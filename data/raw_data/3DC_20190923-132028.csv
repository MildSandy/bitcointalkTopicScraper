Sorry if I am being stupid but can we not mine this coin any more? I can't find pools. I must buy or use a masternode? How muc hresources does using a masternode use? How are people able to do shared nodes?? I can understand when the node it very expensive but they about $40 so if you have 100 people and need 10 nodes how do you run them all? I am thinking of running at least one node.,False

From March 14, 2019 (more than 5 months ago) 3DCoin has activated a ""first industry"" consensus protocol ""full masternodes only"" called ""Proof of Sync"", so from March 14 on 3DC blockchain only and exclusively masternodes can create blocks and then receive rewards.  So the miners are no longer present in 3DCoin blockchain.  No traditional mining (pow), no classic staking (pos) but only masternodes! (Proof of Sync)    More info about ""Proof of Sync"" masternodes only consensus here: https://telegra.ph/3DCoin-Proof-of-Sync---Quick-explanation-and-references-04-16  Therefore, no traditional mining, no classic staking, all the work is done exclusively by the masternodes, which grow visibly, in the last days in particular the growth has been incredible with already about 5800 masternodes enabled, a great result in a very short time, you can see the masternodes statistics to the following links: https://masternodes.online/currencies/3DC/ https://masternodes.pro/stats/3dc/statistics https://coins.masternode.buzz/3DC  As for the hardware resources required to manage a masternode in this phase, a normal VPS with full virtualization (ie ""KVM"" or ""VMWare"" type) with 15 or 20 gigabytes of disk space is sufficient (our blockchain has just over a year of life from genesis block so it occupies about 600 megabytes of space, therefore ...), an adequate vCPU (it is sufficient to choose a good VPS provider to have it and not even ask yourself the problem of the onboard cpu model), at least 1 gigabyte of ram (better 2) and in short, all that a basic VPS model of a good provider offers is sufficient at this stage (with monthly prices starting at not less than 3 euros and arriving just about 5 euros in general).  Alternatively, most of the ""managed masternodes hosting services"" and ""masternodes sharing services"" are becoming interested in 3DCoin, for obvious reasons, given that it is one of the most promising and innovative projects with masternodes. Managed hosting or sharing, some services also offer sharing, but actually as you said you saw the very affordable cost of the collateral is affordable for many to have at least a 3DCoin masternode so if you do not want to manage a VPS by yourself you should go more to a hosting managed than a sharing service (shared masternode), some services that have 3DC listing offer both options, others offer only one, evaluate yourself, based on your needs...    I remind you that as announced several times to maintain the right to keep your masternode active even after block 800k with only 1k 3DC of collateral you need to meet some requirements explained in the last dev update of August, further details at the following link:  https://3dctalk.net/topic/1228/reminder-for-masternodes-operators-reached-block-700k-now-we-are-in-the-range-of-blocks-in-which-to-mature-the-requisites-to-keep-your-masternodes-active-with-the-current-collateral-of-1k-3dc-even-after-block-800k  After the 800k block (scheduled for end of October / beginning of November) the collateral will be 25k 3DC but the collaterals will still be ""temporary"", ie they will only serve as ""antispam"" to activate the nodes, because 3DCoin is a project that aims to show its value not for the coins blocked but for what the team is developing (smart scripts and Virtual Reality, for example) then in 3DCoin the masternodes with the introduction of the innovative concept of ""temporary collateral"" will be remunerated for their work done in favor of the network (as in mining ) and not for the blocked collateral. 3DCoin wants to be a living and circulating currency so it does not aim to have the coins blocked in the stakes but aims to have many nodes that work for the network and that are rewarded for their work not for their coins locked. After all, our great 3DCommunity is demonstrating its great passion for the project as the holders are holding most of 3DCoins without even implementing nodes (remember that most of the supply is circulating, most of it sold in ICO and simply held by the holders, masternodes are a more niche phenomenon for tech enthusiasts, our community is much bigger than the only masternodes operators) and of course without selling!

A first industry consensus protocol based exclusively on masternodes has been activated. So from March 14th only the masternodes are creating the blocks. There is no pow / mining and there is no pos / staking as we understand them traditionally but a system based exclusively on masternodes which has been called ""Proof of Sync"" and which is well illustrated both in the whitepaper and in the Wiki (Wiki available from the ""resources/documentation"" section on https://3dcoin.io site).  A number of factors have definitely contributed to the good performance in the market these days:  The release of the July core update on Github and the release on Medium showing a preview of mobile wallet and desktop lightwallet, both built from the scratch;  The new 3DCoin listing on Crex24 is very welcome to the community and for which we are only receiving positive feedback;  The announcement made by Cryptobridge on its official Discord of the upcoming listing of 3DC;  The listing on masternodes.online that you mentioned too;  The banner ad we found yesterday on masternodes.online also;  The entry directly on the podium in masternode.buzz best performance masternodes (I think it is due to the fact that masternode.buzz draws the data from masternodes.online so for this reason we can now also be present in those statistics)  https://stats.masternode.buzz/  (yesterday the entry in second position, today in first position)  The increase in activity on social media and communication platforms, in particular Twitter, Reddit, Instagram;  Cause but also the consequence of this was the growth of the community on Telegram international official group and the birth of further national groups on Telegram;  Furthermore, the imminent activation of a Discord server was announced, to which the team is working to complete the finishing touches and provide the safest possible information and communication experience;  The project starts to get underway and maybe someone starts to understand that it is one of the rare projects that tries to achieve something concrete on blockchain, not to mention the fact that it is one of the few projects that has been building undercurrent for years a platform that will run on masternodes (I refer to virtual reality and related dapps) and not merely aimed at masternodes ""tout court"".  Even more so with the new consensus protocol based exclusively on masternodes, without pow/mining and without pos/staking, the project clearly showed that their masternodes are structural to their own ecosystem and not an end in themselves.  So many concomitant factors and probably the perspicacity of the many who have realized that a correct due diligence applied to the project cannot make it discard but appreciate it and give birth to the desire to understand it and be part of it. Because regardless of price issues, it is a great technological project that is worth following in its technical growth.  Although there is no longer the possibility of mining, many miners have decided to stay to follow the project and be part of our 3DCommunity and I hope to include you among them...",False

Yes as it was correctly answered before me with 1k 3DC you can do 1 masternode and with 50k 3DC you can do 50 masternodes but you can't make a 50k 3DC single masternode. Each node: 1k coins (for now, read below).  It is important to remember that as the team have already written several times in the past months, even in the latest July's Medium update, the collateral will be increased to 25k from the 800k block (if I'm not wrong in about 100 days, but it is only an average not an exact calculation, so don't trust this but follow the blocks progress on the https://3dcstats.net/ block explorer... now we are in this moment at block 663308, at this time the average is 1377 blocks per day, the average is variable but this is more or less every day).  But the masternodes activated with 1k coin will retain the acquired right in recognition of their contribution to supporting the network.

You are a Hero Member so I can't give you discounts for your statements, I'm sorry.  Do you know that this project was the first to introduce a new consensus mechanism based exclusively on masternodes and this new system has been working since March 14, 2019? Do you know that this thing wasn't even foreseen but was done anyway because it was needed for our infrastructure aimed to the Virtual Reality? Do you know that this has allowed us to eliminate mining altogether?  Did you know that the team opened a Trello public bulletin board recently?  What do you know about this project exactly?  The statements regarding the community are even worse, because they are not very respectful of hundreds of users who have been following the project for years now. We have at least two large daily active Telegram groups, one international and one Italian, and there is also the Russian Telegram group which, although not as numerous as the Italian one, still has a core of users who have been following the project for a long time and remain very active and yet I'm concerned what matters is the quality and not the quantity of users.  I leave you some links so maybe you realize you've talked without knowing what you were talking about. Do not damage the project and those who follow it with these statements, do harm to those who do not know the project and risk losing one of the best projects in terms of technological development and community commitment. And this is not fair to those who do not know the project and could be deceived into thinking that a Hero Member must necessarily know what it is about.  From a Hero Member, we expect sincerely more informed statements, I am truly shocked by the fact that a Hero Member comes to speak in such a poorly informed way about a project that he does not know.

The team has been working for years on track, because the team guys are developing an entire decentralized virtual ecosystem on its own dedicated blockchain that will raise the level of VR technology applied to the blockchain (and viceversa, the blockchain applied to VR) by several notches. For this reason we have basically never considered other VR projects of the crypto space as competitors, because an entire virtual ecosystem with its own blockchain like our 3DCoin Project Districts cannot consider as a competitor a simple dapp with a token that runs on a third-party blockchain.

Our team guys thought that for the virtual world they are creating, more speed and more security is needed, so they raised the bar of masternodes importance by dropping the pow and letting only the masternodes create the blocks. For three months then in our network we have a unique and first industry consensus protocol and we are the first project that took the ""classic"" masternodes (those in Dash style for instance) and put them to create blocks alone without mininig, without staking and without higher hardware requirements. And over 5000 masternodes activated in a year were the 3DCommunity's answer to support the project! And I'm sure that this number of nodes is destined to grow, as the crypto space will discover all the power and innovative and futuristic scope of 3DCoin Project Districts! Come on guys, the support of a patient and motivated community has never failed so go ahead like this, development first of all and give us and the world the first blockchain entirely dedicated to virtual reality that will spectacularly demonstrate what can be achieved combining such revolutionary technologies as immersive experiences of VR / AR / MR / XR and the blockchain!

I want to clarify that I am only a volunteer community manager and an enthusiast of the 3DCoin Project Districts and I don't have any kind of first-hand information different from those publicly released by the team through official updates.  I can assure you that any news I always have the pleasure of posting it here too because I'm going to look for 3DCoiners in every place  As for the team, the official contact channels are the official https://3dctalk.net/ forum where updates are posted, in particular in this specific section of the 3DCTalk forum:  https://3dctalk.net/category/3/blogs   Moreover, a Trello public notice board has been recently activated, which together with Github obviously allows for a set of information on the development trend...  explanation of Trello board: https://3dctalk.net/topic/1208/trello-a-public-board-to-keep-an-eye-on-3dcoin-teamwork  direct Trello board link: https://trello.com/b/6131axEu/3dcoin  In this regard, as visible in the Trello board an important update is being implemented that has not yet been released (0.14.5), which is essential to be able to proceed with listing on the next exchange (Crex24).  As rightly said Examplens  the Coinmarketcap listing policies require the presence of the coin on at least two exchanges, so the team only can make the request for Coinmarketcap after listing on the second exchange.  Consider that however we are on Coingecko, which although less famous than Coinmarketcap is very very useful indeed I would say fundamental for any coin, because Coingecko provides free APIs widely used by other services (for example Masternodes.pro acquires pricing data from Coingecko's API)  https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/3dcoin   Finally, in order to have direct and immediate contact with the official team, in addition to the 3DCTalk.net forum, I also recommend the official Telegram group that you can find at the following drect link:  https://t.me/Project_Districts  Moreover I would like to point out that we have already passed a full 2 months full of activity of the new protocol (""proof of sync"") from March 14 to today all blocks have been created solely by masternodes and the network is working very well (after all there are over 4400 masternodes active today), this is an innovative protocol and therefore this requires particular commitment of the team on development and particular patience and also long waiting on the part of the community, this coin follows its own path of development and in short is a beautiful long adventure.  Thank you again for the stimulus, also because as you see I love talking about this project and I can tell you that this will help me to be more present in this forum but at the same time I hope to have you with us also in the 3DCTalk forum and in the Telegram group if you have the opportunity to participate. Every 3DCoiner is welcome (and also all friends curious about the project of course).  For any need or information do not hesitate to contact the project team and the 3DCommunity in the way you prefer!",False

In fact, the Medium article is rightly focused on the advantage in terms of costs and development because the platform will be accessible to various subjects (companies and design studios for example) without specific development skills and without exaggerated costs as the Medium article explains well.  But today the question that everyone asks themselves in any project is ""what is the blockchain for in this area""?  This is the answer I gave to the user who asked about in our Telegram group and I think it can be useful to bring it back here in the topic:  A construction company, a real estate company, an architecture and design firm can let customers visit the buildings in a VR virtual environment, even before the buildings are built or completed or renovated (and this is nothing new but something is already done in various parts of the world with other VR software) or overlap in AR some changes or variations to the design of a build (external or internal) still to be realized (also this is something already done with various VR software I think), but here is the novelty of the use of VR/AR/MR in general on blockchain: everything you do, stipulate, everything you buy / sell in a VR /AR /MR dapp of Districts World can record it in blockchain and therefore it becomes valid and immutable (but transferable of course) with the classic guarantees and advantages that we know typical of smartcontracts and digital recordings on blockchain. Then there are also purely advantages related to greater possibilities without specific skills and reduced implementation costs of virtual environments based on the type of software client the team is building (Districts Visual Studio or DVS) but this is an advantage linked to the software features of for itself and not so much to the fact that it is on blockchain. (This last part is also well explained in the Medium article linked above)  Then as already mentioned, it allows to record in real time a series of contractual and binding data in a certain way, in some regulations (also in Italy for example, see article linked below) legal value has already been recognized for smart contracts and DLTs. So a virtual reality environment (cheap, simple to use, etc. etc.) but which in addition has features related to the possibilities in terms of data recording, properties and their transfer guaranteed by the blockchain and without the so-called ""third party"" intermediary.  The following article is from one of the largest Italian online newspapers in the crypto sector, not just Italian in reality because it has an edition also in English, and it speaks precisely of the legal value that in Italy (I do not think it is the only one) is already recognized to the data recorded in DLT distributed registers (such as the blockchain in fact).  https://cryptonomist.ch/en/2019/02/07/simplifications-decree-blockchain-smart-contract/   The advantage of using blockchains for data recording is now known: Everything is digitalized, the third intermediary is eliminated (notary or other), some margins of random interpretation are eliminated. it gives certainty and non-modifiability (fraudulent) to the data. All these things are already recognized advantages in the sector and not a peculiarity of our project. Simply the project combines a good, cheap and simple for all VR platform with already established advantages of the blockchain that we should all know already.  In other words: We add virtual reality, or rather we bring the same advantages of the blockchain that will already be used and are already regulated in some jurisdictions for use in the real world also to virtual world. So there will be the possibility (not the  obligation obvious) to record things that need to be recorded on the blockchain even when doing actions in the virtual world.  In short, a virtual world in addition to the possibilities already offered by the blockchain in the real world. Easy and simple!  And of course this will ensure that the actions taken in the virtual world will also have legal effect in the real world when it is deemed appropriate by the parties.",False

Do you know that you'll have to deal with a tough bone like me  and you're not doing your job right?   We come to your ""arguments"", I start from your conclusion because it is a clear clue ...  ""As usual in crypto, better to stay away from such projects, which promises but no sign of delivery anywhere"" ... well... you say you stay away from this type of project but you are always here to check out, eh eh ... this does not require further comments, it gnaws at you eh not be arrived at the beginning when you could accumulate more easily ... now without mining and in a phase in which we are not yet in exchanges with good volumes it is more difficult for those who got on the train later than when they wanted ...  Summary of your malicious disinformation:  1) Exchange: p2pb2b.io or any other is completely irrelevant, most project holders who hold most of the coins won't sell for years because they simply don't need it. This is not a project for those with urgent needs of sell. It has already been explained several times in the official channels that an innovative protocol like ours that provides for the creation of blocks exclusively on masternodes (you don't say that... true?) needs some security updates that allow you to go without any hitch in other exchanges. I am explaining this to others because you are too in bad faith and your comprehension skills are too irrelevant to follow my text walls...   2) Trading price: 3 sats to 300 sats, see above, completely irrelevant, especially irrelevant in that exchange and with those insignificant volumes. First the updates necessary for this new experimental protocol, unique in the world, introduced quietly and without fuss by those who are used to working hard even for those like you;  3) 1 Implementation of MN update: this does not actually require comments ... just look at the list of commits in Github and the continuous updates that have occurred mainly between the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 ... your ignorance is reaching levels that I didn't think ... or maybe bad faith? I would say both. Which of the many updates do you talk about? Of the one that for months manages to automatically update about 4k masternodes without user intervention or the new ""proof of sync"" consensus protocol that for over a month now has been creating blocks exclusively for masternodes, so traditional mining POW has been eliminated). Eh eh ... and here we come to one of the things that gnaws at you ... you haven't been able to mining... You arrived late and you missed the fantastic ""cpu solo mining"" that allowed those who were in the right place at the right time (especially the ICO participants who knew the project then) to significantly increase their positions, even mining with notebooks!  Yes for those who do not know this is one of the rare projects that has allowed in recent years a traditional cpu solo mining for practically ""free"" months with normal home PCs, many masternodes have been made precisely with such mined coins for free, then home mining work and construction of masternodes and the network, a beautiful collective experience that had not been seen for years. Then we moved on to mining pools with rigs and nvidia graphics cards with a modified protocol to guarantee safety despite the difficulty being low. There is a team of skilled blockchain artisans in this project who when it has a problem solves it, invents new protocols, customizes existing protocols. It is good to know for the respect of the level of this forum. This forum which you instead abuse to exploit your personal frustrations and envy. This forum whose moderators have already had to intervene in the past to cancel some of your shameful and insulting posts. Especially your posts insult the intelligence of other users. So the problem is not that you attack the team or the project or our community, the problem is that with your disinformation you try to induce in other users a staggered view of reality, the one that comes from your malevolence and your envy.  4) Promises and broken dreams: the team promises nothing to anyone, simply the team has often shared among friends in the community the hopes of what it was trying to achieve, sometimes the stages were kept on schedule, some things were not not even foreseen (such as the creation ex novo of a consensus protocol based exclusively on masternodes) but they have been realized anyway because they serve for the purposes of the great ecosystem that the team is building with 3DCoin and with Project Districts. The broken dreams are only yours because your envy, that would like not to see all the things that the project is building, your envy will not be fulfilled. It is no coincidence that you come up with this fake account every time new information is released and then you understand that you wanted to participate in solo mining and wanted to have several masternodes, so your ignorance makes you think you came too late. That's how it is in your case because the only way you have to accumulate coins is that they are given to you as gifts. For all the others there will be better exchanges in which I am sure that they will be able to buy at very low prices at least in the initial stages of the listing as the project is deliberately keeping a low profile because it is not a project by senseless hype or by lambo boys. It is a long-term and far-reaching project. A technological and innovative project that brings an entire world of virtual reality to 3 blockchains in one and with its own unique consensus protocol. Stuff too complicated for you, but basically your mind senses the potential and this is your anger.  5) 4k MN´s, but with 1000 coins for MN its not really an achievement: and even on this you have a vision staggered in bad faith by your envy. 4000 masternodes built with fatigue day by day by a large community that mined with PCs first, then with rigs, which bought what they could in OTC. Some community members even gave each other coins for free to help each other to build masternodes together. It will seem strange to you since we are used to projects in which the teams sell whole masternodes at a high price. Do you prefer that? Here there is no team that intends to scam so there is no need to sell whole masternodes at a high price and then drop everything. There is a community that has decided to shoulder the monthly cost of over 4000 VPS knowing that such a long-term and experimental project requires great sacrifices if you want to have the honor of being early adopters. Or maybe you think that over 4000 VPS are free, so you are insulting the sacrifice and the commitment of the community by saying that 4k masternodes are not an achievement. The community whole international takes note of your offensive attitude.  To conclude my wall of text (I know it's what you want so I will never let you down)... I repeat that you tell others to stay away from such a project but you just can't stay away even if you don't want to be away discovered earlier when you could have accumulated more easily, so your fud is aimed at keeping the price low in a future exchange with higher volumes so that your poor pockets can stock up. I wish you success so you can finally satisfy your desire and you can feel like us, historical holders.  Come on, try to get all the masternodes you want at a low price, so finally your envy will cease and you will be able to live peacefully.  Peace and love! ",False

This project is constantly evolving and the team is constantly updating! Great!    https://twitter.com/3DCoin_io/status/1105418751263105025  https://www.reddit.com/r/3dcoin/comments/b068ev/3dcoin_v_01441_fork_imminent/   Official support in our Telegram Official Group: https://t.me/Project_Districts   Additional info for masternodes owners/managers:  All the masternodes that already have on board (in the VPS) the mandatory autoupdate script released at the beginning of February (3 February) will self-update within 24 hours in random time without the need for user intervention (on the VPS side of course) except for rare cases (a percentage of error, of autoudpdate failed, of VPS that are blocked is physiological, generally the success is almost equal to 100% for previous recent updates). Instead the user intervention is required in the computer control wallet, so as soon as the new wallet is released (not yet available) ie the v0.14.4.1 version it will be necessary to start again masternodes from control wallet as the protocol passes from 70216 to 70217. It is always normal when a protocol change occurs, normal administration.  So to simplify:  - On the VPS side, no intervention was required to those who made the mandatory update released on February 3 (autoupdate script) because in 24 hours the VPS will be automatically updated by the script  - On the computer side it will be necessary to give a new start as soon as the new QT wallet is available.  Before giving a new start it is important to make sure that the VPS has updated itself to new version and to new protocol verifying the version following the guide already published in our forum in the past days:  https://3dctalk.net/topic/1196/masternodes-guide-2-in-1-how-to-verify-installed-version-and-if-autoupdate-is-active",False

I totally agree and that's what the team did right after the ICO, which greatly reduced the total supply initially planned.

So it was a normal ICO  and open to everyone and not an ""initial sale of masternodes""  (not a notorious ""IMO"" on Discord  ) and the team has never sold whole masternodes! Although the masternodes were already present in the whitepaper from the beginning they were not ""advertised"" because the team has always been interested in presenting its final product (the virtual reality of the Districts Visual Studio). I also point out that the team's coins have been locked for 5 years! So unlike many projects especially of many ""masternode coins projects"", here the team will not dump their coins.

Right now I see about 3200 active masternodes in the wallet so basically we are back to our remarkable pre-update numbers and every day we continue to grow, such a result is truly remarkable and demonstrates the great participation and attention of the masternodes managers who follow step by step the work of the Team and the evolution of the Project, rolling up the sleeves when you have to get your hands ""under the hood"" of VPS without losing heart as it requires a true Master of Nodes !!!   Also I want to thank the Team for the great attention that shows the user feedback by releasing continuously and very quickly updates and patches, like the last released yesterday.

We initially only went on masternodes.pro because on this service (see link below) you can go even if you are not in exchange and if you are no longer in ICO (as in our case, ICO terminated and no exchange previously, but today we are on p2pb2b.io though!). In order to go to masternodes.online, however, we need an exchange whose ""api"" are approved by masternodes.online so I think that the 3DCoin team is moving in this direction, also a second exchange in the short term is also necessary to request the listing on coinmarketcap. Regarding the economic question, it is not necessary to have the community intervene because the project was funded between November 2017 and January 2018 with an ICO (not ""IMO"" of masternodes, but a regular ICO, as visible on icobench, icorating, trackico and other similar sites) that has collected about 10 million dollars, it is a very technologically advanced project and therefore the fundraising was necessary to develop the project. Obviously it is also used for marketing and listing where necessary. Consider that on the day of the exchange we became ""Premium Buzz Backers"" on Masternode.buzz (which is also linked by partnerships with masternodes.online in fact). So going to masternodes.online is not an economic problem for the project but only a technical question that will be overcome as soon as we are on an exchange with api supported by masternodes.online. The team is working at full capacity on everything. Yesterday we were present in the DailyBuzz edition, now we will be constantly present in the reference head for sector news around the world, thanks to the team's choice to start this fruitful collaboration with Masternode.buzz !

I know perfectly how the rewards mechanism works, more masternodes... same cake (reward/block) ...fewer slices of cake for everyone. I am manager of the largest Italian technical Telegram group about masternodes (generic dedicated to masternodes) as well as 3DCoin Community manager so I have enough concepts clear...  But I'm interested in the Project and the technology and innovations it will bring (VR on blockchain and an innovative system of consensus management via the masternodes, because masternodes will replace the miners in v0.14... to name two innovations) so I'm not worried about the decline in rewards. I'm very happy with this growth because I know what's behind this growth as I manage both the international Project's Community and the Italian community on a daily basis, namely:  1) There is a great deal of trust on the part of those from the ICO or even before and then from last year to now has followed Project Districts 3DCoin and is continuing to implement nodes and pay VPS (the VPS have a monthly cost as low... but a cost is a cost...) and just the fact that there is no exchange is even more a great test of trust of our wonderful Community and this makes me very proud as I attend the Community every day  2) Even if with difficulty because the OTC market is obviously a small / reduced / limited market we are still struggling day by day with great tenacity bringing new users into the Community thanks to small sales by some miners or even some masternode owners who sells some collateral obtained as a reward and then I can assure you that it is not only the old users who continue to create new masternodes but there are also new ones (especially those who follow the Italian community on Telegram knows very well that for months we make known Project Districts and 3DC also in other Telegram groups and that we managed to grow the Community in our small, considers that the Italian group has about 180 users with a daily average growth of one user per day in recent times and it is not a little to be a national group of a project not yet in exchange and little known, also because generally every new user is assisted in all ways by the users for the implementation of every single masternode if necessary ... great Community spirit without thinking about the rewards that are lowered ...)  So these are the reasons for my great satisfaction as I have followed the growth of the network of masternodes from the beginning and often when a new masternode is activated it is always a great joy and I can also imagine who is the new user who activated it. Obviously I'm happy both when an old user with whom we have shared this adventure for months declares to have activated for examples 10 nodes in one fell swoop with the 3dcoins from mn rewards and when a new user declares he has managed to start the first node with the 3dcoins bought in OTC market. In both cases I am happy even though I know perfectly well that the decline in rewards is a mathematical question... ",False

You can see the rewards statistics at the link to the ""masternodes pro"" you find at the end of my message. Right now while I write there are 2553 masternodes in enabled status (3178 mn already activated) this remarkable number is due to the fact that there is a very active Community that believes in Project Districts 3DCoin and in the Team and then after participating in the ICO and many even at ""cpu solo mining ""lasted a few months after the ICO for the benefit of everyone (even with notebooks was mined) with these 3dcoins (bought in ICO or mined) have been started several masternodes, with the rewards of mining and masternodes the Community has continued to implement masternodes, then the mining pool started with gpu and some miners started to seriously mining and sell in OTC market (on 3dctalk.net forum or in the Telegram group), thanks to this we were able to grow again as a Community making the Project known and having the 3dcoins bought by those who did not have them for collaterals (thanks to the OTC market many have entered also in these recent weeks). This premise is useful for answering your real question that is ""how do you pay VPS"" and you're right VPS are not free but if you believe in a project you commit with your resources to invest in it and then pay one or more VPS and having the rewards of the coin in a project you believe is exactly this and it is a sacrifice like any commitment of resources...   https://masternodes.pro/stats/3dc/statistics",False

We will reach a maximum of 85 million within a couple of years, when all the coins will be mined, no matter how many miners there are or how powerful their equipment or how many masternodes there are. More masternodes will always have to share the same coins (same reward for each block). Every about 1 minute (more than 1400 times per 24 hours) a block is mined and the miner who found the block assigns 4 coins to himself and 12 coins to a masternode (only one masternode, the one that is in the queue for the turn) . So with over 2200 activated masternodes now and around 1400 blocks to be rewarded per day, not all masternodes take the reward every day (you take the reward and get back in line for the next round). All the masternodes systems work like this (from DASH onwards). In the Districts system the masternodes will become ""prime / pulse nodes"" later as well described in the following article.

I do not know if there were similar cases in the past but it is really impressive to see this growth of the number of masternodes if we also consider that there was a normal ICO like any other currency and not an IMO (""initial masternode offering"")  as it is now a bad (IMHO) habit in the sector (in short, here the team did not sell masternodes, but made a simple ICO in which you could buy also a few coins with a few dollars, they did not sell complete masternodes!). To see the exponential growth of the nodes just look at the chart on the site linked above, obviously be careful to read well the data because the ROI indicated in this site is only in reference to the ""number of coins"" that currently get a masternode as rewards annually to the current average (so you refers to the number of coin ""invested"" in the collateral and the number of coins that are obtained at the current average based on the number of current nodes), it is not a ROI in fiat currency considering that there is no quotation of the 3dcoin currency not yet in exchange.

I just want to share our (small group of early supporters) story with you guys and let you know that not everything is quiet brilliant by this project team as it seems to be. We were early supporters, we find a project that was according to our opinion one of the best (we still think so), but the problem occurred when team members didn't kept their promise. Let me explain, we were helping team in testnet environment with our mining equipment, team promised us that they will pay us out for that. Firstly they promised 100% mined coins in testnet, so we would have to receive same amount of bounty in mainnet. Then after some time of our work they decided to reduce a reward onto 50%, we still agreed. After project switched onto mainnet, we were waiting for our bounty, we were constantly contacting team members and they used to tell us that they are working on that and that it will be soon distributed. Suddenly two days ago they just posted a post that they will not reward any of testnet miners. So they left us without anything  we invested quiet a lot into mining equipment, biggest cost was electricity for which we had to pay upon 400$ per month, but the team doesen't give a sh.. further more after their post they didn't want even to talk with us any more. We were forced to bring our problem into community, but they ban us ant threw us out of that group.  Well that's our story. Our point is to warn you all of scammers, please be careful, we certainly will be more that we were till now.  P.S. I still believe in this project it seems that they will bring something great out, but you should not trust a team members.  Thanks for your time reading this.",False

Usually when a blockchain recruits external staff to do tests, it always gives some reward. And this reward is always insignificant at that moment when the coin is found. I cite Storiqa as an example that will pay me 100 STQ for the test I did in Beta a few days. That's about $ 1.2. I think the best way here would be mediation, because as we all know, a test is a test! Not to leave the testator millionaire. On the other hand, as I understand it, some people were willing to test because of the reward. This has to be observed. So gentlemen, I think that any amount that does not exceed $ 2 at the price of ICO pays very well to anyone who is willing to test. This is my suggestion. It is well for 3DC to propose paying such a value, for example a test. And if you do not want the coins, please send them to me. The difficulty has greatly increased is 3DC is turning gold.",False

But it is not the case of Districts 3DCoin because here there is a project with Dapps and 3D / VR / AR features that goes well beyond the masternodes, which have a function in the network, as in the case of Dash are used to quickly validate ""instant send"" transactions and also serve to perform functions of ""private send"" (or ""mixing"") and obviously being nodes working 24/7 keep the network safe and have a copy onboard of the blockchain. It is not about staking so it is not necessary to keep the coins inside an open wallet with the PC always on (as it happens for NavCoin for example) the masternode is a very different thing and therefore requires a VPS server always operating to work well and receive the reward... but hey buddy out there is full of VPS providers with deals between $ 3 and $ 10 a month and if you're in this business of cryptos should not discourage such an expense. All projects involving masternodes (including DASH) require a VPS server to have a real 24/7 operating masternode but if you have a static IP provided by your provider at home and if you can follow a guide on the web you can also dabble to always keep your computer turned on and set the masternode on it without the need for a VPS, you can also use a raspberry pi  but at the end of the fair are you sure it is better to keep a machine always on with your static IP home always exposed? Maybe it's the same IP you use when you make BTC or EHT transactions... mmm maybe a little risky can not you find? So what is better and cheaper and safer a nice VPS for 3, 5, 10 dollars on which in the future you can also place other masternodes of other coins (I read of people who also puts 4 or 5 mns on a VPS... of different coins is obvious) or is it better a machine at home always on with the wallet unlocked and your IP exposed to anyone?

Preliminary analysis from TokenData reveals that just under 27% of ICOs surpassed their fundraising targets in November. To this regard and also because a significant majority of prospective investors didn’t comprehend the idea behind the Districts project, the team has decided to implement a system-wide overhaul with our latest update. Update Details. Web Portal .Website makeover  We’ve given the website a massive facelift; it now spots a minimalist design with more text and animations that provide a succinct overview of Projects Districts, its applicable use cases and upcoming events from the team. Whitepaper/One pager Makeover: The new whitepaper and one pager are less technical than their predecessors. We substituted the complex wordings with simpler text and included eye-catching infographics for better understanding.  ICO Revamp Steps taken to address Market Volatility. When we kick-started the ICO one bitcoin was valued at $6000, as at the time of posting this announcement its value has surged past $10000. To protect the collective interest of our investors we’ve decided to; I. Compensate all existing investors by adding the difference in the value of invested coins, calculated by subtracting the initial value from their current worth, to their wallets. So, if you purchased 1 BTC worth of 3Dcoins when BTC was trading at $6000 per BTC, given the current price of $10,000, you get $4,000 (10,000 — $6,000).  II. Valuate the amount of investor 3Dcoins based on the real-time value of accepted coins. What this means is that henceforth, 3Dcon will have a floating market value that is hinged on the trading price of BTC, LTC, ETH and DASH coins. Any rise in the value of these coins will be followed by a proportionate increase in the amount invested 3Dcoins. § Also, investment bonuses are no longer tied to the invested sum. Instead, we’ve decided to allocate bonuses based on when the investment was made (November was 40%, December will be 20%, and January is pegged at 10%) § When the ICO ends, and when 3Dcoin becomes listed on global exchanges its worth will be determined by its actual value.  III. Extend the ICO duration to 31st January 2018, to allow investors the opportunity to get acquainted with our recent updates, and also to foster better understanding of the Districts project.
