We already made the first implementation of the DAICO by Vitalik's Buterin concept through the integration of the ERP system, IPFS and Ethereum. https://darfchain.com/news/2018/mar/22/risk-free-darfchain-investing-platform-based-daico  As one of the results of this work will be the creation of an escrow fund. Investors can put the money in it and take them back if the task set by the investor is not executed or accepted for execution by the team of the ICO project. The bulk of the fees will go to the endowment of this fund.     Risk-free ICO investing platform Now we develop a risk-free ICO investing platform. This approach provides investor not only with safe way of investing but direct influence to the ICO-projects development and growth.      The ICO team has issued tokens and started work on the project.     Investor writes (in Odoo for instance) his own  user story or offer with desired business-functions.     Investor remits the sum in our DARF tokens to the escrow smart-contract. DARFs he had to bougth before.     System commits the money, investor does not get the tokens for a while.     Other investors can see the offer, accept it and join to the the escrow.     The project team starts to negotiate the investors offers and assign the story  terms and conditions - the job objective, scoup and criteria of acceptance. The progress of negotiations is fixed in the trusted distributed storage system DARFChain.     In case of team reject the user story or doesn’t accept or consider it during the time limit, investors get their money back.     If investor and team have got a deal and team has accepted user story, then money can not back to the investor but the team will not get them, untill job is accepted by investor’s side.     If team count that the job has been fulfilled, they request the smart-contract close, and investors can get this message at their wallets.     If majority of  investors (according to the sum) is agree that  work is done, then smart-contract remit sum to the team and tokens - to investors. Then team can exchange DARFs to Ether via smart-contract with fixed price. Platform advantages  Investors can directly influence the progress of the project, They risk only small amount of money, The team gets new ideas product development, Investors can monitor project's traction online.

BitcoinX: When and why did you first decide to do an ICO?  DARFCHAIN: We kicked off in an old fashion way, running circles around venture capitalists, business angels and small private equity investors. And it was when our committed potential investors broke the deal during the 15th round of negotiations, complaining that he doesn’t feel like understanding some minor details and can’t start the project. That’s when I learned the first rule of new era start-upper: never waste your time finding an investor, write your white paper instead. Thus, Our ICO is a predefined one.  BitcoinX: Tell us about what preparation was required to get the project to this point?  DARFCHAIN: Here are some general rules for an ICO startup, aside from the one I already mentioned: Rule #2. Have a detailed and clear vision of the project – this is no different from a usual business plan.  Rule #3. Write white paper in a clear manner, making it understandable for everybody. Rule #4. Publish white paper on Bitcointalk.org and open your helmet, cause the hater trolls will be biting you. Rule #5. Be prepared for everything, from tons of hate and criticizing to discovering an extra of 10 BTC in the morning in your crypto wallet – haters are way more probable and outnumber donors, obviously, so stick to believing in yourself and don’t lose faith in your project. Rule #6. Be ready to repeat this step N cycles, where N can be rather big. Rule #7. Create a landing page Rule #8. Start bounty programme and love your bountiers at all time, they are your first investors. Rule #9. Start pre-sale of tokens and advertise it everywhere. Rule #10. As early as possible start developing your product and demonstrate it to online community. We started the project in May 2017 and have been fully on track of its development ever since.

A good example would be the Peter Thiel-backed, SeaSteading Institute - if they would ever go to an ICO model. The project has solid, world recognized names backing it up. However, the idea of the project that is creating whole new countries in free areas of the ocean - is clearly very difficult to achieve, albeit not entirely impossible.
