ETH market price and Ethereum network itself are different cases. The price on the market doesn't show any of the project development during a bear trend. If you look just on the price of any asset you will be surprised, everything loosing value and ETH loosing as well. It doesn't mean Ethereum network will go away for any reason, no, it will stay here. Ethereum is the most reliable and secure smart contracts network currently, beside those marketing projects who claiming high TPS on testnet, etc. Let them show up with secure and working product and then we talk about scalability issue of Ethereum.",False
