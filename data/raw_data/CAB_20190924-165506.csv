Team: to bring BitCab vision to life, we have assembled a unique international team with a wealth of experience in ridesharing, tech startups, blockchain, software engineering, venture capital, finance and general business. Our team includes alumni of Uber, McKinsey, Yandex, Avito and multiple other fast growth tech startups, VC funds and consulting firms - such as Arkady, former country general manager at Uber; Vasyl, blockchain and AI R&D engineer, former CTO at blockchain startup IRAEngine and computer science PhD candidate; Andrey, former McKinsey consultant and tech executive.   2. Syscoin partnership: our partner Syscoin provides a uniquely fast, scalable platform, which unlike ETH can accommodate the needs of ridesharing. Jag and Brad, Syscoin co-founders, are our Advisors, and will help promote us in Syscoin community to make Syscoin community (~69k Twitter followers) the early adopters of BitCab ecosystem. Syscoin block awards can also provide an additional source of funding.  3. Ambitious, comprehensive vision: we envision a fully decentralized, uncensorable network which will use blockchain to solve the key problems plaguing ridesharing today: lack of driver and rider loyalty (in-built blockchain loyalty incentives and gamification), expensive growth (self-funding growth mechanism of champions being rewarded for the activity of their referrals on the network with block awards), exploitation of drivers (cutting out the exploitative corporate middleman and enabling drivers and riders set their own terms enshrined in immutable smart contracts letting the market set rates), regulatory intrusion (network fully decentralized, uncensorable and not operated by any legal or physical person - securing free market for mobility for all). We see our role as BitCab Foundation in developing the ecosystem, not owning it: once the network is built and is functioning on its own, we want the community to fully govern and own it.  4. Pragmatic execution: we know what it takes to build startups and fully appreciate that this vision will take years to be fully realized. Therefore we are already working on our MVP in a lean startup, agile iterative approach. We will build it from the ground up, test every feature on the app and move it to blockchain one by one after it has been properly tested in the real world, moving to fully functional network with fully decentralized on-chain governance one step at a time.",False

Syscoin (SYS) needs no introduction among crypto enthusiasts. Called ‚Äúthe most undervalued project in crypto world‚Äù and ‚Äúthe hidden gem of 2018‚Äù, Syscoin is a ‚Äúrevolutionary cryptocurrency that offers near zero cost financial transactions like Bitcoin and provides businesses the infrastructure to trade goods, assets, digital certificates and data securely‚Äù and was released under MIT license in 2014. Syscoin offers a wealth of functionality that BitCab needs including hardened smart contracts built into the core such as On-chain Offers, Certificates, Escrow, Aliases (identities or usernames), Encrypted messages etc. The new core coming out tentatively end of March will support Tokens, Assets, ICOs, has a built in database for powerful searching and offline data, Instant send (SYS) and Zero confirmation instant transactions (Z-DAG) for assets. Tokens can be sent and received in real-time. Syscoin will give BitCab faster, cheaper, more scalable transactions than any other blockchain platform. You can read more about Syscoin here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syscoin https://syscoin.org  The partnership will go far beyond just building BitCab app on Syscoin blockchain: - We are very excited to have Jagdeep Sidhu, Syscoin Core Developer, and Brad Hammerstr√∂n, Syscoin CMO, joining BitCab as Advisors. They will share their insights and provide support on both development and marketing - The partnership will enable BitCab to tap into amazing Syscoin community of tens of thousands of crypto enthusiasts. In addition to access to Syscoin social media channels, we plan to give back to the community by airdropping 4.5% of tokens sold in the ICO to existing SYS holders. This will align incentives and bring the early adopters into the ecosystem: any network only becomes valuable once critical mass of early adopters starts using it, such as collectors for EBay, LIONs for Linkedin and Harvard students for Facebook. Our critical mass can come from crypto enthusiasts holding SYS. To incentivize these early adopters to use BitCab app, we will offer to refund initially airdropped tokens to anyone who uses them on BitCab ecosystem (i.e., actually buys ride(s) on the platform - as opposed to just selling or holding the tokens) in the first 60 days after BitCab app is launched. - With Syscoin reach and Brad‚Äôs marketing expertise, we will be able to get the word about BitCab to many more potential users, bringing the decentralized future of mobility to reality faster.  This is an exciting step forward for both projects - giving BitCab unparalleled blockchain functionality and increasing our reach while adding a new high potential ICO and a new use case to Syscoin platform.

All transactions on BitCab blockchain will ultimately be settled in CAB (although for fast adoption Riders and Drivers will be able to choose to pay and be paid in fiat currencies on the front end - but with transactions still settled in CAB at market rates on the back end).

Essentially, all CAB tokens, existing and future, are hence by definition backed by the present value of all future transactions (mostly car rides) on BitCab ecosystem. Like any other currency, CAB can be used to buy and sell goods and services even beyond the BitCab ecosystem. In case of BitCab success, there will be good reasons for wider application of CAB, such as millions (and billions) of users of the currency and it being backed by real value of mobility services it can be redeemed for unlike vast majority of both crypto and fiat currencies. The present value of all future mobility services on BitCab ecosystem therefore represents not the ceiling, but the floor for the value of CAB.

Firstly, BitCab can never be held liable for any actions of any ecosystem participants: Quote The Platform ecosystem includes a wide range of participants executing different roles. Given current regulatory uncertainty, BitCab shall not be held liable for execution by the participants of any roles in the Platform ecosystem. The participants shall take full responsibility for the compliance with statutory requirements applicable to them, and shall hold BitCab harmless against any losses, damages or costs any participant suffers or incurs arising out of, relating to, or in connection with possible breach by such participant of applicable laws or requirements while executing any role on the Platform.  For any legal disputes the potential plaintiff will have to go through Kitts and Nevis courts: Quote BitCab Foundation is an independent entity registered in Saint Kitts and Nevis which will administer the funds with the sole purpose of developing and growing a successful, robust BitCab ecosystem. Saint Kitts and Nevis jurisdiction provides a robust legal framework modelled on Delaware corporate statutes as well as excellent tax and regulatory efficiency and stability as a democratic state and a Commonwealth realm with Queen Elizabeth II as head of state.",False

Let me quote from our white paper:  Quote Arbiters specify languages they speak and are matched randomly with requests to review in that language. 3 Arbiters review each application and the request is approved only if all 3 agree it should be approved (if no consensus, request is escalated to a new randomly selected trio of Arbiters). If a particular Arbiter is consistently missing the consensus vote, they will be banned from being an Arbiter to prevent bad actors (e.g., those trying to game the system by approving or denying all requests without reading them)  You can find further details on different roles on pages 16-19 in our white paper: https://bitcab.io/BitCab_WhitePaper.pdf",False

What sets BitCab apart from these projects is what is being built and by who: What: other ridesharing-on-blockchain projects we have seen seem to tokenize for the sake of having tokens, blockchain for the sake of blockchain. We, on the other hand, are applying blockchain to solve specific big hairy problems at the epicenter of ridesharing universe that tokenization and blockchain are uniquely positioned to solve: such as driver and rider loyalty, set rules and giving control to individual ecosystem participants, not corporate middlemen. You can find more details in our one-pager and even more in our white paper. Even the quality of deliverables so far (our video, white paper, white pager etc.) are miles apart - I encourage you to google these other experiments and compare for yourself.

You are absolutely correct. First, BitCab will support payments in both fiat (local currency), ETH and CAB. This will enable faster adoption - as you have correctly pointed out, this will increase our target market in terms of both riders and drivers as not everyone is prepared to transact in crypto from the start.  The expectation is that most users will initially use fiat while a small group of crypto enthusiasts might use CAB and ETH from the start. The intent is then to migrate fiat and ETH users to using CAB. This will be achieved in four ways: 1. All ecosystem participants, in addition to direct payment between the rider and the driver, will receive long term vested incentives - LT (Loyalty Tokens) - for useful actions on the ecosystem (e.g., receiving 5 star feedback for a ride or providing community support). These LT tokens will vest over time and convert to CAB - hence people will receive CAB tokens to spend. Because they receive these tokens for valuable activities, it will be easier for the users to see its value, while vested nature will increase price stability. 2. Over time transaction costs in fiat and ETH will be increased to incentivize users on all sides of the transaction to shift to CAB. 3. Shift to CAB will be seamless: the app interface will be seamless and similar to any other ride sharing app (with more gamification to make it feel more like a new smartphone game than just a ride sharing app) with all the blockchain magic happening on the back end. A CAB wallet will be generated automatically and will be fully integrated with the app - resulting in use being easy with no particular technical / blockchain skills required. 4. Hype around cryptocurrencies will help drive adoption - drivers might initially be willing to do just some of their rides for CAB to get some some tokens without buying them for cash, and then increase their share of rides for CAB as they see low transaction costs, convenience and growth in the ecosystem.",False

The current plan, as you have correctly guessed, is to use Ethereum blockchain. We have also been in discussion with Waves over the last couple months and might consider using their blockchain (it has significant advantage such as transaction throughput and speed) depending on when and how smart contract functionality is implemented on Waves.  Fiat will be available in select countries. Riders will be able to select in which currency to pay (CAB / ETH / fiat), and riders - in which currency to get paid. Then the transaction will settle in market prices on the back end if exchange is required.  We estimate about 6 months would be required to develop a fully functional platform. ICO will allow us to extend our developer team with more designers and coders and embark on this mission.",False

Let me quote from our WP (https://bitcab.io/BitCab_WhitePaper.pdf page 12): Quote All transactions on BitCab blockchain will ultimately be settled in CAB (although for fast adoption Riders and Drivers will be able to choose to pay and be paid in fiat currencies on the front end - but with transactions still settled in CAB at market rates on the back end). This will create real demand for CAB token tied to volume of transactions in the ecosystem. Essentially, all CAB tokens, existing and future, are hence by definition backed by the present value of all future transactions (mostly car rides) on BitCab ecosystem.  Like any other currency, CAB can be used to buy and sell goods and services even beyond the BitCab ecosystem. In case of BitCab success, there will be good reasons for wider application of CAB, such as millions (and billions) of users of the currency and it being backed by real value of mobility services it can be redeemed for. The present value of all future mobility services on BitCab ecosystem therefore represents not the ceiling, but the floor for the value of CAB. There is unlimited upside in CAB being adopted for wider uses - similarly to BTC, ETH and USD. One advantage of CAB over BTC and ETH as a store of value is that unlike cryptocurrencies mined by solving computational puzzles CAB is immune to the threat of quantum computers as it is issued proportionally to real world activity, not just virtual computations.",False

We have deliberately kept the dates open for now as we are looking to build a whitelist and conduct pre-ICO before starting the actual ICO. As a rough guideline, we intend to finish the pre-ICO by end of March and conduct the ICO in April-May.   As far as i understand there is no hard cap right? This is correct. Our competitors are the likes of Uber and Didi Chuxing with billions of dollars of cash on hand, therefore the higher the raise, the faster we will be able to scale and outcompete them. We are confident that the superior token-driven network effects and the superior blockchain-based ecosystem will give us an unbeatable advantage against the current ride-sharing operating model therefore the amount of funding will define how fast, not ""whether"", we will be able to scale.   Do you have a prototype of the product already or it‚Äôll only start to be developed after MVP is not hard to build given many ride-sharing apps exist including white label offerings. Hence there is little point in building a prototype. The more laborious part is building the full functionality on-chain, and that will happen after the ICO.   Is there an active twitter and telegram already? We have been preparing in stealth mode for several months and are entering public space today.

It is also important not to underestimate the importance crypto community growing exponentially around the world. Admittedly, more of them are users of ride-sharing than drivers, but when there are millions of people in both circles (crypto enthusiasts and drivers), the Venn diagram is bound to intersect. Even a few thousands of millions at the intersection would be enough to launch the platform to stratospheric growth - just look at how small groups of users far from mainstream have launched some of the most successful online platforms: Ebay - initial users were collectors of rare items; now it is a multi-billion dollar per year platform selling everything from electronics to cars Linkedin - initial users were LION (Linked In Open Network) fanatics who just wanted to connect with tens of thousands of people - now they are irrelevant for the platform, but they created the momentum which made Linkedin one of the most successful social networks in the world Facebook - from a few thousand Harvard students to 2 billion MAU across the world There are countless other examples such as Craigslist, Reddit. And this is how major cryptos such as BTC and ETH started as well - from a few coders mining with their old laptops to hundreds of billions in market cap.  Does it make sense?
