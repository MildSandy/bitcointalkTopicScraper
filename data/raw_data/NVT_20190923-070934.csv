I know exactly what i am talking about and most people here don't. I have 0 interest in these pointless tokens (of any form).  You on the other hand promote this crap in your signature. You became a living billboard, you have been bought, wasting your time convincing others for pennies. (as is typical on this website) congrats. And don't act like i am the only one.  Quote from: tk808 on January 02, 2018, 03:43:02 AM This is a pretty greedy ICO, have you guys read the whitepaper? Like some real fucking greed.  If you look at steam and any Indy game, they can develop this shit for 500k USD through a go-fund-me. But instead, we have these greedy cunts asking nearly 80-100million dollars in investment for some pictures and data on a blockchain. Let me rephrase, they valued their creation here at over 80million dollars!   Let me give you an example of what 100million dollar game is:  The most Costly game ever made was, GTAV, it cost nearly $250 Million The 5th most costly game ever made was Destiny roughly $140 Million https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_video_games_to_develop  These are AAA games with hundreds/thousands (when you factor in ever little asset or supplier that had their hand in the game) of people working on them, through multi-billion dollar studios.    You think you guys can actually compete with Hearthstone or even pokemon? No, those are highly developed and highly integrated into the very fabric of our society. Those are characters that have brewed in minds for decades. Billions were spent on marketing, but through giant distributors who didn't focus soley on that asset of ""cards"", but had the ability to market it through a world-renown brand names such as Activision/Blizzard or Nintendo and they made profits by being already-established through the channels already made with other giant successes. Essentially, they had the capital and reputation through games like mario or warcraft to help promote and create new entities.  What we have here is a get-rich-quick scam ICO, with poor poor artwork designs on the cards.  i quote ""it fails entirely on card ownership - cards cannot be traded, so player collections have no value, and will never have value.""  This actually has no significant meaning to anyone. No one actually cares if they own the hearthstone cards, because when you login and you play the game, you have fun playing and you FEEL like you have ownership over those cards.  Basically, you guys are saying here is a couple drawings we made in 2-3 months, you can have this PUBLIC ID associated with the card and yeah it's 100% yours, but does that truly matter when you play a game, fuck no. Video game's are entertainment, not investments. Would you like to own Mario? Fuck yeah, but guess what, it took billions of dollars to make Mario... Mario.  This isn't Entropia Universe either, this is fucking cards with some shitty drawn artwork. - https://www.entropiauniverse.com/  What we have here is a mismatch of shit, misdirection and manipulation.   Scam ico is a scam   Edit: Also, you listed  Blizzard as #1 competitor, which is incorrect. Your #1 competitor is actually Ubisoft - Might & Magic Duel of Champions, and you're second competitor would be Elder Scrolls Legends. Both of these card games have very similar themes to your cards. Hearthstone is directly fantasy and doesn't incorporate any mythology/medieval theme based cards, might and magic and elder scrolls do.    Feels bad when potential investors knows more about the field you work in, then you actually do yourself.",False

Sure the first game is Novablitz (make of that what you will) but the team are creating infrastructure other games can run on, not just one CCG. They are also investing in other game studios that want to build on their platform with the ethereum raised. This means the success of the project isn't dependent on the success of the Novablitz game or even Novablitz as a studio, other studios can come along and make their own games and cards that live on the platform.  I'm not arguing with you, not saying you're wrong, not saying the project will even have positive ROI, just saying I think what they are trying to do is kinda cool.

Novatoken makes a lot of sense for proof of ownership with transparent rules for game content within a lot of games - card games, adventure games (Diablo types with rare/unique items), sport games or fantasy leagues etc.  Nova blitz is an excellent game to model the potential of the token and if they create a great API I can certainly see a lot of other game creators incorporating it into their apps.  It's also a lot of fun...maybe there wasn't a ton of interest 2 years ago but I think it's fun now and has a lot of potential.

Token holders can choose which games on the Nova Token platform they wish to stake with their NVT.  When new cards are issued in the chosen game, players will be rewarded with copies of the new cards proportional to the amount of NVT staked. Hence, NVT holders earn new cards through proof-of-stake.  How will the proof-of-stake enhance the value of NVT?  The laws of supply (fixed) and demand (growing) mean youâll be able to sell your cards for more and more as the player base grows. The same principle is what has grown the secondary market prices of Magic: The Gathering cards, where a single copy of a Black Lotus recently sold for $45k.  Example: Nova Blitz distributes 1,000 copies of a new legendary card among all token holders. Joe stakes enough NVT to earn 10 copies of that card. He can keep three to play with, and sell the other seven to other players. Or, if he thinks the value of the card will go up, he can hold onto the extra cards and sell them later.   https://imgur.com/a/JSt9d  Further your discussion at: Telegram Group : https://t.me/Novablitz Or their official website at : https://novablitz.com",False

Firstly, I am a player and I am invested in this ICO, so my opinion is surely biased. Obviously I hope the project succeeds.  I feel that it will for the following reasons: - The game itself is entertaining. I like strategy games and I do have a few files full of magic cards in my cupboard. - The game is on multiple platforms (Steemit / Android / Iphone)  I believe that once cards start staking that NVT will become big.  I found Nova Blitz after a run in with Crypto Kitties. So I feel that if a useless cat can have value, a Trading Card on the blockchain with an actual use could be even more valuable. People bought useless Generation 6 cats from me for around $100. I can see them paying $100 for a decent legendary as well.  This is my opinion though.

As a form of strategy I like ccg games.   What Nova Blitz is and where it is going is something I like. Could I be wrong. Possible, but there's always a chance that I am right and we all know that from an investment's sake there's no reward without risk.   If there were no product involved like with most ICO projects I would have agreed to this: ""The whitepaper is run off the mill megalomaniacal ICO hogwash.""  But that is not what I see here. Is the stats on steem on the low side, surely, could the marketing budget been handled better? Maybe.   But I prefer a project that has been 3 years in the making to just another overnight get rich idea by devs.  Could I be wrong. Yes. But I look for people in investments. The rest is all day trading and I don't care much about the company as long as the value grows. But my opinion is that Paul Barclay's digital footprint is large enough to be of interest to me.  But what happens to Nova Token will likely not be seen before 2019 or even 2020. That lies with the developers.",False

ENJ seems to be following the trend of TRON (TRX) which is now trading at $10.9 billion in market cap. ENJ at the time of writing is trading at $322 million in market cap.  As for Nova Token which is targeting to raise 10,000 ETH, this would mean a huge upside for investors and supporters alike.

Like some real fucking greed.  If you look at steam and any Indy game, they can develop this shit for 500k USD through a go-fund-me. But instead, we have these greedy cunts asking nearly 80-100million dollars in investment for some pictures and data on a blockchain. Let me rephrase, they valued their creation here at over 80million dollars!   Let me give you an example of what 100million dollar game is:  The most Costly game ever made was, GTAV, it cost nearly $250 Million The 5th most costly game ever made was Destiny roughly $140 Million https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_video_games_to_develop  These are AAA games with hundreds/thousands (when you factor in ever little asset or supplier that had their hand in the game) of people working on them, through multi-billion dollar studios.    You think you guys can actually compete with Hearthstone or even pokemon? No, those are highly developed and highly integrated into the very fabric of our society. Those are characters that have brewed in minds for decades. Billions were spent on marketing, but through giant distributors who didn't focus soley on that asset of ""cards"", but had the ability to market it through a world-renown brand names such as Activision/Blizzard or Nintendo and they made profits by being already-established through the channels already made with other giant successes. Essentially, they had the capital and reputation through games like mario or warcraft to help promote and create new entities.  What we have here is a get-rich-quick scam ICO, with poor poor artwork designs on the cards.  i quote ""it fails entirely on card ownership - cards cannot be traded, so player collections have no value, and will never have value.""  This actually has no significant meaning to anyone. No one actually cares if they own the hearthstone cards, because when you login and you play the game, you have fun playing and you FEEL like you have ownership over those cards.  Basically, you guys are saying here is a couple drawings we made in 2-3 months, you can have this PUBLIC ID associated with the card and yeah it's 100% yours, but does that truly matter when you play a game, fuck no. Video game's are entertainment, not investments. Would you like to own Mario? Fuck yeah, but guess what, it took billions of dollars to make Mario... Mario.  This isn't Entropia Universe either, this is fucking cards with some shitty drawn artwork. - https://www.entropiauniverse.com/  What we have here is a mismatch of shit, misdirection and manipulation.   Scam ico is a scam   Edit: Also, you listed  Blizzard as #1 competitor, which is incorrect. Your #1 competitor is actually Ubisoft - Might & Magic Duel of Champions, and you're second competitor would be Elder Scrolls Legends. Both of these card games have very similar themes to your cards. Hearthstone is directly fantasy and doesn't incorporate any mythology/medieval theme based cards, might and magic and elder scrolls do.

When I saw the announcement for the token I was really excited and intrigued.    So onto my barrage of questions.  If you already own cards in Nova Blitz what happens after NovaTokens get tied to the game.  Do your existing cards get transferred on to that platform or will this be only new sets going forward.  Can you discuss more about providing a Stake in a card game.  Being new to cryptocurrencies I am not familar with the concept.   Does this mean you will be spending those tokens?  Or is it more of a distribution of funds like in a mutal fund, so you're tokens would be allocated towards specific development teams as time goes on?  For the token exchange, I read that you would be exchanging ETH for the Nova Tokens.  Does this mean you need to own ETH to participate in the exchange or can you purchase with US Dollars at an ETH exchange rate equivalent?  A couple more philosophical questions on the token and market.  Can you share your thoughts on the market's appetite to going back to a TCG model versus a CCG model.  As you pointed out in the white paper the current digital ccg market does not support what the nova token  will provide, I think the closest we come is Magic the Gathering Online and even there you do not actually own the cards, although there is buying and selling of them.  The question is whether or not that is something the market wants to go back to since I would speculate a large portion of the digital ccg market never actually experienced the model of it's paper-based counterpart.

One thing to know is that as a Kickstarter backer, you're automatically getting some Nova Tokens as a reward for supporting the project over the last two years.   If you already own cards in Nova Blitz what happens after NovaTokens get tied to the game.  Do your existing cards get transferred on to that platform or will this be only new sets going forward.  We're keeping Set 1 as a free-to-play set, so that new players can more easily join the game. All future sets will be ownable cards on the blockchain.   Can you discuss more about providing a Stake in a card game.  Being new to cryptocurrencies I am not familar with the concept.   Does this mean you will be spending those tokens?  Or is it more of a distribution of funds like in a mutal fund, so you're tokens would be allocated towards specific development teams as time goes on?  With proof of stake, you still own the tokens that you stake. Your ""mutual fund"" example is a reasonable way of thinking about it. How it works is that you stake your tokens on a specific game/team, and then you'll get the cards that team creates. If you change your mind, you can pull back some or part of your stake and use it for something else (spend it or sell it).   For the token exchange, I read that you would be exchanging ETH for the Nova Tokens.  Does this mean you need to own ETH to participate in the exchange or can you purchase with US Dollars at an ETH exchange rate equivalent?  Yes, you need ETH to participate - the Nova Tokens will be transferred to your ethereum wallet when they're distributed, so you have to have a wallet too. We recommend MyEtherWallet for creating a wallet. You can buy ETH with USD on many major exchanges (but make sure you transfer the ETH to your wallet BEFORE contributing to the token sale - if you contribute from an exchange, you won't receive any Nova Tokens).   A couple more philosophical questions on the token and market.  Can you share your thoughts on the market's appetite to going back to a TCG model versus a CCG model.  As you pointed out in the white paper the current digital ccg market does not support what the nova token  will provide, I think the closest we come is Magic the Gathering Online and even there you do not actually own the cards, although there is buying and selling of them.  The question is whether or not that is something the market wants to go back to since I would speculate a large portion of the digital ccg market never actually experienced the model of it's paper-based counterpart.  The concept of card ""printing"" and scarcity is another topic I wonder if the digital market will be able to wrap their heads around.  A follow up question to that is assuming this is something the market is looking for, why would a bigger company not just create their own token rather than using yours, Blizzard for example, although I would assume they are committed to their current business model at this stage?  I believe this is great for indie developers and studios not looking to sink R&D time into this area.  I am just wondering if there are concerns with success if competitive coins will arise to achieve the same thing.  I think the digital gaming market as a whole understands scarcity very well - we're exposed to it on a daily basis, in games and beyond. There's rare item codes and top-end raid loot for MMOs like Word of Warcraft, legendary weapons in Destiny, and many more examples. What we know is that ownership is an incredibly powerful driver for people, and that's something that the recent crop of CCGs haven't succeeded at. And one of the reasons scarcity is confusing in paper TCGs is the fact that print runs aren't known. With Nova Tokens, the print run is recorded on the blockchain, so it's public information. That lets even the most casual player understand just how rare a given card is.  Bigger companies tend to be risk averse. So that's why we haven't seen big companies jump into token creation and blockchain. Also, big companies have shareholder responsibilities, and so tend to be very private in what they talk about. They're just not good fits for the more open communication required to run a token sale project. Smaller companies most likely both won't be able to create their own token, as they don't have the required skills on board, and won't want to, as the effort, risk, and investment required is considerable. Being able to jump on board an existing, developed, and supported platform is a much more sure bet for them.",False

It already features more than 300 cards, and will feature up to 50 new cards each month.  In parallel, we will integrate the Nova Token into Nova Blitz and create the tools required for other developers to build on top of the Nova Token. Building the Nova Token on top of the Nova Blitz infrastructure minimizes risk and maximizes speed to market.   Why Nova Tokens? In online card games, players want to trade and sell their cards, and they cannot. Players want their cards to grow in value, but that can never happen. Even worse, your cards are not your own - they are licensed from the developer, and the developer can revoke that license at any time.  Nova Tokens (âNVTâ) solves this by enabling the creation, sale, and trading of cards across any card game. Nova Tokens can also be used to enter in-game tournaments and pay for other in-game purchases. This allows NVT to completely replace fiat currencies in any game that implements it. Adopting Nova Tokens will allow Nova Blitz and other games to grow revenue to $100M or more per year. This growth will encourage future games to adopt Nova Tokens for trading, buying, and selling their cards, fueling even more growth.  Players benefit because they own their cards and can sell and trade them freely. Players will also benefit through entering and winning tournaments, without cheating and fraud.  Developers benefit because they earn 90% of Nova Token revenue, compared to 70% on Android, iOS, and Steam. And, developers will receive funding to integrate Nova Tokens.  Players: Free Cards In addition to being able to buy, sell, and trade their cards, token holders earn cards through proof of stake. Stake your NVT on a game, and when the game releases new cards, youâll earn copies of them. The number of cards that can be earned is proportional to the amount of NVT staked, so if you stake a large balance you might earn hundreds of copies of a single Legendary card. You will then be able to do whatever you want with the cards, including selling them to other players for 100% profit.  Developers: Free Money Developers will integrate NVT into their games because of the large number of players who demand ownership of their game assets, because they can acquire players more cheaply, and because developers will receive a portion of revenues generated by the platform. As the platform generates income from use in Nova Blitz and other games, it will return that income to new and existing developers to enable them to grow their player bases, and to assist them in integrating the Nova Token into their games.  Earn New Cards Token holders earn cards through proof of stake. Stake your NVT on a game, and when that game releases new cards, youâll earn copies of them. The more NVT you own, the more cards you can earn. The number of cards that can be earned is proportional to the amount of NVT staked, so if you stake a large balance you might earn hundreds of copies of a single Legendary card. Youâll then be able to do whatever you want with the cards, including selling them to other players for 100% profit. And if you own a lot of NVT, youâre going to get more cards than you can use, so youâll want to sell them.  Tournaments Current esports tournaments are rare, exclusive, and open to cheating and fraud. The Nova Token smart contract solves all these problems. Any game that implements the contract can run tournaments and know they will be safe, secure, and free from cheating and fraud. Entry fees and prizes are managed by the tournament smart contract. Prizes can be Nova Tokens, a card, or another type of in-game item. Players can also use the contract to organize their own tournaments. This feature allows an unlimited number of tournaments to run, so tournaments arenât just for the top players any more.  Card Exchange To buy, sell, and trade cards with minimal overhead from fees, and maximal liquidity, weâre implementing the Card Exchange. This is an Ethereum-based side chain built to take advantage of the Plasma protocol when it launches version 1.0 of the Card Exchange will allow users to post and fill buy/sell orders, and will mediate orders to ensure the order is filled at the listed price, with unused funds being returned to the filler. Version 2.0 will upgrade the card exchange to include an auction/bid system. Transaction fees will be low, and any profits made on transaction fees will be returned to game developers who integrate NVT, to provide additional funds for game development, marketing, and user acquisition.

The 10% also goes back to developers, just not directly. That 10% first covers any costs related to platform development, infrastructure, security, ongoing global legal compliance. Rather than every developer having to spend those costs, we can significantly reduce those costs by sharing them across multiple developers. It's unlikely those activities will take the full 10%, so any leftover money after those costs is added to the pool of money for supporting new developers.  Of course, a developer can also make their own back-end platform for trading, buying, and selling Nova Tokens and token cards, and retain the full 100% of revenue. We don't believe developers will do this, because it will be significantly more expensive to develop and scale. More likely, we expect the reverse - that developers will make open source contributions to the platform.   Quote from: Maurice1021 on November 13, 2017, 06:50:01 PM Hello Dev.
