Reveal your DNA value.,"ZENOME NETWORK: A NEW PROTOCOL FOR DISTRIBUTED INTERNET First of all, Zenome team is ready to publish a new article about ZENOME NETWORK with the detailed description of our technology. In the beginning of the next week this article will be available for our community. But before that, we decided to introduce you to the basic information, so you can read our article with a full understanding of what is going on here. The existing problems of personal genomics [associated with the exponential growth of the amount of data] are aimed at creating an IT-infrastructure that allows free exchange of genomic data and corresponding meta-data, storing large amounts of data in a safe manner with preservation of privacy and would be independent of any public or private organizations. Since all the existing solutions based on distributed networks cannot fully solve these problems, we have developed our own stack of network protocols - Zenome Distributed Network, as the foundation for creating our own IT-infrastructure. In our development we solved the following technical problems: - Peer Identification - Handshaking - Peer communication. Messaging - Routing and Switching - Data transfer. Streams It is worth noting that we have developed such a specification that would allow us to use the whole existing infrastructure of the Internet, over which our distributed Zenome network will be deployed. In our article (next week), we describe the key features of this Network. In contrast to our competitors, we are creating not an exchange service for genetic data but a new network protocol for storing, exchanging and monetizing data. Our competitors are using already existing solutions that are not perfect. But the launch of our #protocol will allow us to be out of this competition. How? They can use our distributed infrastructure to build their own services, because it will be even a more profound decision for them than the ones, that are described in their documentations right now.",False

Reveal your DNA value.,"Zenome Smart Contract Release  Basic informtion  There are two contracts - the ZNA contract and the one that is responsible for the emission (minting). ZNA token is a mintable token based on the ERC20 standard. To create secure contract we used OpenZeppelin library as it enables us with secure, tested and community-audited solidity code. By reusing battle-tested code we make the contracts much easier to audit by a third-party. By reusing battle-tested code we make the contracts much easier to audit by a third-party.  The second contract is so-called Crowdsale contract and designed to actually mint tokens. It's underlying source code actually mirrors the structure of the sale and represents all 3 options how tokens can be obtained. According to the sale terms, tokens can be bought (45%), given as a reward (30%), or reserved as long-term incentives (25%). The smart-contract ensures that the number of purchased tokens in the market will be greater than the number of rewarded tokens. A purse with reserved tokens can be released when 89% of tokens intended for sale are sold.  For security reasons, each of the three types of tokens will be created on a separate address.

Personal data is stored only on your computer, all financial transactions are stored securely in an encrypted form in the blockchain. You can conduct a DNA test (a saliva sample) in one of the partner laboratories (the list will be presented after launch) in your country, and then upload your genomic information into our system by installing a special program on your local computer.

In the case of the 23andMe, people were voluntarily allowed to use their genomic information to develop farm companies. We offer people to earn by selling access to their information, but in an encrypted and secure way, which is why we need the use of blockchain and peer-2-peer technologies. In some cases, if a person needs a genomic analysis that is expensive (and this is so for developing countries), he can get a genomic analysis for free, transferring the right to use this information to a third-party company.

Reveal your DNA value.,"From what I understand, 3.2million is for the pre-ico right? If say during the ICO the hardcap of 100million USD was reached then what will be the total circulating supply after the ICO? So I'm talking about the 25% out of total supply (including the frozen tokens). Personally I believe in the project and while I think Zenome could be very big in the very long term, I'm not sure about the short-term aspect of it, like in a year or two. If many potential investors share my belief, many will be reluctant to participate in the ICO since it would mean that the capital invested will be tied here for a while and this is definitely not a good thing. So I'm curious if the team has considered initiating a buy-back program, say like dedicating 5% of the funds raised or buying back certain amount ZNA after token listing (like 3-8% of the circulating supply, the more the better for the investors but I'm sure the team will find the right amount). This will not only secure investors' interests, it will generate the right amount of attention for Zenome after launch due to the price spike, having a promotional effect as well and will attract much more interest in the project and will raise much more funds during the ICO. It's like this, there are very promising altcoins out there but they are not receiving the right attention and hence is heavily devaluated. Most traders don't go and look for every altcoin but will be interested in a coin if something suddenly spiked. I hope you get what I mean. This can provide the right push to become one of the big alts. I think it would be a win-win for everyone since it's quite obvious that the buy-back funds will be much less than the additional funds raised due to the buy-back program too. Let me know what you guys think.. N btw good luck Devs.",False

Reveal your DNA value.,"   We understand that the certain regulatory constraints exist. For example, in the US and Germany it is impossible for a patient to get obtained genetic medical data without a doctor involved in this process. At the same time, it is possible to collect genomic information, as well as provide and release the information on ethnos / wellness or fitness practically in any country. The main legal barrier is to get a permission from medical regulators (such as the FDA in the US), but we are planning to work with a partner network of service providers that will meet all the necessary legal requirements. We are going to collect prepared genomic data (for example, customers of 23andMe and others) and issue genetic reports (within the framework of local legislation) immediately after project launching and the world. At the same time, the first pilot project that includes the connection of genetic service providers and data consumers will be conducted in Russia for a number of reasons: we have partner agreements with two local licensed service providers who are ready to work with us. We have a prepared scientific base, laboratory and consultants in SkTech (http://www.skoltech.ru/en/) - and the development office is located in Moscow. In addition, Russia is one of the least explored countries in genomics, while possessing a very diverse gene pool of the local population (many ethnic groups and nationalities), economic potential and lack of regulatory constraints, which is typical of most developed countries. All these reasons make the Russian Federation the best place to start a project. After that, we plan to open a representative office in the UK for expansion into England and the EU countries. After that, we will start projects in other developing countries like Mexico and Brazil. And after all the processes of platform development and the establishment of cooperation with the regulators, we will start to develop projects in the US and China, since these are the largest, but highly regulated markets.   We are going to publish our business plan and the description of regulatory issues as a detailed document. Some crucial points for now:  1. We start taking genomic data from people who have already undergone genetic testing and want to receive a report and a secure decentralized repository for money. According to our estimates, there are about 3-4 million people who have genomic data and could load them into our system. In the beginning, we plan to use a subscription model of monetization for the first users at a rate of $ 50 per year (or equivalent in ZNA tokens). Later, users who uploaded their data will begin to monetize their genomes. The start date for this phase is February 2018. We estimate the volume of this market at $ 100mln per annum for now and $ 1bn per year in the next three years. 2. We create a partner network of laboratories and clinics. Who supply us with raw data, pay for processing and storage, attract new customers through our platform. There will be work in B2B format also on subscription. The approximate period for the pilot project in the Russian Federation is March 2018 - December 2018. The opening of the office in London is scheduled for September 2018. The size of this market today exceeds $ 20 billion.  3. When the critical size of the genomic database is reached, we begin to sell data to large companies from Big Pharma, FMCG, state structures and e-commerce companies such as Google, Alibaba and Facebook with Amazon. According to our estimates, our genetic database will contain 1 million genomes by the end of 2018. After having collected anticipated amount of genetic data in our database, we are going to allow users to exchange genetic data. In short, at that time we will begin the monetization of genetic data. After having collected anticipated amount of genetic data, the ZNA token price will increase. The market for the personal genomic data purchasing by various companies is still difficult to assess, since it is in its infancy. To date, the total aggregate of transactions doesn't exceed $ 200 million, but we are confident that in the next 5-10 years this market will be one of the largest in the world. 4. After the genomic data critical volume achievement there will be more services on our platform. For example: services of genomic acquaintances, genomic social networks, definition of ethnos, search of relatives, companies providing telemedicine services, dietetics and many others. We believe that with the help of the critical volume the system will start an independent development.  It is worth noting that Zenome is a non-profit company. This type of organization is reasonable for creating the best environment for other businesses on the platform. In order to give equal access to genomic service providers and medical centers and to exclude monopolization and to protect human rights, we deliberately abandoned the model of a commercial company.  In connection with the foregoing, the funds collected under the ICO (token sale) will be used for the following tasks:  - Development of a system for storage, processing and sharing of genomic data (including all operating expenses, business administration, bonuses, capital expenditures and own research, tax expenditures) - Development of a partnerships wide range - Marketing costs, advertising and improving people's knowledge of genomics and our platform -  Zenome Fund development, which will stimulate research and the start-ups around our platform - Educational program by Zenome - Legal support and interaction with regulators from different countries (representative offices in different jurisdictions, legal support, costs associated with obtaining various licenses and certification)",False

White Paper         Zenome.io Web Site  Genes have a profound impact on person's health and lifestyle. Recently many discoveries of genetic factors connected to longevity, overweight, sports success, drugs susceptibility and other traits have been reported. These findings provide opportunities for different kinds of genetic services.  Disease treatment Genetics provides better understanding of disease mechanisms and drives the development of an effective treatment. It's possible to predict what disorders a person is likely to develop and prevent future complications. Disease prevention Prospective parents can undergo genetic testing to determine the risk of having a child with a genetic disease. In the high risk cases the assisted reproductive technology is used to ensure that the baby will be free of the disease under consideration. Advice for lifestyle change Lifestyle modification and personalized nutrition based on a genetic profile of an individual could greatly improve the quality of life and life expectancy. Not to mention genetic services utilizing genetic profile to give recommendations for better athletic performance and weight loss. Genetics for Fun ""Recreational"" genetic testing: Ancestry, DNA-Based Dating. Your DNA is an Asset Zenome is the Market   How Genetic Services are Provided For Now    Or the Overview of Challenges and Disparities in Genomics  The highly promising market for genetic technologies is growing rapidly. The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies has resulted in a significant drop in prices for genome analyzing and an exponential increase in available genomic data.  To store such a large amount of genomic data, special genomic databases have been created, financed by governments or large corporations. These databases contain clinically relevant information as well as the relationships between genetic traits and diseases. Impact on Science and Society The development of genomics has led to the transformation of biology, agriculture, medicine, social sciences and many other sciences.   Google, Apple, IBM and a number of commercial companies have set the objective of using genomics to adjust their products and services according to the customers' genomic profiles. This led to rethinking of the notion of privacy.  Currently, the total market volume is about approximately $25 billion.  But some serious challenges for genomics still exist, concerning availability, privacy and ethics.  Genetic Privacy DNA is a molecule where all genetic information is stored. This information is closely connected to personal and group identity. That means that genetic privacy has a value on its own, and genetic privacy protection is of great importance for a meaningful life. Genetic discrimination Discoveries in genetics have opened the door to new notions of discrimination. Genetic discrimination occurs when people are treated differently by their employer or insurance company because of a specific gene mutation. Undermined privacy as a price for participation in open reseach Informed consent is a key issue in every biomedical research study that means that participants understand the consequences and agree with the terms of the research study, which may include giving permission to use the data in future projects.  As a result of privacy-related concerns overly complicated legal limitations took place in many developed countries.  Genomic Data Monopolization The majority of genomic data is hosted in developed countries in databases controlled by corporations and governments. Access for the scientific community is limited by commercial subscriptions or restricted. In many cases research groups should provide explanations of how the research will contribute to the public good and wait months for approval. Pseudonimity of Data stored in genetic databases Although the founders of genomic databases claim they securely and anonymously store genomic data, in reality, the data stored are only pseudonymous, as in some cases, individuals have been identified based on their genomic information. Low Awareness Public awareness of genomic medicine remains quite low in the developed and even worse in developing countries. That means that people, in general, have little understanding about possible benefits of genomics as well as possible dangers associated with it.  Monopolization of genomic data inhibits further scientific progress. Zenome project  The Zenome Platform is going to raise awareness on genomic medicine, so users can make conscious decisions regarding their data. To ensure that, the Zenome Platform is based on the following fundamental principles.  Individual ownership of personal genomic information     User has all rights for personal genomic data. Freedom of choice     User decides how genetic information should be used. The right to share     User may grant access to genetic data to a third party in a way restricting data copying. Privacy     Encryption prohibits access to genetic data without an explicit user's permission. System Architecture Simply put, Zenome platform is a P2P network. Some nodes are resource providers that store and process genetic information. Participants, analysts and service providers connect to distributed network and interact with each other. Data exchange is secured through encryption and utilization of blockchain smart contracts.    Zenome platform main actors: Resource provider provides storage and CPU/GPU power for a reward. Participant uploads individual genetic data, gets reports and possibly uses genetic services. Analyst works with genetic information (a data scientist or a scientific organization) Service Provider implements a user-space genetic service (possibly paid) on the platform. Distributed data storage provides high availability and fault tolerance through replication and scale out ability. Distributed data processing enables any user to become a node by providing disk space and CPU/GPU time to the network. Service Provider API is designed to ensure maximum confidentiality. User sees what data is to be transfered and has to explicitly confirm data exchange. Decentralized economics is powered by the utility token of the platform, Zenome DNA Token (ZNA). Genome Tokenomics It appears that the exchange of genetic information is of crucial importance. The prospective genetic market must ensure protection from possible misuse and genetic discrimination in particular. It is particularly important to maintain transparency and equal access to this market.  Zenome aims at creating the personal genomics infrastructure, that would enable participants to: Upload genetic information and take control of it. Securely store own genetic information. Make profit by selling access to genetic data or part of it. Undergo genetic testing in exchange to the right to use genetic information. Get individual dietary recommendations or personal training program based on genetic makeup. Make use of other genetic services. The principal customers of genetic information are companies interested in genetic targeting such as Google, Facebook, Unilever and pharmaceutical companies. Inside Zenome Platform different types of information are inextricably intertwined. The nature of each type determines the way to store information of that kind.     Financial data, which includes records of transactions, is stored on blockchain.     Anonymized genomic data is stored on the distributed network.     Participant's personal data is kept on their own computers only. Treating data of different kind differently provides privacy as well as scalability of the system.  Since all data transactions, including buying and selling data, are governed by smart-contracts, interactions can only include balances stored on blockchains.  Using any of pre-existing tokens for this purpose would result in unreasonable dependence on the valuation of external token. Thus, a separate utility token should be issued to power economic interactions on the platform. Utility Token A platform's utility token, ZNA (Zenome DNA Token), powers Zenome's decentralized economics. The token is used as an exchange unit in the internal ecosystem. Value of ZNA depends directly on the success of the platform.  ZNA is an utility token: ZNA is not evidence of ownership or right to control.  Tokens will be allocated during the crowdfunding period.

Reveal your DNA value.,"  Thanks for the feedback. We have updated the opening post.  In short, Zenome platform will provide infrastructure for genetic data exchange. The basic premises are: 1) Everyone has rights over individual genomic data. 2) Many companies are interested in getting these data for different purposes. 3) Privacy should be ensured as much as possible. 4) User should make an informed decision. The platform should warn user about data exchanges that can compromise user's privacy.  So let me give you some examples: Example 1 Some company wants to apply genomics to improve a service/a product. (That could be a personalized nutrition service, for example.)  The company needs 10 000 records, each containing information about ~20 SNPs, to conduct a research. So company makes an offer to buy this tiny part of genetic information and sets a price. The offer then propagates in our network.  Each user who has the data gets notified. The user opens the offer and sees all the details, including price and the system message ""Privacy won't be compromised by sharing that little data."" Then user may accept and get reward or decline an offer.  Example 2 The research group in a large corporation is developing a new promising drug. And there is a need for genome-wide association study of more than 1000 SNPs.  So the research group make an offer from their corporate account. Users get notified as well, but this time they will see a warning: ""Attention! Privacy can be compromised!"". Then go some details: ""Attention! Genetic Identification possible!"" and ""Consider reading about the corporation (link is given) before accepting the offer."" Once again user may accept and get (much larger) reward or decline an offer.  So the Zenome is a genomic market, but the platform is designed to ensure users' awareness. If a particular exchange can compromise privacy, the platform will explicitly warn user.",False

Reveal your DNA value.,"   Concerning financial aspects, there is another use case. Companies that provide genetic services can deploy their (paid) services on the platform. That could be a genetic dating service, or a cosmetology recommendations service. Each user can access any service and spend tokens on paid features.  Different service providers using the same API on the Zenome platform would eventually create an integrated environment and provide a consistent user experience. Also, there is no need for an additional account for each service. No need to undergo genetic testing once more. User just should give access to genetic data that user already has.  This greatly simplifies the use of genetic services and we expect them to be used more.",False
