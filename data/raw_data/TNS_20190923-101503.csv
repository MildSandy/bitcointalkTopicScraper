Well, It‚Äôs because of they detect the device and internet speed and delivers you the right file.  Transcoding is the process of converting from one file format to another desirable and compatible format. Before your favourite social media platform or streaming site such as YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter makes a video available to you, they need to convert this video into multiple formats in order to support different devices such as smartphones, laptop and desktop computers, TVs and more, since each of them have different capabilities. Some videos might even fail to play over a slow internet connection, these type of videos will also need to be converted into a lighter format for a smooth streaming.  The process to convert files into different file format or frame sizes are called transcoding. Complex media encoding, decoding, and transcoding is resource intensive which needs multiples of servers to process on a large scale which is very expensive at the moment. This is the main reason for fewer competitors to free public streaming sites like YouTube.",False

Question: How can you claim that Transcodium has unlimited processing power when the reality is that the processing power  is limited by the number of ""miners?""  Answer: we used the term unlimited processing power because comparing the number of people who would want to earn from their cell phones, idle computers and even gaming console to the number of servers you will have to buy and maintain is huge. if you have really read our whitepaper very well, the files to be processed will be sent in very little chunks so as to not overwork the worker devices especially smartphones.This way device owners wont even notice the battery and memory consumption. Alot of people would opt in for this to make money from their devices.   2. Question: What happens if the service gets extremely popular and there is more demand than supply?  Answer: If the service gets more popular then it means customers are getting value for the money paid and the service rendered to them is of high quality.   3. Question: What incentive do miners have to use their processing power for this instead of mining other coins?  Answer: Again if you read the white paper very well, the minner or workers will earn the TNS tokens after every successful transcoding process. Also customers can only pay with the TNS tokens on the network  to enable the Token get value because there will be an active trading and this causes demand and supply of the token. Also with transcodium there is no need to disturb your self with hash rate difficulty  and others because its not needed, if you earn $100/ a day, you will earn that forever with the same processing power you provide   4. Question:  How is this decentralized when you have to upload your file to an unknown masternode? Again if you have read the whitepaper and the business model very well, The masternode will be managed only by the transcodium team due to the privacy involved, again customers can provide their own master node if they think it will be okay with them.   5. Question:   Amazon charges 3 cents per minute for HD transcoding.  Answer: True, and that is very cheap, but ask your self, is it fast enough to handle very large scale processing? also , also you will need alot of technicalities to be able to setup an amazon transcoder. let me give you a simple example: before whatsapp was born there were alot of messaging app, but ask your self, why is it the number one choice of the average Joe, because of it simplicity, if you have tried our prototype you will know how simple is it to edit and transcode a file. Also amazon dont provide editing tools, its strictly transcoding, but we provide visual editing tools and many more. Try the prototype.   6.  What if there is an issue with the transcoding?  Who gives the refund? Do you really know how the blockchain, transcoding and the smart contract works? if no, then let me explain, after every successful transcoding, the integrity of the process file is tested before payment is done, also if you have read the whitepaper very well, using the proof of stake, users cannot mine with an empty balance. Also There is a company called Transcodium Ltd. to give support and help to its customers, it is a registered company and not just a group of people trying to create something up.  7. Question:  It would be much better suited for a centralized service that pays users for computing power.  No one who needs massive transcoding power is going to go through the hassle to buy the highly volatile bitcoin so that they can convert it to an altcoin to get some decentralized service that may or may not work.  Answer : If Storj , Golem , Siacoin and others have been able to decentralize most aspect of the cloud , then how is this different, dont people buy bitcoin and convert to altcoin to pay them??

What is the essence of a crypto and ICO based groups? The main usage of these groups are to discuss , share and talk about ico , cryptocurrencies based topics , upcoming, ongoing and completed ICO. So what is wrong when we post in such groups informing users about our project and why it is useful? besides many of the group members asked alot of questions and we gladly answered them. also in cases where the post was wrongly posted to non crypto and ICO groups, we apologised and requested admin to take it off.  Again, you said we are spamming our own thread, let me ask, what is your own explanation of a spam ?: from google this is the definition of a spam which maybe you need to educate yourself:  A spam is an irrelevant or unsolicited messages sent over the Internet, typically to a large number of users, for the purposes of advertising, phishing, spreading malware, etc.  Point out only 1 irrelevant message which we have posted here ? , we try to answer and update our members and thread watchers, isnt that the sole purpose of this thread??   Lastly I think you are of the guys who sent me a message to promote us in your group for 5-20 ethereum, the fact is we cant pay that. We would be glad to pay it but we are on a low budget.  about 20+ different telegram groups are asking 5-20 ethereum or 1-5 bitcoins respectively per group to post or announce our project in their group, lets imagine we can afford that, then what would be the need of going for an ICO if we had that huge amount to spend on announcement only + other expenses which can cost up to $100k - $200k , wouldn't it be wise to spend that in project and just launch it??  We are sorry we or our bounty participants might have posted in your group, but ask your self, do you even read the whitepaper of projects you take monies from before misleading innocent investors by posting into your group?  We are running a bounty program and a contest where users are allowed to spread our project's ideas, we might not have control over the groups they post, Thank You...",False

Why does transcoding need the blockchain :  Simple Transcoding task can be done on the personal computers and laptops, but large-scale production like what Netflix and Youtube process a  day will need hundreds to thousands of server which requires huge money and a lot of time maintaining those servers. Like Uber, Transcodium will work with anyone willing to rent their device to process these files, for maximum privacy and security, a media file such as video and images will be split into very little chunks and distributed to workers (minners), this means no single machine will get a full file access but rather a very little portion of it.  The blockchain is required here because there must be a trust between the customers and the worker machines, therefore, with the use of smart contract which is currently supported by the blockchain, the incentive to be paid after processing a file will be locked until the master nodes check the integrity of the converted files. Also minners will need a reserved tokens which will be held by the smart contract to issue automatic refunds to failed conversion which somehow the integrity check passed.  incentives to be paid the device owners (workers) will be based on the blockchain's token, which we adopted ethereum blockchain.  secondly, for transparency, the public distributed ledger of the blockchain will hold all the necessary information of the processed file chunks, how much was paid to workers and many more information which both the worker machine owners and customers can verify.  2. How will the Tokens / Coins be used (token usage)  The TNS tokens will be used on the Transcodium Network, Those customers who want their files to be processed will pay using the TNS tokens, also masternode owners and Worker Machines (Minners) will be paid using the TNS tokens after a successful transcoding request on the Transcodium Network.The token will be based on the ethereum blockchain and will be an ERC 20 token standard  Also Since Transcodium will employ the proof of stake algorithm of as part of the worker (miner) selection process, workers (minners) will need to prove their wealth by keeping some considerable number of tokens to account to be able to qualify for transcoding contract.",False

How is this decentralized when you have to upload your file to an unknown masternode?  Amazon charges 3 cents per minute for HD transcoding.  That right there will limit the value of this token.

Transcoding is the process  of converting from one file format to another desirable and compatible format.  Before your favourite social media platform or streaming site such as Youtube or Netflix  makes a video available to you, they need to convert this video into multiple formats in order  to support different devices such as smartphones, laptop and desktop computers, TVs and more, since each of them have different capabilities. Some videos might even fail to  play over a slow internet connection, these  type  of videos  will also need to be converted into a lighter format for a smooth streaming.  Why the Transcodium is an interesting project: Reasons why Transcodium is an interesting project for investors,startups and developers are:  1.Uniqueness of the project : We are the first company to migrate from the cloud transcoding platform to the blockchain.  2. Very large market size: The transcoding and media distribution industry is growing at a very fast pace, social networks are adding streaming capabilities to their platforms, on demand streaming sites are replacing the traditional Televisions, news agencies now posts news using audio visual methods,advertising networks are now serving video and audio ads and many more. All the mentioned services above needs to convert their media files to support multiple devices and that is where we come into play..  3. Cheaper, Faster & reliable services : Our competitors (Google Cloud, Amazon  Transcoder, Zencoding ..) are currently the cheapest cloud platforms available,but we will be the cheapest and fastest due to the unlimited resources our workers(miners) will provide, thereby increasing the demand for our service.  4. Limited token supply : our token supply is fixed at 120million, which is an exciting news ,because from coinmarketcap.com.  5. Company Registration and Founders Verification Passed: All Serious projects must first register a company and verify all founders to proof seriousness to their investors.  6. Existing Product : We have an existing product which we are migrating to the blockchain, we are expert in this field already, our company has helped many companies such as geetmp3.com in the media transcoding and streaming field.  How Does Transcodium Works Transcodium's unique algorithm will enable the conversion of media files in a supersonic speed by splitting large media files into very tiny chunks and thereafter will be encrypted, compressed and sent to workers (idle devices) to process. Due to the lightweight of each chunk, these tasks will be transferred and processed at a very fast speed, even smartphones will be capable of processing them. Tokens will be rewarded to any worker who completes its task before the allocated timeout.

This can be very tedious and complicated especially if it involves a large number of files.  But you can do all these with jusr one click using Transcodium's platform. The files will be converted by our minners in a very fast and reliable mode, our master nodes will also distribute the files to anywhere you need them to go.",False

Transcodium's unique algorithm will enable the conversion of media files in a supersonic speed by splitting large media files into very tiny chunks and thereafter will be encrypted, compressed and sent to workers (idle devices) to process. Due to the lightweight of each chunk, these tasks will be transferred and processed at a very fast speed, even smartphones will be capable of processing them.

Again on server bills, if you have really worked with transcoding on a large scale, then you should know the amount we are talking about here.The Transcoding Technology is not outmoded, its rather an emerging technology, example, all social networks are adding video streaming capabilities to their platform, advertising networks are now serving video and audio ads and Netflix, Hulu and more are still getting popular, the list can go on and on, these videos needs to be transcoded to support the different varying device capabilities. This is where our service comes into play. The service is in a very high demand but the cost of servers has made it a business for the Giant (Google, Amazon ....).  Lastly , any good businessman does not give up his ideas because he encountered a problem, but rather searches for an alternative approach to achieve the goal, that is what we are doing here, we believe decentralization and the blockchain will help achieve this goal and even better.",False
