We undertake to include the DTX token in the Chankura.com crypto-electronic register to date and conduct one or two exchange transactions for confirmation of entering the DTX into the register.

If you want to know how selling or buying IoT sensor data would work on Databroker, check out the BETA version of the platform: https://beta.databrokerdao.com/  The data flows from the sensor to the gateway operator. Like a telco for example. The gateway operator runs the dAPI on their end (so every gateway operator runs their copy of the dAPI and their blockchain node). Secondly, the marketplace records who owns what at what time in the smart contracts. When you buy access, you also specify a target where it needs to go, e.g. your AWS S3 bucket. Now every time data comes into the gateway operator, it will pass it to the dAPI that will check who has bought access to it. it will then send the data onwards to the location specified in the purchase. The gateway operator takes a percentage of the sale to cover the server and network costs to do so. so as a buyer, you pay DTX tokens and add a target location, and the data will appear there. The data itself does not flow over the blockchain network, the scale would be impossible.",False

The platform will retain 25% of all tokens, minus all tokens needed for the referral scheme, plus all unsold tokens.  The purpose of these tokens is twofold. On the one hand, a reserve of tokens allows for follow-up sales to accelerate growth and allows the platform to do some limited market making. This is crucial since the liquidity of a utility token is paramount in the functioning of the platform. At the same time, some of the raised ETH will also be kept in reserve for these market-making purposes.  An additional 10 percent of the tokens are reserved for the team fund. The majority of the team fund will be distributed to team members joining the platform and will be vested in stages over 3 years.

Streamr is taking their traditional data transfer platform and will attempt to ‚Äúblockhainize‚Äù it. While we will not go into a deep technical analysis of these projects the conclusion can be drawn from reading the whitepaper that the goal is to replace the entire IoT stack, from top to bottom, with the Streamr solution. A monumental challenge if you keep in mind that if they are operational in 2 years, they will have to replace an industry with 30 billion deployed sensors.  IOTA‚Äôs plan is similar. But they go even further, aside from replacing the entire IoT ecosystem, they also replace any underlying blockchain base with a new and untested network, using a concept called a ‚Äútangle‚Äù. Double down on the challenges.  Both Streamr and IOTA describe a data marketplace. A marketplace for data on the the Streamr or IOTA platform/network. Of, at some point in time, one of them has replaced the IoT ecosystem, the winner would indeed be a real competitor for DataBroker DAO to break down data silos and facilitate the easy transfer of data, regardless of the underlying network.  OceanProtocol is a different story. Their focus is a new kind of BigchainDB-based network specifically for buying and selling AI datasets. While not a lot is known at this point, the roadmap specifies several years before their solution will be ready and the underlying technology is less decentralised/open compared to an Ethereum based solution.   DataBroker DAO takes a radically different approach: It is built to go into production this year. This ensures we both need to use proven technology, and a first movers advantage over these other players.",False

The key role of Sensor Owners in DataBroker DAO is to sell the data from their sensors on the platform.  Network operators Gain scale and speed in the adoption of their network as connected telcos can present a win-back to their enterprise accounts, a clear USP. The key role of Network Operators in DataBroker DAO is to expose the gateway they operate to enable sensor owners to sell their data on the platform.  Sensor manufacturers Can stop the ""race to the bottom‚Äù for production and pull resources and capital out of manufacturing and allocate these to profitable SaaS offerings.  Smart city initiatives Can limit the upfront cost of populating the town with sufficient sensors and turn the expense into an investment with a 2-3 year payback period and a continuous income stream after that.  Agricultural sector In the Agricultural sector in Belgium today, 10% of farmers are ""techie"". They deploy sensors include for wind, temperature, barometric pressure, humidity, PH level in the soil. The platform will provide the possibility to recoup some of this cost.  Academics Can get access to thousands of sensors and can buy data directly and more cheap on the marketplace, cutting out established data providers.   Data Buyers Data Buyers are those stakeholders who will purchase data on the platform. The scope of this purchase could be to use the data in its raw form, for their own purposes, or to transform/enrich the raw data to be resold with added value via DataBroker DAO (see Data Processor below). The use of the data purchased by Data Buyers can be quite straightforward, for instance purchasing temperature and rainfall data provisioned by a neighboring office building to get accurate local readings, to the more complex, like purchasing data to train one‚Äôs AI.  Data Processors Data Processors are those Data Buyers who purchase data with the explicit intention of enriching the data and either reselling it or handling it for their clients. The enrichment may take many forms and Data Processors can be categorized by the level of insight provided: ‚Ä¢ Simple data services are the most common. Data brokers collect data from multiple sources and offer it in collected and conditioned form ‚Äî data which would otherwise be fragmented, conflicted, and sometimes unreliable. ‚Ä¢ Smart data services provide conditioned and calculated data, with analytical rules and calculations applied to derive further insight from the collected data and aid the decision making process. ‚Ä¢ Adaptive data services apply analysis to a customer‚Äôs request-specific data, combined with data in a context store. This is a more advanced form of service. It is estimated that there are more than 5,000 data processing companies worldwide relying on a vast array of open datasets, published by government agencies and non-governmental sources.",False

Streamr is taking their traditional data transfer platform and will attempt to ‚Äúblockhainize‚Äù it. While we will not go into a deep technical analysis of these projects the conclusion can be drawn from reading the whitepaper that the goal is to replace the entire IoT stack, from top to bottom, with the Streamr solution. A monumental challenge if you keep in mind that if they are operational in 2 years, they will have to replace an industry with 30 billion deployed sensors.  IOTA‚Äôs plan is similar. But they go even further, aside from replacing the entire IoT ecosystem, they also replace any underlying blockchain base with a new and untested network, using a concept called a ‚Äútangle‚Äù. Double down on the challenges.  Both Streamr and IOTA describe a data marketplace. A marketplace for data on the the Streamr or IOTA platform/network. Of, at some point in time, one of them has replaced the IoT ecosystem, the winner would indeed be a real competitor for DataBroker DAO to break down data silos and facilitate the easy transfer of data, regardless of the underlying network.  OceanProtocol is a different story. Their focus is a new kind of BigchainDB-based network specifically for buying and selling AI datasets. While not a lot is known at this point, the roadmap specifies several years before their solution will be ready and the underlying technology is less decentralised/open compared to an Ethereum based solution.   DataBroker DAO takes a radically different approach: It is built to go into production this year. This ensures we both need to use proven technology, and a first movers advantage over these other players.",False

Streamr is taking their traditional data transfer platform and will attempt to ‚Äúblockhainize‚Äù it. While we will not go into a deep technical analysis of these projects the conclusion can be drawn from reading the whitepaper that the goal is to replace the entire IoT stack, from top to bottom, with the Streamr solution. A monumental challenge if you keep in mind that if they are operational in 2 years, they will have to replace an industry with 30 billion deployed sensors.  IOTA‚Äôs plan is similar. But they go even further, aside from replacing the entire IoT ecosystem, they also replace any underlying blockchain base with a new and untested network, using a concept called a ‚Äútangle‚Äù. Double down on the challenges.  Both Streamr and IOTA describe a data marketplace. A marketplace for data on the the Streamr or IOTA platform/network. Of, at some point in time, one of them has replaced the IoT ecosystem, the winner would indeed be a real competitor for DataBroker DAO to break down data silos and facilitate the easy transfer of data, regardless of the underlying network.  OceanProtocol is a different story. Their focus is a new kind of BigchainDB-based network specifically for buying and selling AI datasets. While not a lot is known at this point, the roadmap specifies several years before their solution will be ready and the underlying technology is less decentralised/open compared to an Ethereum based solution.   DataBroker DAO takes a radically different approach:  - It is built to go into production this year. This ensures we both need to use proven technology, and a first movers advantage over these other players.  - It is built to interface with the large players in the ecosystem (manufacturers and gateway operators) in a non invasive way. We are not replacing anything or anyone, ensuring a low friction environment. The only way to get market scale fast enough.  - It focuses on being a complementary component in the current and future ecosystem, meaning that in the future DataBroker DAO can co-exist, integrate and complement IOTA, Streamr and OceanProtocol.  We wish each and every one of these projects all the success in the world, and we will happily integrate them into the ecosystem upon reaching critical mass.",False

They have a drone flying around and 5-20 sensors deployed and some other automation in place. The sensors include for instance wind, temperature, barometric pressure, humidity, PH level in the soil. They use these to manage their farm and spend between 10-50k euro per year, and DataBroker DAO will provide the possibility to recoup some of this cost.

The percentage is set to 10% right now but can vary according to market conditions.  Quote from: spottcoin on October 12, 2017, 12:04:16 PM In the white paper you forecast the potential demand for information describing groups of possible consumers. How will you act, if not all of these groups are interested in your service and the demand will be much lower suggestions that will be lead to the decline of interest in DataBroker DAO from the sellers data?  We have market tested the platform since January on conferences with buyers and sellers. We are very sure that there is demand. And if we are totally wrong, we need to adjust our plan/offering to match.  Quote from: 16009 on October 12, 2017, 12:42:48 PM What will you do with the remaining tokens, if not the entrie amount will be realized after ICO?  We only mine the tokens that are actually sold. So that would be the supply in circulation. Though we reserve the right to organise a follow-up sale in the future (nothing planned btw) and sell these leftover tokens at that time.  Quote from: MadduckUK on October 12, 2017, 01:03:13 PM As far as I understand, growing your token will be long-term. But the project is serious. If not secret how much you've collected at the moment?  In our early sale we have a little over 900ETH right now.

The owners of the sensors and sensors can offer service only to the sale, or to additional ways to monetize their activities?  The platform allows for what we call data processors. Companies buying data, doing smart things with it (bigdata, ai, etc) and then selling this data onwards.  Quote from: hunterofmoney on October 12, 2017, 01:34:26 PM The data providers are stored on your servers on not? If so, will i have the sellers info to pay  for the storage of sensor data and sensors?  No the data is not stored on our servers. The buyer can choose where to send the data he or she bought.  Quote from: polonium84 on October 13, 2017, 05:17:58 AM The information from the sensors, and sensor suppilers will be ""broadcast"" to consumers in real-time or updated at regular intervals of time?  In realtime. Tough e,g the LoRa sensors have a low rate, so it might only send a reading once per hour.  Quote from: coin63 on October 13, 2017, 05:53:03 AM How do you plan to limit the volatility of their tokens?  Not actively at least. The DATA token will vary, especially at the beginning. We assume that in the long term the value of these tokens will stabilise based on real word performance of the company.  Quote from: Immer on October 13, 2017, 07:07:32 AM How to affect the profitability of the company DataBroker DAO situation, if the loT market will cease to grow in the coming years and will decline? Has the service replacement strategy in this case?  That would go against all current predictions. But it would severly affect the project. That would require a pivot to deal with.",False

We need one for the state channels and microtransactions. Pure utility.   Do token holders receive any reward for staking?  Not as of yet.   Your white paper mentioned something about your token being used on your platform instead of Ethereum because of volatility of the Ethereum price. Does this mean that your token won't be traded on exchanges to avoid price fluctuations?  Since the project is a ""real"" business, we hope the volatility will be less than ETH in the long run. if this proves to be a false assumption, we are looking into solutions like a Variable and a stable coin.

I still do not see the benefit to the ICO investor (me) though. If I invest then the 'stability' of the coin means that there is little to no prospect of profit since it will be used solely on your platform. Add to that no staking and this means that buying the token from an investment point of view just doesn't add up.  I get that this is a real business but you are asking people to invest real money in an ICO without clearly explaining potential benefits. This project should be receiving a lot more buzz and perhaps the lack of the value proposition from an investment point of view is the reason it isn't? Add your coin to exchanges so the market can decide its true value and it will serve as an incentive to your development team to grow your project thereby increasing their investment. Add a staking element so that ICO investors buy and hold instead of try to dump their tokens at the first available opportunity.  Check projects like WaltonChain to see how to build a community of passionate stakeholders.  I wish you all the best!",False

Let's take this Proximus case for example. Your white paper states that sensor owners will be directly remunerated when their data is bought. Does this mean that actual phone owners will profit directly from Databroker DAO? The whitepaper mentions that the average sensor has a value of ~12 USD per year. You based your ICO token value on that number. With 14 sensors in the average smartphone, that would mean that a single phone would be good for about $168 worth of sensor data per year. Granted, not all sensors would be useful or equally interesting to be traded, but still, it's a large amount.  And besides phone owners, will car owners, smart TV viewers, home automation owners profit directly? And will all of them need a wallet and a Managed Identity Contract, as your whitepaper mentions? I'm genuinely curious. If the general public is going to benefit directly from Databroker DAO, that would make the scope and scale of it all massively different than when the benefits reach no further than data harvesters like Proximus, Volkswagen, Samsung and Google. Could you elaborate on this please?",False

Or at least not anything that is ""personal"" data. It is set up to directly remunerate the actual sensor owners, so the scale is indeed as you describe, immense.
