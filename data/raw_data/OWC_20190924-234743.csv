For example; Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum saw their value triple last year, while other altcoins also grew enough to make people earn their fair share of dividends without much effort.  The digital currency industry is enormous, lucrative and very enticing in a general view of things. However, people tend to get enamored with the advantages and potential benefits, often investing large chunks of money without analyzing or even knowing some of the attached risks that come with the activity.  Reality indicates that cryptocurrencies can be very volatile. The same high appreciation can quickly turn into substantial losses as most investors discovered this year when Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies dropped to half the value at one point, causing more than a few people to take their hands to their heads. Experienced traders can analyze the markets and minimize their losses, but the fact remains that the majority of conventional traders cannot prevent these unexpected events.  The ODUWA team noticed the problem and developed a solution; ODUWACOIN, which is a Nextgen cryptocurrency that offers indemnity and covers against the volatility of the cryptocurrencies listed on the platform. The system achieves that by combining blockchain technology and insurance to give investors a way to insure themselves from losses in the always active cryptocurrency market.  Imagine being able to invest in cryptocurrency and sleeping peacefully at night, or watching Bitcoin or altcoin crash in the news and not losing your mind. You can give your family peace of mind, focus on things you love to do, going on vacations and starting up other projects if you know that the crypto investments you have done so far are protected under the rules of the ODUWA decentralized exchange platform.  The attractiveness of trading cryptocurrencies and the associated risks  The interest of investors in cryptocurrencies is at an all-time high right now. As more people start to consider coin investments as a lucrative opportunity to make money, there are also many who are put-off by the pitfalls involved.  Issues like high uncertainty and cryptocurrency volatility are preventing investors from taking the leap and entering the market. However, things are starting to change with the rise of ODUWA, which is a revolutionary platform where investments on approved coins inside their Exchange will be 100% Insured against depreciation, protecting investors against some of the risks.  Another reason why people can be afraid of trading digital assets is that there are lots of worthless coins are out on the market, so they don’t know which one to trust. That is why ODUWA will approve only four reliable cryptocurrencies against volatility at the beginning and continue to add more as the platform expands.  The financial experts behind ODUWA understand investors’ concerns that investing in cryptocurrency is an enterprise with high risk considering its digital nature that is always prone to hackers, the volatility and high uncertainty within the coin market. Users don’t want to risk their resources, so they often look for a secure alternative that provides a stable floor and a high ceiling when it comes to potential profit.  ODUWA aims to counter those problems through an intelligent solution, which involves selecting coins to insure, keeping a proportional reserve to the invested amount, and automated smart contracts to provide reliability and trustworthiness.  It is not difficult to see the appeal of cryptocurrency investment. Amazingly, in 2017, the market with Bitcoin went from $830 to $19,300 and now lingers around $8,000, so apparently, there is money to be made. The pull of achieving financial freedom when an ICO portfolio skyrockets have investors worldwide salivating, but there are real risks involved, which are big enough to hold investors back. But fear no more: ODUWA is in the house.  ODUWA: a risk-palliative network     ODUWA is nothing more than a decentralized exchange platform in a similar mold of Coinbase, Bittrex, and HitBtc, just to name a few; with an option for asset protection within the exchange for investors on a contractual term using smarts contracts.  ODUWA protects cryptocurrency Investors with Insurance volatility and asset safety solutions, making it the perfect setting for both beginners and advanced users of digital currencies who are afraid of some of the risk pertaining crypto trading.  With a revolutionary solution like ODUWA’s, users will experience little to no risk of losing money with absolute protection in the face value of their principal investment. The ODUWA solution will play a significant role in stabilizing the market and creating a new trust economy.  The ODUWACOIN platform includes the ODUWA encrypt feature, one that provides Nextgen security for digital assets and an inbuilt exchange where trading ODUWACOINS is free. The ODUWATEAM achieves that by providing smart contract indemnity once users insure coins on the platform.  People do not have to pay anything when their cryptocurrency assets are depreciating. However, the system will ask them to pay a small fee when their cryptocurrency securities and assets are doing well, as a small token of appreciation!  The company is working on a beta version of their core software, and it is actively being tested. The ODUWA encrypt application will be a multiplatform solution that enables users to connect and make VoIP calls using any device (desktop or Android SIP, Zoiper, 3CXPhone, X-Lite and more), and gain access to their PBX via Telegram, Facebook Messenger, and other apps.  Without a doubt, ODUWACOIN is revolutionary in numerous aspects of the decentralized exchange. You can join the ODUWA community by investing in their ICO or by entering their referral or bounty programs.  The ODUWA token (OWC)  To interact with the same ecosystem, people will be able to acquire their ODUWA tokens (OWC,) and they will become immediately available upon purchase and will be deployed through Ethereum. The ODUWA company has announced that they will not create any additional token during or after the crowd sale.  ODUWA tokens will be tradable on various notable exchanges around the world, and since ODUWA is the exchange, you can trade the associated coin on the existing platform with no extra fees.  ODUWA coin holders can gain several benefits, including added protection for their network portfolio against volatility, easy liquidation with ODUWAPAY debit card, and no Inflation, among others.  Token sale  After the platform was successfully funded, the development began, and it is now expected to be live and go on the exchange in May 2018. ODUWA tokens are currently available only for 21 cents a token and will be tradeable in the secondary market known as the exchanges, for those who can buy now for 50,000.00 dollars and above, their tokens will be delivered at 15 cents each until April 5th.  ODUWA final stage Initial Coin Offering (ICO) will scale to .90 cents starting April 5th, 2018 until May 5th, 2018 with supporting bonuses and discounts for the growing ODUWA community because there is no inflation.  During the ICO, a total of 21,000 000.00 OWC tokens will be offered to the purchasers. The crowdsale will continue until the end of the time frame, or the project receives 3,150 000.00 USD  Start: Feb 8, 2018 (9:00AM GMT)  Number of tokens for sale: 16,930,081 (9%)  End: April 05, 2018 (11:00AM GMT)  Tokens exchange rate: 1 token = 0.21 USD 10% Discount  Acceptable currencies: ETH, BTC  Minimal transaction amount: 0.10 ETH  Distribution of tokens:  57%: Core phase of the token sale  12%: Project team  10%: Bonus fund  8%: Tokens presale (Round 2)  6%: Partners and advisors  5%: Tokens presale (Round 1)  2%: Bounties  Use of proceeds:  53%: Branding and marketing  29%: Gift code inventory  12%: IT infrastructure  4%: Legal and financial overhead  2%: Bounty and overhead  In conclusion, ODUWA is a decentralized blockchain organic wealth building community, an exchange platform with asset protection options designed with full security, complete decentralization, with a focus on protecting investors’ money.  If you are a beginner in the cryptocurrency trading world and want to get your feet wet, using a decentralized exchange platform like the ODUWA network is a recommended first step. It can guarantee that most of your investment is protected against unexpected falls in value, and all you have to do is show your appreciation when things are going smoothly with a small contribution to the system.",False
