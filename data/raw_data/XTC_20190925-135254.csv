Since the dev team decided to be anonymous, then, the team needs to prove themselves that they will not disappear after the ICO. That's one of the concerns of most investors. So you need to convince them that this is a long-term project. Though you didn't meet the target of 300k$ in your pre-sale stage, still 264k+$ is not bad at all to start your project.

StakingCoin is a peer-to-peer, community driven decentralised cryptocurrency that allows lenders to store and invest their wealth in a non-government controlled currency, and even earn a substantial interest on investment and also enables individuals take loans with collateral and low interest rates, you can get loans without the usual credit rating/immigration/residency discrimination faced when you try to take loans from the centralised banking system. Also with our unique staking platform, you can stake your XTC coins for profits of up to 100% per year, one of the highest staking returns in the cryptocurrency space. You will be in complete control of your coins at all times and we will reward you for helping to stabilise the network. This means any person that holds Staking Coin in their wallet will receive interest on their balance of up to 100% a year.    Users can lend their XTC coins to the credits platform for rewards of up to 15% per month, the highest in the industry.   THE SYSTEM The Staking Coin Network defines a set of rules for the integration of several agents participating in the credit lifetime, allowing connections between lenders and borrowers located anywhere in the world, regardless of currency.  The protocol that we propose seeks to provide an objective measure of the credit risk assumed by the lenders, diminish that risk or even neutralize it totally and, in case of default, it provides an alternative mechanism for managing the debt collection in the borrower’s country of residence decreasing losses throughout the network.  By making use of blockchain technology and including a special agent called ""Cosigner"", XTC Network manages to reduce the traditional banking brokerage costs and management fees, allowing better conditions for both sides, lenders and borrowers, with the consequent significant improvement in financial inclusion.   Do you wish you could secure your future with financial stability in a safe way? Are you tired of centralised banking and the misleading promises of third party lenders/Banks doing what they want with your money? This is not just an investment tool; it is the investment tool you need to jump start your financial security!
