""Carrier onboarding is a time-intensive process. It involves validating the carrier’s driver records to ensure they maintain a strong safety rating, as well as verifying insurance coverage and confirming their ability to meet service level requirements. Traditionally, shippers and freight brokers have employed entire teams dedicated to validating carriers and managing information within a database. This redundancy and waste of resources can be solved by the blockchain’s ability to validate driver information, store and share records, and continuously update important metrics like driver and carrier safety scores, on-time delivery, number of hours driven, and more. As the data network grows within the LaneAxis transportation ecosystem, we believe that the carrier ratings accessible on the blockchain will be as reliable, if not more so, than the credit rating score system consumers are accustomed to today. Just as businesses and lenders rely on credit scores to determine a customer’s creditworthiness, shippers will be able to rely with confidence on the carrier ratings listed on the LaneAxis ledger, which in turn will justify the rates a carrier is charging. The ledger’s immutable smart contract data will produce standards and insights for an industry comprised of more than 700,000 trucking companies. This type of matrix simply does not exist today.
