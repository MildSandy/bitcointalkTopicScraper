Oliver Bussmann, former CIO of UBS and SAP as well as President of the Crypto Valley Association (association that promotes development of Zug, Switzerland as a blockchain and crypto hub – Crypto Valley Association partners include KPMG and ConsenSys) Michael Guzik, ICO Lead for Lykke and former Head of Blockchain & Manager of Digital Strategy at PwC Verdict Though Smart Containers is a proven company, the need for an ICO is vague, especially for its utility token LOGI, and LOGI CHAIN is yet to be developed. These factors along with other risks (discussed below) make this an investment that requires proper due diligence. Risks SMARC is definitely a security token since it grants token holders the right to dividends from Smart Containers’ profits. In its ICO FAQ, the company says that SMARC are not categorized as security tokens under Swiss law, but investors should be careful. -1 LOGI CHAIN yet to be built. -0.5 Very small amount of tokens available to public compared to private and pre-sale investors. -0.4 Information on lock-ups or vesting vague at best (see “What is the vesting schedule for Team and Advisors token?”), -0.4 No max contribution information. This along with heavy token distribution to pre-sale and private investors is worrying. -0.4 Smart Containers whitepaper light on details about LOGI token utility and focuses a lot on the company’s accomplishments thus far, making it seem like a push for non-equity fundraising via the sale of SMARC tokens in an ICO. -0.2 Competitors like VeChain, Walton, WaBi, etc. working on blockchain integration into supply chain scenarios and in the case of VeChain, have much more significant presence and partnerships (e.g. being incubated by PwC) already established. -0.2 Growth Potential Through SkyCell, the company is well-established, operational, and has revenues. In the Smart Containers whitepaper, the team claims customers like Roche, Takada, and Novartis. +3.5 Skycell is partnered with large carriers like Cargolux and Emirates, already giving it an in in the industry. +2 Even if the ICO is mostly for fundraising via SMARC tokens, if the tokens really give token holders the right to dividends, investing in them could prove profitable if the company does well, which is very possible considering its past and present performance as one of the leaders in the container industry. +3.5 Disposition Although the need for LOGI utility token isn’t clear, and the LOGI CHAIN blockchain solution has yet to be developed, investing in SMARC tokens could prove profitable for investors that want to benefit from the dividends of a leading container providing company.

It is already successful company. WHO & WEF estimate that 40% of all vaccines delivered worldwide are ineffective, since they have been transported in the wrong way. These products break down or even become harmful if the required temperature level is not maintained. Unfortunately, with medicine, it is more complex than with food: when medicine is “broken” it doesn’t change color or smell badly. Therefore it is very important to track the temperature along all the supply chain.  When it comes to food, we maintain the food transport conditions more accurately than any other player, resulting in better food quality and fresher produce. We manage to do this in a more sustainable way than any other provider, because our containers are made of recycled material and are lighter than other vessels. In this way we manage to reduce our CO2 footprint bi 50%.  The blockchain application LOGI Chain will help us to create a more seamless, fully integrated logistics process, which will drive down our shipping costs significantly. It will automate the whole shipping process, which today is highly driven by manual intervention. Through smart contracts we will invoice shippings automatically in cryptocurrencies. This will create a new logistic ecosystem that will ultimately be joined by every player in the market and disrupt the logistics industry.",False

Smart Containers has 2 applications - pharma through the brand SkyCell (currently number 4 player in the industry worldwide) and food through FoodGuardians (recently started). SkyCell’s fleet of containers is tested by 12/20 TOP pharma companies as the safest in the world. Furthermore SkyCell has a key partnership with 2 leading airlines in pharma logistics - Emirates and Cargolux as partners and works with the Top 5 Freight forwarders in pharma (DHL, K+N, Agility, Unitrans, Fedex etc.) Existing Clients are Roche, Takeda, Grifold, Novartis, GSK, etc. - take a look at the executive summary of the White Paper as well please.   The blockchain application LOGI Chain will help us to create a more seamless, fully integrated logistics process, which will drive down our shipping costs significantly. It will automate the whole shipping process, which today is highly driven by manual intervention. Through smart contracts we will invoice shippings automatically in cryptocurrencies. This will create a new logistic ecosystem that will ultimately be joined by every player in the market and disrupt the logistics industry.  Face a decentralised business with a decentralized technology. The blockchain helps to reduce the energy to track containers and invoice them massively - so cost reduction.  I don't know about the Envion, but Smart Containers Group is an established company which is already operational and generating revenues. Most other ICO‘sonly have an idea and a whitepaper. Smart Containers Group is a highly attractive Swiss high-tech company, financed by investments from high net worth individuals and family offices.",False

When empty SkyCell containers are repositioned its on dry trucks or ship containers. Our skycell containers are developed for airfreight, but some customers use them on trucks or sea freight containers on distances shorter 7 days.  As Smart Containers has a running business - there is an underlying value - dividends. So there is a downside protection, whereas with other tokens, which still have to develop something, will be more volatile and will not generate any returns except when bought / sold on exchanges. SkyCell has become the 4th largest player in the B2B global pharmaceutical transport market in only five years. SkyCell is recognized as the safest system on the market and offers its clients 20% total cost reductions.

We share this space with a number of like-minded actors and believers in the potential of IoT and blockchain, which have the potential to revolutionize the logistics industry. Many projects, including our friends at Modum, are carrying out innovative and effective work to recognize the true potential of blockchain and have effectively built upon successful ICOs to produce real results. While we have not established a formal partnership with Modum, we are excited to see the benefits which all actors within the space can accrue through collaboration, consultation, and coordination with one another’s efforts. This is only the beginning, and we are excited for what tomorrow will bring.”  Smart Containers Group is a Swiss high-tech container provider aiming to create the first fully autonomous container based on blockchain technology, consequently disrupting the logistics industry.

First of all, it should be noted that Smart Containers already have a running business with their hardware, we are simply trying to marry the blockchain with the hardware.  1. Our patented hardware has about a 0.1% temperature deviation. The market average is 8.5%, making our hardware more than 75x better than the industrial norm. 2. We are already recognized as the safest system in the market. 3. Finally, with the new venture into blockchain, we can decentralize many aspects of logistics. For example, around a hundred or more e-mails can be required in order to conduct one shipment. By automating the documentation through the blockchain, we believe that many tens of man hours can be saved per shipment which will in turn save a lot of money for companies. 4. Transparency. The IoT sensors within the containers will provide real-time information on key information such as temperature.  I hope that helps!",False

All on the blockchain. We are preparing an ICO.  »»»»»» Fully running business applications «««««« »»»»»» Nr. 4 in the field after only 5 years «««««« »»»»»» Scaling of existing business by ICO ««««««    Smart Containers Group is a Swiss high-tech container provider aiming to create the first fully autonomous container based on blockchain technology, consequently disrupting the logistic industry.  Blockchain-based software and an IoT infrastructure is the core of Smart Containers Group strong technological ground, enabling to track and monitor each container around the world and making Smart Containers Group the largest provider of IoT airfreight containers on the market.  The combination of hardware, software and service enables Smart Containers Group to assertively position its division company SkyCell among the top four providers of pharma containers in the industry. Through the FoodGuardians division, the next generation of reusable containers and boxes to transport temperature sensitive food products will be offered regionally and globally, preserving the product’s freshness and traceability. Using blockchain as transformative technology in logistics, Smart Containers Group is driven by the opportunity to create the LOGI CHAIN, a fully integrated, seamless logistic ecosystem that will be accessible to all industry players at minimal cost. Therefore, Smart Containers Group will lead the way towards a more efficient, client-centric and cost-effective industry standard.   SMARC ICO  The SMARC token (SMARC) is a profit share token: 20% of future dividends and exit profits will be paid out to token holders. It is upon the Board of Directors of Smart Containers Group to make a proposal on how much dividends will be attributed year by year. Subsequently the General Assembly of Smart Containers Group approves or rejects the dividend plan. A payment equivalent to 20% of this amount is converted to Ether and sent to the SMARC token smart contract. The SMARC token smart contract evaluates the current holdings and dis- tributes the profits to the token holders in Ether.  In the event of an exit of one of the sub divisions, the same process as described above applies. The maximum total supply is 150 M tokens. 120 M tokens (80%) are offered in the initial coin offering, while the rest is used to cover the ICO costs and align interest of the Smart Containers Management. The hard cap for the ICO is USD 36 M. The price per token is fixed at USD 0.432.  Pre-Sale  Token pre-sale is private and will be conducted on invitation only. The pre-sale starts in April and comes with a 25% discount. The number of tokens sold at 25% discount is hard capped at 49.3 M tokens (=41%), raising USD 16 M.  Public Sale  The public token sale starts in May. 12.8 M tokens are sold during the public sale, raising USD 5 M. The first tier is sold with a discount of 15%. The second tier is discounted by 10% and the third tier comes at a discount of 5%. Oversubscriptions of a bonus tier get allocated to the following tier. The estimated current bonus tier is visible on the website (www.smartcontainers.ch). The displayed amount may change due to changing exchange rates and is therefore indicative. Final bonus tier and token allocation is done post transaction. Oversubscriptions of the whole ICO are returned to the investors after the closing of the sale.  Private Sale  The rest of the SMARC tokens are offered in a private sale to institutional investors.
