I don’t see it why it can’t just be a database?  Cherie Kloss: Our credentialing system  for my other business (a large nurse agency called SnapNurse) is currently off chain, and it gets unlocked with a Dropbox that the admin uses to open with an email and password. I guess you can think of it as an electronic version of a manila folder with pdf’s in it but on a database. We want to improve that offchain system by placing it on a distributed database but also keeping record via a hash connected to the open blockchain which would record when the data was last accessed, what was changed, which hospitals used this database to credential a nurse and for peer to peer reviews to give the credentialing package a more trusted factor that the current“Dropbox” system is not optimized to do. In addition, the current system would not allow for a nurse to take that automated approved folder system to another hospital and all the same verifications would have to be done over and over again. By establishing a gold standard of credentialing by which top organizations have approved and vouched for (and are rewarded for approving) which has an automated trigger for when things have expired or the packet is not longer valid, we create a more organized portable system where the credentialing standard can be trusted more than a manila folder or Dropbox of pdf’s which were approved and verified by just one source. The more sources that have verified the nurse, the more trusted her credentials are and therefore the need to do some of the same processes over and over again, becomes obsolete and a nurse can get verified much quicker. It’s an improvement over the current credentialing companies who do somewhat of the same things but off chain...the business model already exists, we are just securing and using multiple verifiers instead of just one, to create a more trusted set of credentials that a nurse can take place to place and own it, decentralizing the data. In a way, it ends up possibly making my current business become obsolete when widespread adoption occurs because this approved and verified packet can someday replace nurse agencies. It can also be accessed for consumers who want a nurse to help in their home or for telemedicine. Its portability and multiple verified system is what give this a much more upgraded system from what currently exists.  Hope that answers your question. I’m writing this on the fly because I don’t want the thread to go down much further without answering your question. Currently the credentialing systems off chain are charging nurses on average about $130 a year to keep the credentials updated if they want to take that from place to place. Just FYI.",False

Hospitals are doing what they can, but the current solution is clunky, slow, and expensive. Essentially, they’re forced to pay expensive staffing agencies for contractor nurses. But because these agencies take such a massive cut, hospitals end up paying more, and nurses get paid less.     “Hospitals nationwide... are paying billions of dollars collectively to recruit and retain nurses.” - Reuters, “Short on staff: Nursing crisis strains U.S. hospitals.”  Nursing is already an incredibly grueling job though. This decrease in pay is deterring capable people from becoming nurses. But our world desperately needs nurses. Patients are already dying from the shortage. It’s only a matter of time until an epidemic shows us how critical this issue is.             Because hospitals do not share information or nurse hiring practices, nurses must get new credentials for each hospital they wish to work at.   ''But because the process is so arduous, it can take up to 3 months for nurses to gain credentials at hospitals that desperately need their help.''  If a nurse then wishes to help another hospital in need, he or she will have to go through the process all over again to work there. There’s a shortage of nurses. And bureaucracy is rubbing salt on this open wound.               Portable, trusted, and instantly-verifiable credentials via blockchain. Here’s how:                                1. With NurseToken, nurses will go through a rigorous credentialing process that any hospital would approve of - with flying colors.                                 2. These credentials would then be stored in their own blockchain wallet.                                   3. To pick up shifts at a hospital in need - nurses would simply show their credentials, and just like that, they’re in.    No more 3-months-long process per hospital. Now, nurses get credentialed once, and can work anywhere, at any time.            For example...                                               1. Let’s say Nurse A completes a shift at Hospital A and receives rave reviews from patients and other hospital staff.                                                   2. Hospital A wants to do whatever they can to get Nurse A to come back.                                                 3. NurseToken makes this easy. Hospital A simply sends Nurse A a ”bonus” in NurseToken, delivered straight to the same blockchain wallet she stores her credentials in.       The result? Nurses receive powerful incentives to pick up more shifts... and these incentives make nursing far more attractive to the current and next generations of our world.                            ++The Team++                     ++Roadmap++       ++TOKENSALE-ICO++  Crowdsale Details  Offering Details: Soft Cap, Hard Cap, Token Pricing & Relevant Dates  + Soft Cap: Equivalent of $2M USD.

People around the world are living longer, and of course older people tend to use more healthcare services. In fact, according to the UN, the number of people in the world aged 60 or older is expected to more than double by 2050, exceeding two billion. In the US another factor is leading to increased demand for healthcare: The Department of Health and Human Services reports that 20 million individuals have gained insurance through the Affordable Care Act.  Little wonder, then, that of the more than 800 different occupations listed by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), registered nurses are projected to have the second-highest job growth over the next ten years. When you look solely at occupations that require a bachelor’s degree, registered nurses take the number 1 spot. Today there are nearly 3 million nurses employed in the US and 439,300 more positions are expected by 2024, a 16% increase from 2014.  This strong demand is reflected in Indeed data: Jobs for registered nurses make up 8.4% of all postings on Indeed in the US; more than 3% in the UK; and more than 1% each in Australia, Canada and Germany. The staffing industry plays a significant role in meeting this demand for nursing talent: healthcare jobs account for 36% of staffing firm postings on Indeed.

I mean there is a big recruitment challenge and 17.5% of newly RN's leave their job within the first year...could Nursetoken also play a role in this part?  Cherie Kloss: What we are doing is maximizing the work force and decreasing times to onboarding as well as increasing incentives for more nurses to enter the field as well as for current nurses to work more. While that does not solve the shortage in one year, over time, it does help the system gain equilibrium. More students will be attracted to the field because nursing will have the opportunity to achieve real wealth with portability and incentives. Will it benefit the individual hospital? Well, we can’t look at that because hospitals have to compete for nurses no matter what, and rightly so, the more in-demand the nurses are; the more the salaries go up, and the more attractive the field becomes. Also the more portable they are- the more they can maximize their income. So yes, in a long term sense, creating portability and incentives will solve the global nursing crisis. We have to start somewhere and right now, no one is doing much. In fact, the Georgia legislature wrote  into a referendum three years ago to make changes to attract nurses and utilize the current nursing workforce to its maximum or else they would see a dire shortage. Well they did nothing, and now GA is at crisis levels. GA did recently join (in January) the Compact State Licensure which allows nurses with GA licenses to travel to 25 states using the same GA license. While that may seem strange and counterintuitive to share their nurses, they did that so they could also benefit from other nurses from other states to come work in GA without having to do a rigorous new state license which can take months. So as you see, the movement for portability is already happening and we are taking hold of the opportunity and running with it so we become the gold standard.",False
