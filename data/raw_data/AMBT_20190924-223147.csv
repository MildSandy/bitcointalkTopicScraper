It costs $2835 to mine a bitcoin in Kazakhstan according to the Elite Fixtures data. Bitcoin right now is $3250. We are not getting ANY dividends because there are no dividends. That $2835 doesn't include the cost of overhead, heating, rental, salaries. I suspect Ambit is operating at, or close to a loss right now and will probably go out of business. Fortunately for me I only put some bitcoin(I think I paid around .03 bitcoin at the time worth $96 now) from what I mined(so free) into 1000 tokens so it's not problem for me as I mine at home and the difficulty is dropping like crazy so I make up for it. But if you dumped a shitload of money into Ambit I hate to tell you you're probably not getting it back or going to see any profit sharing as there is no profit. They only way these guys can make a profit, is if they move their operation to Venezuela ($531 per bitcoin) or maybe Ukraine ($1852). These costs to generate a bitcoin is electricity only, not overhead like rent, security, salaries. The reason they are not releasing their tokens is it will dump the first day to nothing and they won't have an operation anymore. I don't think they purposely are trying to fuck us over, it's just the market. Their ""Bear"" worst case scenario was bitcoin at $7000 US, more than double the price of bitcoin now. I have a feeling bitcoin will probably bottom out around the $2000-$1500 level going by my experience and history of Bitcoin. That's awesome for us home miners as it actually gets more profitable because the difficulty is dropping like a rock as the big farms(like Ambit) have to shut down, especially since I get free electricity at my apartment. I'm willing to wait a few years and accumulate as much as I can until the start of the next run up which will probably be at the next halfening in May of 2020. If they ever do release their tokens and if by some miracle it gets on an exchange dump it fast, they aren't going to be able to survive the next year or so. Not their fault, just reality.

This to me is cheating… We want to payout real dividends from mining and hosting services, this will be 1 months from now. ICO’s have made promises and not done a single thing, others have delayed for months and years, this is what happened to US, you seeing the overall market and its obvious that doesnt look great and please take everything into consideration and give us little more time.

From page 17 of the whitepaper (which you can find here https://ambitmining.io/doc/Ambit-WhitePaper.pdf ) :  RISKS See below for some of the risks inherent in cryptocurrencies and ICOs in general.  The risk of failure to fund the project is present. We will fully refund all token holders to their payment wallet addresses, less transaction fees, should this unlikely event occur.  The Ambit Mining Token (AMBT) may be influenced by market trends once listed on the exchanges. The value of AMBT may be influenced by events out of control of the cryptosphere, including fraud, legislative changes, tax treatment changes, new disruptive technologies and organized crime.  AMTB may not ever be tradale on the exchanges.  The mining software may not meet expectations.  There are many points of failure in this program innovation process.  Changes in mining difficulty may squeeze profit margins into insignificance after costs.   Construction timeline specified in the whitepaper is based on the reasonable estimates, but it is not guaranteed.  Alternative technologies may be developed that negate the need for cryptomining and related services. This is one of the strengths of Ambit Mining, because if one product line fails for unforeseen events, then the revenue from hosting services is still available for the organization use as a source of income.   Cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile, AMBT may suffer from these severe pricing changes. Most of the ICO funds will be spent immediately on mining hardware, so this risk does still exist for some of the funds held in cryptocurrencies produced by mining activities and not yet distributed as profit share.  Tokens may in future fall under as yet undefined tax law changes, which could significantly affect the efficiency of this type of token.  The Tokens could also face the risk of limited or no liquidity in the market. Should this happen you will not be able to sell your tokens on the exchanges.  Breakthroughs in the field of cryptographic technology could destabilize the whole industry. An example of this would be the use of quantum computers to mine Proof-of Work coins and therefore mine all available coin resources in a very short space of time. However, should this happen, the traditional banking system would be equally adversely affected.  There are no guarantees that the Tokens will increase in value; volatility in the crypto exchanges mean that the price of this Token might, at some point in the future, come down.  It is possible that the organization will fail to launch or if launched, will fail to meet profitability targets set out in the Business Model document.  Ambit Mining performance may be interrupted, suspended or delayed due to force majeure circumstances. For the purposes of this White Paper, force  majeure shall mean extraordinary events and circumstances which could not be prevented by Ambit Mining and shall include: acts of nature, wars, armed conflicts, mass civil disorders, industrial actions, epidemics, lockouts, slowdowns, prolonged shortage or other failures of energy supplies or communication service, acts of municipal, state or federal governmental agencies, other circumstances beyond Ambit Mining’s control, which were not in existence at the time of Token Launch.",False

Ambit Mining has a track record and experience in running a successful mining operation. We have already constructed 1 MW diversified mining facility in Tbilisi Free Economic Zone and 5 MW hosting facility, which has achieved 100% ROI in just 5 months. Building on this successful project, Ambit now aims to scale its operation to 20 MW and invites mining enthusiasts to join our mining family. Our experience in this field helped us to secure partnerships with the leading hardware manufacturers and companies that will allow us to run a successful and profitable mining operation.

What benefit can I have in your project? Quote from: upisdown on May 21, 2018, 05:20:06 AM So what is the practical benefit of holding tokens? Or is it just a tool to calculate the initial investment? Quote from: pat231 on May 21, 2018, 02:12:42 PM what are the benefits of owning your token? does it mean i become a shareholder in some sense? I'm not sure as I'm understanding it right from the White Paper. All token holders will receive bi-weekly dividends: 85% of the net profits from the mining operation and 85% of the net profits from hosting services. (In accordance with the rules as setting up in the Smart contract). Dividends will be calculated and paid on bi-weekly basis in cryptocurrency. The size of the dividend will be determined in a pro-rata share of the tokens held by token holders during a full cycle before the dividend declaration. (for example, if a user held 100 tokens in the beginning of the cycle, and sold 30 during the cycle, dividend will be allocated for the remaining 70 tokens which were held during the full duration of the dividend cycle) A portion of the profits from the mining (30%) will be bootstrapped into further development and innovation of our equipment, in order to maintain profitability with the constantly increasing difficulties in mining. All the information regarding the upgrade of the equipment as well as other related development costs will be fully transparent and available to the token holders, to ensure the credibility and transparency of the project.

What does it mean?  From the whitepaper: Ambit Mining contributors will receive Ethereum based AMBT Tokens that represent their share in Ambit Mining. These tokens will entitle the holders to the profit share from the Ambit Mining operation. 85% of the net profit will be available for token holders (Total Mining Yield), out of this 85%, 75% will be distributed as dividends, the remaining 25% will be reinvested to improve and upgrade our mining infrastructure, in order to match the increasing mining difficulty and maintain the same ROI over the years. If the cost of the actual reinvestment is less than 25%, then the remaining funds will be distributed as dividends as well.

Quote from: Jordan Siyo on May 19, 2018, 12:32:19 PM I don't get the purpose of your smart contract. What makes this project different between other similar projects?  so there are few things: 1. We have experience in mining, we have successfully completed 2 projects that are fully operational and have achieved 100% on roi in 5 months. Can’t say the same about the competition 2. We are located in Tbilisi free zone, which means we are exempt from taxes, such as income tax, corporate tax, and most importantly VAT. So that gives us around 20% saving on our hardware purchases which means more miners which means more profitability. i don't like to talk about competition as I am not fully aware of their projects but you can do your own research what is the VAT in other countries. As for IRM there has been lot of negative news coming from KZ about them planning to ban mining, again do your own research. 3. Electricity cost, we have electricity at 5cents per kW/h, which is very competitive price across the world and it’s on paper. MIO has 6.5 euro cent, IRM i’m not sure. 4. We are doing our due diligence, we are a resposnible company that understands that we are a security, so to be compliant with SEC we are not accepting any US investors and do KYC on all our customers. IRM as far as i know doesn’t do KYC at all (which in my opinion is going to get them in lot of issues when they try to deal with banks) and MIO does KYC only on BTC (again i might be wrong) 5. We are not promising outrageous returns on investment compared to the above mentioned competitors (especially IRM which promises 350% ROI or something along these lines) 6. We are a diversified operation, meaning that we will be mining not only BTC but altcoins as well which minimizes the risk attached to one coin. Both IRM and MIO are only mining BTC 7. We are also offering hosting services as another option to diversify the risk to our token holders, as hosting provides a stable income despite the price on the market",False

And I mean to receive the dividends they must be on your platform not on the exchanges, right? You'll be able somehow to track them?  To receive dividends you must keep the tokens on your personal wallet, a smart contract will handle the process when dividends are due. If you keep the tokens on an exchange, you do not get the dividend.   Anyway it might be, there must be an easy way to trade them.  On exchanges. We are in talks with several now. We cannot name them due to NDA.   Also I see in your Roadmap, February 2018 1MGW farm 100% ROI. Can you provide any kind of proof of that? Like some mining history.  Check out the channel. Which contains all kinds of walkthroughs of both facilities, as well as spreadsheet episodes: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqzel0d35Olk-E7s-XaumUw   And I ask you this because on Genesys or HashFlare is pretty easy to calculate your profits, there you know exactly what you mine so..  It shows what you will mine in that moment, but mining always faces changes, and has to adapt to them.   By the way, personally I think this is a great project, me and a few friends want to take part in this, but as many of us here, we want any kind of info we can get.

All token holders will receive bi-weekly dividends: 85% of the net profits from the mining operation (including the existing farm), and 85% of the net profits from hosting services. (In accordance with the rules as setting up in the Smart contract). Dividends will be calculated and paid on bi-weekly basis in cryptocurrency. The size of the dividend will be determined in a pro-rata share of the tokens held by token holders during a full cycle before the dividend declaration. (for example, if a user held 100 tokens in the beginning of the cycle, and sold 30 during the cycle, dividend will be allocated for the remaining 70 tokens which were held during the full duration of the dividend cycle) A portion of the profits from the mining (30%) will be bootstrapped into further development and innovation of our equipment, in order to maintain profitability with the constantly increasing difficulties in mining. All the information regarding the upgrade of the equipment as well as other related development costs will be fully transparent and available to the token holders, to ensure the credibility and transparency of the project.

Ambit mining is the only ICO with the existing mining infrastructure, experience and proven track record. All this is reflected on “Ambit Mining” youtube channel. The company is located in Georgia, Tbilisi Free economic zone, which gives various benefits such as, cheap green electricity of 5 cents, no tax or VAT, and favorable government regulations. It partners with major mining hardware and cooling system manufacturers, farther decreasing consumption of electricity. Our main value is transparency and experience. Every variable related to the mining operation will be disclosed to the token holders, each token holder will have voting right to influence important business decisions.  Green Electricity All our mining units are powered by 100% renewable hydro energy ensuring cheap and clean electricity supply at only 5 cents per kW/h.  Location Our farm is located in Georgia, one of the most crypto friendly countries in the world, with abundant green electricity and favorable government legislation.  Experience Ambit mining has already constructed 1 MW diversified farm in Georgia, which generated over 1.3 mln profit per year, with these experience we aim to further expand our operations and to share the profits with the community.  Tax-Free The mining farm is located in Tbilisi Free Zone, which is a tax-free area in Georgia. Meaning that operation will be exempt from a majority of licenses, taxes and will benefit from simplified procedures.  Technology Ambit mining has partnerships with major chip manufacturers, as well as listed company Schneider Electric which will provide cooling and wiring solutions to ensure cost-efficient operation and to maximize the profits from the mining operation.  Transparency Ambit Mining will establish itself as one of the leading mining operations in terms of disclosure and transparency. Every variable related to the mining operation will be disclosed to the token holders These variables include the following:  Mining equipment Transparency ● Make Model and Serial Numbers of the units for all mining rigs. ● Full disclosure of what units are removed or changed due to technical repairs or any malfunction or reduced mining capacity. ● Full disclosure on energy usage of the mine on a monthly basis.  Mining Return Transparency ● Daily mining returns to ensure complete revenue disclosure. ● Full daily stats pertaining to the mined blocks found and pool luck. ● Full monthly breakdown of expenses. ● Daily breakdown of the total hashing power of the mine – Including the average hashing rate for each miner for that particular day.  A full development cycle will commence building our enhanced Mine Dashboard, Blockchain API, and management software. The Mine will be connected to the user interface dashboard through the API. The Mine will submit real-time data to our portal, which will collect all information from The Mine and display data to our token holders. This data will include daily mining stats, daily mining returns, daily blocks found, and all other data pertaining to the operation of the Mine. All the information submitted can be verified. This process allows for the creation a fully transparent mining operation safeguarding your profit share. Token holders will submit their payout addresses in their Ambit Mining portal allowing bi-weekly profit share to be paid directly to their ETH wallets.  Profit Overall even with quite reserved assumptions of cryptocurrencies the mining farm provides an opportunity to invest in a high return on investment project. What’s more important is the fact that this is an already existing business model and the dividend payout start from the first month of ICO completion. And by the end of 1 full year of operations provides 171% ROI to the token holders, assuming the growth in popularity of the cryptocurrencies and the previous trends where every year the price of BTC has at least doubled, it’s a fair assumption that mining returns might be even higher than we expect.",False

I would appreciate it if you at least 'assume' 2% increase in difficulties every 2 weeks... Rather than assuming its the same for 5 years    All in all, it looks like a VERY promising ICO... Will keep an eye on it.",False

If the actual reinvestment is less than 25% the remainder funds will also be distributed as dividends. We are updating that section in the whitepaper to make it more clear.",False
