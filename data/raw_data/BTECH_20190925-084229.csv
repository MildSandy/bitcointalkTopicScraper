On the example of the data center under construction in Russia. 1. Security. For security, an agreement with a local security company will be concluded, as well as a video surveillance system inside and outside the building. Indoors installed fire-fighting system. 2. Electrification. When choosing the location of the data center, the decisive role is played by the availability of the necessary free capacities. In the Irkutsk region, Russia, there is a large reserve of power, more than 200MW. At the same time, the cost per kW does not exceed $0.07. 3. Cooling. Together with the engineers of the company IGC, was developed the ventilation system of each data center, the system allows maintaining a comfortable environment with a sufficiently low noise level.
