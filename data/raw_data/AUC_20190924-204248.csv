You’re just starting to earn income and entering adulthood, so obviously the last thing on your mind is exiting the workforce.  The importance of investing for my future became clear to me when I started to be honest with myself. It was apparent that the likeliness of me becoming extremely wealthy in my lifetime was low, but what really hit me is when I realized that no one is coming to save me. There isn’t going to be a $10 million dollar inheritance check waiting for me, and I‘m pretty sure most people will relate.  It became clear that I needed to invest in my future and set goals for myself. I needed to educate myself on what was out there in a forever-evolving market. I needed to know where to invest and how to put my hard-earned money in the assets that I saw fit. I, as well as many others, saw the feasibility of digital assets taking over and could see there was huge potential in this in all of our futures.  This isn’t an article to entice you to start investing for retirement; If you’re reading this then you already know it’s important. What this article will go over is how using the upcoming Auctus platform will give investors full control of their retirement portfolios. https://blog.auctus.org/the-importance-of-alternative-assets-in-a-retirement-portfolio-a7a9fc6770c7",False

Initially, we were not planning a second round.  The bonus is not for new purchases, it is for the people that already participated, including pre-sale investors.  Pre-sale investors will have additional 15% on top of the previous bonus and people that invested between March 27 and March 31 will get the 15%.  The decision of offering this bonus was made because the conversion rate of people with completed KYC that actually participated in the token sale was badly influenced by the bearish market. The token sale period was too short (4 days) and we decided to extend it. To compensate people that already contributed, we decided to use bounty tokens that were not used and would be in the hands of the team.

The market fluctuation that has been going on the last few days will not affect our goal since we still haven't fixed the ETH/USD rate.  We will set the ETH/USD price closer to the ICO and the ICO will only go on for 4 days, so we won't be too exposed to the fluctuation.  People should not be concerned about the market. It is a good opportunity to buy cheap ETH to participate.  We are more worried about keeping the good news coming than about the market going down.

We released a demo for a retirement plan using smart contracts in November 2017 and we started working on strategic partnerships.  Our goals for Q1 2018 were: Strategic Partnerships, Development of Alpha Auctus Platform, and Initial token sale.  In terms of Strategic partnerships, what we have achieved so far is: The strategic partnerships and working collaborations include big companies from the traditional industry (the latest announcement being Prudential Financial) and other successful Ethereum projects, the latest being Bancor (and previously Cofound.it, Ripio Credit Network, among others).  We also joined the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and MAMA (Multichain Asset Management Association, led by Melonport).  Development of the Alpha platform: We released the alpha ahead of time, one month earlier than expected. You can test it at https://platform.auctus.org/ or read more about it on our blog post announcement: https://blog.auctus.org/the-auctus-platform-mvp-is-live-e145543cd7bc  Next step: We are going to have our token sale this month, starting on March 27th.

This project looks like a very good one that has the chance to be massive as they are trying to penetrate a massive market. I used to work for a pensions provider as an analyst and studied actuarial science so this one interests me.  Fees and commissions will be uniquely paid in Auctus Tokens (AUC) - this has potential to be big.  This is what pension fund fees can consist of:  Set up charge While these are unusual now, some providers may charge you an initial fee to set up your pension with them.  Annual management charge The Annual Management Charge, or AMC, is the fee charged by pension schemes for the administration of your investments. This must always be stated upfront by the provider.  Underlying fund charge There may be a fee associated with the management of each fund in your portfolio.  Platform fee In simple terms, the platform is the service that enables investors to buy their investments and there may be a charge for this.  Transaction fee This is usually a set fee per transaction and relates to buying and selling investments. And it is important to remember that there may be a higher price when you buy a fund than when you sell it  Exit fees Some pension providers will charge a fee to withdraw or transfer money to another plan, while others won’t. Historically, these charges could be high, but the regulator has moved to cap exit fees at one per cent.  All these fees, costs and charges add up.  The annual management charge, Policy fees, Bid/offer spread, Fund switches, Allocation rates, Initial units, capital units and accumulation units, Stopping contributions, Transferring your pension pot  If this gets to become adopted on quite a significant scale the token will be worth a fair deal.  I will hopefully get to participate in this ICO.",False

Is it scam or no?    We’re excited to announce an Auctus ICO private sale that will open to ICO Syndicate members this Monday.  Auctus is a Swiss-incorporated blockchain powered startup disrupting the $36.4 trillion pension market. This is the first ICO targeting the retirement industry.  You can learn more about Auctus in the high-level overview PDF here.    Deal terms The terms are significantly better than during the recently finished Auctus pre-sale (which was oversubscribed and raised 240% of the soft cap).  Bonuses and caps:  No maximum contribution per participant 25% bonus for all ICO Syndicate members 30% bonus if you individually invest 30 ETH or more 40% bonus if you individually invest 300 ETH or more (includes a personal call with the founding team) Total hard cap 4500 ETH for the whole syndicate Dates:  Private sale starts on Monday 2017-10-23, 10:00 AM EST. Ends in 72 hours on Wednesday 2017-10-26, 10:00 AM EST. We will contact you on Monday with access information. Security:  The sale will be hosted on the official Auctus.org website on a password-protected page. Smart contract will be provided and operated by the Auctus team (source code preview). The smart contract works the same as the original pre-sale contract. You will get the tokens immediately and they will need to be migrated to the main ICO contract, just like the pre-sale tokens. Auctus will provide instructions on their website. Tokens will be transferable after the main ICO ends on November 28.    Insider info Since the pre-sale, there have been positive internal developments. Auctus signed on with cofound.it - one of the best known cryptocurrency incubators. There are also 2 new senior pension executives joining the advisory board and a Prudential retirement innovation labs partnership in the works.  It was tough to negotiate this deal because the Auctus team is already experiencing strong momentum (they were recently featured on Bloomberg) and didn’t see a strong need to raise private capital before their official ICO.   How to participate If you want to participate in this private sale for a potentially game-changing ICO:  1. Read the high-level overview PDF about Auctus  2. Mark Monday, October 23 10:00 EST in your calendar  3. Prepare ETH you want to invest in a wallet you control (such as MyEtherWallet)  4. Wait for an email from us on Monday with the sale access information  5. Invest before the hard cap of 4500 ETH is reached   If you are investing over 300 ETH and would like to have a phone call with Auctus, let us know to reserve your spot.  Before Monday, there's still time for you to invite your friends or business associates to join the ICO Syndicate so they can get the bonus as well.    If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this email.   Talk to you soon!  The ICO Syndicate Team  Disclaimer: This message is strictly confidential.

Who else from your staff has any relevant expirience in pension fund's managment? Clarify please what exactly is this expirience? 4. Who is responsible for legal issues? 5. Why do you think that existent pension funds will be willing to accept the inconvenience associated with migration to the new platform? How are you going to incentivise them to do so? 6.

Some of the information we will not be able to disclose right now for strategic purposes as well as sometimes contractual reasons. But we'll try to answer your questions as accurate as possible.  Please note that we are not at ICO stage, but pre-sale stage. Our priority right now is to secure financing for all the ICO related expenses. We are aware that several things still need to be disclosed/done prior to the ICO.  1. Who are the founders of Auctus? We consider the team of 12 to be founders. Yes a few had initial talks, but we commonly decided to launch this project.  2. Who is the CEO? We don't have a CEO at this stage. If at some point we feel that it's necessary, we will determine and announce one.  3. Who else from your staff has any relevant experience in pension fund's management? Clarify please what exactly is this experience? From the 12 team members, only Vinicius; and you are right about the length of his employment. However, it's not a junior role he is holding. Rest be assured, that we are being advised by several senior executives (20+ years experience). This being said, pension fund employees with very long tenure, usually are a bit 'company blind'. When Vinicius entered the pension industry, he saw right away what could be improved by blockchain. Of course we cannot run Auctus just with engineers. At this stage a lot of development is necessary, but we are getting industry feedback from several senior mentors. Further down the line we will add more pension fund professionals to the team. We will also announce a proper advisory board prior to the ICO.  4. Who is responsible for legal issues? We are getting legal advice from a Swiss law firm. We will disclose the name as well prior to the ICO as we have an agreement that only kicks in after meeting some pre-sale targets.  5. Why do you think that existent pension funds will be willing to accept the inconvenience associated with migration to the new platform? How are you going to incentivise them to do so? I think you need to distinguish between western, well run pension funds with high end, but expensive pension fund management systems and smaller pension funds for example in emerging markets. We have defined a minimum viable product (MVP) which can improve operations at smaller pension funds right away at a very low cost. We will start to penetrate the market with these smaller ones.  6. Do you have any preliminary agreements with existent pension funds? We have two preliminary agreements with pension funds. They want to see the Demo first before we can officially announce a partnership. We hope to be able to announce a pension fund partnership prior to the ICO.  7. Almost all countries have very strict legal requirements and limitations as to accounting standards for pension funds. Why do you think that local authorities will be willing to control pension funds in other way (by auditing smart contracts)? Our full scale pension fund platform needs a lot of buy in. However, our MVP doesn't. It's a gradual process, not an all at once approach.  8. How are you going to use $27 000 000 of proceeds from ICO? Do you have any cost estimations? The higher the raised funds, the more international we can go. There are significant advantages to deploy fast in as many jurisdictions as possible. As you righteously noticed, it's not an easy process. The MVP is, but if we want to expand our services, we need a lot of buy in from several stakeholders, preferably in as many jurisdictions as possible. We have a cost estimation to be able to run Auctus profitably at USD 5m. In that case we would just start in one or two jurisdictions, but not our prefered strategy.  9. What is the legal status of your company. We are running under a Swiss limited liability company. We might change to a corporation limited by share ownership (Swiss Aktiengesellschaft) in case we choose to give equity ownership to some key partners or investors.",False

I am sorry if I didn't make myself clear in the last post. When I wrote:  Quote from: DuarteFig on October 02, 2017, 09:55:56 PM 1. Who are the founders of Auctus? We consider the team of 12 to be founders. Yes a few had initial talks, but we commonly decided to launch this project.  what I meant regarding the founders of the Auctus Project is that we consider all the members listed in the team section of the website and whitepaper to be founders and these names are disclosed.  We have made the cost estimation to define the minimum cap and hard cap for the ICO. We will present it publicly in details before the ICO that starts in November.  Keep in mind that our ICO is still one and a half month from now, some of the practices you are pointing are in our plan for the ICO, we want some things to be more solid before we announce it, and for the presale some pieces of information were not in the stage where we could officially announce it, as some points are being revised by ""still unofficial"" consultants and advisors.  Between presale and ICO we will launch the demo of the platform and announce the partners and advisory board, and the reason we will give a bonus of 25% for presale supporters is exactly the fact that they are showing support even before we can disclose every information.",False

Thanks for asking. The idea is to offer guaranteed participation for our supporters without the need to rush, spend a lot of gas or anything like that. If someone hears about the project today and join the whitelist, when the sale starts this person will have 72 hours to remember to send his/her contribution.  If our token sale smart contract only limited 10 ETH per different addresses (with no whitelist), one of the things that could happen is that if the sale starts really well some people could decide to create multiple wallets and raise their investment size, and people that are supporting us since the beginning and small investors could be left out.  By creating a whitelist, we make it harder for people to create multiple accounts, we guarantee participation for everyone interested and we can keep track of the number of people subscribing every day.

I can point you some things we are doing to avoid any doubts you have:  Be welcome to check our social media profiles and ask us anything, we take community opinions very seriously and we don't want to hide anything about our background. Before the main ICO, we will release a demo version of our platform in the Ethereum testnet so you can simulate managing your own pension fund using smart contracts. You can track development progress in our github. As described in the whitepaper, the funds raised in the ICO will be locked. At the end of the ICO, if it is successful, we will be able to transfer a maximum of 20% of the funds raised, and the rest will be released monthly to cover our expenses. If the ICO is not successful, you will be able to recover your contribution. 20% of the total supply of the AUC token will belong to the founding team for a long term alignment of interests, and our AUC tokens will also be locked by smart contracts with two years of vesting with six months cliff. The above-mentioned rules about the vesting of our tokens and locking of ETH raised will be coded into the Token Sale smart contract, which we will publish prior to the ICO so it can be audited by anyone. We plan on hiring someone to audit it as disclose the results.  We still haven't found any other initiative to use Ethereum platform and smart contracts to reinvent the pension market. There are probably some other initiatives to take advantage of the blockchain technology to improve pension fund management, as pointed here, but we haven't seen a project that had already started the development as we have.",False

Yes, we have researched before defining our ERC20 token ticker as AUC. There is no record of it in https://etherscan.io/tokens or in https://coinmarketcap.com/, for example.  The contract name defined in the smart contract code is not unique or exclusive, and the ticker used is up to the community (wallets, etherscan, exchanges and users) to decide. Before being listed on an exchange or officially added in Etherscan / MyEtherWallet by their development team, the creators of a token can suggest any ticker they want. We made sure that there wasn't any listed/recognized token with the ticker AUC and we are not worried by anyone claiming they ""own"" it. There is no way of ""claiming"" or ""registering"" it, and we can't change it everytime someone appears claiming ownership of something that can't be officially registered.  We will leave it up to the board moderator to decide if the messages that are not related to our project (floods/attacks) should be deleted and we won't participate in discussions of this kind.  We couldn't find the above mentioned project because until today it didn't have any kind of activity since January, so our token ticker remains AUC.",False

But while we don't publish it, let me tell you some key points of our project and you can decide if you find it interesting:  Business value proposition Our idea is to introduce the world's first pension fund management platform that is based on smart contracts that run on the Ethereum blockchain. Why pension market? For a start, one of our co-founding members (Vinicius) is a certified pension fund investment analyst and works for one of the biggest public pension funds in Brazil, so he brought the idea sharing with the rest of us his knowledge about the problems in this market related to frauds, high administrative costs, bad governance, obsolete technologic solutions and lack of transparency. These problems fit perfectly to what transparent and immutable smart contracts are supposed to solve. Besides, there are over 36 trillion dollars invested in this market, so it would be of great magnitude if we are the ones to revolutionize it using blockchain.  Why does it ""seem everything isn't final yet"" We are doing a lot of things in parallel, such as: creating the website, finishing the whitepaper (final revised version), developing a demo version of the platform, establishing partnerships and handling feedback from the community. We didn't disclose the final ICO date yet because of our concerns regarding our stakeholders. If an unforeseen event occurs for one of the above-mentioned activities when we had already defined a date to the community, it would have been a lot worse than to hold it for a little longer.  Development progress, team and upcoming news We are keeping the code in a public github account, so the community can track our progress. You can check the team members background in LinkedIn using the links in the first page of this thread. We are regularly updating our medium page with posts related to pension funds, blockchain technology, and our project. We will participate in some blockchain events coming soon and we are being approached by a lot of other people involved in projects in the blockchain community. If you have any question about any of these (or other) details of our project, you can post here (or use slack, telegram, twitter...) and I (or someone else from the team) will quickly answer you.  I myself think that the most interesting thing about this project is the potential of disrupting the pension market using Ethereum blockchain and also the group of people that are working with me on this. We have a great development team, a great designer, a financial expert helping us with contacts in Europe, a pension fund specialist and other experienced professionals in their respective areas. But you shouldn't take my word for it: instead, be welcome to address us any doubts or critics and keep track of our development progress through our blog posts or directly watching the code being developed in github.

If it is possible, I would really like to hear more about why do you think this is not important in the sphere of developments around blockchain and smart contracts technology. And also, if you know any kind of initiative similar to ours, since you mentioned it is not unique.  Most of the criticisms or concerns we have received so far are related to the platform security and to the difficulty associated with regulation since we are trying to create the first smart contract-based pension fund and the first platform for retirement solutions using smart contracts. We have responded to these concerns explaining our strategy of first creating an unregulated crypto currencies-based retirement fund as a proof of concept while using the funds raised in token sale to address legal issues, and also creating other products that are easier to monetize with less regulation, such as the annuities marketplace, and having security audits and bringing specialists to the development team before publicly releasing the platform.  We have some big challenges ahead: we need tokenized traditional assets, we need to build a safe platform, we need to spend a lot of efforts and resources to operate fully regulated, among other important questions we are already addressing.  However, despite the challenges, I really don't see how this could be irrelevant, trivial or not unique. We see some projects using the Ethereum network just to create their tokens and raise funds through an ICO that are not really exploring the smart contracts potential to address ""real world"" problems. Of course there are also a lot of very interesting projects developing decentralized apps using Ethereum's potential for transparency and decentralization, and this is what we are trying to do. As you begin to read about pension-related frauds and problems, coupled with the belief that Ethereum technology will be consolidated and used by general public and smart contracts can be recognized as official documents, this project can be seen as a natural step towards pension market evolution.",False

We are developing a platform for pension funds management and we are using the Ethereum network and its smart contracts as our backbone. What you said (""who knows what there possibly will be instead of the blockchain"") could be pointed as a risk factor for any current project being built using Ethereum, not only pension funds. We don't believe the blockchain technology and smart contracts will be replaced by something else. It may become different from what it is today, as the developers are still working on it and bringing more functionalities in, but it still has a lot of space to grow and evolve and there are hundreds or maybe thousands of promising projects being built on it and improving the ecosystem. This technology is at the very beginning and has a brilliant future ahead. I agree with you if you are talking about crypto currencies current prices, it is very difficult to predict what the existing digital coins and tokens will be worth some years from now, so it would be risky to have a retirement fund with only current existing digital assets. But our project is not only about managing a digital assets fund, we are aiming in the long term market revolution. Our platform will begin with a proof-of-concept digital assets retirement fund but later will expand to traditional assets as the tokenization process evolves and smart contracts become more accepted in the ""real world"".",False

No offense taken. My opinion is that these security concerns are very important, and this holds true for both traditional pension funds and any project related to blockchain and cryptocurrencies in general. Nobody wants to have anything hacked, not just pension funds. Traditional pension funds are often fraud/scam targets and one of our goals in bringing them to the blockchain is to improve this. Of course this brings a new kind of risk, especially with recent hacks occurring in other ICOs and a vast history of other problems that have happened in the past. But it is our team's responsability to address those risks by following a few important steps such as: Thoroughly testing the smart contracts that will be used in the pre-sale and in the ICO; Having security audits; Disclosing contract address previously and using ENS; And after the ICO, before publicly launching our platform, spend even more effort and resources to assure security, hiring security specialists, promoting bug bounty campaigns, extensively testing the platform on test net before launching it on main net, gradually releasing our products to beta testers before releasing them publicly for everyone, and a lot of other measures that can be taken to reduce the risks to near zero. The risk is not exclusive to our project, it exists in every cryptocurrencies exchange, in every ICO and in every system that handles users' assets. Even traditional banking systems are not completely safe against hacks, so it depends on the team's competence to ensure that the platform built is safe.",False

I think this question is very important and should be answered in two parts: technically and legally.  Technically speaking, we are building a platform for general pension funds that will interact with different/custom smart contracts. We can have a smart contract for each fund, or even more than one contract for a single fund. Each smart contract will define the terms for the specific fund, with vesting rules, employer match, fees, calculus and assumptions, and every other thing that is current defined in paper documents / traditional contracts. So it is easy to have a custom smart contract for a private pension fund and a different one for a public pension fund.  Concerning regulation and legal issues, we can address the two types in parallel. Even though our experience comes from a big public pension fund, it might be more challenging to be adopted by public pension funds at the beginning because of bureaucracy issues. We will start with our own Auctus Retirement Fund as a proof of concept and, with help from legal advisors, expand our platform to meet traditional funds requirements.",False

All you said is true, directly dealing with pensions requires a lot of efforts and resources to handle regulation issues. We have put a lot of thought in our business proposition (and we are still gaining new insights and ideas) and one of the team members, Vinicius, works with pension funds. It won't be overnight that we will operate our business fully regulated managing traditional assets and being adopted by traditional retirement funds, but we have been following recent changes in traditional business with blockchain and smart contracts slowly moving towards going mainstream and we have drawn a realistic roadmap. Our first important milestone is the release of our proof-of-concept which is a smart-contract based retirement fund which will not be fully regulated, but instead be used as a showcase to attract traditional funds to joining in. We are at this phase trying to contact potential early supporters (such as other blockchain technology companies) that could adopt this cryptocurrencies retirement fund to help us validate our model. Legal and regulation issues will be handled in parallel with the development of the platform, and soon we expect to be hire specialized legal firms and also be backed up by traditional funds that have already gone through this regulation problems, and in the long term we will provide them a platform that allows better governance and transparency to manage their funds (we will not manage every pension fund that uses the platform). To provide a platform for pension funds will still require regulation, but it is not the same as directly managing pension funds. Besides, selling annuities in the Annuity Marketplace is another product that we will work on in parallel and requires less governement regulations. When we release the final version of the whitepaper and set the token sale date some of the new ideas that we are working on will become clear to the community.",False

Thanks for posting here, we really appreciate every kind of thoughts and feedbacks from the community, that's what is making our project more solid each day. I totally agree with you, a good project can't just focus on short term profits and forget the challenges ahead. We are entering a very promising market, as it is worth more than 30 trillion dollars today, and we believe that Ethereum and smart contracts will play a major role in revolutionizing traditional business models in the few next years. I personally think that this kind of market, that currently lacks of transparency and is always being a target of frauds, is what smart contracts are supposed to improve in the near future. That being said, it will also be very challenging as everything related to blockchain technology is still very new to the general public. But if you think about it, a smart contract-based platform with transparency and easier auditing will be advantageous even to regulators, not only to employers and employees. We won't spare any efforts to keep our mission on track and be prepared for future turnarounds. Having the challenges we are going to face in mind, we won't sit and wait for the blockchain technology becomes accessible to the general public and wait for other projects to lay ground and make it easier for us. We want to be a part of this revolution and disrupt this market facing the challenges ourselves. That is the idea behind our first pension fund being at the beginning focused in the blockchain ecosystem and digital assets, before we are ready to expand to traditional pension funds and managing tokenized traditional assets.",False

We are not in the test phase yet and this is one of the reasons we still haven't decided the ICO date. We are already in a very advanced stage in terms of the token smart contract code (available in public github) and we have finished some architecture definitions for the platform and also started developing a smart contract for the first pension fund (a proof of concept). Our dev team is working really hard and we want to present at least the demo of the platform before the ICO.  We are also finishing the whitepaper, website and establishing some partnerships and those are other reasons why it doesn't make sense to announce a date right now, but we are getting really close to be able to do it.",False
