They have set goals for each stage, which amounts to 5, 10, 20 and 35 million  I was first confused about the hardcap, and the stage where we were in. Because the goal was low in stage 1, and that was not the hardcap. Later on i read that there were more stages xD.  Otherwise would be a very low hard cap of 2000 ETH, cant imagine an ICO to achieve what BitFence has planned in their roadmap with that hard cap  Approx 48%(929+)ETH they raised yet. Bonus also reduced to 19%. This is final steps of bitfence sale? Or after stage we will see any another sale/steps?  I believe we are in the current stage of 2000 ETH cap, there will be more stages with reduced cap sizes Exactly what is the last date of ICO? After this stage what will be their next process and cap limit or target? Do anyone have that idea?  The last day of the TGE is the 1st of July. As said, the hardcap is a stretched goal. ""with staged goals of 5, 10, 20 and 35 million"" . So after the 2000ETH is reached, the next goal is 5000ETH.   Don't you think there is huge distances between softcap and hardcap? And I don't understand why there are multiple stages before hardcap  Well it's always good to set a softcap which is actually realistic so the project can go ahead regardless of hardcap. There are multiple stages to reduce the bonus infrastructure over a periodf time resulting in tokens sold at alater stage of the ICO will recieve less tokens for more money",False

Basically for those that are new to cyber security - the StingMiner which is the honeypot or tool that attacts hackers can run on virtually any platform. To start off with it will be on low powered systems like the raspberry pi or beagleboard. It can also run on normal machines (OS) but the idea is to have mass adoption. The power of this is the more StingMiners we have the better the threat detection capabilities. Once a threat is identified and validated using the AI engine in the backend this will be distributed to consumers and enterprises.  Consumers - the threat information will be available because BitFence plans to launch a personal firewall which will be integrated into the distributed network. Enterprises - they already use existing security solutions like Cisco / F5 etc and Bitfence will integrate into this.  The ICO is a strong business case covering cybersecurity which is a $202B industry and the cost of cybercrime topping $3T so you can do the maths.  The value of the HNY tokens will rise as more threat intelligence feeds become valuable - which means mass adoption. Also note due to the technical superiority of StingMiners we can target focused industries. For example: Autonomous Cars connected to the Internet - our StingMiner can emulate an infotainment system of a car using CAN bus. Hackers would think this is a car and try to run some attacks specifically targeting these protocols - which would identify them and fingerprint them. The same can be applied to any industry as they move to Internet of Things.....",False
