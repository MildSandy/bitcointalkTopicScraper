Earning Boltt tokens to do so should be enticing to many which could translate to great success for BolttCoin. Adding gamification, a decentralized marketplace, identity management and a crypto wallet, BolttCoin is an intriguing blockchain project with tremendous upside.  Risks     Major companies with immense resources, such as Fitbit, are sure to implement blockchain technology in the future and compete directly with BolttCoin. -1.5     The team mainly comes from the same company, Boltt, and currently doesn’t possess an all-star member in the cryptocurrency space. -0.5     Investors prefer to see lockup periods for ICO team members and advisers, which gives the perception of long-term commitment. However, there is no lockup period mentioned for tokens allocated to the BolttCoin team and advisers. -0.5  Growth Potential     BolttCoin has tied up with several large and well-known partners that, in their essence, are some of the world’s most significant corporate entities. +4     The amount of hype and awareness surrounding an ICO does have an impact on their initial success or failure. BolttCoin is succeeding in this area with multiple high rankings online as well as large Telegram, Facebook and Twitter numbers. +3.5     Tracking health and fitness via wearables and mobile apps is a business model in which Boltt has already found success in and should improve upon with BolttCoin. +2.5  Disposition An existing company that has already had success in the area in which it is transferring to the blockchain starts with a major headstart over competitors who are starting from scratch. Boltt aims to add their large active user base to BolttCoin which would translate to instant implementation, adoption and success. Also, with the trend of more and more people looking for ways to improve their health, BolttCoin is poised to capitalize on this massive market.
