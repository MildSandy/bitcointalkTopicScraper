This algo for call makes it impossible to get the information from the operatorâ€™s billing software, as it is unknown what operator TOR-Q-ALL is registered to, and as a result there is no public identifier - MSISDN by means of which IMSI, Ki and IMEI parameters are obtained. Even if the destination number is wired it is impossible to understand who heâ€™s had a conversation with, for the session consists of two legs, and both legs are separated by TOR-Q-ALLâ€™s server ATS, and as a result, the anonymity is reached by these means.",False

A numerous ICOs gone wrong and their founders escaped with raised funds (and counting). On the other hand, we do feel our project to become a trigger for changes in terms of the freedom of communication. Apart from that, it's a good business with quite an interesting margin to develop it further on. Once we get the funds needed to scale it up and start the real marketing campaign, you'll see how strong the platform may be. It's already a ready-to-use solution, and a lot investments have been made, so why would we abandon this ship, when the wind is coming?  Sincerely, Lude | TOR-Q-ALL Co-founder",False

But today we have some rules in this field. Following the rules increases chance to see expected behavior of investors: giving you money you want. Now I can tell you that absolute anonymity is not welcome during ICO. It harms your fundraisnig. And I think you are wrong about some names and photos. If these names won't be yours there is a chance that somebody will figure it out. If someone was seen in some criminal schemes there is also a chance taht someone will notice that. We are talking about probabilities. Of course you can have succesful ICO withat revealing your names (time will judge us) as well as fail with  getting your identity cards scanned in WP. I always want to see best in other people and so do I with your project. But risks of failure can be lower. Sincerely, Oleg, Russian moderator",False

Thank you for the rised question!  Let us be more specific in that regard. We would not be able to provide anonymity to the level stated in the WP should we publish our ID's. Consider our activity as a torrent tracker â€“ nobody knows who are behind the vessel, however it works, and most of them work fine, twenty-four seven, for the benefit of all mankind. We, at the TOR-Q-ALL, would be pleased to become the first provider of cellular services of that kind. Actually, we are, already, and our clients benefit from the list of features we are able to provide them with today.  Still, we do understand that the non-disclosure of the team section during the ICO hardly could be considered as an advantageous move. True, other fund raisers usually show the identities of the founders, advisors, escrow-agents, and so forth during the ICO in order to trigger the investors' feel of confidence. We reckon that it's not our first priority. Money matters, but not as mush as anonymity does. And then again, we do recommend every particpant to remember the failures of the ICOs with the full disclosure: the number is still counting. Meanwhile, please remember that our Product is a ready-to-use one, that has been tested and polished, and is now available at https://www.torqall.com/#vbid-27d0e482-irbdlerw  We hope, that we provided you with the answer needed. Should you have any other inquires, do not hesitate to approach us either here or at ico@torqall.com  Sincerely, TOR-Q-ALL team",False

The next question is: You tell about single payment, let's say 199 USD. But different countries have different costs for mobile connection. Will subscription for your service cover these costs anyway? And let's assume that you have some physical servers to maintain syste, fully operational. How do you make transactions with other GSM operators while using their basic stations and their service? It's some sort of roaming service? Are you anonymous to them?",False

This is a fixed sum regardless of where you are. Indeed, other providers do detect the signal and where it comes from (provider, not location). Still, the identity of the TOR-Q-ALL operator is hidden, for it's a trade mark, not a legal entity. Apart from that, each and single call is divided into two parts (leg 1/ leg 2), thus it's literally a chaotic system of calls that nobody could trace back without a hint. In respect of the mutual net-off with other providers, you should know that we buy a certain amount of traffic (minutes, GBs, etc), and we use it according to our financial model, which helps us maintain the price stated above. Upon scaling we'll be able to cut off one forth of the price, i.e. the volume provides the discount for us, and for you as a customer.  Sincerely, TOR-Q-ALL",False

Two different approaches to the implementation of the feature. Still, each of them has its pros and cons. For instance, EncryptoTel may be excluded from the Apple or Google app store, so the updates would no longer be available.  Our approach is different: TOR-Q-ALL works no matter what, regardless of internet connection, and it's a ready-to-use solution with the wider set of features and opportunities (scenarios of use) None the less, we wish our competitors the very best, since we pursuit the more or less same goals.
