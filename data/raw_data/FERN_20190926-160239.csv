This renders them exposed to a Sybil attack, where nodes, or the people controlling them, act, collude or bribe, to undermine the integrity of the blockchain ledger and defraud users. Fern makes any blockchain network more decentralised and secure by connecting identified node and oracle providers through an anonymous protocol. Through the fern ecosystem, networks will be randomly assigned to the trusted service providers and the identity of the provider remains unknown to avoid collusion and fraudulent after connection. Fern combines enterprise compliance requirements with trustless network fundamentals.  Who we are? And where we come from?  Fern is made up of a team with years of experience across different backgrounds. Our employees have worked with many big names across financial and technological sectors such as the Big Four or Lloyds Banking group.
