This was the start of a globally interconnected set of a set of computers, through which users could quickly access data and programs from any site.  In July 2018, a Dragonchain developer shared a series of transactions bridging the ETH and ETC interchains for the first time. This was the start of a globally interchained set of blockchains, through which users could quickly access data and programs from any chain.  Ethereum Classic (ETC) is joining Ethereum (ETH) on the list of supported public blockchains in the Dragonchain Library of Smart Contracts, with NEO and BTC interchain capabilities soon to follow.  Though the blockchain industry continues to show growth and potential, the community has also experienced limitations posed by the current state of available platforms. Users continue to encounter problems with security and scalability, problems some platforms are unequipped to address.  The Interchain is set to lift those limitations and connect solutions. All blockchains are welcome.  Having ETC in our interchain network is an important development, as it affords our enterprise partners more choices, security, and control over their blockchain solutions. We aim to add as many public blockchains as possible to provide businesses with the strongest, most flexible network. With interchain capabilities, users can be confident that their resources will be safe and usable, even if their public blockchain is compromised or falls into disuse.  Let’s say that as a business, you have decided to utilize Ethereum for your blockchain solution. You’ve spent a considerable amount of resources to develop a new company process; hiring developers, transferring data, and onboarding a blockchain infrastructure set to disrupt the world. However, let’s say in the future that Ethereum (ETH) suddenly ceases to exist. What would happen to your company?  Having additional public blockchains available through interchain would give users something to fall back on. As users interface with a greater number of public blockchains, they continuously reduce their risk. With the addition of each public chain like ETC, the network is made more resilient to potential changes.  Interchaining not only increases data security, it makes user’s blockchain solutions future-proof and provides them with a variety of options and the ability to tailor projects. You may notice that ETC has a smaller user base than Bitcoin or Ethereum, but this comes with the advantage of lower transaction costs and processing times. You are able to decide which public chain is best suited for your intended timeline, budget, and security. You may decide that Ethereum is better in some instances and ETC is better in others; a decision-making quality only available through the power of interchain. https://medium.com/@dragonchain/the-new-internet-of-value-connecting-eth-and-etc-36be5deb3b3a",False

Go to https://dragonchain.com/slumber-score  Enter your address in there to see what your slumber score currently is. The score will be used (to the discretion) of companies that are incubated through the dragonscale program to denote ICO discounts.  So if you have a high score you may get very profitable discounts on up and coming ICOs. There was also talk of dragonchain migrating to it's own chain and if they do that the DSS will be used to integrate nodes on the network.  Overall the score is a mechanism to reward holders of the token. At the moment the only mechanism of reward I am aware of is the discount on incubated ICOs.,False

(Here is my best summary overview) Dragonchain is positioning themselves to sell the 'shovels' in the blockchain space to all the people hoping to become the next Amazon of the crypto/blockchain world.  During the gold rush, the people who made the most money were the ones who sold the shovels, not the ones looking for the gold...  Imagine for a moment, a company that uses a combination of blockchains:  1. ERC-20 Utility Tokens (Ethereum)  2. accepts FIAT+BTC, but handles mass transactions using Stellar.  3. uses Aaragon's governance tech.  4. While connecting to Aigon's cost effective supercloud computing  5. leverages storage with Storj  6. and awards intellectual ownership with PO.ET  THAT is what can start to spawn by using Dragonchain's toolkit! --  In my opinion, they don't need to have their own chain. When I hear people say things like: ""But Dragonchain doesn't have a main net... they can't compete with ADA, EOS, NEO without a main net... ""  *Shakes head*  Being a copy-cat isn't the way to be successful... if there are already 5-7 platform coins, we DON'T want Dragonchain to just be the 8th clone... thats no fun. and that's no way to buy a #LAMBO either.  The angle here is: build your own blockchain solution using any of the products available to you: quickly and easily.  Dragonchain has open source code that you can use to develop onto any other open blockchain using traditional coding languages (think python, java, c++, etc.)  If that doesn't mean much to you, then understand that the current cryptography languages needed to develop a blockchain are: very difficult & time consuming.  This makes the learning curve easier and allows you to go-to-market faster.  So here is WHAT Dragonchain is:  1. They help incubate projects to rapidly enable them to go-to market.  2. They are creating a marketplace / ecosystem for vendors and developers to prosper.  3. They are educating the community / teaching developers via: academy classes; meet-ups and hosting conferences.  Dragonchain is quietly becoming the industry leader in all things blockchain... and they are intentionally quiet.. No PR, No Marketing. It's a concept called Anti-Hype.  And think about it... their product hasn't been released yet.. so what exactly is there to promote anyways?  Just watch. Once their marketplace is established and they have solid partners / vendors... Dragonchain is going to throttle their marketing to 1,000% FULL-FORCE.  I predict you will see them in traditional media like TV ads, Radio, Print... as well as all over the internet ad space.  But for now... any money spent on marketing is as follows:  A. A complete waste of the money they raised. (Since they have no product to monetize that traffic)  B. Skating the lines of upsetting the SEC folks..  If dragonchain can nail this ecosystem of partnerships and collaborative vendors... then they will become the go-to place for all things blockchain.  The funny thing is, they aren't competing with anyone either.. in-fact they help EOS and NEO by helping others build off of their chains. Its truly a win-win for the entire space and will help usher in mainstream adoption. This will bring more and more money into crypto and ballon the total market cap much faster.  Win-Win for everyone. Its a true ""Blue-Ocean"" Strategy  I feel DRGN understands they can't approach other exchanges until they have a working product (AWS March ~ 19th) because they don't want to give the SEC any reason to scrutinize them.  A while back there were suggestions that the SEC looks down on ICOs that only focus on: marketing and exchange listing and neglect focusing on building their product.  My gut tells me once AWS is live, there will be a rationale that Dragonchain will be able to get listed on Bittrex to help support their commercial product - since it requires the functionality of exchanging FIAT, BTC, and Ethereum into DRGNs in order to pay for services.  If that is the case, then it stands to reason they would rather work with a big American exchange to handle this feature.",False

Recent public revelations about Facebook’s handling of its private user information, dramatically culminating in Mark Zuckerberg’s testimony before congress last week, are just the latest demonstrations of inadequacy in third party handling of personal data online. Blockchain’s core transparent decentralization, combined with Dragonchain’s hybrid public-private approach to secure scalability, offer new solutions for transparency and accountability in data networks.  It’s no secret that as the fabric of everyday life becomes ever more entwined with digital networks, the stakes on personal data are growing too. The advent of social networks and other evolving forms of mass communication/commerce have increased both the volume and sensitivity of such data exponentially, Trafficking in it has become big business for ad supported platforms like Facebook — offering a level of targeted hyper-specificity for advertisers (or other interested parties) previously impossible to imagine.  But this increasing weight raises complicated new questions about the ownership of such data, both in terms of privacy and compensation. Just who “owns” a person’s digital details and footprints, and the limits on their use, is still unclear and the subject of much debate.  One of the latest solutions gaining traction (or at least offering some political cover) is the Honest Ads Act, which targets political advertising ala players like Russia and Cambridge Analytica. What remains clear, is that though the issue is multifaceted, encompassing elements of economics, regulation and philosophy — transparency and accountability will be at the heart of any meaningful solution.  Trust and Transparency Fundamentally, in a centralized platform like Facebook’s, users entrust their private data to a third party. Sure, everyone clicks the box agreeing to terms of use. And, yes, levels of privacy may be accessible to the user. In practice though, that data is in the hands of the platform, and users must trust that platform to keep it secure from hacking/misuse, as well as be straightforward in their explanation of how it is used.  It is exactly this third-party trust at the crux of current Facebook revelations. As they’ve been quick to point out, Facebook has always offered privacy controls, and mechanisms for disclosure and consent in personal profiles. Still, in practice, users have been mostly uninformed about the dynamics of Facebook’s use of their private data.  Who Sees My Photo? If Facebook Was a Blockchain Let’s take an example. As the first graphic illustrates, in exchange for taking part in a viral and innocuous quiz, a user might consent to an advertiser accessing their “profile data,” thinking that means their name, picture and location. But users don’t normally think about their “profile” encompassing every friend, like and comment they’ve ever had, nor might they realize the ways in which that information might be used.  Conversely, as described by the second graphic, blockchain eliminates the need for such third party trust, creating trustless networks through the use of smart contracts. Rather than a vaguely defined “profile access,” which might encompass many different digital assets/actions past, present and future, in a blockchain model, access is granted via a smart contract, with explicit terms tied directly to the asset. That smart contract is both public and immutable, providing full transparency of the interaction from the outset. The question, “Who saw my photo?” is one that need never be asked.  Dragonchain For Enterprises Dragonchain’s hybrid public-private blockchain extends this same utility even further, by providing a means to seamlessly connect public blockchains with private blockchains. In practice, this means greater transparency and accountability across networked resources, from internal enterprise networks to wide ranging public communication platforms.",False

DRGN is a utility token, one meant to be used (by hodling).  Understand Dragonchain is a PLATFORM. Yes, it has a token, but this is simply a tokenized microlicense for its holder providing access to the platform. Created in a Disney lab, centered in one of the largest tech-hubs in the US, perfectly and extremely uniquely 100% SEC compliant since day 1... (I swear, to me it appears .gov is writing its laws in order to comply with Dragonchain, not only the other way around.... lolololol I'm not kidding, this is how well Dragonchain fits into the bigger-picture developing between crypto and the rest of the financial world.)  As far as ""why invest"", or rather ""why hodl"".... man... read the whitepaper. It's why this is flying under the radar (also why it exploded when it first arrived [developers were super stoked, wanted to begin hodling{few minded the higher price, they wanted in and to begin building DSS score}])... because only those so far who get it, well... get it. The rest are just too lazy to read the whitepaper; hype followers will eventually fizzle out as blockchain tech further and further manifests in real-world applications and utility. Were I to explain why I own DRGN, I'd be sitting here typing for days on end. It is a blockchain of blockchains. Think Microsoft Windows for blockchains. Dragonchain is the operating system, its ""incubator projects"" are the programs/apps built upon the OS... and one requires DRGN to get/run/create those programs/apps. Think of a masternode or PoS coin... You hold that coin over time and you earn ""reward"", right?... well Dragonchain is this x 1million. Yes, there is plan for mn/pos/even pow applications in the future for DRGN holders, but beyond this, by holding DRGN in an erc-20 wallet, you gain Dragon Slumber Score (DSS) points with time. DSS=number of drgn * days held. Higher DSS ---> greater discount on any pre-sale/ICO for the incubator projects that develop on the platform... it is like an abstracted masternode, abstract in the sense that the ""reward"" comes through greater and greater discounts on projects within a platform that is likewise becoming itself greater and greater through time as more projects join into/with it, and as those projects themselves progress. think fractals. very dragon-like. Anyone with an idea can approach Dragonchain and receive as much help and customization as they need in bringing their idea to fruition... with or without any tech/blockchain knowledge whatsoever.   You need to read the whitepaper, and you need to realize not everyone out there has the patience to do so. You need to understand DRGN market growth will happen through time whether you read the whitepaper or not (because slowly, more and more do read it and see that white light, and share it, even with those who don't read it), and you need to seize the opportunity while it lasts. This is groundbreaking stuff, truly endlessly applicable/interoperable/scalable/language & currency agnostic/etc. It can host public AND private blockchains and anything between, even interact with already existing blockchains like BTC, ETH, etc.. Each project has limitless potential to tailor security features / function / interoperability with other chains / etc., , as required by the project. It's like... a fractal net of glory, dragon-like. This will only become more and more apparent as projects continue to build upon it and feed off of/give to each other within the Dragonchain ecosystem and beyond, no end in sight. The team is outstanding, the projects being built onto the platform are outstanding... it's so outstanding that I've yet to read a perfectly concise and acceptable explanation of it that gives it due justice ANYWHERE, EVER (besides in the whitepaper). It's so interesting and mind-opening that I probably sound like a lunatic trying to explain it, because well... how does one adequately explain infinity with only his/her 10 fingers? One doesn't.  https://dragonchain.com/dd6d7a464346349a6659b8c1075e6772.pdf  I'm gifting you just by spending the time to write this. Why ought I to have written it? Why shouldn't I just let it stay under the radar as long as possible so that I can keep buying more and more at cheap price as my personal finances permit?  Here's an interesting tidbit for you: Did you know an ETH genesis-block address-owner contributed 3600 ETH (~$1mill at the time) during ICO? Why? Has this ever happened? Answer: No. Why not just send that 3600K ETH to a new address and then send to ICO anonymously??? Answer: THINK ABOUT IT. *taps forefinger several times upon temple*  -Rest",False

Everyone https://medium.com/@dragonchain/alms-for-the-everyone-c1216461bf71  Nearly ten years ago, sites like Kickstarter and GoFundMe used the Internet and social networking tools to popularize the concept of “crowdfunding,” radically redefining project funding towards a more grassroots, direct, distributed model. Today, the Seattle based start-up, givewithnothing.org, is preparing to launch a system which could provoke an even more profound transformation in the world of charitable giving.  By using blockchain to increase transparency and accountability at all levels of giving (from the direct to the institutional), givewithnothing.org hopes its ALMs marketplace will increase overall confidence in charitable giving, while also expanding the universe of givers through the new types of contributions blockchain smart contracts enable.  The effort is pioneered by three well established tech industry veterans, Paulo Avelar, William Palmer and Filip Hantson, who’s collective corporate backgrounds include companies like Microsoft, Nintendo, T-Mobile, AT&T and Goldman Sachs among others. This business management experience is evident in their recently released white paper, which provides a detailed discussion of current problems in charitable giving, the structure of GWN’s upcoming ICO and an extensive road map for exactly how the ALMs marketplace will roll out and operate.  All in for ALMs. How Trustless Transactions Work The crux of the GWN approach is to create a distributed marketplace for charitable giving, which uses blockchain-held smart contracts for what it calls “trustless charity transactions.” In this model, the network itself is the trust, rather than a third party, since it provides an open, transparent system for verifying transactions. The network also holds a system for accountability which ties the disbursement of funds to specific actions or outcomes.  For its part, GWN verifies participating marketplace charities for things like identity and legal compliance. It also operates an internal exchange of its token (the ALM) for fiat, or other digital currencies, that can be spent outside the marketplace.  The white paper outlines this process in great detail, but broadly speaking, here’s how it works:  GWN screens and registers charities to the marketplace, assigning them ERC-20 wallets capable of holding ALMs (the GWN tokens). Contributors purchase and hold ALMs (using various fiat and digital currency), which can then be designated for specific charities and charitable purposes. Funds are held in escrow until those predefined conditions are met, at which time a smart contract releases them to the charity for conversion to fiat or or digital currency via the GWN exchange.",False

With topics spanning ICOs, evolving global regulatory landscapes, new models for banking, blockchain ethics and more, we seek to gather thought leaders worldwide for an annual tentpole event.  Any student of culture or history knows that new paradigms don’t spring from a vacuum. Great shifts in thought or technology are inevitably a logical consequence of similarly inspired ideas taking hold, each driven by their interaction with a common context. Taken together they become a wave that changes an established order.`  It is in this spirit we are launching Blockchain Seattle, creating a context for both education and relationship building among developers, businesses and investors, alike. Seattle, long a hotbed of tech innovation, is a growing Blockchain hub, making it a natural choice for the event. Highlight activities already planned include a Women in Blockchain breakfast, as well as a start-up pitch competition, but expect many more announcements in coming weeks.  As a platform ecosystem and business incubator, Dragonchain has always taken an active role in encouraging this type of inter- and cross- industry interaction. Dragonchain’s sponsorship of groups like the Seattle MeetUp, support of educational activities like Girls Make Games and a very responsive approach to social media channels and communication are all activities which support this underlying goal. We’re pleased to continue this role, with a focused opportunity to share experiences and insights, describe challenges and find solutions along side peers.  https://medium.com/@dragonchain/betting-on-blockchain-28459ce1d400",False

Dragonchain was sold in the US and considers itself  to not be a security, but the SEC will be coming with regulations soon and im afraid they may disagree with this. Has this been thought out by the owners? What happens then? For more details on the SECs latest statement related this, see below. Not trying to spread fear on this but genuinely want to understand since I own the token.   ""Second are ICOs where the lawyers appear to have taken a step back from the key issues – including whether the ""coin"" is a security and whether the offering qualifies for an exemption from registration – even in circumstances where registration would likely be warranted. These lawyers appear to provide the ""it depends"" equivocal advice, rather than counseling their clients that the product they are promoting likely is a security. Their clients then proceed with the ICO without complying with the securities laws because those clients are willing to take the risk.  With respect to these two scenarios, I have instructed the SEC staff to be on high alert for approaches to ICOs that may be contrary to the spirit of our securities laws and the professional obligations of the U.S. securities bar.  I recognize that in some ICOs there is no market professional involved. The SEC is undertaking significant efforts to educate the public that unregistered securities investments offered by unregistered promoters, with no securities lawyers or accountants on the scene, are, in a word, dangerous.""",False

DRGN is a tokenized micro-licence which allows access to the Dragonchain platform. It offers no dividend or revenue for holding the token, and it was clearly stated in the whitepaper that you should not view the tokens as a speculative investment or expect profits from purchasing them. The SEC's regulations are the reason the team will not solicit exchanges to list DRGN, as this could be classed as a form of market manipulation.  The ICO's that have come under the SEC's scrutiny so far have been those which have led investors to believe they can expect profits by purchasing coins or tokens, either by promising a reward or dividend for holding them, such as the DAO, Munchee, and Plexcoin, or by claiming they are backed by some form of commodity, such as real estate and diamonds in the case of REcoin and DRC World. https://www.sec.gov/litigation/investreport/34-81207.pdf https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-227 https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-219 https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-185-0  The SEC also stated recently that it is possible for some ICO's to be exempt from regulation: https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-clayton-2017-12-11#_ftn5  ""It is possible to conduct an ICO without triggering the SEC’s registration requirements. For example, just as with a Regulation D exempt offering to raise capital for the manufacturing of a physical product, an initial coin offering that is a security can be structured so that it qualifies for an applicable exemption from the registration requirements.""  To be clear, I'm not offering you legal or investment advice, and if you're concerned about any risks involved in holding DRGN you should consult your lawyer.",False

(more on this from the HuffPo). Naturally, identification systems that can provide the highest levels of security, ease of use and scalable efficiency, will be some of the first necessary building blocks towards truly enabling that future.  lifeID, a Dragonscale incubation partner and the second of our exclusive ICO pre-sales for Dragon holders this month, provides exactly this type of solution. We believe lifeID’s solid technology and impressive team have it poised for early marketshare in this important area.  Consider applications from rewards cards to gym memberships to health and education records. For these, the ability to confirm identity is as important as the ability to confirm a transaction. The vulnerabilities in current systems for identity management (whether from criminal attack or internal abuse) are widespread, well-documented and growing fast.  lifeID solves this with a secure identity level platform that establishes trust within Dragonchain and other blockchain-based environments. This enables the convenience of no-password, no-ID card trust solutions that are also secure from “hacking” and the many other vulnerabilities of centralized databases.  https://medium.com/@dragonchain/bringing-the-blockchain-to-life-id-657b9ce4882c",False

In 2014, Disney's Seattle technology team set out to develop a blockchain protocol with the goal of ensuring greater data privacy than other enterprise-oriented blockchains.  In 2016, Disney made the project open source.  No longer affiliated with Disney, Roets and Quenin lead Dragonchain in its expansion of what is now known as the Dragonchain blockchain platform into a variety of commercial applications.  Dragonchain is presently working with some of the country's leading brands to solve complex problems using the Dragonchain blockchain platform.  The Dragonchain blockchain platform is believed to have applications for just about any enterprise.  Due to its design which makes it difficult to commit fraud, the platform could revolutionize commercial transactions.  Unlike the public bitcoin and Ethereum protocols, Dragonchain is a hybrid. This means some information is private, and some is public, providing advantages over other blockchain platforms.   ""We are excited to form an alliance with Joe, Eileen and the Dragonchain team,"" commented Derek Dubner, CEO of cogint.  ""We are intrigued by Dragonchain's application across disparate enterprises to drive secure transactions.  We believe that combining cogint's differentiated abilities to deliver asset tracking, identity verification, fraud prevention, and secure transactions with the Dragonchain blockchain platform will accelerate adoption of the platform by enterprises, as well as instill confidence in counterparties and the investing public in not only Dragonchain but the emerging blockchain and cryptocurrency industries.""   ""With this powerful combination, we are building blockchain-based identity management and authentication solutions for cross-industry applications and continuing the expansion of our network,"" said Eileen Quenin, VP Strategic Partnerships at Dragonchain.  ""We strive to implement privacy, trust and security.  This alliance represents Dragonchain and cogint's belief that such elements should be incorporated early in the development cycle to accomplish our clients' objectives.""

DRGN is now the 77th on Coinmarketcap.  Price of 100 dollars would mean a marketcap of 23 842 194 000 (almost 24 billion!) dollars (with the current volume in circulation).

Plus, since he didn't specify WHEN next year, that leaves a large window of opportunity open.  It's real aggressive, but I wouldn't say its completely out of the window.  Platforms currencies are starting to pop up left and right and it's watering down the game, but if there's gonna be something that can get into 10s of billions marketcap range, platform currencies usually have some of the best chances to do that.

Part of The ""Dragonchain Ecosystem"" is the Dragonchain Platform, where people will to pay a fee to use it also.  So, everything is all equal then, right? Nope, not even close!  Let's say an ICO launches on Etherium and they raise 30 Million Dollars. Does Etherium profit 30 Million Dollars from it? No they don't, they just get the fees. Does the 30 Million Dollars stay in Etherium? Nope, it gets turned into cash and possibly a few new Lambos ASAP or in the worst case, just vanishes.  Now, Dragonchain helps a new company launch an ICO and they raise 30 Million Dollars. Does Dragonchain profit 30 Million? Well, here is where it gets interesting... and the part that's genius.  Dragonchain is not only a Blockchain Platform, they are also a One-Stop Marketplace for everything that new company needs.  The only ICO Money the new company has to take from the $30 Million is rent for some office space and pay for their employees... if even that.  Most of the $30 Million in ICO Money is going one place, right back into The Dragonchain Ecosystem.  No Lambos, hookers or coke... just Dragons!  Almost all the Bitcoin or Etherium that is raised in the ICO gets turned into Dragons at a price that is ABOVE the current Dragon DRGN price at that time... and that's good news for you and me!  I may be kind of wrong in how I'm looking at this, but on a equal dollar for dollar amount of ICO Money raised, Dragonchain is 1000x more profitable than Etherium. I'm not saying they are worth more, but they sure don't need to create that many ICO's to make a boatload of money.  If Dragonchain was just a platform, Dragons would be $10-$20 easily. Now add in the Marketplace and Incubator... $$$  The only real Lambo in this story is the one you will be driving next year! Go Dragons Go!!!",False

Art has never been so close. Presale Jan 8th, 2018; available only to holders of Dragons.  Mantova, Italy-based Look Lateral will hold a private presale for Dragon holders on January 8, 2018, offering first access to the “Look” utility tokens and tokenized system. Though the full ICO will be open to the public, this private presale opportunity will be the first Dragon holder exclusive of its kind, and the first to utilize the Dragon Slumber Score priority tiers.  Everyone Can Look Look Lateral takes on several key challenges of the contemporary art market using a tokenized, Dragonchain powered platform. What this yields is a completely next generation “Provenance Marketplace,” that encompasses a level of transparency, accessibility and liquidity previously unknown in the global art world.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrjvsaMHUs8  The heart of this exchange platform is a pricing system driven by algorithms and constantly-refreshed data from the global art community. The Look Lateral system pairs a uniquely generated Signature Tag for each art piece to corresponding authenticity certificates. Using a blockchain-secured database powered by Dragonchain’s technology platform, the system confirms an artwork’s identity, and opens access to its entire historical record, as well as its ongoing lifecycle. The new paradigm also allows for the sale and trading of a whole piece or portions of an artwork, quickly and safely. This promises to further democratize the arts market by lowering upfront costs for arts investment.   Look for more details in the coming weeks, as LL releases its white paper and FAQ, key documents that outline the full technological proposition, team of founders and participation guidelines  including specific instructions for those who will utilize the Dragon Slumber Score presale discounts.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq0nEJ8Mc00  Presales for Dragonholders  The ability to enjoy priority participation in Dragonchain sponsored accelerator/incubator ICOs like Look Lateral are one of the most unique “extras” available to Dragon holders.   Dragonchain developers recently unveiled the first step in this utility with the new Dragon Slumber Score calculator on the official website. Here, all Dragon holders can check the  current weight of their personal “nested Dragons,” and even brag about this to others (no pressure, every Dragon counts..).

What are Dragon Days of Slumber?  A Dragon Day of Slumber takes into account both the Dragon balance and length of time each Dragon is held. Based on this “Dragon Slumber Score,” token holders gain priority access to Dragonchain Incubator ICOs and pre-sales. Dragon Slumber scores will used to drive factors such as discount level, participation timeframe and purchase limits. Since each of the Dragonchain Incubations are unique, with tokens representing different types of utility, these benefits will vary based on the specific ICO. Every Dragonchain Incubation ICO will include some type of exclusive participation for Dragon holders, however.  How is a Dragon Slumber Score Calculated?  It’s simple! The number of Dragons held, multiplied by the number of days held yields the Dragon Slumber Score. For instance, if you have 100 Dragons that you’ve held for 5 days, your Slumber Score is 500.  Look Lateral will be the first Dragonchain Incubator ICO, and its pre-sale will take place shortly after the distribution of public Dragons. Stay tuned for specific details on Dragon Slumber Score participation levels and how to make sure you don’t miss out!

They have also said that projects that want access to the incubator platform will have to buy DRGN from them at a premium. However, at the moment we are only on one exchange, which a good number of people do not want to use. So eventually, when everyone on EtherDelta has had their fill of coins the volume will tail off and the price will fall. It would therefore be in the best interests of the team to have DRGN listed on as many exchanges as possible, it raises awareness and adoption, and also supports the price by providing additional liquidity.  I don't see where any FUD would come from, the team is legit with a wealth of experience, and the project seems to be one of the best out there. But if there was an attempt to start some FUD, then being listed on just one exchange will definitely not help in regards to supporting the price. The more exchanges the better.",False

DragonChain is a sleeping giant in that it already worked through 20 or so use cases while in development to tweak the initial implementation of the platform.

The Benefits of DRGN: Smart contract integration, which has recently only been available on the Ethereum network. High scalability and faster speed to market, which reduces development costs. Built-in security that is inherent to blockchains. From an investor standpoint, DragonChain is already light years ahead of a lot of ICOs that are creating platforms. It has an incubator program that will fund startups that will help real-world companies get up and running on the DragonChain platform. Unlike Ethereum, which has mainly become an ICO launch pad, DragonChain is building a platform for existing businesses to be able to build on top of the blockchain. While Ethereum is mainly a platform that is there to build on, Dragonchain is a platform with support.    The DRGN platform is focused on reaching companies just as much as they are building out the platform itself. This will accelerate platform adoption and business growth while increasing the value of DragonChain. Larger companies are approaching the blockchain with skepticism and reluctance. DragonChain can be the bridge that connects the two. It is very expensive to try and leverage blockchain technology in already existing companies. The DRGN platform attempts to solve this by putting businesses first based on past experience and offering restful interfaces, interoperability with other blockchains, ease of integration, a simplified architecture and more.  Dragons or DRGNs will be utilized by developers and organizations to interact with the DragonChain commercial platform’s products and services. Dragon tokens will also be used to support startups in the DragonFund Incubator providing early access to data and technology as well as first access to purchase tokens for use on the developed platforms.  The DragonChain ICO raised $21,358,506 USD. It has since grown to around three times that level and appears to be expanding more rapidly as time goes on. Once the DRGN token is listed on larger exchanges there will a lot great liquidity. DragonChain has a current value of approximately $60,000,000. This is low for a platform that is already so mature, was originally backed by Disney and has an incredibly capable development team.  Disclaimer: Analyst current invests in Dragonchain.

For everyone that takes part along the way-- the visionaries, developers, team members and contributing community-- an ICO is the contribution of common time and attention towards a certain point. That point, of course, is the inception of a certain project and the distribution of its utility via the token.   For us, that is the Dragon and the launch of the Dragonchain Incubator. And the time is now!   We are excited to announce that both our internal and external audits are now complete. Thank you to everyone who took part in ways big and small. Final results and documentation are posted here. All Dragon holders can expect to see their balance of Dragons by entering the receiving address of their designated ERC20 compatible wallet in an Ethereum blockchain explorer like the one found here.

For the non-technical among us, there are aspects of the Dragon that may fall into this category (node spinning? tokenization?). The ability to enjoy priority participation in Dragonchain sponsored incubator ICOs is a benefit everyone can understand. While certain priority windows or discounts may require a Dragon Slumber Score for incubator ICOs, Dragons need not be “cashed in” for that participation. As long as a contributor is in possession of Dragons, they can contribute to incubator ICOs using their Dragon Slumber Score participation windows.  In other words, you’ve got your Dragons--now HODL ‘em!           What’s your Dragon Slumber score?        Dragonchain, Inc. is continuing its role as an innovator, with a pioneering new approach to ICO pre-sales and incubation.   As we release the first public token sale Dragons, Dragonchain is excited to introduce the “Dragon Days of Slumber,” our mechanism for encouraging ongoing participation and support for the larger DC ecosystem and our incubator program.           What are Dragon Days of Slumber?   A Dragon Day of Slumber takes into account both the Dragon balance and length of time each Dragon is held. Based on this “Dragon Slumber Score,” token holders gain priority access to Dragonchain Incubator ICOs and pre-sales. Dragon Slumber scores will used to drive factors such as discount level, participation timeframe and purchase limits.  Since each of the Dragonchain Incubations are unique, with tokens representing different types of utility, these benefits will vary based on the specific ICO. Every Dragonchain Incubation ICO will include some type of exclusive participation for Dragon holders, however.  How is a Dragon Slumber Score Calculated?   It’s simple! The number of Dragons held, multiplied by the number of days held yields the Dragon Slumber Score. For instance, if you have 100 Dragons that you’ve held for 5 days, your Slumber Score is 500.   Look Lateral will be the first Dragonchain Incubator ICO, and its pre-sale will take place shortly after the distribution of public Dragons. Stay tuned for specific details--via our TG chat or Email List-- on Slumber Score participation levels and how to make sure you don’t miss out!    ",False

Circulating Supply is the best approximation of the number of coins that are circulating in the market and in the general public's hands and is used in calculating Market Cap.  Total Supply is the total amount of coins in existence right now (minus any coins that have been verifiably burned).  Max Supply the best approximation of the maximum amount of coins that will ever exist in the lifetime of the cryptocurrency.

If the value of the technology is on Dragon's own blockchain, and if using the ERC20 version requires extra effort, then demand is going to move toward Dragonchain. How can the developers maintain a peg if demand for the ERC20 token is falling? And why would I buy an ERC20 Dragon now if there's the possibility that at some point in the future Dragonchain launches and my ERC20 Dragon becomes obsolete and/or less valuable?

I saw the post were the Mod for this thread said something like that, like it was pegged to ETH or something. He didn't mean price, so I don't get what he meant by that.  It's pretty complicated at first, but there are some great videos on YouTube that explain everything.  Basically, anyone that wants to use the Dragonchain Platform will have to buy Dragon (DRGN) Tokens to do so. Let's say you want to use one of their Smart Contracts... you can't pay in Bitcoin, you can only pay with Dragons.  The more people who want to use Dragonchain, the higher the DRGN price should go. The real important thing is something Joe Roets said in one of the videos... NOBODY will be able to pay with ANYTHING other than DRAGONS.  Sure, you could walk into Dragonchain HQ with a shopping cart full of cash and they will accept it. But before they will do any work for you or let you invest in one of their projects, the cash will be converted to Dragons at a price that is ABOVE market price.  Dragons really are magical, you can do all kinds of cool things with them. After a day or two of reading and watching videos everyone should be able to understand what Dragons are. You will see that Dragons will actually be quite valuable to a lot of different people for a lot of different reasons.  I'm personally interested in what ideas Dragonchain has hidden in their Magic Vault. I really get the feeling once this whole thing gets rolling, Dragonchain will start announcing things and everyone will be freaking out. Like, Holy Cow... that's what these guys are up to!

Imagine going to a Carnival, but instead of a Carnival where you spend money, it's a Carnival where you make money.  You walk up to the ticket window, hand the cashier $20 and you receive 20 Tokens. Now, are the Tokens worthless? No they are not. They allow you to get on the rides you want and to buy food and drinks. In the case of Dragonchain, Dragon Tokens let you access their platform.  Now imagine... you walk up to the window and all the tickets are sold-out. That's where we are now. Are the tokens only worth $20? Remember, at The Dragonchain Carnival, we make money off of the tokens not just spend them. What if I can make $60 inside the Carnival with my $20 in Dragons? Am I going to sell them for $21? No way.  As people start to hear about this Magic Dragonchain Carnival and all rush to the ticket booth, what happens? Sure, some people sell them for $21, but most people know that is a foolish thing to do. You HOLD your Dragons until the value you get for selling them in the market is greater than using them inside The Dragonchain Carnival.  Another thing to remember about The Dragonchain Carnival, the value of a Dragon can be $1 or $100.00, it DOES NOT MATTER!  If a smart contact inside The Dragonchain Carnival is $100. It doesn't matter to someone on the outside if it works out to be 100 Dragons or 1 Dragon. It's still $100 to them either way.  To the people who buy Dragons early, it's a great deal. They can basically get all their work done for free just from the profit on Dragons. If you are holding them to sell, the sky is the limit. It only depends on the price the other investors are willing to sell for. I say if you want to sell them for 10 cents, be my guest. Dragons ARE NOT Dogecoins.  Sure, when Dragonchain starts releasing more tokens the price could move down. But if everyone is on the same page there would be no reason for it to go down.  Also, as they keep introducing new ideas and projects, the value of a Dragon can only go one way... UP!  Dragons are very valuable if you think about it... you can sell 'em if you wish, but don't come crying to me when people start to realize the Power of Dragons!!!  Go Dragons Go!!!",False

This is from their FAQ  With the BTC hardfork around the corner , is it best to wait to invest, as BTC may be higher now than it will be in 3 weeks? Actually, the BTC/USD price will not be a factor -  We are doing all calculations for token distribution based upon BTC price with no consideration for USD or other fiat pricing.  1 BTC on Oct 2 = 1 BTC on Nov 2.  So you wouldn't be evaluating with ETH@250, you would be evaluating what how much BTC your ETH converts to on the day of you sending it in. And BTC value is ""pegged"" to USD - how they determine how much they've raised....(probably on the date of the audit/closing). They don't care what the value of your BTC is, only how many. So your 1 BTC from when it's $2000 is worth the same as the 1 BTC that you buy today (~$5700). Both BTC get you the same amount of DRGN token. So contrary to what they are saying, the BTC/USD price will be a factor for people that's buy/sending btc/eth into the sale -- since people are still using fiat to acquire BTC.",False

Why would USD be any fairer? If it was pegged to USD, wouldn't that in turn be unfair to anyone who's native currency is worth less than USD? BTC is a level playing field.  If I bought 1 BTC at $1000 and you bought 1 BTC at $5000, my BTC is still worth the same as yours. It's like if I bought a '59 Gibson Les Paul in 1959 for $500, it would be worth $50k today.

If ICOs assigned an arbitrary value, say $10, to their token, then $1000 spent is $1000 spent, you won't be penalized or profit just because the BTC value crashed/jumped due to other external factors that's not related to dragons. You are effectively creating ""FOMO"" because people might be afraid that tomorrow's BTC might be even more expensive and that they need to buy BTC now(!) so they can get the same allotment of DRGNs with less USD today.  You are not letting the market to set the price of DRGNs, you are letting BTC to decide the price of DRGNs when you are basing your evaluation off of price from BTC's market price (and price of BTC isn't majorly affected by DRGN, so really, that statement is really false).  Currently on the funding page, you are showing you've raised ~7700ETH and ~203BTC, which is ~3.8mil. (approx 7700ETH*$330 + 203BTC*$5800 -- even this is questionable, you guys suppose to exchange ETH into BTC everyday at the closing according to your FAQ, why is it still showing how much ETH you've raised?! You should be showing everything as BTC). Now, hypothetically, if the market crashed, and ETH and BTC worth only 50% of the current value, you would only have raised ~1.9mil instead. That's....kind of unwise. Unless you sell off coins into fiat (USD) as they come in, then you can at least guarantee that you've raised actual USD to pay off the whatever bills the company needs to pay. If THAT is the case, then a person who bought 1 BTC at $2000, and a person that bought 1 BTC at $4000, contributed different amount to the company, yet, they will receive the same amount of dragons. Hummmm, so however you want to spin it as ""We are choosing not to do that. We are letting the market set the price of DRGNs and by doing this we are hoping to create a more stable token and prevent dumping when DRGNs hit exchanges"", it is actually better off to have assigned the dollar value to each DRGN tokens instead of this ""i hope i'm lucky that i purchased my btc when it is cheap"". Your system would've worked if people's bank accounts are in BTC units, but they are not. People need to exchange them using USD, that adds an extra layer that you guys did not consider apparently.   Another thing, Market price for Dragons will be determined at close of sale based upon total amount raised, just exactly how did you guys come up with this and decide it is a good idea?? If, IF, BTC is worth $100k a piece, and you have raised 600BTC, that makes you a $60mil company. But if BTC is only worth $1000, you are only worth $600k. You are not letting the market to determine your company's worth, you are letting the BTC's market to determine your company's worth instead - for now at least - this isn't very good either...  In short, I find the system to be questionable, and people that is interested should really look into the math behind how they determine how much drgn you are assigned",False

Yes, most of them only have XXX/BTC trading pairs, but that doesn't mean it's pegged to BTC at a certain ratio. For example, LTC isn't always 1/10 of BTC's price, it changes with supply/demand on the exchanges -- but this is the case of DRGN. BTC is further away from a level playing field USD is - simply because it a greater variation than fiat currency.  Your example is true only for BTC, except you are not buying BTC anymore, you are buying DRGN. Why is DRGN pegged to BTC when it shouldn't be? It should be a free market by itself. Putting in 1BTC at $1000 and 1 BTC at $5000 get your the same amount of DRGN, that's absurd. Why is DRGN more expensive today than yesterday just because BTC price changed? Person A buys 1 BTC to invest in DRGN today, and BTC crashes 50% next day, and Person B buys 1 BTC to invest in DRGN tomorrow, why should Person A get the same amount of DRGN as Person B when Person B only spend 50% of the money as Person A? They are not investing in BTC, they are investing in DRGN, it should not be affected by the price of BTC, but it is. Basically, what I am saying they should be using a system of tracking the fiat equivalent of the BTC that is donated such that people receive the equivalent amount of DRGN back -- but they've said it's a bad idea....",False

As far as a dsktop ERC20 wallet, Mist and Parity both have desktop applications I believe. But please, don't take my word for it. I would suggest you do a whole bunch of research and find the wallet that you are comfortable with.  Quote from: sandler425 on October 04, 2017, 01:53:25 AM How the HELL do you plan to use an ERC-20 token to compete with ETH?   Disney you didn't think this through.  And by having no cap, you will get less money than you would if you actually put a cap on it.  Yes, the token is an ERC20 token, but the platform is a proprietary blockchain platform. Please have a look at our whitepaper and FAQs for more information on DragonChain (I will link them at the bottom).  Most ICOs arbitrarily set the price of their tokens and use bounties, airdrops, and bonuses to entice people to buy, we prefer to let the market set the price. By doing it this way we are helping to ensure stability with the token. We don't have a hardcap, but we have capped the amount of tokens and no more will ever be created.  Re: Disney (from the FAQs):  Dragonchain was originally developed at Disney’s Seattle office in 2015 and 2016 as the Disney Private Blockchain Platform. Over 20 use cases and applications were explored and documented publicly via the W3C [Suspicious link removed]munity Group. The platform was later released as open source software under the Apache 2 license in October of 2016.  The Dragonchain Foundation, a Non-Profit Corporation was created in January of 2017 to maintain ownership and responsibility of the open source code.  The Dragonchain team is now in the process of launching a commercial entity to build a serverless architecture blockchain platform. The combination of serverless and blockchain technologies is unique and tremendously valuable. The timing of the Dragonchain platform launch is highly strategic to benefit from explosive growth of cloud computing over the last few years and the emerging wave of Blockchain solutions entering proof of concept stage across enterprises.

Over 20 use cases and applications were explored and documented publicly via the W3C community Group. The platform was later released as open source software under the Apache 2 license in October of 2016.  Dragonchain simplifies the integration of real business applications on a blockchain and provides features such as easy integration, protection of business data and operations, currency agnosticism, and multi-currency support.  The Dragonchain Foundation, a Non-Profit Corporation was created in January of 2017 to maintain ownership and responsibility of the open source code.  The Dragonchain team is now in the process of launching a commercial entity to build a serverless architecture blockchain platform. The combination of serverless and blockchain technologies is unique and tremendously valuable. The timing of the Dragonchain platform launch is highly strategic to benefit from explosive growth of cloud computing over the last few years and the emerging wave of Blockchain solutions entering proof of concept stage across enterprises.  Vision  The Dragonchain team will launch Dragonchain, Inc., as a commercial entity to provide an array of products and services to the community. Our vision supports areas of the market that are underserved with strong demand and projected growth in the blockchain industry ($7.7b by 2024) across an array of multi-billion dollar sectors such as Arts, Wine, Automotive, Legal, Digital Marketing, etc. These sectors and more will experience market disruption with blockchain capabilities shifting the value proposition into decentralized environments. Dragonchain platform will support these needs.  Dragonchain provides a commercial platform for application developers to rapidly and securely deploy Blockchain applications while maintaining existing language development environments (e.g. Java, Python, Node, C#, Go); a tremendous costing and speed to market advantage. The Dragonchain architecture is also designed to allow nodes to handle approval of transactions based upon five levels of network consensus to provide a spectrum of trust to data consumers; a level of security and flexibility unseen in the market by current blockchain solution providers. These design attributes position Dragonchain for exponential growth.  In addition, Dragonchain will provide project incubation as well as professional services with strategic partnerships to develop successful tokenization ecosystems focusing on long term value.   A Turnkey Blockchain Platform for Business  Serverless system and smart contracts Established language support for smart contracts (Java, Python, Node, C#, Go, etc.) Scalable - Amazon AWS and Google deployments Secure - Protection of business data and operations Advanced currency implementations Smart contract libraries Currency Agnostic  Benefits  Lower development cost via existing development languages Faster speed to market Significantly higher levels of security with proprietary architecture Higher scalability with proprietary architecture  DragonFund Incubator  Standard processes for the incubation of blockchain startups and new integrations Direct access to legal, technical, marketing, and economic subject matter experts as partners for advice and support Direct support from Dragonchain platform team  Benefits  Higher success rate for launch with data driven insights Expedited launch cycles Sustainable token marketplaces  Token Definition  Token Name: Dragon Ticker symbol: DRGN  Country of origin: USA Website link: https://dragonchain.com/tokensale Token Sale Summary Deck: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10Zhvs4R7cJqUvv7Q5h1gLHr7R6i0Wo59nXGTPED3nPg/edit?usp=sharing Business Summary Document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1usy0W0y64Y_9bLjN7uZmm86RIxILB-D_6ThvlIxaeTg/edit?usp=sharing  Architecture/technical Document: https://dragonchain.github.io/doc/DragonchainArchitecture.pdf Contact: tokensale@dragonchain.com Twitter: @dragonchaingang Slack: https://dragonchain.slack.com/ Join now!
