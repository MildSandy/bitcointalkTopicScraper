It can be as revolutionary as farming technologies which made gathering and hunting redundant and led us to the dawn of the human civilization. Blockchain can lead us to its heyday. First time in history, we have a real chance to forget about drudgery and survival and move to the world of prosperity and economic freedom. However, despite having the powerful technology behind it, the success of cryptocurrencies has been limited by their lack of adoption and acceptance. Cryptocurrencies are perceived and used mainly as a speculative investment, while they should create a new economic set-up, which brings life changing opportunities to everyone.  Solution/Product  Coinyspace is the platform created to make cryptocurrencies a tool which will help people earn decent wages, start their own business, receive better education, repay debt and solve other fundamental human problems. To achieve this Coinyspace combines two revolutionary technologies - crypto and social media. It is the first platform that is focusing on the community building, as we believe this is the foundation that will elevate the universal acceptance of bitcoin and other digital currencies. The platform is designed to be a place where ideas can be shared, developers, merchants, and individuals can collaborate with one another, and lasting and productive connections can be forged.  Benefits for Users   Tokenomics Coinyspace introduces a utility token CNC that can be exchanged for advertising or other services rendered by the Coinyspace Platform.    Token Sale Parameters*: ¬∑        Soft Cap: 50m tokens, ¬∑        Hard Cap: 600m tokens, ¬∑        Token Price: 0.000035 ETH per a token Unsold tokens will be burned. Tokens reserved for the Team and Advisors will be locked for at least 1 year.  *Participants of the Private Pre-Sale can buy up to 75m tokens with a 40% discount and get other benefits as described on our website. Please fill out this form if you are interested in participating in the pre-sale.  How big can this be?  Our ultimate aim is to make cryptocurrencies universally accepted across the world. Our mission is to become the go-to platform for all existing cryptocurrency users and the main gateway for the new adopters. We are building a product which will be used by everyone who is already in crypto to find merchants, goods, services, partners, jobs, customers, investors and so on. At the same time, all those who just want to start using crypto will be referred to Coinyspace as the natural starting point. We have got more than 10,000 sign ups (and counting!) from 121 countries through our airdrop campaign. These are our target audience - the crypto enthusiasts - who will have a Coinyspace account from Day 1 and start using our platform immediately. The Platform‚Äôs functionality is designed to retain them as loyal users and grow our audience further. It is strong evidence that our business model is robust and Coinyspace has a bright future!  We believe that cryptocurrencies will eventually become mainstream currencies, and Coinyspace will be at the centre of the action!  Project‚Äôs History and Background  Coinyspace stands out as one of the most transparent and reliable Token sales on the market, which, in particular, is evidenced by the following: The team has been in crypto since 2013. We believe in crypto and started this project being driven by our desire to contribute to the success of the industry. We did not make up a project with an aim to raise funds, but rather evolved to the Token Sale stage, while building a project we believe has a huge potential to move the whole industry forward. Development of the service (under a working name moBUinet) started in the 2014, you can check out one of our earlier social media posts here; We have launched the first version of our prototype in 2016, which you can visit here. Please see the Coindesk press-release about this here; Since the launch of the prototype we have been collating feedback and considering further steps. Our founder and BD Lead has been growing his network on LinkedIn to receive insight from various members of the crypto community. You can check his profile and connect to him here; Key team members passed KYC procedures on FoundICO through Sum&Substance's identification process. Please check out FoundICO profile here.

It is a good one indeed! We thought a lot about this and included two solutions in our prototype: 1. We partnered with XAPO and leveraged their KYC solution. Our users could attach their XAPO account to their profile and if it was verified by XAPO we could see it through their API and get the account verified on our platform too. We were also airdropping our virtual currency for doing this. 2. In addition to this we developed a community based verification system based on the 6 hand-shake rule, where people vouch for each other. So a randomly selected verified user could vouch that another one is a real person.  Now, after receiving user feedback, we will likely change this approach, taking the community verification out and probably adding a SumSubstance like solution. There has to be a right balance between maintaining privacy of users when they want to be anonymous and trustworthiness of the community when people are involved in business deals. So we will allow anonymous accounts while having an optional verification feature. This can be used to verify airdrop recipients, ICO founders, bounty participants, merchants, freelancers and so on.",False

Please see below our medium blog post, where we discuss what is the real problem crypto should solve and how Coinyspace can contribute to this.  https://medium.com/@coinyspace/crypto-will-succeed-if-we-all-focus-on-the-real-problem-it-is-to-solve-8935b6ea274  Crypto will succeed, if we all focus on the REAL problem it is to solve.  There are many discussions in the crypto ecosystem, including very heated debates absorbing a lot of time and energy of the community. To name a few: big blocks vs small blocks, Bitcoin vs Altcoins, store of value vs medium of exchange, POW vs POS, ICOs are scams vs ICOs are the future of funding, decentralised vs centralised, private by default vs private by choice etc.  No doubt, every particular issue is important in the context and deserves to be thoroughly discussed. However, once you consider the grand scheme, all these issues are secondary to the main one, which surprisingly is almost never discussed.  What is really important is how the cryptocurrencies can help people earn enough money to live fulfilling, financially secure life. If someone is broke, if they live from paycheck to paycheck, it does not really matter whether they are broke while using bitcoins, altcoins or dollars. The crypto system should not be simply a different payment system, it should create a new economic set-up, which brings freedom and prosperity to every human on our planet. This is the goal. All other issues are ancillary.  Crypto should be weaved into our economic lives, changing the patterns of how wealth is created, distributed, exchanged and consumed. Crypto should help people earn decent wages, start their own business, receive better education, repay debt and solve other fundamental human problems. The right question is how cryptocurrencies should be designed and what infrastructure should be in place to make this happen.  The current situation when crypto is presented to the public as an investment vehicle is dangerous. Crypto does not exist to be bought, hold and sold on its own; it should function as a tool that creates radically new economic opportunities, which are not possible under the fiat system. The current price level is based on an assumption that crypto will eventually perform this useful function and if this doesn?t happen, crypto will fade away by itself.  This is what we all need to discuss.  What, in your view, is required to make crypto a tool that will leave financial insecurity in history?  ----------- We at Coinyspace started our journey with an attempt to create a coin which is designed to achieve this goal. However, we realised that the biggest problem is not a lack of a well-designed coin, but rather the misplaced agenda and priorities. What the crypto community is lacking now is a service designed to bring people together for cooperation and exchange.  Our platform offers a unique functionality that is specifically designed to facilitate further adoption and usage of cryptocurrencies. It is designed to be a place where ideas can be shared, developers, merchants, and individuals can collaborate with one another, and lasting and productive connections can be forged.
