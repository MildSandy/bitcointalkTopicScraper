A: Everyone  As people respond to questions throughout the Knowledge.io ecosystem and on publisher apps and websites, their score of correct (and incorrect) answers gets written to the Knowledge Score blockchain.  Knowledge builds a graph database, with topics, and those point to other nodes on the graph with questions and answers. Knowledge Scores are associated with this, as well, to identify experts, etc. But the scores get written to the blockchain, like a DMP in ad tech, a Data Management Platform.  This allows advertisers to target people based on how much or how little they know about these topics, which has never really been done before in the history of marketing in a deterministic manner... all of it has been probabilistic.  In the current ad tech landscape, the ad platforms primarily use content consumption as the main targeting criteria, beyond the basics of audience demographics and geolocation (from which they derive demographic data for audiences). They also use contextual targeting by analyzing the words that appear on the page where ads are shown, and other types of behavioral targeting. Basically, the IP address reveals the geography pretty accurately, and then there are 3rd parties that sell demographic data about geographies. Using this method, advertisers are able to target audiences, but it's all pretty much based on statistics and predictive modeling which works great to lift the performance of campaigns. Those systems are most impressive.  We just one up it at Knowledge.io.  From the ad exchanges, ad tech platforms are able to pull months worth of log files which contain the IPs, the URLs for the property where the ad was served, and date/timestamp information. They derive demographics from the IPs, and they see on which publishers, and with what audience visit frequencies, audiences have visited from inspecting the URLs.  So they can see where the audiences are in what quantities throughout history. This informs their recommender systems on where to buy ad space. Advertisers know the demographics of their customers, so they just find those out there on the exchanges and do programmatic direct buys, at scale.  Ad tech platforms also use realtime bidding or RTB to target to people based on products they’ve consumed or added to their carts but abandoned (or not… sometimes you see these ads anyways even though you actually purchased that or a similar product).  We will plug into those systems in the future, so that external ad tech platforms can use our data anywhere, on any of the inventory sold on any of the exchanges, and to make our audiences addressable for retargeting purposes.  Most of the past 12 years in the evolution of ad tech has been focused on automation of that buying process, which is awesome, but there has been little innovation similar to what we're doing with targeting the amount of knowledge people possess.  Our method makes for better communication with a potential customer. Do you want to sell a basic telescope to an astronomer enthusiast? No. You want to sell that person the most high end telescope you've got.  Think of our ad tech platform as somewhat similar to Google Adwords. Advertisers pick topics which are related to the products they sell. They also load their entire product inventory into their site on the Sellers Marketplace. We identify experts with high scores on the topics related to those products, and the advertisers can offer tokens to those people for influencing sales.  Those Knowledge Stars (experts) write reviews, ratings, make videos (unboxing, installation, reviews, etc.) and they're posted alongside the product content on the product details page within the Marketplace.  Would you rather know that proven experts are recommending a product, over random people you don't know?  Experts benefit with increased tokens.  Token holders in general benefit because they'll know which are the best products.  The entire community benefits because manufacturers will have to compete more heavily and actually make good products, otherwise they won't sell.  Advertisers benefit because they can communicate more appropriately with people based on how much they know about their brand, their services, their products, solutions, etc.  Publishers benefit because they earn tokens for all of their users improving their Knowledge Scores.  In the education and employment domains, schools, teachers and students benefit from earning tokens.  Employers benefit from identifying and hiring proven experts, and it is also used for internal employee assessment and rewards in the form of tokens.

Here's an explanation:  This process by which tokens are distributed to participants on the Knowledge.io ecosystem is an analog to bitcoin pool mining.  We call this process meta-mining, and like bitcoin pool mining  which has a 1. fixed supply, 2. increasing difficulty over time, and 3. halving of rewards, the KNW tokens are distributed in a similar way, fractionally and proportionally based on contribution of Knowledge to the pool, meeting all 3 criteria above.  In the Knowledge.io ecosystem, our rewards mechanism is an analog to bitcoin pool mining. Publishers are like pools, and their users/visitors are like the individual miners on the pool. Rewards are issued proportionally based on the individual’s contribution and the publisher earns tokens for operating the website, app or platform.  Knowledge.io receives fees for operating the Q&Ads platform, but most of the KNW tokens are indirectly distributed to the publishers and users based on a structured rewards mechanism. Knowledge.io then deposits a portion of the tokens it earns from advertisers back into the treasury to replenish the pool used for distributing tokens.  The KNW token is a pre-minted ERC-20 compliant token on the Ethereum blockchain.  There is a finite supply of 150 million tokens.  The calculations needed to earn rewards increases in difficulty over time, and the rewards are halved over time/difficulty.",False

Consider that the ads and content can be incorporated into any publisher's app, website, and we'll be looking into more immersive experiences such as games and AR/VR.  That's really awesome and will make knowledge service available in different platforms with different type of business.   Since we're planning on implementing a Knowledge OpenID Server, users will be able to stay logged in within browser sessions which allows us to do some really awesome stuff with the Marketplace products and purchases.  No CC or SSL required.  Just our wallet.  I got it, Similar to what platform facebook does and allows us to register, comment on other websites using our facebook profile.   Regarding the practicality of calculating and generating a Knowledge Score, it's more that there are multiple Knowledge Scores around topics or topic sets.  The targeting method you are referring to at the beginning of your comment is the ability to target ads and content to users based on how much or how little they know about topics.  That is the patent we filed for Knowledge Scores.  Inventing something new and offering it exclusively through Blockchain technology is really the kinda of projects that we like to see in crypto space.",False

Our platform and ecosystem is really an exciting product to build.  It actually combines much of my previous experience.  I worked with the top affiliate marketing platform early on in my career, as a product manager, and I learned about performance advertising.  Also helped out on a part of the product suite that had to do with syndicating products from merchants to be able to offer them in an affiliate model for inclusion on affiliate websites.  Think Amazon's Associates program with product links.  Later on I worked with a company that built technology to help showcase and merchandise retailer products on the internet.  And before I started my own recruiting firm that I operated for 12+ years, I worked with an ad tech company that was one of he first companies using statistics and predictive modeling to improve ad campaign performance and optimization.  All three of those companies were subsequently acquired by major industry leaders.  I was fortunate enough to have worked with the Chief Scientist as well whose advisor was the Chief Scientist at Amazon at the time.  I learned so much in this role, it shaped my thinking around data and building computational pipelines - it was a wonderful experience.  Since 2009, I've been managing a private ad tech industry group on LinkedIn with 12,000+ vetted ad tech industry members, and we post and discuss the news daily.  My time spent in recruiting was primarily with large ecommerce retailers in the US, and ad tech companies throughout the world, as well as a bunch of really advanced startups in the areas of artificial intelligence.  So bringing an advanced ad tech platform to commerce, education, and employment is a great combination of many years of experience in these spaces.

Can you give us ideas?  This is a great question.  I'm Steve, and I head up product at Knowledge.io.  Since our platform is very much an ad tech platform, we will be attracting major advertiser brands onto the system.  Advertisers currently do not have any mechanism for targeting people based on how much or how little someone knows about their brand or their products.  This is quite an innovation in the world of ad tech, and we've filed a patent on putting these Knowledge Scores on the blockchain.  Advertisers will be able to buy advertising across the network of publishers who install our SDK/APIs, just like other ad tech platforms out there.  Most apps and websites are monetized through advertising, and all of them implement a similar sort of SDK/API.  They're sometimes called ad tags.  Down the road, we will have our own buying platform that allows us to show ads across the entire programmatic exchange ecosystem via programmatic direct buys or real-time bidding (RTB).  Many of the largest advertisers on the internet are in fact ecommerce retailers.  So, many of these retailers will choose to open a store within the marketplace, and will upload their entire ecommerce site's product inventory into our marketplace where Knowledge token holders will be able to buy pretty much any of the products sold directly on the ecommerce retailer's websites, except they'll purchase them using KNW tokens.  Think of it as similar to an Ebay Store of Amazon Store from a major brand.  Additionally, those people who end up earning high Knowledge Scores by answering many questions correctly about topics associated with the products from these retailers will be able to earn more tokens by becoming Knowledge Stars who act like influencers on the marketplace.  Knowledge Stars will provide ratings, reviews, videos like unboxing and installation videos, etc. which will appear alongside the product listings within the marketplace.

Think of our ad part of the platform as similar to Google adwords in some ways...  in adwords, people bid on keywords so that people searching for keywords will see their ad.  In Knowledge.io ecosystem, we're collecting information and putting it on the blockchain about how people interface with topics (like keywords), and we score the correctness or incorrectness of answering questions related to those topics.  Many different apps and websites will act as publishers, like when a publisher puts a little snippet of code or installs the SDK for admob, they're showing Google ads.  Similarly, we have a similar javascript snippet and SDK that will allow publishers to display ads from our platform.  Our ads can be banners or Q&Ads.  Q&Ads are questions and answer format ads.  They will also be able to interface with APIs to include other content about topics directly within their apps and websites. Publishers who use our SDKs and APIs will earn tokens.  Advertisers will be able to reach out to users across these publishers who have our SDK/tags installed, and show ads to them either banners or Q&A format ads  In the common ad tech world lingo, the Knoweldge Score blockchain is like a Data Management Platform or DMP, but better  Historically, no one has been collecting the amount of knowledge or lack of knowledge people have about topics.  AI technology is just simply a mechanism for teaching a system how to learn and improve itself automatically over time. We do that too, and the systems that plug into us do that.  In fact, almost all ad tech companies nowadays do that to varying degrees.  Some companies call it machine learning, some call parts of it deep learning, some natural language processing, some computer vision, some speech processing, etc.... all of those fall within the scope of AI. We do all of those, and our plan calls to open a Lab on NLP, CV, Speech, ML, DL, and other AI.  There are also a bunch of tools out there that help with this which are readily available on various platofrms and open sourced, but we have bigger challenges that require a specialization focus around Q&A  We have an idea for pricing. It won't be done at auction in the beginning, it'll be fixed price like paying CPC or CPM, but not at auction. Over time as more competition enters the platform, we'll switch to an auction model.  You could assume relatively competitive ad rates to what's out there today, at a premium for the Q&Ads part of it.  Most of the platforms out there that claim AI are implementing some form or technique to analyze content and train computers how to learn. AI is a wide term with a lot of scope. Ours is challenging and interesting because we deal with questions and answers.  Scoring correctness or accuracy is definitely a challenge in the world of AI. Imagine being able to ingest a textbook and turn it automatically into Q&A sets, or listening to speech and figuring out which are questions and answers, or seeing images or video and generating Q&A sets about it.  We'll be working on those things in the lab.  So the ad tech platform is the underlying tool to get the best messaging to the best audiences. It applies to commerce, education and employment content.  Publishers earn tokens based on a similar concept to bitcoin pool mining.  In our system, the publishers are like mining pools, and their users/visitors are like the individual miners.  The publisher earns like what a mining pool would, and the individual miners earn based on their contribution of Q&A correct answers (similar to hashrate), proportionally based on their contribution to the pool.  In education it's a bit different.  We have an app generator which will allow schools, educators and students to be able to earn tokens. Schools and teachers add content/questions, and students answer it.  In Education, students earn tokens as they study and take quizzes on all subjects at every level of education for every topic taught in every school in every language (over time). The schools and educators enter the Q&A content and they earn tokens, as well.  Experts will validate the correctness of the answers.  We call these experts Knowledge Stars.  They're proven experts, because they've already answered a ton of questions correctly on various topics, and there's a record of it on the blockchain.  Knowledge Stars earn extra tokens.  In Employment, advertiser employers will be able to target people with high levels of skill on topics related to the job.",False

I'm Steve, and I head up product at Knowledge.io.  Since our platform is very much an ad tech platform, we will be attracting major advertiser brands onto the system.  Advertisers currently do not have any mechanism for targeting people based on how much or how little someone knows about their brand or their products.  This is quite an innovation in the world of ad tech, and we've filed a patent on putting these Knowledge Scores on the blockchain.  Advertisers will be able to buy advertising across the network of publishers who install our SDK/APIs, just like other ad tech platforms out there.  Most apps and websites are monetized through advertising, and all of them implement a similar sort of SDK/API.  They're sometimes called ad tags.  Down the road, we will have our own buying platform that allows us to show ads across the entire programmatic exchange ecosystem via programmatic direct buys or real-time bidding (RTB).  Many of the largest advertisers on the internet are in fact ecommerce retailers.  So, many of these retailers will choose to open a store within the marketplace, and will upload their entire ecommerce site's product inventory into our marketplace where Knowledge token holders will be able to buy pretty much any of the products sold directly on the ecommerce retailer's websites, except they'll purchase them using KNW tokens.  Think of it as similar to an Ebay Store of Amazon Store from a major brand.  Additionally, those people who end up earning high Knowledge Scores by answering many questions correctly about topics associated with the products from these retailers will be able to earn more tokens by becoming Knowledge Stars who act like influencers on the marketplace.  Knowledge Stars will provide ratings, reviews, videos like unboxing and installation videos, etc. which will appear alongside the product listings within the marketplace.  So, to answer your question, over time, pretty much everything.",False

I mean if this can examine the knowledge and intelligence of a person then I think this should be bought by websites that really want to be secure and safe and ofcourse if they want their distributions, campaigns and bounties to be taken by one person at a time to be fair in all. Knowledge Token can also be very useful for teachers to know more about their student, I mean talking to them might be better but I think if the child doesn't interact always, i think it is better to have this for more accuracy.
