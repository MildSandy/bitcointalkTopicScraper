I am a complete noob to the medical field but managed to learn some interesting things! For example, I learned what the Aortic Arch is.  This was made possible by easy links to wikipedia:     Your platform was easy enough for someone like me to use and benefit from. So that tells me:  - It is intuitive, simple, and very easy to use - Has a vast amount of information that is easily accessible. - Has an interactive element to it that can facilitate learning.  Some things that stood out that could be improved:  - I wonder how useful it would be to just have students follow links to Wikipedia? Wouldn't it be better to have more academic links? I suppose the student can find academic references through the wikipedia pages but direct links to scholarly works seems appropriate.  - I'm not sure about the technical side of things, but the platform did seem to take a long time to load between categories.  I assume it is because of the large files that you can interact with.  If so, and nothing can be done, that is acceptable.  However, I imagine a medical student having to cover vast amounts of information at a time.  With each page taking 30 sec to a minute to load, that is a lot of wasted time for the student.  Overall, I would say it is a terrific platform, especially when you consider that it is in Beta.  You can use this open testing of the platform to attract more investors.  It has certainly changed my mind about whether I should consider investing your company.",False

This platform is so inspirational and I can tell that this can be very helpful to those who are in the medical industry, especially the radiologists. They can rely on the platform for more resources of knowledge and easy access to the information. I hope that everyone can realize that so you can gain more investors to make this project happen. This is amazing. More power to you, Team. Good luck!",False

I guess not everything is editable yet since I already clicked on two images I couldn't work with in the drawing area but the imaging tools worked and I also liked the possibilty to capture the picture directly from the browser instead of using snipping tool. About the window tools I wanted to ask if it's possible to select the option by clicking on ""lung"" for example and deselecting by clicking on it again instead of the reset button.  Before I suggested to highlight the strenghts of your project and by giving us a look into the beta and having such a current state is already impressing and I think a lot more can be expected by this project. I hope some influencers will find this and like the idea as I did. Here one image I captured with the image tool.",False
