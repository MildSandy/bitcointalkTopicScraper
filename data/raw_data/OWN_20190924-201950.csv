Welcome to the World’s ultimate BlockChain based data exchange platform! Owndata is a crypto marketplace for data sellers and buyers.  How owndata works?  Collection of Data Site Owners/Editors have to sign up and get a Owndata user account in order to register their websites to OwnData BlockChain Platform. Owndata generates a unique pixel code (unique cookie) for each website in return. The addition of this unique cookie to a web site, immediately enables the collection of visitors’ data. Segmentation & Profilisation of Data Thanks to the user-friendly interface, Owndata users can flexibly segment the collected visitors’ data however they (or the buyer) would like to take. Besides, it also allows the users to integrate their own algorithm for a deeper profilisation & retargeting. Such a flexibility paves the way to automatically tokenize and sell the segmented data to buyers on the OwnData exchange platform  Who can benefit from owndata?  Owndata is for content owners, website editors, application developers, advertisers, publishers, data suppliers, data exchanges, ad networks, DSPs, DMPs and more!  Which parties will take part in Owndata ecosystem?  Site Owners: Users or companies who stores Unique Cookies to the system via Owndata Script in their website. Data Wallet: Wallet that stores the Unique Data Cookies in the system in exchange for Owndata Coins. Unique Data Cookie: Unique Data Cookie collected via Owndata Script in the visited page. Owndata Coin: CryptoCurrency of the Owndata Ecosystem. DMP: Data Management Platforms buy Data from Data Wallets of Website Owners’ in exchange for Owndata Coins. DSP: Demand Side Platforms buy Data from Data Wallets of Website Owners in exchange for Owndata Coins. Pricing: Revenue per Unique Data Cookie is highest at 0-100M data range. Early adopters will get more coins for their data. As the amount of data in the ecosystem increases, the revenue earned decreases accordingly. When Owndata opens to the exchanges, the value of users’ earned coins will be priced by market demand.  How to make the ultimate profit from owndata?  The Bounty Program of Owndata is very  simple: The earlier you bring data, the higher you earn! Since early adopters collect more unique cookie and more unique cookie means more reward, hurry up and join the competition from now on.  How can I get started?
