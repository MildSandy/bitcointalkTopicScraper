We wanted to introduce ourselves to the Bitcointalk community:  We are 8gig - an extensible, low-code platform and developer ecosystem powered by blockchain.  Our goal is to disrupt the digital transformation movement by providing the tools to accelerate work and save money in the process. IDC estimates that $2 trillion will be spent on digital transformation on an annual basis worldwide by 2020, and Forrester Research estimates that low-code platform's share of this will be $22 billion annually.  We achieve this by combining a modern platform, robust developer network and a token powered economy to propel software development efforts forward in an exponential manner.   https://preview.ibb.co/nveQF9/Screen_Shot_2018_08_06_at_10_47_31_AM_copy.png   Our low-code development platform, the 8base Serverless Chassis, helps front-end developers build, deploy and scale modern applications. The Serverless Chassis offers developers access to a robust, enterprise-grade backend-as-a-service that encapsulates most of the complex tasks related to building and hosting software. Developers build new applications and their underlying data models in excess of 10 times faster than they could using traditional approaches, for a fraction of the up-front and recurring expense. We make it possible to approach software architecture from a blockchain agnostic perspective while easily incorporating the blockchain of choice into your applications.  The 8gig Developer Network serves the digital transformation ecosystem in two manners: 1) To create their own new innovations that are added to the Serverless Chassis, extending the capabilities of the Platform, and distributed on the 8gig Marketplace to other developers on the network. This ability to continually enhance the platform through a crowd-sourced approach creates exponential growth of the platform’s capabilities to the benefit of all who use it, developers and end users alike.; and 2) To respond to specific, one-time development requests, or gigs, that are posted by business customers. The Developer Network is underpinned by a blockchain-based, fully-verifiable reputation score that is assigned to all users on the Network based on the quality of their contributions.  The third ingredient of the 8gig approach is the Piece of 8 Token-Powered Economy. Through a user-friendly staking mechanism to align incentives of different parties, developers on the 8gig network are incentivized to innovate and respond to development gigs by earning tokens. These tokens also facilitate the administration of a token-curated registry of extensions made to the Serverless Chassis by developers, which, after validation by other users, may be included in the 8gig marketplace and made available to other developers for a fee. Lastly, customers can also stake tokens to receive ongoing discounts as they utilize Serverless Chassis to host applications on the platform.  We are very excited about what we are building and hope that you are too! Join us on our journey of creating a new future for software development!   Read our entire introduction blog post here!
