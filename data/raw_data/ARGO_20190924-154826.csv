Project that will help brands from most countries to establish a long lasting emotional liaison with customers.  ARGO is ready to lead at the new market. The market of AR solutions  What about statistics? The financial potential of augmented reality market is enormous. The gap between US$ 11.4bn. to US$215bn. will be bridged in just 4 years.  Who we are We are AltWolf LLC, a team from Minsk (Belarus) with 10 years of IT-experience. We've been working on this project for the whole year. Right now we have a working MVP, we made a test launch with one of the shopping malls in Minsk - Galileo Mall. And here are the numbers: 3000 installers, 80% retention during 4 weeks.  Profit for users We all love sales and gifts (you've probably noticed it on Black Friday). And Gen-Z spends about 10 hours a day using smartphones. So, the best solution is to unite entertainment, social interactions and real bonuses from your favourite brands.  Profit for business You create a new channel for communication with young audience who is really blind for traditional ads. You establish long-lasting relations and create cool brand for gather your fans.  How it works? 1)     A user downloads the ARGO application and gets to the main screen with a list of gifts he/she can win by participating in quests, games, communicating with friends. Tapping on an image opens a map with objects and activities to reach them. 2)     The map shows the following locations: Community places for users to visit AR chat or meet new people; Quests to follow story missions using AR; AR playgrounds to compete in a variety of gaming skills. 3)     Tapping on AR button turns on the camera. The camera is used for capturing various objects, tasks, or games, e.g., a quest assignment. The mission having been completed, the respective button appears. Tapping on the button takes the bonus and sends the user back to the main menu. 4)     The main menu shows the related progress bar with bonus points added. Bonus points are added for each activity and assigned to the gift, as appropriate to the activity pursued. As soon as the required number of bonus points is won, “Pick up the Gift” button light sup, and the timer appears. 5)     “Pick up the Gift” button call sup the bar code. Code scanning and issue of gifts are effected at locations specified by the rules.  https://preview.ibb.co/myrGqn/phones.png  RoadMap Feb.2017. Concept development - DONE May 2017.

Thank you for your question.  1. The purpose is to create a new space for communication between brands and customers (especially young audience), including AR, gamification, real gifts and sales, communication.  2. It depends on your role: As an investore you get tokens (with bonuses for early pre-ICO, etc). So, there are quite many options to use them: As a user you can keep them and get gifts, sales, bonuses from brands As a business-owner you can use them to advertise your business as soon as ARGO is launched in your city As an investor you can sell them to business and users and get your profit. And for sure, you'll participate in completely new reality - practical and entertaining at the same time:)  3. We haven't found the same projects. Usually AR is used in games, but nobody links it to real needs of people and business. So, if you know anything similar, please share.",False
