I would like to explain about the early termination of pre-sale which most of you are curious about. While we were preparing for the pre-sale, we spent a lot of time coming up with methods to provide all our investors with equal investment opportunities. Among some of the roadblocks that we confronted while seeking the optimal solution was  Qtum’s long block generation time.  This issue troubled us the most as we judged that if too many participants were to be concentrated in a single block, Qtum’s long blocktime may change participation priority depending on the gas price.  In order to prevent this unnecessary competition, we set a fixed value for the gas price and made everyone participate in the pre-sale under the same condition. However, when the pre-sale actually started, we recognized that there were a number of transactions that were not processed properly.  Our development team was monitoring all of the transactions real-time and found out that most of the transactions that failed had their gas price set at 69, not 70. The real problem occurred when we found out that the percentage of people who invested with gas price of 69 was excessively high(53% of the total transactions, to be exact). At this point, we came to the conclusion that the gas price could have been modified due to network or wallet error, and that ongoing smart contract needed to be stopped immediately for investor protection. Therefore, we stopped the original smart contract and came up with a new smart contract address urgently that had no gas price limit and were finally able to resume the pre-sale. But as the pre-sale went on with the new smart contract address, the morality of creating a new smart contract address was questioned  within our team. We subsequently came to a conclusion that the second smart contract could go against our original principle of fairness and that the contract must be closed. This is why we terminated our pre-sale earlier than scheduled.  We are still running internal tests to understand the exact cause of sudden gas price change. All relevant information regarding this incident had already been passed to the Qtum foundation, and we are looking into the issue together  I would like to express my sincere gratitude to those that participated in our pre-sale and also apologize to those who were unable to do so. We will keep you updated on this issue.  I will talk briefly about our future operation plan. Adhering to our core principle of enlarging the blockchain industry and protecting investors’ assets, we will never resell our remaining tokens from the pre-sale. All unsold tokens(254,584,967 tokens) will be promptly burnt after the termination of ICO with a prior announcement.  Thank you.  Best regards, Ronny Yoo",False

Sorry for my misunderstanding, but what's the difference between public and ico? is that in one you invest in qtum, and in another you buy tokens?  No problem. The public presale is a capped, whitelisted sale with a lower cap of 400 QTUM and an upper cap of 2000 QTUM.  ICO is a sale without a lower cap, although there is likely an upper cap for the first few hours or so.  Other than that, there are no differences (in the sense that you are exchanging QTUM with APIS). Both sales will be conducted through our smart contract.

A masternode’s most distinctive feature is that any investor investing in a masternode can acquire stable and almost guaranteed profit just by locking up his/her money in the masternode for a fixed amount of time. However, despite its attractive characteristic, hosting a masternode is quite out of reach for most normal people since most masternodes require substantial amount of capital and intricate software engineering to set one up. By aiding these normal individuals come together to form a whole masternode, we will be able to encourage more people to participate in masternode investments as well as to provide them with much safer way of investing money rather than investing in the exchange market without adequate knowledge.   Token Sale     Our APIS Token Sale amount this time is 5,236,000,000 APIS which is 55% of the total APIS and it is worth 1,000,000 QTUM. Our sale this time will be divided into 3 main stages :   Private Offering Stage   Coins Allocated : 1,380,000,000 APIS / 240,000 QTUM  Many leaders of related field, companies and angel investors contributed to the establishment and development of the APIS platform. As a return for that, we are giving bonus of 15%. In other words,  1QTUM = 5,750APIS  The Total Cap for this stage is 240 ,000 QTUM.   Pre-sale Stage   Coins Allocated : 756,000,000 APIS / 140,000 QTUM As a means of appreciation for APIS early investors, we are planning to sell APIS through Qtum Smart Contract before the actual crowd sale begins. There will be 8% of bonus given.  1QTUM = 5,400 APIS  The Total Cap for this stage is 140,000 QTUM   Crowd Sale Stage   Coins Allocated : 3,100,000,000 APIS / 620,000 QTUM In the Crowd Sale stage, we are planning to sell APIS through Qtum Smart Contract.    1QTUM=5,000APIS  The Total Cap for this stage is 620,000 QTUM  In this stage, we will set-up global communities and get investments from the general public for the development of the APIS Platform.
