Meet the Rajce.io team, based in Europe. It is time to reveal the things that we have been doing before Hashbon idea was published to the masses. Our story started five years ago when Matbea.com had been released. Currently, it allows customers in Russia to work with cryptocurrencies safely and quickly  - deposit, withdraw, and make exchange. Matbea.com is a bitcoin wallet where you can buy or sell bitcoin at a favorable rate. It has a goal to provide a simple, convenient, and safe way to work with cryptocurrency absolutely for everyone. And we believe that more than 80000 registered users - is a really good achievement.  Then the owners decided to make things even faster and convenient for everyone - to develop Bitcoin-explorer, where anyone can see detailed information about all bitcoin transactions and blocks. Matbea.net, second project of Rajce.io team, was designed to provide Blockchain API with unique features where users can view relation between bitcoin exchange and bitcoin address free of charge. This service gathered information on more than 60 millions bitcoin addresses.  What could be the next step? Gefarapay.com, similar to Matbea.com was developed and released in 2016. It was targeted to conquer European Union. This project shows how to make store your cryptos in web in a very simple and safe way and make exchange at low fees. It has a strong legal side, which is essential while working in Europe, supplied with strong but simple KYC procedures and AML rules. And recently a new convenient option to make deposit with Visa and Mastercard was added. Team is planning to publish mobile version of gefarapay.com on iOS and Android very soon.  After those tremendous steps in developing blockchain solutions our team was actually shocked because of lack of good and reliable mobile app, that can help to find Bitcoin ATM all over the world. And thus meet the Bitmapp.org. Now you have reliable, fast, easy-to-use Bitcoin ATM map on your mobile. It has already 10000+ installations.  As we can see, Rajce.io team has a strong experience in blockchain world. Four projects that made themselves popular in five years. And now the team is preparing to rock blockchain community with Hashbon, they have all the needed instruments and experience to make it happen.  Stay tuned and we'll tell you about the real people behind Rajce.io team",False

As you may already know from our whitepaper, investors relations with business is not quite easy and always honest. Sometimes business finance reports are not truly represents current situation. It is done due to fear to lost investment, to hide huge material loses and for some other miserable reasons. Some people may remember Martin Shkrely - the most widely covered in the media some time ago. He tricked investors into investing in two MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare funds he founded, sending them fake bank statements and concealing significant losses. In addition, he provided false information to support the stock exchange price of the shares of the pharmaceutical company Retrophine. As a result, the loss, only from the action with shares of the company Retrophine, amounted up to 65 million dollars. If blockchain had been used those days, there won’t be such issues. Thanks to Hashbon, now we have such availability - to deploy reliable, honest, bullet-proof product, which can store actual information decentralized without any chance to be criminally substituted. Using Hashbon IRM public companies will increase the capitalization and value by making their business more transparent and less risky for public investors. Shareholders will get more tools for realization of their rights as an investors.  This solution provides following features: Simplified identification of the shareholder and his rights Increasing the transparency of the company and its attractiveness for investors Expansion of the range of investors due to simplification of the acquisition of tokenized shares Great possibility of tokenization and issuance of shares  Strength of multi-blockhchain framework together with Hashbon.com IRM platform is definitely capable to solve described problems.

Have you ever experienced difficulties in your investor/management relationships? Or maybe you’ve been struggling with organizing your financial statements? Have you already thought of universal solution that will keep your company’s data safe and transparent at the same time?  We’ve been pondering over the same issues ourselves and that’s how Hashbon came to life.  On the 26th of June we’re starting our ICO campaign for Hashbon.  Hashbon framework - is a universal platform for effective building applications and smart contracts that work on top of live public blockchains such as Bitcoin BTC, Litecoin and others. It will allow to build all sorts of blockchain applications that could be used for variety of business purposes. One important and interesting example is creating digital ecosystem for relationship between shareholders and management of public companies. Remember the Martin Shkrely case when he falsified bank statements and tricked investors into sponsoring his two funds? Hashbon will put an end to such affairs. The framework will allow investors to easily communicate with each other, request financial reports on a specific time period whilst all the data will be strictly confidential and completely transparent when necessary. It will also be a useful tool for improving company’s business strategy as it allows to gather and harmonize information about existing problems and find effective solutions. You can get acquainted with the project summary in onepager.     Who’s going to benefit from using Hashbon framework?  corporate business small and big picture investors company owners employees  Developing the framework together with real business application will make the framework more demandable and useful and eventually will lead to increasing P/E and stock price. All the detailed information is available in our whitepaper.  Hashbon has a strong and diversified team. We have been developing cryptocurrency related projects since 2013. Among them there’re crypto exchangers and wallets, ATM finder and Bitcoin explorer.
