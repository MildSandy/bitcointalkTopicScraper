The decision was made for the benefit and fairness of the broader community.  1. We want to avoid creating a gas war like many other projects. We believe it’s ridiculous for our supporters to pay $800USD in gas for an allocation of 1-2ETH or even less. While it’s not a big number for someone who comes in with 100ETH, but it does become a nightmare for those who are planning to contribute 1ETH or less, and we don’t think it’s fair.  With Dutch Auction's model, the cap on the first couple of days is set in a way so it couldn't be reached at all. This will make it possible for our early believers to support with whichever the purchase amount they like; and at the same time, be able to get in with a plenty of time. We hate to have our supporters stay up late at night, or have interference with their work and study because they are trying to squeeze into our tokensale, which would only last for a matter of minutes or a few hours. Our goal is to create a better and happier community, by achieving our vision of bringing cryptocurrency to the masses. Not introduction of misery at the very start of the project with tokensales. Furthermore, with Dutch Auction model, every buyer will be paying the same price per token at the end. If the last buyer in the auction was lucky enough to purchase GoToken at the cheapest price, then every single buyer will end up paying that lowest possible price. ",True

The decision was made for the benefit and fairness of the broader community.  1. We want to avoid creating a gas war like many other projects. We believe it’s ridiculous for our supportesrs to pay $800USD in gas for an allocation of 1-2ETH or even less. While it’s not a big number for someone who comes in with 100ETH, but it does become a nightmare for those who are planning to contribute 1ETH or less, and we don’t think it’s fair.  With Dutch Auction's model, the cap on the first couple of days is set in a way so it couldn't be reached at all. This will make it possible for our early believers to support with whichever the purchase amount they like; and at the same time, be able to get in with a plenty of time. We hate to have our supporters stay up late at night, or have interference with their work and study because they are trying to squeeze into our tokensale, which would only last for a matter of minutes or a few hours. Our goal is to create a better and happier community, by achieving our vision of bringing cryptocurrency to the masses. Not introduction of misery at the very start of the project with tokensales. Furthermore, with Dutch Auction model, every buyer will be paying the same price per token at the end. If the last buyer in the auction was lucky enough to purchase GoToken at the cheapest price, then every single buyer will end up paying that lowest possible price. ",True

We believe it’s ridiculous for our supportesrs to pay $800USD in gas for an allocation of 1-2ETH or even less. While it’s not a big number for someone who comes in with 100ETH, but it does become a nightmare for those who are planning to contribute 1ETH or less, and we don’t think it’s fair.  With Dutch Auction's model, the cap on the first couple of days is set in a way so it couldn't be reached at all. This will make it possible for our early believers to support with whichever the purchase amount they like; and at the same time, be able to get in with a plenty of time. We hate to have our supporters stay up late at night, or have interference with their work and study because they are trying to squeeze into our tokensale, which would only last for a matter of minutes or a few hours. Our goal is to create a better and happier community, by achieving our vision of bringing cryptocurrency to the masses. Not introduction of misery at the very start of the project with tokensales.

If the last buyer in the auction was lucky enough to purchase GoToken at the cheapest price, then every single buyer will end up paying that lowest possible price. ",True

The decision was made for the benefit and fairness of the broader community.  1. We want to avoid creating a gas war like many other projects. We believe it’s ridiculous for our supporters to pay $800USD in gas for an allocation of 1-2ETH or even less. While it’s not a big number for someone who comes in with 100ETH, but it does become a nightmare for those who are planning to contribute 1ETH or less, and we don’t think it’s fair.  With Dutch Auction's model, the cap on the first couple of days is set in a way so it couldn't be reached at all. This will make it possible for our early believers to support with whichever the purchase amount they like; and at the same time, be able to get in with a plenty of time. We hate to have our supporters stay up late at night, or have interference with their work and study because they are trying to squeeze into our tokensale, which would only last for a matter of minutes or a few hours. Our goal is to create a better and happier community, by achieving our vision of bringing cryptocurrency to the masses. Not introduction of misery at the very start of the project with tokensales. Furthermore, with Dutch Auction model, every buyer will be paying the same price per token at the end. If the last buyer in the auction was lucky enough to purchase GoToken at the cheapest price, then every single buyer will end up paying that lowest possible price. ",True

As adoption of blockchain technology grows, this problem will only get larger. To solve this, GoNetwork has developed a mobile network infrastructure for Ethereum and ERC20 tokens that would allow thousands of transactions per second.  Being able to scale to allow this many transactions simultaneously would have the effect of reducing the cost per transaction, and would be ideal for anyone who is creating their own business or application that requires fast and cheap transactions. Their idea was one of the winning submissions at the ETHWaterloo Hackathon.",True

Ans: the date and details of our presale and crowd sale has not been finalised- reason been that we didnt expect our telegram group to increase to about 7k+ members within 3 weeks without any marketing campaign, so now we need to fully prepare our ICO to make sure everything is properly set up with our lawyer. But we are targeting between early and mid December for this. We really need to slow things down now so that we can record a long term success.  2. Is KYC required for this investment?  Ans: yes  3. Are chinese, Canadian and US citizens allowed to participate?  Ans: No, except you are an accredited investor  4. I can see there is a limit of joining the crowdsale whitelist as between 10000-50000 USD can I invest out of this range?  Ans: well it depends, we are over subscribed now, too many requests for presale and we have to give people fair chances. Anyways if you can help us in certain ways then you can. We will announce this rule soon.  5. I registered for the crowd sale whitelist but I didn't  receive a confirmation email, is anything wrong, did I fill the form wrongly?  Ans: No, it doesn't mean you have filled the form wrongly, check your junk mail for the confirmation mail if it is not in your normal inbox. If peradventure you can't still find it there, then message your details to https://t.me/xuncai  6. I have applied for the airdrop since and I have not received my tokens, has distribution ended?  Ans: No, distribution has not started. Distribution of airdrop is after our ICO  7. I have been hearing much about this project but I am yet to fully know what the vision and roadmap is, where can I have access to this? Is there a place I can read the white paper?  Ans: yes, check our roadmap and white paper on our website @ https://go network.co and you can always get updated by joining our telegram announcement page @ https://t.me/gonetworkAnn",True

GoNetwork is creating, a highly scalable, low cost mobile first network infrastructure for Ethereum.  We have a strong team – we recently won Worlds' Largest Ethereum Hackathon called ETHWaterloo. The hackathon brought together crypto’s smartest minds - over 400 participant from 32 countries participated. The judges included notable names in the blockchain community including; Vitalik Buterin, Jeff Coleman, Brian Bondy, Joseph Lubin, Dmitry Buterin to name a few.  Our Advisors are involved deeply with the team and are among the leaders in industry. With a history of delivering products at scale, a team rooted in industry leaders across Google, Amazon and Tinder, strong ties to academic circles including the University of Waterloo.  GoNetwork is creating a low-cost, low-latency and scalable network for Ethereum that will be used by mass mobile, desktop and web platforms. The technology today, although revolutionary, has some important challenges that need to be resolved in order to serve the mass consumer markets. The number of transactions that most popular cryptocurrencies can handle is minuscule compared to what's needed for the technology to be effectively used at scale. Our goal is to solve these issues by creating a strong team and investing heavily in research and development while considering strong business use cases. Our alpha is currently available at https://gonetwork.co/page-mvp.html.  Mobile web browsing has overtaken desktop. Google has said it is now bigger on mobile than on desktop in 10 countries. More than half of Facebook users now connect to the site with just a mobile phone. Mobile has become the primary device for the masses. GoNetworks belief centers on the fact that Ethereum, ERC20 tokens  and cryptocurrencies in general require mobile accessibility and interoperability to gain mass adoption. Our prime objective is to build a fast, cheap and scalable mobile first off-chain transaction network for Ethereum. We will accomplish this by implementing state channel technology to our network; while focusing on adapting the methods to mobile platforms .  To achieve this vision, and bring cryptocurrency to the masses, we will take the following steps: Build the infrastructure that can scale Ethereum to massive transactions per seconds on mobile. Use GoNetwork to deliver a strong use case; GoExchange, a virtual goods commerce platform, that will show the capacity of our infrastructure.   Implement GoExchange in all Infinidy games and dubsquad.me app (cumulative download of over 15 Million) Develop the pocket product to penetrate the commerce market.
