Your thought is very important for us.  Crystals platform doesn't have anything to do prostitution. In fact, illegal activities of this sort are impossible to conduct in our service by design. At CRYSTALS, we want to give every service performer a chance to be an entrepreneur on his own. Moreover, we want to say that the nature of model's work will be determined individually through the negotiations between the model and the client. For our part, we will protect both the client and the model through our KYC which, together with the transparency offered by the blockchain enhances safety of each and every deal, while also protecting funds of each side of the deal. Via KYC we will identify whether the person is real, after that all of them will be held responsible for their actions and doings.  Moreover, our legal team works tirelessly to make sure we'll comply with all of the legal requirements of different markets that we're planning to enter.",False

Talking about the procedure of double-authorization protocol, it is rather simple and logic. This double-authorization protocol includes the following two steps: searching/booking and a transaction confirmation.  At first, a model have to negotiate the booking with a client. After that client's funds will be immediately transferred from his account into our CRS token smart contract. This funds will be frozen on our CRS smart contract until the booking is confirmed. After the reaching verbal confirmation between the client and the service provider, the client will need to give a final confirmation to the tokens' transaction through our mobile app. Only after that the tokens will be instantly sent to performer's account.  Besides, in case CRS token system doesn't receive confirmation, the funds are automatically returned to the customer's account and the agreement is terminated.",False

CRYSTALS project is a platform that does not provide modeling services directly and our law consultants identified that in most cases, we will not face many barriers in major markets.  The other issue arises from service providers and modeling agencies. In CRYSTALS, we are firmly against any illegal activities, human trafficking or child labor. That is why we will establish a manual verification system. Each services provider will need to pass their age verification and online interview for us to eliminate potential risks. Operation costs article is included in our fund distribution strategy exactly for maintaining support and verification systems within the CRYSTALS platform.  From the customer's point of view, most modeling platforms today offer an overwhelmingly aggressive, complicated, and vulgar user experience. So the first thing that our customer will notice is that CRYSTALS is not like any other industry’s representative. With its modern, light, and welcoming design, it will move customers to explore and make use of the platform.

Talking about the procedure of double-authorization protocol, it is rather simple and logic. This double-authorization protocol includes the following two steps: searching/booking and a transaction confirmation.  At first, a model have to negotiate the booking with a client. After that client's funds will be immediately transferred from his account into our CRS token smart contract. This funds will be frozen on our CRS smart contract until the booking is confirmed. After the reaching verbal confirmation between the client and the service provider, the client will need to give a final confirmation to the tokens' transaction through our mobile app. Only after that the tokens will be instantly sent to performer's account.  Besides, in case CRS token system doesn't receive confirmation, the funds are automatically returned to the customer's account and the agreement is terminated.",False

Based on a blockchain technology, we have developed a decentralized and private double-authorization protocol that combines all the benefits of cash and online transactions while eliminating almost all risks for each party involved.  When a customer wants to arrange for a meeting with a model, he/she creates a pending order for a service provider. As a booking is made, funds will be immediately transferred from client's account into our CRS token smart contract. In order to complete the 1st step of authorization the service performer will need to confirm the booking. At this stage, the client's funds are frozen on our CRS smart contract until further confirmation.  Providing that the 1st step of double-authorization has been done, the customer and service provider will have to meet in person to agree upon the details of the order and reach a verbal confirmation. If everything is discussed and agreed, the client will need to give a final confirmation to the tokens transaction. He/she will be able to do that through our mobile app afterwards the tokens will be instantly sent to performer's account. The 2nd authorization step is completed. In case CRS token system doesn't receive confirmation, the funds are automatically returned to the customer's account and the agreement is terminated.",False

In the current business environment, individual service performers face several limitations. First of all, most of the similar platforms work as a chargeable bulletin board. In other words, they charge models fixed fees on a weekly or monthly basis for which, in return, they enlist individuals on the website. However, this system is proven to be inefficient and does not guarantee any financial gain for service performers. In CRYSTALS, we consider this approach as outdated and more often than not, fraudulent. That is why we will charge all service providers a commission only upon a successfully executed service order.  Registration and listing will be done under our support and free of charge. Models will be granted full access to our distribution and marketing channels. Besides, they will be able to see complete statistical information about their profile, including orders and views. In exchange, we will deduct a commission of 4-10%, depending on the market where we operate. This commission will only be inferred from a completed order made through our platform.  On the other hand, blockchain technology behind the payment system in CRYSTALS can avoid unfair practices related to money transfers in modeling industry. That is why CRS token is the only payment method within the CRYSTALS ecosystem, which guarantees privacy, decentralization, and protection to all users of the network. On the other hand, blockchain allows any user of the system to see all transactions and account balances. At CRYSTALS, we do not want any of the performers to be a subject of provocation. That is why we will develop a cryptocurrency’s smart contract that will hide the performer’s account balance from the client and other users.",False

This funds will be frozen on our CRS smart contract until the booking is confirmed. After the reaching verbal confirmation between the client and the service provider, the client will need to give a final confirmation to the tokens' transaction through our mobile app. Only after that the tokens will be instantly sent to performer's account.  Besides, in case CRS token system doesn't receive confirmation, the funds are automatically returned to the customer's account and the agreement is terminated.",False

As a booking is made, funds will be immediately transferred from client's account into our CRS token smart contract. In order to complete the 1st step of authorization the service performer will need to confirm the booking. At this stage, the client's funds are frozen on our CRS smart contract until further confirmation.  Providing that the 1st step of double-authorization has been done, the customer and service provider will have to meet in person to agree upon the details of the order and reach a verbal confirmation. If everything is discussed and agreed, the client will need to give a final confirmation to the tokens transaction. He/she will be able to do that through our mobile app afterwards the tokens will be instantly sent to performer's account. The 2nd authorization step is completed. In case CRS token system doesn't receive confirmation, the funds are automatically returned to the customer's account and the agreement is terminated.",False

In the current business environment, individual service performers face several limitations. First of all, most of the similar platforms work as a chargeable bulletin board. In other words, they charge models fixed fees on a weekly or monthly basis for which, in return, they enlist individuals on the website. However, this system is proven to be inefficient and does not guarantee any financial gain for service performers. In CRYSTALS, we consider this approach as outdated unprotected more often than not, fraudulent. That is why we will charge all service providers a commission only upon a successfully executed service order.  Registration and listing will be done under our support and free of charge. Models will be granted full access to our distribution and marketing channels. Besides, they will be able to see complete statistical information about their profile, including orders and views. In exchange, we will deduct a commission of 4-10%, depending on the market where we operate. This commission will only be inferred from a completed order made through our platform.  On the other hand, blockchain technology behind the payment system in CRYSTALS can avoid unfair practices related to money transfers in modeling industry. That is why CRS token is the only payment method within the CRYSTALS ecosystem, which guarantees privacy, decentralization, and protection to all users of the network. On the other hand, blockchain allows any user of the system to see all transactions and account balances. At CRYSTALS, we do not want any of the performers to be a subject of provocation. That is why we will develop a cryptocurrency smart contract that will hide the performer’s account balance from the client and other users.",False

The reason we chose Ethereum blockchain is that, launched in 2015, Ethereum is a decentralized software platform that enables Smart Contracts and Distributed Applications (DApps) to be built and run without any downtime, fraud, control or interference from a third party. Ethereum is not just a platform but also a programming language (Turing complete) running on a blockchain, helping developers to build and publish distributed applications.

It happened before when modeling-related applications were not accepted by the App Store and Google Play Market. We are already working on several solutions regarding that. One of which will include a self-signed certificate that any user can easily install on their mobile device.  CRYSTALS will provide all new users with a prepaid encrypted cryptocurrency wallet. Similar to a prepaid card, customers will need to transfer the CRS token into our platform from his primary account to the prepaid account on our website. When client decided on his choice, he creates a pending order for the service provider. The order will have to include all necessary details, such as a type of a date, time, service needed etc. Immediately after booking is done, funds will be transferred from clients’ account into our CRS token smart contract. It is the 1st step of our double-authorization function.  At this point, the customer knows that his money is in safe, blocked by smart-contract, and can be easily refunded. Since there is a commission on using Ethereum-based token transaction of 0.30-0.40 cents, the number of fake bookings or cancellations from the customer side will be limited. CRYSTALS platform is entirely free for all users. However, these transaction fees bring seriousness to all bookings. The booking then should be approved by the performer. The approval notification will reach both parties to the agreement. At this stage, money is held between both parties of the agreement. The decentralized blockchain system allows this be controlled neither by CRYSTALS team nor by any of the agreement party.",False

Our  forecasted values are based on assumptions provided below, where we use minimal or lowered down indexes, which allow us to remain on the conservative side but with significant upside potential. Please note that all figures are subject to changes and are based on current industry statistics, which are very scarce and difficult to come by:  We expect the conversion rate of all users to be roughly 75%;  Total orders are calculated assuming that each user will perform at least 2 orders per year;  The average check is lowered down to USD 400. However, based on our industry research, this will be most probably doubled;  Gross margin for similar online platforms, without significant inventories, is between 85-90%. However, due to the high capital expenditure to support chain and legal consultations, we estimate CRYSTALS gross margin to be a minimum of 75%.",False

As a booking is made, funds will be immediately transferred from client's account into our CRS token smart contract.

At this stage, the client's funds are frozen on our CRS smart contract until further confirmation. W  Providing that the 1st step of double-authorization has been done, the customer and service provider will have to meet in person to agree upon the details of the order and reach a verbal confirmation. If everything is discussed and agreed, the client will need to give a final confirmation to the tokens transaction. He/she will be able to do that through our mobile app afterwards the tokens will be instantly sent to performer's account. The 2nd authorization step is completed. In case CRS token system doesn't receive confirmation, the funds are automatically returned to the customer's account and the agreement is terminated.",False

In CRYSTALS we will dedicate a lot of attention to the legal procedures and honesty of the service provided through our platform. CRYSTALS project is a platform that does not provide modeling services directly and our law consultants identified that in most cases, we will not face many barriers in major markets. The other issue arises from service providers and modeling agencies. In CRYSTALS, we are firmly against any illegal activities, human trafficking or child labor. That is why we will establish a manual verification system. Each services provider will need to pass their age verification and online interview for us to eliminate potential risks. Operation costs article is included in our fund distribution strategy exactly for maintaining support and verification systems within the CRYSTALS platform. From the customer's point of view, most modeling platforms today offer an overwhelmingly aggressive, complicated, and vulgar user experience. So the first thing that our customer will notice is that CRYSTALS is not like any other industry’s representative. With its modern, light, and welcoming design, it will move customers to explore and make use of the platform. What is more important than design is the privacy and security we offer our target audiences. At CRYSTALS, we clearly understand that due to the nature of the services provided, both our partners and our clients are susceptible to all aspects of privacy. For this reason, our project is directly connected to our self-developed token, CRS. Based on the technology of cryptocurrencies double authorization powered by our smart contract",False

When a customer wants to arrange for a meeting with a model, he/she creates a pending order for a service provider. As a booking is made, funds will be immediately transferred from client's account into our CRS token smart contract. In order to complete the 1st step of authorization the service performer will need to confirm the booking. At this stage, the client's funds are frozen on our CRS smart contract until further confirmation.  Providing that the 1st step of double-authorization has been done, the customer and service provider will have to meet in person to agree upon the details of the order and reach a verbal confirmation. If everything is discussed and agreed, the client will need to give a final confirmation to the tokens transaction. He/she will be able to do that through our mobile app afterwards the tokens will be instantly sent to performer's account. The 2nd authorization step is completed. In case CRS token system doesn't receive confirmation, the funds are automatically returned to the customer's account and the agreement is terminated.",False

We are also planning to cooperate with corporate partners and agencies in order to be promoted through their platforms.

A token is a special frame that is passed from node to node around a ring network. When it gets to a node that needs to transmit data, the node changes the token into a data frame and transmits it to the recipient. A token is essential to the inner workings of a token ring network.  The token can only be handled by a single node at a time. The bearer of the token is the only one allowed to send data around the network to a recipient node within the network. The bearer of the token writes the address of the recipient and the data to be sent, and then sends it to the next node in the series. ( In our case, tokens will be used in order to pay for some service provided within CRYSTALS ecosystem).  The CRS token is the only payment method that will be accepted in the CRYSTALS ecosystem. The CRS is based on ERC20 smart contract protocol, which, however, is modified according to our project needs. As it was explained before, he unique function of CRYSTAL Token is a double authorization of every transaction. This is a key feature that makes it possible for us to bring the highest level of security, privacy, and convenience to the customers and service providers. More about it you can read on our whitepaper: https://du3m9xzpbu52i.cloudfront.net/whitepaper.pdf",False

This platform is made to be the first ever software for the modeling industry with the use of blockchain and shared economy principles.  At CRYSTALS, we believe that in the 21st century, everyone should be able to be an entrepreneur on his own. As it can be seen, platforms such as Uber and Airbnb created a whole new concept of realizing unused individual assets in order to generate extra income. On the other hand, we have seen how online distribution channels such as Booking.com and Skyscanner changed the world of marketing for the tourism industry. Applying the same principles of shared economy and online distribution, CRYSTALS will become a tool for both.  The idea of CRYSTALS is to become an intermediary between service providers and their clients. This business model will not require high investments for investors to grow with minimal risk. This way, CRYSTALS will not provide any modeling services directly but will organize and support a secured, convenient, blockchain-based platform for this business.  Moreover, this will decrease the legal responsibility of the platform without decreasing the level of control of operations. Modeling industry is a very sensitive field and in CRYSTALS, we will dedicate a lot of attention to the legal procedures and honesty of the service provided through our platform.",False

However, based on our industry research, this will be most probably doubled;  Gross margin for similar online platforms, without significant inventories, is between 85-90%.

It is expected to have more than 550 thousand users, 25 thousand active services performers, 825 thousand orders per year and 4 different platforms generating 26 million USD in revenue by the third year of operations.

At CRYSTALS, we believe that in the 21st century, everyone should be able to be an entrepreneur on his own.

This way, CRYSTALS will not provide any modeling services directly but will organize and support a secured, convenient, blockchain-based platform for this business. Moreover, this will decrease the legal responsibility of the platform without decreasing the level of control of operations.

CRYSTALS is a complete ecosystem that provides a full-service cycle for private modeling clients, models, and agencies. This platform is made to be the first ever software for the modeling industry with the use of blockchain and shared economy principles.  At CRYSTALS, we believe that in the 21st century, everyone should be able to be an entrepreneur on his own. As it can be seen, platforms such as Uber and Airbnb created a whole new concept of realizing unused individual assets in order to generate extra income. On the other hand, we have seen how online distribution channels such as Booking.com and Skyscanner changed the world of marketing for the tourism industry. Applying the same principles of shared economy and online distribution, CRYSTALS will become a tool for both.  The idea of CRYSTALS is to become an intermediary between service providers and their clients. This business model will not require high investments for investors to grow with minimal risk. This way, CRYSTALS will not provide any modeling services directly but will organize and support a secured, convenient, blockchain-based platform for this business.  Moreover, this will decrease the legal responsibility of the platform without decreasing the level of control of operations. Modeling industry is a very sensitive field and in CRYSTALS, we will dedicate a lot of attention to the legal procedures and honesty of the service provided through our platform.  The project ecosystem is based on our CRS Token, which is the only accepted payment method. Based on a blockchain technology, we have developed a decentralized and private double-authorization protocol that combines all the benefits of cash and online transactions while eliminating almost all risks for each party involved.  CRYSTALS Token (CRS) allows customers to pay securely, privately, and quickly for all services listed in the CRYSTALS ecosystem.

The CRYSTALS ecosystem provides a full user-friendly service for customers and performers through two main products: CRYSTALS website and mobile app companion. It happened before when modeling-related applications were not accepted by the App Store and Google Play Market. We are already working on several solutions regarding that. One of which will include a self-signed certificate that any user can easily install on their mobile device. CRYSTALS will provide all new users with a prepaid encrypted cryptocurrency wallet. Similar to a prepaid card, customers will need to transfer the CRS token into ourplatform from his primary account to the prepaid account on our website. When client decided on his choice, he creates a pending order for the service provider. The order will have to include all necessary details, such as a type of a date, time, service needed etc. Immediately after booking is done, funds will be transferred from clients’ account into our CRS token smart contract. It is the 1st step of our double-authorization function. At this point, the customer knows that his money is in safe, blocked by smart-contract, and can be easily refunded. Since there is a commission on using Ethereum-based token transaction of 0.30-0.40 cents, the number of fake bookings or cancellations from the customer side will be limited. CRYSTALS platform is entirely free for all users. However, these transaction fees bring seriousness to all bookings. The booking then should be approved by the performer. The approval notification will reach both parties to the agreement. At this stage, money is held between both parties of the agreement. The decentralized blockchain system allows this be controlled neither by CRYSTALS team nor by any of the agreement party. This ensures the highest level of privacy for everyone because all transactions are done without human interaction. Upon the meeting, service performer has the right to a final decision. If everything is confirmed, a service provider will need to ask a client to confirm the transaction through his mobile app by simply pressing the button. CRS blockchain system will automatically recognize this confirmation as a 2nd authorization step immediately unblocks the money and transfer it to the associated account. Service performer will be able to see an instant credit on her or his account. This is the most crucial step of the platform. By eliminating usual cash transaction, CRYSTALS eliminates all related risks. In addition to all functions, CRYSTALS platform will operate an advanced rating system. This system will allow clients to search for the most relevant offers faster and easier. Apart from usual search parameters, all performers will be listed in accordance with various factors, such as level of verification, popularity, rating and relativity. On the other hand, the smart engine behind this rating and search platform will be able to analyze each service provider’s performance and suggest necessary step for increasing the number of orders. Therefore, everyone will have an equal competitive environment and will be motivated to work with the CRYSTALS platform.",False
