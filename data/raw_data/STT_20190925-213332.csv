We decided to gather some most frequently asked questions and ask these questions to the project founder of “Synthestech” project Vladislav Karabanov.  Vladislav, how will construction of the laboratory complex affect the development of the project?  Our laboratory complex performs several key tasks. The main role is a tool in which we can solve technical issues of the project. We need to have the full range of equipment and tools for work. Without this, project development is delayed, and something is generally difficult to implement. We need a serious workshop to create the details of our installations. We need certain conditions for operation of our installations, — observance of temperature, air, energy, and so on. Having our own center greatly accelerates our work. And some problems in general can not be solved somewhere else, except in such a complex, which construction we are already finishing.  That’s why, a laboratory center is a must have. After it will be possible to work in our center, the project will go very quickly forward and I hope there will be a quick result. We have no reason to postpone. By the way, the speed of construction proves this.  What is the current state of the project?  Understanding of natural principles, analytical laboratory and experimental base allow us to set and solve technical tasks. We have found several key solutions and the task is only to realize everything correctly. Here I want to add that not only platinum metals can turn out to be valuable elements. Other elements with valuable qualities and correspondingly demanded at very high prices can be obtained.  Prospects are clear. Regarding development, we have a very great progress. We already have the tools and the base, which we did not have earlier. This is a project shift into a completely new quality. At the same time, at this stage, we gained additional knowledge. In fact, we are approaching the phase of production.  Cold fusion has not yet received recognition of official science. How scientifically justified are works in the field of Cold Nuclear Transmutation?  The recognition is already received and for a long time. Simply, it does not look like an application to the public with an official press release. But works in this field are already planned . On the other hand, when this recognition becomes universal, it will be senseless to engage in this field. When everyone acknowledged that the Earth was round, Columbus had already discovered America.  In fact the question with Cold Transmutation of Nuclei was very interesting. Some clever men decided that as they did not want to see this point-blank, it does not exist . On the basis of Cold Synthesis all nature and life processes are built, but it was avoided to be seen. There is a reason to believe that the development of research on this topic was primarily hampered because of attempts to prevent the creation of power plants using the energy of Cold Synthesis. There were interested parties. They are still there. That’s why, by the way, we chose the path of obtaining valuable chemical elements, not energy.  How will the project develop after the creation of a laboratory center?  We will create a series of experimental installations for Cold fusion and within 3–4 months we will test them for effectiveness in obtaining target platinum elements as well as other elements. After this we will move in three directions in the process.  First of all, we will produce a small number of elements for testing biological potential. That is for medicine. If our expectations are confirmed, we will find a manufacturer to produce dietary supplements based on our raw materials. This should work and this covers a huge market in billions of dollars.  Secondly, we will observe what else we interesting will be obtained in the elements. There not quite the usual isotopic composition of elements may occur, and it can cost thousands and tens of thousands of dollars per gram.  Thirdly, we will decide the precise issue of platinum production.  Based on the received results in these areas, we will choose the most effective way.  In any case, we will gradually grow into a large corporation. I suppose in a very huge one. Now we have such a period as earlier Google or Apple have — such a garage stage. But ahead expansion is awaiting us.  What is the plan by which investors participating in the project can get a profit?  Profit must be available from the start of production. But it is also formed as a result of the increased capitalization of the project as a result of the increased cost of the project, when our token cost will grow. This is also a profit. After all, the number of shares is limited, and the project, after receiving the first weight grams, will attract a lot of investors. We spend money very competently creating the material basis of the project. We already have serious assets — a building, an expensive analysis laboratory equipment. Assets exceed our liabilities. And we will go on so further.  Time will sort things out. Those investors who are with us from the very beginning and join to us now, will receive serious bonuses.  How dangerous in terms of environmental are installations and the process of Cold nuclear transmutation?  Nuclear processes occur in all living organisms on Earth, at the cellular level. Living organisms exist and function thanks to them. That’s why, in our case, it is an ecologically absolutely safe process, safe installation. Otherwise, living cells would die. Cold transmutation is a process where stable elements are obtained from stable elements. They can produce excess heat energy, some other excess energy relatively to natural processes. But these processes are safe. Cold fusion installations are a step towards sustainable production.  https://blog.synthestech.com/questions-to-the-head-of-synthestech-project-794de0ca2436",False

We have raised the required funds the project’s implementation and do not doubt the success.  Over a short period of time we have raised $ 681 508 (we hope that this is not the limit). This is the first stage of the 4 ones that we have planned. Unsold tokens will be frozen. Visit https://ico.synthestech.com   We understand the fears of investors of the mass market, who invest in secondary ideas and are afraid to invest in real breakthrough technologies. Moreover, we deliberately chose not to finance the marketing campaign of STT tokens in the mass market in order to spend the saved money on implementation of the first stages of the Synthestech research program. The mass market will reach out to us sooner or later, but, of course, it will have to pay a completely different price.    The Synthestech team is working hard every day on development of the project and we have already started implementation of our plans.  Since the beginning of the crowdfunding campaign, we have upgraded the basic LENR laboratory, completed it with the most modern laboratory of substance analysis.   Now we have high-precision equipment required for research - Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer, X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, special laboratory complex for analysis and extraction of chemical elements obtained through LENR transmutation. So now, we have the sufficient amount of tools for the further successful implementation of our project and we have already started further experimental work and creation of the pilot reactor.   Estimating the scope of the work already done and the scheduled one, in the autumn 2018, we are planning to produce a pilot reactor STR to start industrial production of platinum group elements. Creation of the industrial reactor STR will be the next cornerstone of our project. If we succeed, this will greatly increase the cost of STT tokens.     When scaling up and launching the industrial production of platinum, we plan to run the next round of Tokensale, let’s call it SCO (Secondary Coin Offering), its conditions we will develop additionally. At this point only one thing is clear, if the reactor STR proves to be successful, the cost of STT tokens at SCO stages will be significantly higher than during ICO. At the same time, you, as early investors, will get the best investment conditions or you can sell your tokens to new investors and make a profit.    Regarding the order of tokens distribution after the end of ICO, we will provide this information later.   We are confident that our project will be a great success and we thank you for your constant support. This undertaking will bring great profit to everybody!

We are happy to inform that we have raised the minimum amount of money required for the project kick-off.  We are grateful to everyone who has joined the project!   In this regard, we have started to equip the analytical laboratory with equipment, devices and tools. What makes our project different from the other developments in the field of LENR, is the focus on obtaining valuable elements.  Analytical chemistry plays here an important role. The laboratory equipment that we have purchased from well-known manufacturers is tailored to this task. The laboratory is being equipped with an Italian air filtration system FILTERBOX. This system will enable us to work with the necessary reagents for analytical purposes and subsequently certify the laboratory.  Also, we are waiting for the purchased Shimadzu X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometer to be delivered, as well as the tooling for it.   By April 25, 2018, the Materials Analysis Laboratory will be completely equipped in the renovated facilities and then we will proceed to pilot implementation actions. According to this, the roadmap has been updated specifying the earlier experimental work kick-off.   Despite the major activity decline in the cryptocurrency market, we see a keen interest and confidently keep on running the Synthestech crowdfunding campaign.   Today, March 26, 2018, we launch the 2nd ICO Round which will last 1 week until 02.04.18, and until then you have the opportunity to purchase STT tokens at a price of 1 USD for 1 STT with a 12.5% bonus.   The BONUS is available in Investor's Dashboard: my.synthestech.com                               Stay tuned and we will keep you updated on the latest project news.  ico.synthestech.com",False

Synthestech ICO has been very successful, meanwhile we are focused directly on our main work. The most essential part of this work is in-depth chemical analysis of Cold transmutation products.   Our main challenge was that we couldn’t carry out tests quickly and thoroughly enough. The institute analytical centers can’t provide an in-depth comprehensive analysis of our samples. We had to wait for weeks and months, and the further direction of our research work depended on these research results.   Now, we equip the laboratory with the most up-to-date Quadrupole ICP-MS - SPECTROMETER manufactured by AGILENT. This is a modern complex that measures concentrations of scattered elements (from Be to U) with fantastic accuracy and sensitivity. Most importantly, it can be used for isotopic analysis of substances. That puts our laboratory on the same level with the most modern centers for nuclear and geochemical research.    The expected delivery date is 15/04/2018, since then the pilot run, adjustment works and pilot experiments will be started. Further, the spectrometer will be used according to the work plan. This will enable us to quickly carry out accurate and high-quality analyzes of substances which we obtain through cold transmutation.    Today, 29/03/2018, we are running 2nd ICO phase until 01/04/2018, inclusive. You can still join the project and receive the 12.5% bonus.

(See the attached a photo of the spectrogram) As you say, about the theoretical part, your statement says that you have a very weak idea of science in the whole. Example: In 1906, General Electric bought a patent for an incandescent lamp and started serial production. They earned billions, but they had no idea about the quantum nature of the electron shells of the tungsten core, as well as about much more, but this did not stop them from making money on this invention.  Fundamental science requires a completely different level of investment, that is the reason why we are not interested in this.  ""The project is research-oriented?"" Ok, but then what dividends are you talking about? How will you get money for it? "" Dividends we can receive from:  1. Own production 2. Sales of license, 3. sales of technology 4. Sales of reactors, etc.  The period of time which we have stated is really short, but our preliminary results give a high degree of confidence in success. If we do not succeed, we will understand this quite soon.  ""And since there is only 3 months (!) allocated in your schedule to establish both serial production and profitable sales — you are living in the land of fairies or you just planning to escape with the money.""  This time is enough to organize pilot production and receive profit, no one talks about payback or operating profit, but profit is our goal. You can create large-scale production only if you know how to make a profit. This is also necessary to obtain further investment in the project.  You say that it is possible to escape somewhere in this world with other people's money - you are a very naive person, since this is impossible.  You have read the WP very inattentively, your accusations are groundless. We are ready to answer all questions.",False

So I don't understend your point, LENR has been known for more than 30 years. There are questions on physics behind it, but not the phenomenon itself. By now it is mainstream research, NASA, CERN recognize it and work in this field.  ""I can't find neither any published projects of your ""engineers"".   -  In your statement there is a contradiction. It is scientists who publish articles, not engineers. We don’t need publications, as we don’t do science, everything is already done befor us. We study the possibility of commercialization, it is applied research with biggest potential ever!  ""Poor equipment and lack of skills"" Your statement is unfounded and false. Our current laboratory was visited by the most famous scientists in the world working in the field of LENR and found it to be very modern and technologically well-equipped. Parkhomov once mentioned our laboratory at one of his seminars calling it vey technologically advanced. At the initial stage of our work, we were able to repeat all the experiments described in the LENR field, so our experimental experience is colossal. We worked in the field of analytical chemistry with the leading laboratories in Russia, leading experts advise us. If the analytical equipment of leading laboratories, which costs a fortune, is poor equipment for you, then show me your equipment.  ""Real guys would repeat them very quickly. You have no chance.""   -  You think like a loser, that is the reason why you find it impossible for you. Do you think that there are some special people in big companies? Iwamura from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries received his first results in 2003, and in 2014 received a patent https://patents.google.com/patent/EP1202290B1/un But even such a large company has not yet managed to commercialize its developments. Real guys are us, and large corporations will start to be seriously engaged in this only after we launch the serial production and make money doing this.      ""But since there is nothing here but lies, I see you have no plans to compete with anyone."" - Your statement is again groundless. You did not bother to ask questions and now are accusing us of lying. Your posts are shallow and the comments are dilettantistic.  Breakthroughs are made by people like us, who are not afraid to go against a common opinion, they believe in their experiments and in their strength.

Your potential investors should understand the difference between “known” and “in commercial operation”, because you are not.  So called LENR, as anomaly heat emission, is known (mostly between marginals, but however). But the “synthesis of precious metals” you are talking about is not. Even the phenomenon will be confirmed by several independent researchers, it does not mean that it can be scaled and bring any profit. But you are promising dividends in two years, as if you already have an economically justified technology!  If you do not know something, this does not mean that others do not know that. Yasuhiro Iwamura obtained platinum from tungsten, here is his report: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzZl9l8nn1c Domenico Cirillo also obtained platinum group metals http://lenr-canr.org/acrobat/CirilloDtransmutat.pdf H. Nagaoka obtained gold and platinum group metals in the 20’s, you can read his article at: https://www.nature.com/articles/116095a0 You can also read about him in the presentation of Lattice Energy LLC p.54: https://www.slideshare.net/lewisglarsen/lattice-energy-llc-lenr-transmutation-as-source-of-key-scarce-elements-dec-13-2013 And this is just a small amount of sources, there is a lot more materials in different languages.  You’re mentioning NASA and CERN researches – but were are the links?  NASA Experiments review: https://synthestech.com/NASA_Presentation.pdf NASA patent: http://e-catworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017.09.14-Published-Application-1663.0002PCT3.pdf CERN review: https://synthestech.com/CERN-Report.pdf  As you can see, you have classified NASA as marginals. But there is also SRI, Kurchatov Institute (Urutskoev and Savvatimova), Japanese NEDO, and thousands of others, google them.   Moreover, several people have contacted us, who observed such phenomena, and they have even sent us a couple of sample. And these people are NOT scientists and they don’t get published anywhere.  Even the phenomenon will be confirmed by several independent researchers, it does not mean that it can be scaled and bring any profit. But you are promising dividends in two years, as if you already have an economically justified technology!  So, do you suggest to wait until everybody starts doing this and begin commercialization later, when the competition is high. You do not understand the very fundamentals of business, all the profit receives the one who stands at the cradle of business. Two years are enough, we are not an institution that eats up grants from the state, lingering for decades over ""Influence of moonlight on telegraph wires"". Commercial research is like a sprint run and not a marathon. And we are confident that we will achieve success.  If you are working with “leading labs” – where’s the name of at least one of them? Where are their contacts?  1. Vyatka State University: https://www.vyatsu.ru/nash-universitet/informatsiya-o-nauchnyih-laboratoriyah-vyatgu.html Our advisor, Denis Kosulin, works there.  Tests were carried out on the energy dispersive XRFA (See our WP) 2. Center for Collective Use St. Petersburg State University, in Petergof, wave-length dispersive XRFA was carried out on Simatzu XRF1800. (See our WP) 3. We have an advisor in a Saint-Petersburg mining university http://spmi.ru/ We have carried out the wave-length dispersive XRFA there as well and ICP-MS of some samples.  4. We have carried out the isotopic analysis of some samples in Hidrometall analytical laboratory: http://www.gidrometall.ru/analytics (Not specified in our WP, because the results are hard to understand) 5. At Kasan Federal University we have carried out a series of analyses using there ICP-MS  I will not give people's contacts here, since not everyone knew what topic we worked on during our analyzes.  If you have “well equipped” lab — why do you use photoshopped pictures of someone else's equipment?  Your accusation is as always groundless and false, photos of our current laboratory are on the synthestech landing at: https://ico.synthestech.com/#photos The pictures we have posted there are not „sugarcoated“ and photoshopped at all.    Saying “Real guys” I do not mean big companies. I mean real engineers, not political bloggers. What projects did you participate in? Where are your CVs? Only your “bla-bla” is colossal.  As I can see, you are not apt to a constructive criticism, your comments are an uncovered trolling, no one is interested in. You are not able to understand the simplest things, that in any business the organization is the main thing. And our head V. Karabanov, is a very highly qualified manager and organizer with a unique vision. He was one of the first people in the world to see the perspectives of obtaining valuable metals and isotopes through LENR, and he was also the first who focused his efforts on this experimental research. And we also have a whole group of engineers with a wide variety of experiences.   As far as I understand, due to your narrow-mindedness, it is difficult for you to understand the perspectives that low-energy transmutation is opening to the world, but for hundreds of people who have already become our investors it is obvious. Our project is much more promising than most leading ICOs. We will change the world in a more significant way than the bitcoin did. We will open the LENR for the investment market and this will inevitably lead to the replacement of hydrocarbon fuels with safe cold fusion. Have a great day.",False

Motivated by nonlinear dynamical systems theory and black-hole thermodynamics, the Invariant Set Postulate proposes that cosmological states of physical reality belong to a non-computable fractal state-space geometry I, invariant under the action of some subordinate deterministic causal dynamics. An exploratory analysis is made of a possible causal realistic framework for quantum physics, based on key properties of I. For example, sparseness is used to relate generic counterfactual states to points not lying on I, thus providing a geometric basis for the essential contextuality of quantum physics and the role of the abstract Hilbert Space in quantum theory. Also, self-similarity, described in a symbolic setting, provides a possible ""realistic"" perspective on the essential role of complex numbers and quaternions in quantum theory. A new interpretation is given to the standard ""mysteries"" of quantum theory: superposition, measurement, nonlocality, emergence of classicality and so on. It is proposed that heterogeneities in the fractal geometry of I are manifestations of the phenomenon of gravity. Since quantum theory is inherently blind to the existence of such state-space geometries, the analysis here suggests that attempts to formulate unified theories of physics within a conventional quantum-theoretic framework are misguided, and that a successful quantum theory of gravity should unify the causal non-Euclidean geometry of space time with the atemporal fractal geometry of state space.""

Large investors set the terms of investment themselves, in addition, they can change them at any time. There is a risk of interception of development results, both to outrun us and to put the development on ice.  ICO is a modern market mechanism for investment. Anyone can participate in the project, both large and small investors. In addition, there is an opportunity to exit the investment project at any stage, thanks to the secondary market system.  Unlike projects entirely built on the blockchain where investments are spent on software, we are planning to use the money raised during our ICO for the purchase of equipment and construction of a laboratory.

Actually there are articles but very few, which is due to Journals policy. But you should understand that if there is phenomenon that doesent mach the main theory, you have to fix the theory and not to ignore phenomenon. Most scientists doesnt try to replicate or figure out, they just ingnore. Question is are they real scientists and reaserchers or just pretend to be one? 2. Patent is not a protection. We have know-how, that are unic as we havet seen any mention by other groups of reserchers. 3.

There are thousands of other reports, only what was published around the the world. These all are reports on experiments.  On theoretical issues, we rely on Bazhutov's erzion model as the most elaborated. I recommend to read this arcticle about Erzion Model: http://www.iccf19.com/.../download/poster/PS04_Bazhutov.pdf But there are many other theories, Widom-Larsen Neutron catalisis is the most respected in US and the world.  4. There are many people and organisation that contact us, but we consider ICO as the most fast and simple method of funding. We reserve more than 51% of company for large investor at the next stage of the project – commercial. At this point it is reaserch.  When everybody will understand that it works, it will cost billions, that is why investments at this stage is a good deal.",False

About the claim, that we are ahead of everyone. You did compare our results with the ones of Adamenko. It seems that he has really obtained many elements including valuable ones. When you see his spectors, % of transmuted matter is high. But You are forgetting, that this XRF spectra is taken from micro spot that looked unusual. On other spots elemental composition is normal. That means the total amount of transmuted elements is critically low, these are just smallest spots after electroblast, that contain something. We conducted these experiments at the very beginning and concluded this to be a dead-end. Probably this was the reason why Adamenko has printed his work in so much details - it has no commercial perspectives. 2. Almost everyone, who carry out some research works in LENR, suffer from two things: Lack of funding and Complexities with calculations of efficiency. We had no problems with funding and didn't waste time on calculation. Only measurments of elemental composition before and after.",False

You may be, but nothing on your site or in you patent documents proves this, moreover, clear things are redacted in your presentation material that make it impossible to be sure you understand the process. Though, as I said above, there are things you did say, that show you do have some understanding, but they were said a long time previously by Kenneth Radford Shoulders & S. V. Adamenko - the other thing you alluded to is clear to see in datasets from Le Claire, S. V. Adamenko and Suhas Ralkar amongst others.    It is certain that many groups have practical embodiments in the works and commercial ambitions, so your first statement is flat out wrong. An example of this is S. V. Adamenko's group who have not only synthesised nearly every element in the periodic table (and super heavy stable elements outside the periodic table), but have now moved to the US and are actively pursuing commercial objectives. Moreover, Adamenko published a detailed 700 page book describing their work in with no redactions.    There are some fora where you would be able to get away with this kind of messaging, but E-Cat World is not one of them, there are two many people that know too many things and you do your credibility a disservice by writing in this way.

Nowadays, there is a great demand in the world for a number of valuable chemical elements such as palladium, ruthenium, rhodium, osmium, iridium, platinum and others. Despite the high demand the supply is very limited, since such elements are not widely distributed in nature. In addition to demand for the chemical elements, there is a great demand for their isotopes. Scientists from all over the world are working on technology for obtaining valuable elements and isotopes by artificial means - through Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR). It is about a transformation (transmutation) of certain chemical elements into others in their natural environment, without the use of huge energy forces for atom splitting. Which means, there is no radioactive emission.  Development of LENR-transmutation allows to receive super-profits for a long period due to the high added value. This profit can reach hundreds and thousands of percent.",False
