This month has been very exciting for us. We received lots of positive feedbacks and applause for how we are using blockchain technology on building the gaming network. After extensive considerations by the team and advisor, we decided to change the date of pre-sale from Nov 9 to Nov 17, 2017, 14:00 (UTC) We believe that this update to our roadmap is the best interest for all our pre-sale contributors and early adopters. In terms of game revision, we will put poker on hold as we believe there are many platforms in the market that provides such game. Instead, we are focused on building intellectual sports such as Chess, Draughts (Checkers), Xiangqi (Chinese Chess), Bridge, Shogi, Go and other board games. We plan to introduce various games outside of the current mind sports category in the future.     By extending the date of our contribution period, we will be doing more road shows. Here are the following events we will be attending for the coming weeks in Asia.   Nov 9 -10, 2017 Digital Asset and Blockchain Congress 2017 (Shenzhen) Nov 10, 2017 2nd Annual Blockchain Conference (Hong Kong) Nov 11, 2017 Blockchain & Cryptocurrency Conference (Tokyo) Nov 14-16, 2017 Singapore FinTech Festival 2017 (Singapore) Nov 17, 2017 MindSports IO Pre-Sale Launch  New Advisors On Board We would like to welcome our new advisors on board.

The MindSports IO network will introduce a larger variety of intellectual games than any traditional online platform.

Our passionate team and advisors consist of key executives and directors in prominent associations such as the World Chess Federation (FIDE) and the International Mind Sports Association (IMSA), blockchain experts, crypto investors, chess grandmasters, and various global mind sports professionals.

Users can also stake their tokens to interact with our Reputation Engine by providing relevant metrics, indicator to help us improve our anti-cheating algorithm, to identify cheaters and get token reward accordingly.  2. Statistical Analysis Layer Infer and calculate move-matching probability between chess engine and human players to identify potential chess engine gameplay manipulation.  3. Community Layer Act as arbiter in case of dispute, where token holders can vote to resolve dispute and get rewarded with tokens and reputation rating when they identify cheaters.     The majority of our token proceeds will be allocated to the development of the MindSports IO platform. We would also like to highlight that a portion of the proceeds will go toward the promotion of MindSports IO tournaments.
