Editorial from TechM on TrustVerse, Money Today https://www.reddit.com/user/trustverse/comments/8y9c7i/editorial_from_techm_on_trustverse_money_today/   Why TrustVerse(TVS Token) ? 👥  We are total service for digital estate(digital assets🗝in many forms 💰💎💳) and will later expand to digital identity, media contents as well.  👤👣  One of the crypto in the market has even treated crypto as asset class, therefore our well performing AI portfolio engine is able to manage 🛠the risk of volatility💣 and high correlation 🌪of various types of crypto.🎛 Moreover, we are also doing off-chain fund, meaning global equities. We provide profitable portfolio info📡 by using our token and smart contract such participation/purchase record via smart contract. We already have asset management company who we are partnering with us and we ourselves will get license very soon on trading and advisory.  🔑  1. Moreover, we give usage of our token🔑 to provide tax and legal services⏳ for the digital estate(assets) that someone holds. SEC has already considered crypto as holding asset and Korea soon will tax crypto as well. We simply provide data service provisioned by digital accounting and legal firm to hedge and minimize the fees. Therefore, this is another differentiation. 2. We are one of the first to use AI chatbot🌞 to design smart contract for digital estate planning for legacy and inheritance. This you won’t find else where. 3. We already have market proven and well performing AI deep neural network based engine to run portfolio of global equities which we have gained max of 85% and low 25%. 🌷We also have built crypto portfolio as well. It can also do risk analysis and product recommendation based on user preference via AI chat bot. AI Chabot is specially made for sentiment analysis.  4.We are using highly secured DID, GSLB🔐to protect user’s connectivity to decentralized application, also to safeguard smart contract designs. 5. We have proactive business partner to run our platform and build customer base in Korea, China and Hong Kong. We are working with wealth management frontier like few famous family fund.  We already have top 10 crypto exchanges to be listed on(Under confidentiality)   ""Explanation of TrustVerse Hardcap, and Why is it relevent? 👆🎯🎲🔨 Explanation for Hardcap (35M USD)  Our hardcap is based on our token demand and utility model of our DAPP. We are issuing 1billion tokens, and these tokens will mainly used for 2 purchase. 1)Participate in global equity and crypto portfolio and 2) Use token to do legacy planning, inheritance between family members with support of tax & legal service. This is compliant to current legal system and abided by the law.  In 1st usage, portfolio that user access is risk managed via AI and profitable since since this is provided by AI deep neural network and algorithm based risk management. This is based on actual engine which we managed hedge fund.  Our token is only limited to 1B tokens and as of now is close to 16 cents USD(Considering when ETH is $580 USD). We are offering 40% of our total toke value to the market.  When it comes to wealth management, people wil  invalue portfolio information to access, it requires users to have certain amount of AUM(Asset under management) and the fees for the service delivered. Our service only require very small fee as well as we provide smart contracts to safely guard user’s portfolio asset as well as providing decentralized ID to secure user’s profile even before accessing the DAPP’s main services. Furthermore, these asset can be safely transferred through smart contracts as well as providing family consensus mechanism with legal and tax services, which we impose small fees. Therefore there will be high demand to use such digital estate and wealth management service.  This is the amount of coins that are actively being traded in the market. Supply is limited. The first has to do with scarcity. Think about diamonds for a second, we know the scarcer they become (i.e. there are only so many diamonds in existence) the more valuable they become. It’s the same with cryptocurrencies, simple supply and demand. If there’s a finite supply of a particular token, the value of the coin is likely to increase over time. This, will in turn, protect the integrity and value of the underlying network. There is however a fine balance in getting this number right. Too low a hard cap and you won’t be able to raise enough funds to develop and grow the network.  If you consider companies like Vanguard, Renaissance Technologies, Personal Capital, they use quantitive trading, portfolio management, with various strategies, their valuation is $3.5 billion. Vanguard Group assets have surged to a record $3.4 trillion, with investors pumping in nearly $200 billion so far this year. Renaissance technologies manage US$84 billion (2018). We provide deep neural with multi-data set which is easily accessed by regular users as service. Lastly, even Robinhood(stock/crypto trading platform), used to be valued at $1.6 billion USD early this year, and now at $6 billion USD over after they trade cryptocurrency.  We were able to create a  low risk and medium crypto portfolio which crypto asset is known as highly volatile and correlated. Our portfolio intelligence both with global equity and crypto portfolio opens a new gateway for the asset management for not only family offices, but individuals and even institutional fund. Therefore amount of ethereum we raise through token sales, will contribute to advanced technology, human capital, legal framework as  well as the AUM.
