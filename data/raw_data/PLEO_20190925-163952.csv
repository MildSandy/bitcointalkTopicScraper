We did it. Without raising a single penny from the ICO market.  It took us less than 4 months from concept to development to launch.  How did we do it?  With our own bootstrap capital. And with an incredibly hard working development team.  Many ICOs have raised millions of dollars but nothing to show in return. But we on the other hand built a fully functional NEM Blockchain based HR Jobs Marketplace platform with limited capital and resources.  We consider this launch as the Phase 1 launch of our platform. But it comes with many amazing features that helps support both the Employers and Job searching Candidates.  So what‚Äôs in this version of the platform for our users?  Employers and Candidates can create profiles with a custom token wallet. All transactions will use our custom PLEO token as value exchange. All transactions are recorded in the NEM Blockchain. Employers can subscribe to Basic and Premium Subscription plan.    Candidates can search job postings and apply for a job. Employers can search for candidates with specific skills and access their profile paying with our tokens. Both Employers and Candidates can favorite each other. Users can transfer tokens to their personal wallet  All these features can be accessed by going to the live site URL at https://www.empleos.io  For a limited time we are offering free PLEO tokens for any employers who will sign on to our platform.  Now let‚Äôs talk about the future. What‚Äôs in store for us next?  Phase 2  We plan to launch Phase 2 of our platform in Q1 of 2019. Here are the features we planned to include in this phase.  AI Driven Recommendation engine (You like candidate X and you might also like candidate Y) Send weekly emails to Employers/Candidates Integration with Ticketing system on Support Page Support for multiple languages ‚ÄîSpanish and Russian Freelance and Gig economy Calendar scheduling for interviews Time and Invoice integration 2FA SMS verification for new user registration Machine Learning to screen and filter resumes/profiles NEM Blockchain Code  If you are interested in reviewing our NEM Blockchain code feel free to check our repo on Github:  https://github.com/empleos/pleo.tokenmodel    Website | Telegram | Whitepaper",False

As part of the UAT process we are actively engaging real life users (employers and job candidates) who will test the different components of our Blockchain based employment platform.  Currently our developers team is also conducting some stress testing on both Empleos.io platform and the NEM Blockchain network.  The beta platform leverages the NEM Testnet network for token transactions. Once the UAT testing is completed and platform is stabilized for performance and scalability we will switch to NEM‚Äôs Mainnet where all employers to candidates token transactions and contracts are recorded in the public blockchain.  Additionally we will be performing some code audits and security testing as part of the process.  Also we are on UI/UX testing stage and doing our best to bring our users the best experience within our platform.

It simplifies and incentivizes the ‚Äújob seekers‚Äù in their career search while offering time and cost saving advantages to employers.  Our platform intends to disrupt the hiring process where the employers no longer need to buy access to resume databases from big jobs portals. They pay a small fee (in tokens) directly to a job seeker eliminating the need for intermediaries. Further, users of Empleos.io have the opportunity to earn tokens by using our platform.  We introduce our utility token PLEO which is used for all the payments between platform users. PLEO mission is to become a standard means of payments on Labour Market including Online Recruitment, Freelance Jobs, Payroll and third-party value-added services. Our goal is to create a seamless experience for users, popularizing use of cryptocurrencies among people who are still not aware of crypto market and its opportunities.  Empleos.io platform is a working MVP which is currently on beta stage of development.
