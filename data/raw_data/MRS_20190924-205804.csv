But the relations between the two have been deteriorating. The biggest setback has come from the rise of illegal betting. The industry has grown not just in terms of revenue, but also in its reach, and there are now fears over its influence on the outcome of sporting events. The allegations of match-fixing across various sports have once again got sporting bodies and lawmakers across the globe worried and they are trying to find ways to counter the sector’s growing might. In this article we will cover some of the main aspects of this huge illegal betting industry that is worth well over 500 BILLION dollars and we will present you some interesting statistics regarding this topic.   It’s massive. In fact it is huge. According to some estimates, the industry could be worth as much as $500b per year. To put that in context, it is more than 50 times the annual profit of Toyota, the world’s biggest carmaker. Most people believe that a huge part of those betting revenues are generated in Asia. However, because much of the industry is illegal, and there are no official transaction records, it is difficult to give an accurate estimate of its total size. For example, Nevada’s Gaming Control board reported a record $4.8 billion bet at its sports books in 2017, with the house keeping $248.7 million in revenue. But legal betting is just the tip of the iceberg, and nobody really knows how much money is bet illicitly. A 1999 study commissioned by Congress put the range at $80 billion to $380 billion annually. Research firm Eilers & Krejcik Gaming puts the number at $50 billion to $60 billion and estimates that bookies keep up to $3 billion of that.

However this solution is working as intended only in theory. How does Marginless face and solve this problem? First of all we need to find out what is Oracles and Smart contracts Smart contracts — is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract.

Today we would like to talk about bookmakers, also known as “bookies” and tell you how they make profit, also, in this article, we will explain the methods bookmakers use to give themselves the advantage. We also look at the other main reason why they make money: most bettors just make bad bets.  What is bookmaking?  The basic principle of bookmaking is straightforward and pretty obvious. A bookmaker takes money in whenever they lay a bet to a customer, and they pay money out every time one of their customers wins a bet. The idea is to take more money in than pay out. The art of bookmaking is in making sure this happens.  Bookmakers can’t control the outcome of sports events, but they can control how much they stand to win or lose on any particular result. They set the odds for all the wagers they lay, which ultimately enables them to ensure a profit.  The role of odds compilers  Odds compilers set the odds at bookmaking firms. They are also known as traders, and their role is absolutely essential. The odds they set eventually determine how much in wagers a bookmaker is likely to take in, and how much money they are likely to make. The act of setting the odds for a sports event is known as pricing the market.  There are a number of aspects involved in pricing up markets for sports events. The primary goal is to make sure the odds accurately reflect how likely any particular outcome might be, while also ensuring that there’s a built-in profit margin. Determining the likelihood of outcomes is largely based on statistics, but very often a certain amount of sports knowledge must be applied as well.  Compilers therefore have to be very knowledgeable about the sports for which they are pricing markets; thus, they often specialize in just one or two. They also have to have a solid understanding of various mathematical and statistical principles.  Read full article on Medium  https://i.imgur.com/xrKoiti.jpg",False

With so many ICOs happening, it’s good to know which ones have potential, but it’s even more important to know whether investing in this space even makes sense. In many ways the current wave of ICOs (Initial Currency Offerings) looks a lot like the heady days of stock IPOs in the late ’90s. The potential return was so enticing that euphoria overtook common sense in many ways. Today we would like to address 5 key factors on whether the ICO that you would like to invest in is good or not.  It’s great to have a whitepaper and detail out a project, but how detailed has the team really thought through their own project? Short Whitepaper? No Details? Avoid! The whitepaper contains all of the core information you should need to know about the coin. Once you’ve done that, go to forums to read about some of the holes that may exist within those Whitepapers. See if the developers are actively addressing the concerns or simply ignoring them. The more information available, the greater the debate, and the more transparent a team is about their tech, the better it is for the investor.  No Development Roadmap? Avoid! What is the team’s development and marketing road map? Does it make sense? Is the time frame reasonable? Has the team already proven it can stay on top of its own development schedule from before the ICO? I am wary of any project that doesn’t have a detailed road map and so should you be. Does the team have real experience in the space they are attempting to coinify? If so, how much experience? What about relationships to industry veterans who can elevate the project further? Ultimately our investment is betting on the people behind the coin, not the coin itself. Our investment is a vote of confidence that the team can pull off the incredible feat they have set their sights on.  Are they full time? The worst thing is to have a part time staff. This means the project isn’t their primary focus and it can mean the project may go slow or, even, no where. We want a full time team dedicated to fleshing out the vision.  How many years of experience do they have? Nothing wrong with the young diving into a killer project, but do they have support from a more experienced team? If not, then navigating the unknown could prove harder than initially anticipated. Nothing stays rosy for long. Having veteran team members can help to brave through turbulent times, which are guaranteed to happen.  Do they have every aspect covered? Architecture? Development? Scale? Business Development? Marketing? A team only comprised of technology developers can also prove to be a poor choice for investment. It’s important to have a balanced team, one that can also get the word out, and build relationships to accelerate growth.  At the same time if a project only has a single developer, it’s a single point of failure. If anything happens to that one person, the entire project can head into a downward spiral. Redundancies are required to ensure that no single person can make or break the project.  Full article on our Medium  https://i.imgur.com/1lzE8wh.jpg",False

Marginless is known for doing things that no other ICO has ever done before and this is not an exception. We started our long journey with a thought to revolutionize the whole betting market, then we created our own Marginless eSports brand and now, as nowhere seen before, we are starting our weekly Marginless challenges!  What are the Marginless weekly challenges?  Marginless challenges will be released weekly - few of Marginless team members will participate in a specific challenge. The interesting part of it is that on our website anyone, and I repeat - ANYONE, can pick their challenge winner, BET their tokens and then, if that person wins, they will receive their tokens — DOUBLED! If you think that sounds amazing, we will be giving some cool prizes too!  How will it work? For example, team member A and team member B participate in a marathon challenge where they need to run 5 kilometers. That challenge has two main prizes — 10 000MRS tokens and a brand new XBOX ONE. Team member A has a betting odd of 1.5 and team member B has a betting odd of 3.0. Lets say that bettor picks team member A as he thinks that he is capable to outrun team member B. If team member A wins, that person will automatically participate in a raffle where he could receive his tokens MULTIPLIED by the odd he has betted on — so instead of 10 000 MRS tokens you would receive 15 000! Also, you would receive another physical prize like an XBOX ONE S, Playstation 4 and many more!  Special Guests  We will not reveal our first competition yet, but we will introduce you to people who will participate in mentioned weekly challenges with us. As we have mentioned before, few of our team members will compete in a weekly challenge. Also, those challenges will have frequent SPECIAL GUESTS — well known TV and internet personalities and athletes that will participate in our challenges. Every challenge will be recorded and uploaded on our YouTube channel for everyone to watch weekly, so stay tuned for more awesome content!  https://i.imgur.com/m7JMU9T.png",False

Betting has been around for thousands of years now. As our CEO Lukas Jonaitis said, “Sports betting has a long-lasting history dating back to the Olympic Games which initially took place in Greece. The process combines a desire to win with the passion for sports. This powerful synergy has created a multibillion dollar industry with its opportunities and quirks. Back in the times of Roman Empire betting reached incredible popularity as crowds gambled on the outcomes of gladiators fights as well as many other sporting events. We have written an article regarding our view on this long lasting niche and how we see it as an upcoming betting platform.”  It is a good bet that wagering on sports predates historical records. As long as there have been contests with winners and losers, there has been betting. However, when it comes to the promotion of sports betting as a popular social activity, much of the credit goes to Greece, home of the Olympic Games.  Thousands of years ago, athletic competitions were held in Corinth, Delphi, Nemea, and Olympus. Events included footraces, hurling the discus, long jumping, throwing the javelin, wrestling, boxing, and a form of free-style fighting. Contestants would dress in full battle array, including body armour and helmets, and prize money was bestowed on the victors. But there was even more to be gained in the viewing stands at these events, where excited spectators wagered on the outcomes, sometimes gaining or losing entire estates in the bargain.  Even bigger sports bettors were the Early Romans, who saw gambling as a metaphor for Life. During the 1st century, Pliny the Elder wrote, “We are so much at the mercy of chance that Chance is our god.” As Roman legions spread far and wide, so did their proclivity for wagering — a legacy that long outlasted their Empire.

You can read more about our journey to eSports here, on Medium  We will have a lot of news and a huge cover of how we did in Infoshow LAN 2018 this week, so stay tuned for that!  That is it for our fourth weekly recap. We will have more news coming really soon, so stay tuned for those. Side note — we might have some challenges coming really soon and we might give something away for you guys.",False

We always keep our promises and this is not an exception — the day has finally come. As we have been releasing short teasers for a while now, we are finally announcing our own eSports brand — Marginless eSports. And we are starting it hard with our first official team in the one of the most popular gaming titles — Dota 2.  This still young market has seen a surge with 40% growth in 2017, making the eSports industry a perfect fit for blockchain technologies and start-ups. Blockchain and cryptocurrency offer a number of opportunities to revolutionize the eSports industry. Transactions on blockchain are safe and transparent, fees are decreased, and payment processes are faster. Popularity of cryptocurrency attracts greater user base and funds into digital gaming platforms, as well. eSports betting got popular because of betting sites allowing people to bet on matches using virtual items (skins) and now almost every betting platform offer an opportunity to bet on this virtual sport matches.  Because of this great connection between betting and eSports, it didn’t take long for us to initiate and start our own eSports team. We have been in the works of taking this huge step for few months now and we could not think of a better option than the world-famous gaming title Dota 2 — the biggest eSports game by award prize money right now.  Our Marginless eSports Dota 2 roster contains 5 BEST players in the Baltic States right now. Here they are:   Oskaras “nzz” Balkus — 4th Position; Povilas “nkg” Kniukšta — 1st Position; Robertas “Vasaris” Remeika — 5th Position; Radek “Radek” Tondrik — 3rd Position; Renaldas “Ainox” Rimas — 4th Position.   https://i.imgur.com/Xs96w9C.jpg  Plans for the future  As we mentioned before, we have a long-term vision for Marginless and the Marginless eSports brand as a whole. Dota 2 is not the only game we want to participate in — we have huge plans for the future and we want to create the best possible environment for eSports players worldwide. After our great start at Infoshow LAN 2018, our Dota 2 team is hyped and ready to win new leagues, matches and tournaments worldwide.  We are always thinking of expanding into new spaces and eSports is no different to that. We have a lot of different ideas and plans for other eSports titles and leagues. As we have mentioned before, Marginless eSports will be a brand. Our own tournaments and LAN leagues are in the upcoming plans too, so stay tuned for that. Merchandise, streams and video content is being created right this moment, so if you want to keep up to date — follow our social media pages.  Medium post  https://i.imgur.com/1C72g8t.jpg",False

In 2016, the idea for Marginless was born. Our PRE-ICO round has just started where people, placing their trust in us, believe that we can deliver the system and technology to change the way the entire betting market is organized. Even more impressively, it seems the community even shared our goal of building a better and more decentralized betting environment on top of this already ambitious goal with their constant support on our social media pages, constant comments and suggestions. Thus our focus is on delivering our promises and the sustainable business model that would surround it. With this article we would like to cover some main aspects and ideas of Marginless and why we are different from others.  Unfair odds  One of the biggest problems that current bettors face are unfair odds. This is one of the main and leading fears of bettors worldwide — regularly losing against bettors while also being regulated, charged and/or extra taxed by governments. This forces regular sportsbooks to charge up to 8.5% margin on all placed bets. We, at Marginless, believe that unfair odds and big margins are not the way to create and welcome users to the betting world and that is the first thing where we differ from others — due to the fact that Marginless is operating as a peer-to-peer betting operator and does not require huge risk management or a full team of traders, bettors will have a possibility to place bets with an industry leading 1% that will be charged from those who won only!  Lack of transparency  Most of the time bookmakers leave possibilities to change your betting selections, void your winning bets or decline your payouts. This is very popular in Arabic and European countries where well-known bookmakers are regularly not paying out their bettors winnings due to some non-existant errors. Marginless is here to fix that. No more worries about the bookmakers not paying out your winnings. Marginless offers the users to bet on events and celebrate winnings exactly after the finish of the event you have wagered on. All of your betting information will be stored in the blockchain which will allow its users to keep track of their betting history, review previous bets and find new ways to improve your betting results with our analyst tools.  Limited options for betting  Most of the time bookmakers from different betting organizations offer wagering options strictly in sports, that way forgetting other popular niches that people have a big interest in. The lack for different types of betting options creates a certain barrier that makes betting interesting for a limited sphere of people. Marginless believes that everyone should have a go and offers a possibility for ANYONE to become a bookmaker and create their own bets on which people can wager. For example, such niches like political elections, cryptocurrency price changes, different cultural events, eSports matches and much more… Your imagination is the only barrier that could stop you here, so feel free to create your bets and offer people a wider range of selection! Becoming a bookmaker has never been so easy! All you need to do is choose your markets from provided list or even create unique ones, select market rules where needed (inclusion/exclusion of overtimes etc.), choose between riskier or safer plans by selecting your starting margins and you are good to go! Marginless platform will provide full events and a Hybdrid Oracle integration, risk-management and accounting services that are needed for the full system usability. All of this while charging only up to 5% (subject to change) of monthly gross profit in MRS from profitable betting pages. Whilst a lot of bettors have the dream of becoming a bookmaker one day — currently this dream is reachable only for very few due to platform building and maintenance costs. Marginless is here to change that!  Face to Face betting  Face to Face betting was one of the main ideas at Marginless from the start. A specific and a unique feature which is not available on any other ICO and which allows two clashing users with different opinions to bet directly against each other. How does it work? You can send a bet offer to another user with a few simple clicks and after the bet was accepted by your opponent, placed bets will be locked using contracts and both of you will be placed into a Face to Face betting interface. In this interface you will be able to chat with each other by using our unique, betting related chat system. You can also offer your opponent to increase the stake or split the pot at any given time. After the event is finished, Marginless platform and the blockchain will ensure that the winner would receive his winnings instantly.  Today we presented four points of why you should choose Marginless and how we differ from other similar projects. We hope that you like our articles and we really appreciate your constant feedback. We love reading your comments and messages. Only with your suggestions we can make Marginless great. Big news are coming soon, so stay tuned! Medium Article  https://i.imgur.com/j3e93ya.jpg",False
