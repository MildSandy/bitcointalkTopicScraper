This project will enable the acceptance of digital currencies by these merchants. The BannerCoin token is a cryptocurrency used with BannerCharge that can be redeemed for BannerView.com service credits. All BannerOS customers who use BannerCharge to accept payments via digital currencies will be required to accept the BannerCoin token as a form of payment. There could be a growing market of merchants accepting it for actual goods and services. Each BannerCoin token will be redeemable for one (1) BannerView.com credit. These credits can then be used toward recurring services provided by BannerView.com limited to website hosting and BannerOS related license fees including BannerGrips that are billed on a monthly or other recurring basis at a rate of 1 credit per $1 value of service purchased.  White Paper:  Download Project White Paper  Symbol:  BCOIN Token Type:  BannerCoin is an Ethereum blockchain token based upon the ERC20 standard.  Total supply:  100,000,000 BannerCoin tokens will be created.   BCOIN allocation plan: Up to 50,000,000 BannerCoin tokens will offered in the initial coin offering.   The remaining BannerCoin tokens will be held in reserve for future use such as distribution to employees, third party partners, sold to fund future initiatives or distributed as otherwise needed.  ICO Sale Dates  Start Date:  Token sales will begin on Friday, September 15, 2017 at Midnight PDT.  End Date:  Tuesday, October 31, 2017 at 11:59PM PDT unless extended or when all tokens are sold.

Purchasers must have an Ethereum wallet in order to receive the purchased tokens.   Sale to those eligible to purchase via credit card will need to wait up to 90 days before receiving their tokens.   All sales of BannerCoin tokens are final. No refunds will be issued.  Use of ICO proceeds  We plan to use the revenue generated via the ICO sale toward further development of the BannerCharge payment system to grow beyond traditional payment acceptance to also accepting many digital currencies directly. This includes hiring developers and support staff along with expanding our data center facility equipment to support a growing digital currency payment ecosystem. In addition, funds will be used for compliance, regulatory needs for running a payments acceptance business, for potential complimentary business acquisitions and other corporate purposes as needed. In light of full disclosure, we are free to use the revenue generated from our sales in any manner seen fit and make no guarantees that the revenue generated from this particular sale will be spent on any specifically announced initiative.  What is BannerCharge and what role does it play in BannerCoin?  BannerCharge is a product that runs on BannerOS, the company's website management platform. BannerCharge works with BannerOS add-on products, called Grips. These Grips enable companies of all sizes to do things from membership management to fully functional ecommerce websites. Many merchants accept traditional credit card payments for products sold via their ecommerce store, paid registration to events, monthly memberships and for products and services invoiced through a billing system. BannerCharge 2.0 already enables this functionality.   We want to take BannerCharge a big leap forward by allowing it to accept payment via digital currencies, not just the big ones like most payment acceptance modules allow such as Bitcoin and Litecoin, but dozens of digital currencies now that digital currencies in general have become a $100+ billion market! In addition, accepting low denomination payments under $1 (micro-payments), via traditional means such as credit cards or even via Bitcoin is way too expensive and inefficient. Using various digital currencies, micro-payments become feasible. For example, if a customer wanted to charge for a white paper of $.50 per download or per view of an article, paying with a digital currency is convenient and inexpensive. Not only that, merchants who accept digital payments don't have to worry about chargebacks and fraud is reduced because digital currency payments are irreversible. This is especially important when your product is delivered immediately, but you could later get a chargeback with no recourse to get your product back. Digitally delivered goods should have a digitally backed payment system!   The development of BannerCharge 3.0 will enable merchants to accept digital currency payments in addition to credit card payments. Initially 8 digital currencies including BannerCoin, Bitcoin, Dash, Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, Ripple, and Zcash can be accepted by merchants. Merchants will have full control over which currencies they choose to accept, however, the acceptance of at least BannerCoin will be required upon enabling this feature. We estimate that about every two weeks after BannerCharge 3.0 is released, we'll be able to add support for another digital currency. Each time a new currency is added, it will improve the ecosystem for that currency.   BannerCharge isn't a system that converts digital currency payments into fiat currencies (government backed money like the US dollar). It will allow merchants to participate in the growing digital currency market, encourage them to hold and use them.   Because products and services are priced in US dollars, the amount of digital currency required to complete a purchase will still be derived by taking the digital currency's current market value from CoinMarketCap's API and converted into the associated US dollar value. CoinMarketCap pulls data from various exchanges around the world to average the world price of a digital currency. Since digital currency prices fluctuate rapidly, customers paying with digital currencies will have, by default, up to 1 hour to complete the transaction which involves the customer sending the digital currency to the required payment address. This time limit will be modifiable by the merchant in the BannerCharge preferences. Merchants will also be able to set fixed exchange rates if they don't want to use dynamic pricing from CoinMarketCap.   Many digital currencies are increasing in value as fiat currencies inflate. Allowing merchants to hold digital currency brings more awareness and real world use scenarios to cryptocurrencies plus gives them upside potential when those digital currencies increase in value. A major part of our initiative is to expand the actual use of digital currencies for transactions as opposed to only pure speculation. We believe that many merchants holding various digital currencies may be more likely to spend them as opposed to selling them for fiat currency if they actually have places to spend them!  BannerCoin Token Sale Disclaimers  This is not a sale of securities, or offer of sale of securities. There are no voting rights or other implied rights by participating in this initial coin offering.

Those wishing to redeem BannerCoin tokens for BannerView.com credits will be required to register as a customer with BannerView.com prior to redemption. We only allow token redemptions from customers with whom we can legally conduct business.
