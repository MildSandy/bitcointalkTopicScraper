USA, Japan, EU... [BOUNTYHIVE]","  We’re sure, that our project is weidhty and innovative enough to achieve our goals. We offer real estate market players our Protocol for real estate tokenization, and the Platform for exchanging tokenized real estate assets. Tokenization enables trading real estate in small fractions, and makes it accessible as a result. Sellers attract new buyers who could not afford to buy real estate before, didn’t have the opportunity to invest internationally, didn’t want to bear high transaction costs, or wanted to pay for real estate with cryptocurrency. Buyers are additionally motivated by the transparency and liquidity provided by the secondary market within the Platform and the secure transaction records stored on the blockchain.  Alt.Estate makes it possible to buy and sell tokenized real estate assets in a trusted, fast and smooth manner with instantaneous transactions and low transaction costs. Any real estate owner can list his property or any fraction of it on the Platform, and anyone can become a buyer as the entry ticket is very low.  We are the first real estate tokenization project with a viable B2B marketing strategy. We will provide our solution to real estate developers, investment companies and brokers. As they are interested in any new sales channels, we can use their marketing budgets to promote our tokenization Protocol and quickly fill our exchange with tokenized real estate from all over the world.",False
