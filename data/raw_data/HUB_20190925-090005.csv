UHUB is a decentralized platform which will use Smart Contracts based on the Ethereum Blockchain, allowing users to purchase products, tickets, and hotel services on the spot. The platform is aiming to create an entire ecosystem, connecting users all over the world and allowing them to easily exchange both digital and fiat currencies, send money with minimal fees (under 1%), trade with other users and businesses, buy tickets for travel, concerts and many other things. Basically, the aim is to create one application that will cover the majority of online shopping needs and provide long-term benefits to the community.  The Whitepapers:  The Whitepaper (EN) The Whitepaper (VI)  ICO Details  Our Initial Coin Offering will be held according to the following schedule:  Presale - November 16th to November 25th. Public Token Sale - November 25th to December 10th.  Start od development phase - December 11th.  Minimum funding goal for ICO - 18,000 ETH (approximately $5.4m)  Maximum funding goal for ICO - 167,000 ETH (approximately $50m)  Initial price per HUBcoin - $0.075  Expected price per HUBcoin on the exchanges - $0.15   UHUB.IO in the press      UHUB.IO Ecosystem  The ecosystem will consist of three different parts:  HUB exchange HUB marketplace HUB connector  The HUB exchange will enable buying, selling and storing of numerous different cryptocurrencies, including the HUBcoin (HUB), which will be the primary payment method on the network. HUBcoin will be exchanged only for Ether (ETH) during the ICO.  The HUB marketplace is a decentralized market where users can buy or sell products directly. The platform will have an Escrow service, in order to keep the users safer and reduce the fraud count to a minimum. Also, there will be a rating system in place, so that the other users can get informed about individual buyers or sellers. The HUB marketplace has one more great advantage - there are no intermediaries (such as PayPal), so the costs for each successful trade can be reduced to 1% (from 4-15%), allowing traders to offer cheaper products.  The HUB connector is designed as a place where users can buy transportation tickets (including the plane tickets), tickets for concerts and other events, food vouchers, etc. Besides that, users will be able to make reservations at the hotels and restaurants around the world. Each user will be able to get a list of places and events corresponding to its location, and sorted by country and city to enable more natural navigation.
