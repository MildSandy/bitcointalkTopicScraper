The existing technologies are too complex for everyday consumers, and many platforms lack a user-friendly design, making them prohibitive to late adopters.

An open source mobile wallet that combines peer-to-peer transactions in crypto and cash with a second layer solution connected to decentralized exchanges. We’re being called the killer crypto app; the missing link to mass adoption that’s solving the last mile for consumers and the new crypto economy.    Our Mission. ▄▄▄  To empower anyone, anywhere in the world to hold, track, transfer and transact with any digital asset from their mobile device, privately and instantly. We’re not building a bank, we’re reinventing banking.  Why Hoard? ▄▄▄  Traditional banking is slow and expensive. Crypto-tech is complex and stifles adoption. Markets are hard to enter which block participation. Cryptocurrencies aren’t fungible like cash. Systems are missing critical machine learning and automation. Dapps and chains can be extremely fragmented. This is a nightmare for everyday consumers. Who wants to use 7 apps just to manage 4 currencies or transact between 2 parties? Simplicity is not a patent. It’s time for real change.  Hoard App ▄▄▄  Picture this… an open source mobile wallet developed for iOS and Android phones that can hold any cryptocurrency across any public blockchain while you maintain full control of your private keys. A peer-to-peer payment system that removes copy/paste methods and slow block times and relies on your device contacts, @usernames, email address or phone numbers, even if the recipient doesn’t have the Hoard app or a crypto wallet. Within that same mobile wallet you can instantly swap any asset for any asset without a complex trading experience at minimal fees. Track transactions and market performance of your assets stored on other platforms. Execute fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat buys or sells at macro or micro levels with additional plug and play rule-based automation. And lastly, through QR payment technology, Hoard users have the ability to make purchases directly to merchants using cryptocurrency and the merchant receives payment in the form of currency they prefer, including fiat, at the time of sale. No banks, no card issuers, no middle men.   Blockchain Protocol ▄▄▄  Our blockchain network (codenamed: Smaug) is a decentralized exchange protocol, solving interoperability and scalability of all public blockchain assets while aggregating the liquidity of decentralized exchanges into a single endpoint for maximum end-user consumption. The Ethereum-based second layer solution is completely decentralized and relies solely on community efforts to provide transaction verification, order matching, and market making through multiple Hoard masternodes. Smaug is comparable to decentralized exchanges like 0x but works across different blockchains and provides both a publically accessible ledger as well as a private one.  Consensus Algorithm Masternode Proof-of-Service secured by Ethereum Blockchain  Masternode Program The Hoard Masternode program is the mechanism that powers the decentralized exchange protocol codenamed “Smaug Network”. This open-source program enables Hoard community members to create their own exchanges, wherein they either source liquidity for the Smaug Network, or connect users of the Hoard wallet app and other supported applications to these liquidity pools. In addition to these capabilities, the masternodes also maintain the off-chain ledgers that represent users’ assets deposited in the Smaug network, either in a publically available ledger or encrypted within a Zero-knowledge ledger. The market matching masternodes set their own competitive rates and can take fees on the trades they make, while the order matching masternodes receive block rewards in the form of the HOARD token.  Token Use Participation in the Hoard Masternode and earning rewards has two requirements:        1. Staking 5,000 HOARD tokens within the Masternode smart contract       2. Running the Masternode software and upgrading the software when required  Upon the initial distribution of the HOARD tokens, the masternode smart contract will be made available to deposit the masternode stake within. Once the masternode software is available, masternode participants will be required to run the software to continue to receive rewards and connect Hoard’s users to the supported exchanges as well as market-making nodes.    Immediately following launch, masternode rewards will begin distribution. These rewards will be distributed evenly between each qualified masternode. The amount of masternode rewards distributed over time will decrease by 20% each year.  20% of Available Masternode Rewards (8 million tokens) will be issued in the first year Approximately 49% of Available Masternode Rewards will be issued in the first 3 years Approximately 80% of Available Masternode Rewards will be issued in the first 7 years Approximately 99% of Available Masternode Rewards will be issued within 20 years  In addition to the Masternode program, end-users who hold the HOARD token will qualify for various benefits provided through the Hoard mobile app, including qualifying for reduced-fee or free add-ons including deploying rule-based and machine learning-based investment tools, as well as reduced fees when accessing our fiat / crypto exchange services.  Current Development ▄▄▄  The Beta App The Hoard team has developed our mobile-first cryptocurrency wallet that supports both Bitcoin and Ethereum assets, with support for many more blockchains coming soon. This app allows you to easily and trustlessly interact with the cryptocurrency ecosystem without sacrificing control over your private keys. The app is Open Source, with the source code for the mobile app and our backend services available for all to inspect and improve on.  As we proceed through our token distribution, the team will continue working on our decentralized exchange protocol, as well as building features into our mobile app that allow users to trade and invest directly from their mobile devices, as well as track their funds in real time on supported top-tier exchanges. In addition, we’ll be building our fiat services which will allow users to buy and sell any cryptocurrency with fiat money and send peer-to-peer cash payments. Beyond that, we’re building machine-learning powered investment tools that track crowd sentiment in real-time, as well as building simple rule-based tools that make investing in crypto as simple as using a piggy bank.  Our goals in building this products is to on-ramp as many people as possible into the cryptocurrency ecosystem, but do it in a way where they are empowered to control their own assets, and source liquidity from both high-liquidity, centralized exchanges, as well as our network of Masternode-powered community exchanges. We aim to eliminate exchange insolvency risks which hurt all cryptocurrency services, and provide powerful and innovative tools for experienced traders, as well as simple automated investment tools and payment services for the vast majority of the globe who has yet to join the cryptocurrency revolution.",False

The biggest takeaways we decided to focus on were speed, reliability, support and experience.  Speed. Our second layer is being built to compete with lightning and raiden. Assets need to move at the speed of WiFi if we’re going to compete with consumer fintech products but keeping inline with censorship resistance and  decentralization were very important. Sending bitcoin across chain works great but we can improve upon that experience while maintaining possession of our keys we’ve leveled up.  Reliability. People use banks for a myriad of reasons but the most important reasons are two fold. 1. Is trust. A bank customer knows the deposit made will be there when they return. 2. It just works. We don’t have to think about paying a bill, moving money, saving funds, writing checks, or swiping cards. The system has worked for 2 centuries now. We’re approaching everything we do as something you don’t have to think about. It just works and it can be trusted, even in a trustless ecosystem.  Support. Customer support is horrible in this industry. Even the biggest company in the space has some of the slowest and most unreliable customer support. Our customer support team is as much our product is the app. Email, chat, and soon will offer phone support (once we can afford it).  I don’t want a single user to feel left out, labeled as a ######## our forgotten about.  Experience. Probably the single most important element is our user experience. While we integrate with banks, we do not want to become one. I worked for one for many years and know both sides of their experience. We have no plans to offer checking accounts, credit and loans, debit cards, ATMs, or brick and motor stores. We’re disrupting this space by not building band-aids like crypto cards. We’re introducing tech anyone can use, any business can benefit from, and any market can absorb. Combine his with private transactions with zero knowledge proofs and we’re a viable option for both the average consumer and the crypto OG.  Lastly, our fiat system enables us to move cash at the speed of WiFi too. Faster than any bank and faster the any crypto-bank. Visa takes 3-5 days to settle for a merchant. We settle in 1 second. Most crypto-banks rely on blocktimes, we’re developing a second layer to move assets as fast as cash. I’ll end with this. We’re open source and available to contribute to, fork, test and audit. Name me a bank willing to give that up?  Thanks for the question. A really great one.",False

In a landscape that is less tolerant of cryptocurrencies such as India at the moment, can the Hoard app be used to turn my crypto into Rupee payments to merchants already?  If not, when do you see this feature being available potentially?   In my mind, something like this could be a real difference maker in terms of the legislation that gets passed to bridge the gap between ""old thinking"" against crypto, and the new wave of adopters in the Indian market.",False

In saying this, I would love to know why Proof of Service/Proof of Stake was chosen? I found that with although PoS solves many concerns with regards to higher speed, efficiency and less hardware, it opens up other areas of concern.  Do you find the vulnerability aspect of Proof of Service/PoS a problem? For example, an individual with enough money will invest exclusively into the potential destruction of this system can do easily by investing money, as opposed to Proof of Work where one would also need to invest money, time, expertise, hardware and electricity.  How do you also mitigate against risks of attacks in your system? The thinking here is that if fewer people are in charge of keeping the network alive, one would automatically think it would be easier to organise a 51% attack and therefore, power is centralised in the hands of a few individuals.

We’ll be relying on the hashing power and security of Ethereum when we launch. We’ve deliberated at length about creating our own blockchain, likely a clone of ethereum but still leveraging their networ date transactionsk. It hasn’t been decided.right now we’re relying on Ethereums smart contract maturity, dev community, and hash.
