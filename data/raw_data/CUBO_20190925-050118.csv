One of those is a start of a productive interaction between Cubomania and Crypto Syndicate Synergy (CSS), a crypto-asset management platform. The cooperation resulted in a pre-seed CUBO token acquisition in the amount of $100 000, a successful completion of CSS Tracking Program and many more new opportunities, opened for Cubomania. But let’s start from the very beginning!  It all started in late April with a traction meeting with Sergey Voropaev, CEO and Founder of Crypto Syndicate Synergy (CSS). After careful examination of the project, he got truly interested and made valuable suggestions on how Cubomania can develop even faster. Thanks to the advice and consultancy received from Crypto Syndicate Synergy (CSS), Cubomania has verified its vision on how to become a billion-dollar company in just 2 years.  But such a great ambition can only be achieved if a project team is flexible enough to do the right things in the right time and adapt its road map to maximize the utility of the project development efforts. So along with a minute of wisdom, Sergey Voropaev also challenged Cubomania to complete CSS Tracking Program and prove the seriousness of team intentions. And the challenge was accepted!  One of the main goals that were set up for the Cubomania team in the framework of CSS Tracking Program was a 10% weekly growth rate of Cubomania’s community of teachers and people involved in educating children. The reason for such a track criterion is simple but prudent. If achieved, then by the time Cubomania platform is launched, it will already have a large base of active content creators that will ensure the Cubomania ecosystem can operate at the full capacity from the early stage.  And Cubomania was prompt to react and start to actively expand the community of prospective content creators. During May 2018 Maksym Musiyenko, founder and CEO @ Cubomania, had more than 5 major meetings and close discussions with representatives of Ukrainian educational institutions and non-governmental organizations. Those include with local branch of EBRD, Academic Council of Petro Mohyla Black Sea University and Vinnytsia National Technical University, Cherkasy Methodical Cabinet of the Education Department of the Cherkasy City Council and private educational institutions, like family support centre “Family Club”.  For more information please read Cubomania monthly digest and follow Maksim Musiyenko on facebook for more updates  These efforts allowed Cubomania not only to meet the requirement of a weekly community growth rate of 10%, but also exceed it by 8%. Such results let Cubomania successfully complete CSS Tracking Program last week on Monday, which, in turn, lead to the pre-seed round of CUBO token acquisition in the amount of $100 000 by CSS. What makes CSS Tracking Program even more important for Cubomania is that upon completion more than 2000 members of the Crypto Syndicate Synergy (CSS) were acquainted with the Tracking Program results. Cubomania believes that this pre-seed round will let to more scaled syndicated deals in the nearest future! So far around 80 institutional investors have already become interested in Cubomania and contacted the team.  Last but equally important, having huge experience in the crypto industry, CSS mastermind Sergey Voropaev has provided Cubomania management team with exclusive industry insights and his expertise to finetune the ICO vector of Cubomania development. Moreover, thanks to support from Crypto Syndicate Synergy (CSS), Cubomania team was invited to a private meeting of crypto investors from Asian region in Hong Kong which will take place in a week! So more news to come from Asia in the nearest time!  In order not to miss any updates and be first to know how the Cubomania project will make it in Hong Kong, follow the project up on its official channels",False

Also, we strive to make children all over the world acquainted with a new level of gamification as well as a completely new system of obtaining knowledge as we believe in developing mental abilities and imagination as well as promoting love for learning. The way we do it is by creating an educational blockchain-powered platform with its own operating system for kids’ watches, tablets and other IoT devices. What’s more, implementation of the cutting-edge blockchain technology will enable members of the education industry to offer customized interactive educational programs directly to the market as the platform operates using a decentralised payment system to ensure safe transactions. Finally, manufacturers of smart devices for children will get an opportunity to integrate with the platform, thereby increasing value for and popularity with their customers.  The Cubomania eco-system consists of several important elements:  CuboCore Operating System CuboStore and Online Workshop CuboApp IoT devices (for example, CuboBuddy) CuboCore Operating System is an operating system for robotics and IoT devices with built-in educational programs that can be installed on any kind of IoT-based devices: tablets for kids, smart watches, robot constructors, IoT toys. CuboCore provides full integration with the Cubomania educational platform and therefore access to the CuboStore and online workshop.  Over the last years the industrial robotics, which was a traditional market pillar, has given way to non-industrial types of robots such as IoT devices, personal robot assistants, and UAV (quadrotors). Every year there is an increase in the number of manufacturers of home and toy robotics. For example, new enterprises which produce IoT devices and robots open in China every single month. As a result, prices for robots, sensors, CPUs and communications continue to fall while capabilities continue to increase. Taking all these factors into account, it’s easy to see a unique opportunity.  Robot programming and maintenance is one of the biggest obstacles in robotics research: when you spend all your time just finding out how to make a robot work and then maintain its work, you don’t have any time to make your robot do something useful and unique. There was the same problem in the early days of the computer age until Bill Gates gave everyman the opportunity to communicate with computers having created the first operating system BIOS that changed the computer world and set a trend in software development. The challenge remains for robotics system developers and users all around the world. Companies have to adjust the operation algorithms of their prospective machines to obsolete control and monitoring systems (the last system was created in 2010), losing out on the opportunities offered by modern technologies. Today’s Robot Operating Systems are steadily installed and work well only on Ubuntu version 10 or later. We are going to tackle this problem — using the experience of creating a programme shell from scratch for our learning IoT toys, we strive for creating a single operating platform for IoT devices — CuboCore.  We integrate the whole range of Cubomania Market learning programs into this ROS. Just by installing CuboCore into your robot/quadcopter/IoT system, you will get direct access to the library of programmes and learning courses from simple directive commands to AI-based behavioral patterns. CuboCore is intended for companies that develop hardware which is necessary for all but is not specific to any particular application.  Content  Devices with installed CuboCore will have access to the decentralized store with apps and programmes administered by the Cubomania community. The main programming examples and greenfield projects of varying complexity are readily accessible at all times to provide students with different tasks: starting from the first movement algorithm and up to complex behavioral patterns.  Software development kit  Along with the basic version of CuboCore, the Cubomania project will prepare SDK which will provide teachers, students and developers with ready-made opportunities to program behaviour, sounds, movements and add additional electronics.  Global trend  We expect that CuboCore will be made available in laboratories, classrooms, workshops and hackathons where new users are trying to touch the world of robotics for the first time.  We see two options for interaction: 1. Installation of our app on your product. This will improve the experience of using your products by your customers, significantly expand the functionality and, in general, increase the attractiveness of the product. In the next stages of our ecosystem development, we will be able to suggest a fully-fledged operating system with full hardware support which will further improve the quality of your products.  2. Production of tablets and smart watches under a private label.  CuboStore and Cubo Workshop are the key elements of the eco-system. Blockchain mechanics combined with the platform interface will ease the process of content creation and distribution as well as grant teachers maximum protection of their intellectual property. We have already completed 20% of the project architecture which has been developed by a strong technical team. Our solution consists of a web-server, Android and IOS apps in the first iteration and a full-stack OS in the future. This will greatly increase the level of user experience with smart toys, watches and tablets for kids.  We have started forming relations with teachers, educators and professors from different countries who are looking forward to cooperation with Cubomania. And every day we will accept new community members in order to have a strong team of content creators once the platform is launched and integrate the Cubomania platform into the learning process of different educational establishments. This will ensure constant growth of popularity of the project, which is beneficial for active users and other interested parties.  Another important element is CuboApp. CuboApp is a mobile application that connects the source of educational content on the blockchain and smart devices such as smart watches, tablets for kids, IoT smart toys (for example, CuboBuddy), or robots. CuboApp can also be used for accessing educational content independent of the devices.  All the educational content can be access through an IoT device (for example, CuboBuddy, smart watches and tablets for kids, and robots). The first device to deliver the content produced on the Cubomania blockchain platform is CuboBuddy, a robotic educational IoT toy. The main purpose of this toy is to provide complex interaction between a user and an AI-based character with integrated educational programs. A set of sensors, engines, microcontrollers and other elements of the toy will allow a child to explore the outside world, learning a wide range of easy and complex things from learning letters to basics of robotics. Firstly, this interactive toy is a unique learning tool itself. Secondly, it will serve as a testing platform to demonstrate how the whole system will work and how all the elements will interact with each other. CuboBuddy has won a lot of awards at Ukrainian startup battles and has been given a lot of recognition at international exhibitions, for instance, at CES-2018 in Las Vegas. Now it is ready for mass production. And, of course, the work is not over. We are constantly improving the hardware product to extend its functionality in order to provide the ultimate user experience to our customers. We have had negotiations with big chains both in Ukraine and outside the country. CuboBuddy will be available in online and offline stores all over the world. We are already negotiating with several large retailers in Australia and the UAE to supply our first product with an integrated CUBO system. Keep in mind that Cubo token holders will have an opportunity to get the cube at a 40% discount and won’t have to wait until the toy appears in local stores. Furthermore, we are negotiating with several top 10 Chinese manufacturers about the development of white label products (tablets for children and smart watches with an integrated ecosystem of Cubomania which will educate children in a playful form).  Any other smart devices for kids (mainly smart watches and tablets for kids) can be integrated into the Cubomania platform by virtue of CuboCore, our own operating system for smart devices.  The Cubomania team see unlimited innovative potential for creating new behavioral, economic and business models based on a gamified learning process. The competitive advantages of this business project are its market attractiveness by virtue of using the blockchain technology, blue ocean of online pre-school and school education market, the demand for IoT-smart toys and high competitiveness of goods. Cubomania seeks to decentralize the education industry by connecting teachers, parents, students and manufacturers of smart devices worldwide with the blockchain solution. So far, there haven’t been any similar platforms as almost all attention has been paid to university education and student preparation for better integration into the working community. Lack of competition in this segment holds much promise for Cubomania.  Our team strongly believes in Cubomania and will carry on after the ICO. We work round the clock to achieve results. We believe that the sphere of education is the future. Education is the currency of a new generation.",False
