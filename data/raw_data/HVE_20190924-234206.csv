UHIVE es la primera red social del mundo con dimensión física y que incorpora tecnología blockchain, combinando tecnología con psicología humana en arras de ofrecer una experiencia de usuario novedosa, notable y exclusiva. Se ha estado desarrollando durante los últimos 3 años, diseñado para dispositivos móviles, y desde sus comienzos teniendo en mente la capacidad de integrar realidad virtual (VR)y de ser impulsada por tecnología de Inteligencia Artificial (AI). El concepto básico deriva de las necesidades y la psicología humanas, aunque adoptando una perspectiva única e innovadora.  1.   Dimensión Física (pendiente de patente): La cual  proporcionará una localización física al espacio del usuario en la red, convirtiendo el descubrimiento y la exploración de usuarios y espacios comerciales en algo mas simple e intuitivo, e incentivando  a las personas a pasar más tiempo en la red. 2.   Mundo Civilizado: Diseñado para personas reales, perfiles reales, navegando por el mundo social de la familia, amigos, socios y compañeros de trabajo en una plataforma regulada. 3.   Mundo Gris (pendiente de patente): Una parte exclusiva de la red social, es un mundo inexplorado y sin control, permitiendo al usuario ser absolutamente anónimo, crear espacios y dar rienda suelta a su imaginación de la forma mas salvaje. Este mundo será creado con nuestra nueva tecnología híbrida de blockchain.   VR y A.I.    El sistema está diseñado desde sus inicios para integrar VR, permitiéndole emplear su dispositivo de realidad virtual para explorar el mundo civilizado y el mundo gris, entrar en los espacios de los usuarios, ver películas, buscar fotos y leer comentarios y artículos de un modo novedoso sin precedentes. Adicionalmente, el sistema está creado sobre una capa de IA, que admitirá la detección de objetos y rostros, análisis de video, detección de sentimientos y análisis de comportamiento, para ofrecer al usuario la mejor experiencia posible.   Privacidad (El mundo gris)  Los usuarios pueden disponer de múltiples perfiles, uno en el mundo civilizado y varios en el mundo gris. El mundo gris se caracteriza por una extrema libertad, enfatizando la privacidad del  usuario, y simultáneamente evita que se cruce la delgada linea que delimita el derecho de las personas a mantener sus actividades y datos privados, respecto del abuso del sistema y la ejecución de actividades ilegales. Para ello contaremos con nuestra vanguardista tecnología de Blockchain híbrida, manteniendo el usuario en todo momento su identidad, datos y actividades totalmente seguros y anónimos.   Ecosistema UHIVE   UHIVE es un proyecto a largo plazo, el cual aspira a seguir innovando e invertir en el futuro de las redes sociales, a partir de la creación de una nueva economía digital sostenible por si misma, donde  integrar el Token de UHIVE. El Token HIVE tiene expectativas de gran éxito, teniendo en cuenta que su valor aumentará de acuerdo a: •    Trading en plataformas de exchange •    Anuncios en la plataforma, los cuales serán pagados en Tokens UHIVE •    No estar bajo el control de un tercero nos posibilita compartir un 50% de nuestros ingresos por anuncios con nuestros usuarios (a modo de salario), lo cual incentiva a participanción y lealtad de los mismos. •    Los usuarios comprarán bienes y servicios dentro de la red social usando Tokens UHIVE De este modo creamos un entorno económico completo, lo cual implica además que a mayor número de usuarios y más demanda, el valor del Token UHIVE seguirá en tendencia alcista.   Suministro y Distribución de Tokens   Suministro total: 80 nillones Cap. Máximo: $52.4M (25 Billones UHIVE) Cap.

UHIVE is the world’s first social network with physical dimensions and blockchain technology, combining technology with human psychology to deliver a new, remarkable and unique user experience. It has been in the making for 3 years now, it is mobile based, designed from the start to support virtual reality and powered by A.I., The concept was derived from human needs and psychology, and it has new, unique and innovative concepts.  1.   Physical Dimension (Patent pending): Which will give a physical location to the user’s spaces on the network, making discovering and exploring users and business spaces easier and more intuitive, and it will encourage people to spend more time on the network. 2.   Civilized World: Designed for real people, real profiles, navigate the social world of family, friends, peers & co-workers in a regulated platform. 3.   Grey world (Patent pending): A unique part of the social network, it is an uncharted and an uncontrolled world, it gives users the ability to be completely anonymous, and it will allow users to create spaces and go wild with their imagination. This world will be built on our new hybrid blockchain technology.   VR and A.I.      The system is designed from the start to support VR (Virtual reality), you will be able to put your VR gear and explore the Civilized world and the Grey world, enter users’ spaces, watch movies, browse photos and read comments and article’s in a new and innovative way. Plus, the system is built on a new A.I. layer, which will support object and face detection, video analysis, sentiment detection, and behaviour analysis, to give users the best possible experience.   Privacy (The Grey world)  Users can have multiple profiles, one on the Civilized world and others on the Grey world. The Grey world is designed to bring freedom and to preserve users’ privacy to the maximum, and at the same time, it defines the thin line between people’s right to keep their activities and data private, and between making sure not to abuse the system and create illegal activities. With our innovative Hybrid Blockchain technology, users will have their identity, data, and activities totally secured and anonymous.   UHIVE Ecosystem    UHIVE is a long-term project, it aims to keep innovating and to invest in the future of social networking by creating a new self-sustained digital economy, and by introducing the UHIVE Token. The HIVE Token has high succeeding prospects, as its value will increase with the following: •   Trading on exchange platforms •   All Ads on the platform will be paid in UHIVE Tokens •   Being not controlled by a third party, will enable us to share %50 of our Ads revenue with our users (like a salary) increasing engagement and creating loyalty •   Users will buy commodities and services within social network using UHIVE Tokens This will create a complete circular economy, meaning, with more users, and more demand, the UHIVE Token value will keep increasing.
