Some really clues:  1. They sell NTO on coinexchange.io when it is being ICO. All people can't move token to sell but they sell NTO by 0.4 USD. It is a trick for you to believe it is a value token. Who sell, who buy a token when it is in ICO, off course it is them, dog teams.  2. After ICO, they remove all TEAMs info, roadmap etc... It mean they don't have a really team and a office.  3. All ETH they colect have been sold now, you can check their ETH address for ICO.  4. sometimes They continues trick more people that they have alpha soft etc... but they don't show anything about the route to develop. Off course many people believe they are still live and act, in fact they all died, the project is nothing. They want to sell more NTO token, a fraud token.  5. They even don't care their website, in 25 October I see in website fujinto.io was deadline and sold by namecheap . Ha ha. I can buy their website but i don't want to be considered a cheater.  6. I threaten them in their facebook: You are scam, I will warn in Intepol and Japan police, ha ha, some day they close their website for 3 day. They was threatened by me.   SO ALL OF YOU, PLEASE WAKE AND SEE THAT , NTO OR FUJINTO IS A BIG SCAM!!!!!   NOW IF YOU DRAW NTO IN HITBTC YOU PAY 998nto=NEARLY 10 usd FOR WITHDRAW, ha ha. Why do you want to withdraw a scam token, there are many token for you in ETH eco like OMG, KNC, DATA etc..., you should chose 1, don't chose and buy sell NTO.",False

Some really clues:  1. They sell NTO on coinexchange.io when it is being ICO. All people can't move token to sell but they sell NTO by 0.4 USD. It is a trick for you to believe it is a value token. Who sell, who buy a token when it is in ICO, off course it is them, dog teams.  2. After ICO, they remove all TEAMs info, roadmap etc... It mean they don't have a really team and a office.  3. All ETH they colect have been sold now, you can check their ETH address for ICO.  4. sometimes They continues trick more people that they have alpha soft etc... but they don't show anything about the route to develop. Off course many people believe they are still live and act, in fact they all died, the project is nothing. They want to sell more NTO token, a fraud token.  5. They even don't care their website, in 25 October I see in website fujinto.io was deadline and sold by namecheap . Ha ha. I can buy their website but i don't want to be considered a cheater.  6. I threaten them in their facebook: You are scam, I will warn in Intepol and Japan police, ha ha, some day they close their website for 3 day. They was threatened by me.   SO ALL OF YOU, PLEASE WAKE AND SEE THAT , NTO OR FUJINTO IS A BIG SCAM!!!!!",False
