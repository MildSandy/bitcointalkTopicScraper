Ebooks on decentralized storage don't disappear. You can re-sell a book after you purchased it.  Irrevocable ownership - your ownership of READ token linking you to decentralised storage is immutable. The protocol also supports paper books print-on-demand.  Token as an Access Key - forget about EULA and license! Access keys are represented by ERC20 token, which is unique for each literary work.  Why would the value of the PBL token increase over time?  PBL is the currency of Publica's ecosystem. PBL supply is fixed (total supply: 33,787,150 PBL; circulating supply: 18,582,933 PBL ), the more users come, the less there will be amount in circulation due to e.g. escrows and some funds frozen. Thus, the demand will increase in the conditions of diminishing supply.",True

I heard he was one of the anointed ones early on. Princeton Graduate and with a cool $300,000 loan from his dad he built Amazon. Everybody loves Amazon pretty much. And how could you not? Prime is legit. Kindle was a big deal. Auto delivery of detergent was a big deal as well.  Jeff started with books, then became a machine. Now machines run Amazon building smart factories where robots do work, while humans supervise.  So‚Ä¶ Amazon is a big deal. Jeff is arguably even a bigger deal. What does this mean for Authors though? You know, the ones who built Amazon when he was slinging books through packages back in ‚Äò97.  That brings us to today.. how do authors make money at Amazon? Well, it‚Äôs complicated. But Amazon self-publishers can upload their manuscript and depending on how they price their book their royalty rates can change.  A lot of authors complain about royalty rates on Amazon and their lack of options when it comes to pricing options, so we are seeing a lot of authors looking for other platforms recently.You can make the argument that Amazon has helped more authors over the past 5 years than any other platform out there, but what does the future of publishing look like?  If you have been following the huge push for decentralized platforms (DPLs) over the past few years then you would think it might be on one. What does the future of DPLs for authors look like? And how can it help authors make more money? Or have more control? It might look like Publica. Let‚Äôs see what Publica looks like.  Direct transactions, using the Ethereum network? Sounds cool.. What does that even mean though?  Ok Publica is aiming to be the next big thing? Who runs it, and is it a good time to get in? Let‚Äôs first checkout their roadmap over the next few months.  https://medium.com/@lawrencedigitalco/publica-blockchain-books-and-bezos-4850e95f6e7d",True

I have seen many projects like this. Few of them deployed a dapp eventually. And the funny thing about the cryptospace is, when they deliver an alpha a product or etc. The people dump asap. eventually price dips. VOISE is a very similar project. Instead of book publishing a music publishing lets say. As soon as they delivered an alpha people dumped it. ITis also probably due to the quality. People were expecting something with great user interface like I tunes. But ofcourse it didnt have that. Besides it came with few song (mozart 9. symphony) so people were pissed and dumped.  I am almost certain that the same will happen with publica. It will go down and down from the first day on. Wont move up until they deliver something actually working and really advantegous for readers or authors. Publica doesnt have a solid tech people to do that and with very small money they have raised , they cant hire such a skilled team. if they are honest and not scammers. Then they will sell coins they held , which will dip prices .  So i will follow the project for sure. But too risky to invest before any tech development sign.  Good luck with your project,",True

Publica's ereader apps will match the quality of any ereader app. Our developers make mobile apps for the same class of critical customers.  Publica isn't building an online store like Amazon Kindle or iTunes, so there won't be anything to judged against their shopping experiences. Book lovers and business buyers will buy their READ Tokens in a Book ICO, and they'll interact with the authors' own websites and social media channels.

Are you relying on being first to market?  How will you gain traction with e-book readers?  Although I'm sure this project has plenty of early investors by now, I doubt they're all going to be avid consumers in PBL's actual book market.    In this regard, I'm skeptical of being able to obtain legitimate adoption of the platform by authors and consumers alike.  It may just be the case that Publica is ahead of its time.  However, blockchain technology is still not widely used by the public at large, which has me questioning how this project will ever get into the hands of its target audience.  There's a lot of other projects in other fields that expressed very similar ambitious goals, and yet they've struggled to gain popular adoption.  So I'm skeptical that Publica will be able to bridge this gap where others have failed.  I feel like it would require cooperation with retailers one some level, which leads to me back to my opening question.  Still, this looks like a good project.  The the team looks really solid.  The whitepaper is generally well-written (a few couple grammar errors).  It's an original idea that tries to solve an actual problem, and the problem seems like one that blockchain is poised to solve.    I can definitely sympathize with the problem that EULA's and other licensing arrangements can make on distributing digital copies.  Providing a means to irrevocably transfer ownership rights in e-books is very intriguing.  With that said, I'm hesitant as to whether the general audience for e-books: 1) is ready to embrace blockchain technology on such a wide scale, and 2) cares about the difference between license vs ownership.  As someone with a legal background, I can appreciate the difference.  But to the average consumer, is it really worth losing out on the convenience of just using Amazon (and only getting a license)?  Is the idea of true ownership really worth the hassle for people to learn how to use/operate an entirely new e-book platform and currency?  The whitepaper is extremely ambitious, so it'll be on the devs to consistently deliver on various goals.  If not, investors will lose confidence.  Best of luck!",True

SingularDTV is a good example of art funding, Kickico is a good example of kickstarting art, po.et does intellectual property registration, Authorship does translations, and ETHbooks does ebooks about crypto. So we have many fellow travelers. Publica tackles the heart of what happened when digital books were invented -- the digital rights management sytems (DRM) and the End User License Agreement (EULA). Those were devised by iTunes and Kindle specifically to deal with a thorny problem -- copyright law. It's so easy to copy digital books. So they borrowed a page from Microsoft DRM and video games developers, namely, the EULA. That's an agreement between the ""buyer"" and seller, and if you read one, it says that no ""buy"" has taken place. Only a private agreement, and therefore not subject to copyright law. This worked well in the beginning. But people think ""buy"" means I own it. I should be able to give a great book to my friend. Buy my child's university books for them. Gift 100 books to a deserving school in Tanzania (I lived there once.) Lend a digital book to a friend and they can give it back to me when they're done. Send a digital book to my friend in Lima who doesn't have a credit card and can't get an Amazon account. Sell my own books for USA prices in USA and Java prices in Java. None of those are possible with DRM and EULA's, unfortunately. So we fixed it. Buy a READ token to a book, and it goes in your wallet. Nobody can dispute that you own it. The money you paid for that book goes right into the author's wallet, now. No dispute about royalties, overseas ""charges,"" whatever. Author Paid Now. Sell the book you bought, when you want. Crypto. Buy 1,000 copies of its READ token and open a bookstore where you know there's a market for it.  You get the idea. It's the blockchain evolution.",True

I'll keep it simple, ask me if I can explain further.  November 1 to December 1 -- ICO crowdsale is open. Presale is open now. We'll mint the PBL Tokens right after December 1.  It's not a 5 year project, it's a right-now project. Maybe you saw a reference to a five years lock on 20% of PBL. Those aren't the PBL sold in the ICO! That's just in case the project needs them for something we can't predict today. But it won't take five years to see Publica in action. In fact,  The ICO ends December 1 and that directs our budget, effectively tells us what the community wants us to do. In December we'll put the system online in UX demo mode for user feedback. The Publica platform is for authors and readers who probably aren't familiar with Ethereum, so we have to make that a seamless UX.  The ICO soft cap, $1M, is for the first half of 2018. We'll put the PBL Exchange live, ereader app-wallets on app stores, Book ICO website templates for authors online, and their READ Tokens in smart contracts on Ethereum.  The ICO Milestone figure, $3M, isn't a cap. It's for the second half of 2018, so we can develop the RIGHTS Token system. That's mostly the legal framework for it. RIGHTS Tokens are the logical followup to the READ Tokens so that authors and PBL owners can take advantage of derivative rights like movies, games, merchandise, etc.  The ICO hard cap, $5M, is all the PBL we'll sell in the crowdsale. That budget is for 2019 and making the project famous around the world, beyond the fans of cryptocurrencies and tokenization.  Is that a better explanation?",True

I don't know how a hype-score happens but we're surely trying not to hype Publica. We're trying to explain it as we best understand it. I suppose some hype-score is due to our delegating some publicity tasks and ad-people naturally assume that hype-y words breed excitement. Anyway, I'm not a marketer so I'll just trust the pros. I appeared on the BadCrypto podcast because the hosts are authors and we got along great. We hear from our Telegram community that many people are joining in and supporting us because of that podcast. You can hear in my voice how we feel about this project. So now we're doing another couple videos, signed up to the Ethereum Davos conference to meet people, signed up to announce the Publica project to the booksellers world at FutureBook Conference on December 1. Trying to be as real and transparent as we can. We have a pretty big team working on Publica and everybody but me is either an ecommerce site developer, mobile app developer, or UI/UX FE/BE designer. I'm on the project because I worked on books all my life, all the odd jobs, and I have friends who're helping us with understanding the nitty gritty details of how the biz works around the world. Here's something I say to them often, and does this sound like hype? Because it's not, it's what we really talk about around here when we're talking about decentralization and tokenization. ""What happens if we reinvent Gutenberg's press for the blockchain? Or -- What if we DON'T?"" That can sound hype-y but if you really ponder it, it's pretty real. Cheers, Josef",True

Amazon and iTunes ebooks changed publishing for online retail but left the rest of the ecosystem to others. The online marketplace responded with many sites and services.  None of them have taken up the blockchain opportunity. Publica expects those sites and services to simply adopt Publica as their easy gateway to the benefits of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain revolution.  What‚Äôs the simple idea of the Publica project?  Publishing is a global economy and ecosystem unto itself.  Online retail is only one corner of it. DIY self-publishing is good but sacrifices some of the best parts of traditional publishing. They can be revived with elements of the gig economy and the sharing economy so long as the ecommerce is tailored to publishing.  Most of the ecommerce in making and publicizing great books happens before retail, starting with how book projects are funded. Book projects continue long after the release of their first editions.  Publica serves book projects from start to finish--and they don‚Äôt have to end. Some book projects can go on forever in new or expanded editions, derivative rights, audio books, movie scripts, games, merchandise, etc.  What‚Äôs the radical idea of the Publica project?  When you buy a paper book, you own it. The same should be true of an ebook. This is very different from a revokable license to read it on a proprietary device or app such as iTunes or Kindle.  No one, including Publica, can tell you what to do with your ebook. There are no terms to accept, no fine print, no subscriptions to maintain, no proprietary devices. The digital key you hold is the only proof of ownership you need.  This presents new business opportunites for authors, and total transparency for their readers and the rest of the people and businesses illustrated in the Publica Circle drawing.  What does Publica do for authors?  Advances on revenues in new Book ICO‚Äôs. That practice virtually disappeared in the Amazon/iTunes age and authors need it back.  Social networking with a professional edge, e.g., treating books as the projects they are. Project managers, collaborators, publicists, marketers, printers, and all the rest of the people and businesses that make books great and help authors reach the readers who want their books.  Authors need an ecosystem with simple, trustworthy ecommerce that looks more like a LinkedIn than a 50-page contract of fine print that serves lawyers better than authors.  New business models. Every new book is like a startup. The business model is as important as the creative writing, and one size doesn‚Äôt fit all.  In one easy example, readers can‚Äôt pass traditional ebooks along to their friends and colleagues for fear that the publisher might miss out on revenues. This stifles word-of-mouth marketing and forces all sales to unrealistic retail pricing. Ebooks languishing in an elibrary don‚Äôt help anyone except the minority of readers who want to re-read them.  At Publica, readers can resell ebooks on an open market. Authors can set creative new terms for ebook resales including a portion back to themselves or their next book project. They can promote word-of-mouth marketing, host a shop on their own site inlcuding like-minded authors, boost their fan clubs and book clubs, etc. Opportunites abound.  What does Publica do for readers?  Crowdfunding in creative ways. Whatever the readers, authors, institutions, and project managers can dream up in their business models to include their fans and readers who care and want to participate.  After reading, resell ebooks on an open market. This is also good for authors because they can get a portion of the resale on Publica.  In one easy example, university textbooks are expensive and students sell them back at a fraction of their purchase price. Universities don‚Äôt need that commerce, they do it because they have to, so the courses can happen on time.  At Publica, authors, project managers, and institutions can set creative new terms for book resales including a portion back to the book project or its successor (fund the next edition). Ebook resale market prices are then up to the seller (reader) and buyer (next reader).  How is Publica different from other ICO‚Äôs mentioning books or publishing? Publica is a platform for ecommerce in the publishing economy, including the social networking that fuels commerce between businesses, groups, and individuals who need to collaborate on book projects.  Other ICO‚Äôs will continue to address atomic portions of the publishing ecosystem, i.e., copyright registration, translation, retail ebook sales, advertising, reputation points, book recommendations, or crowdfunding. On the Publica Circle drawing, those are the corners nearest to the readers and authors. Publica addresses those too, plus all the rest of the publishing ecosystem so that everyone can enjoy the full benefits of social and commercial network effects.  What is PBL? Is it a token, a currency, a coin?  PBL, called Pebbles, are ERC20 tokens.",True

It is misleading to use a market cap in relation to ICOs, their tokens, and cryptocurrencies. Imagine a case, when you issue 1BN of tokens, price them at $1 each and manage to sell 1 million with the rest of them, say, reserved for your ecosystem. Does it mean your capitalization is $1BN and you made your way to unicorns in few weeks or months? I guess not.  So, just multiplying a price to a total amount of pre-mined coins or minted tokens is probably different than a conventional meaning of a market cap.  In Publica case, you can rather refer to monetary base of the economy because PBL is, in essence, private money that is circulated and accepted for any products and services that are traded on Publica platform. While market cap is based on flexible amount of shares that can be issued, Publica's PBLs are locked in their supply.",True

What's the bonus/discount structure for pre-sale?  No bonuses, we believe we have to treat all holders of PBL equally without regard to whether they bought them in the first week of ICO or in the second, third or fourth. Also, we look to attract people genuinely interested in the services they will be able to buy for PBLs, rather than buy them with discount in first week and sell as soon as the token is listed.  Quote 3. What's the maximum funds to be raised in pre-sale?  $30 Million  Quote 4. Any plan for the token to be listed on any exchanging websites such as Bittrex, Poloniex etc ....  YES, token trading is expected on several exchanges, yet we will disclose on which specifically after official approval.  Quote 5.

Slack is the most vulnerable for scam / phishing, so we discontinued its usage. You can follow our Facebook, Twitter, Telegram accounts or join Publica community.  Quote 9. Any partnerships?

Are all PBL token holders get RIGHTS and READ tokens or they will be like you announced in the white paper doing their own duties ... and won't be able for trading.  READ and RIGHTS tokens will be available for trading. Yet they correspond to READ rights of the specific book. The same with RIGHTS tokens, they will represent fraction of IP rights of a specific books with associated payouts.  Quote 11. When did the project started? Like the idea.

Here's an answer from our CEO:  We agree with you completely. As an author myself, I know the feeling whenever I close my word processor file of the book I'm currently writing because I have to go deal with publicity for my previous book. It hurts me inside because I want to keep working on my new book instead! Conversely, when I leave the marketing stuff to sneak back to writing my book-in-progress, I feel like I'm abandoning my other baby, the one that needs publicity now!  Sukhi Jutla of http://www.theauthorentrepreneurs.com/about and https://www.allianceindependentauthors.org/ is working on a campaign that Orna Ross calls ""Blockchain for Books"" and she explained it nicely. She told me that competition is a fact of life now, forever irrevocable because online self-publishing erased the barrier to entry. You have to let the professionals do it, supported by the magic of the Internet, to bring books to the attention of the people who are hungry for them. Shouting over the din no longer works and never will again. That's also a lesson I learned from Seth Godin's wonderful books.  Publica.io website is, today, mostly about the blockchain startup process. After the ICO we'll make it more about the lives of books and the people who make them. Software and platform network effects are the wood and the sparks that will ignite the book-discovery that you, I, and our public advisors want so much (they're authors too).  For me, the best way to visualize it is to stare at what we call ""the Publica circle."" It takes a village. There's always commerce involved. Notice the upper half of that circle -- it's all about how readers find the books they crave.    Best regards, Josef",True

To ignite the ecosystem, Publica is a platform for authors to offer their own token launches for their new books (Book ICOs).

Publica isn't raising $100 million dollars. We hope the website is clear. The ICO is capped at $51M because you can see in the economics white paper that the internal economy doesn't need more. If the ICO raises less, Publica will still do its business just fine. You can see in the ICO section of the website (and the economics white paper) that there's a Treasury of PBL reserved for Publica's fuel for the ecosystem of people who help to turn an author's crowdfunded work into a polished, edited, finished book. There's a Reserve of PBL for five years in case Publica finds a community-driven need to fuel those people again (or new entrants to the system), and if not, that Reserve goes into the same Treasury to fund more great books.  Please read the concept white paper to understand how serious we are taking this project. And the leaders whose names are on it. They really do not need to scam anyone and they have excellent reputations of their own to protect. They're serious people taking on an important job for the blockchain revolution, at their own risk.",True

Publica isn't raising $100 million dollars. We hope the website is clear. The ICO is capped at no more than $51M because you can see in the economics white paper that the internal economy needs, in our calculations, 1 billion PBL to provide the granularity that an economy of publishing's size may require to do business properly. If the ICO raises less, Publica will still do its business just fine. There's a Treasury of PBL reserved for Publica's fuel for the ecosystem of people who help to turn an author's crowdfunded work into a polished, edited, finished book. There's a Reserve for five years in case Publica finds a community need to fuel those people again, and if not, that Reserve goes into the same Treasury to fund more great books.  Publica has the ability to buy a field-tested set of apps and back office systems that do the job. Our developers have built test systems with Solidity. Our roadmap shows where the end-to-end demonstration to the public falls in the roadmap along with the inaugural set of books, the token exchange, the introduction of RIGHT tokens, ereader and ewriter devices, and so on. We look forward to your comments about that roadmap (https://publica.io/whitepaper.pdf).",True
