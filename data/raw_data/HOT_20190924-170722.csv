By the way, it would be very interesting that the Holo Team begin a wide campaign of the project, because if you guys do not take care of it, this coin goes to 1 satoshi very fast. Only Twitter and Medium isn´t enough to let the market know how interesting this project is.  Another tip is find a solution to this same ticker problem. Although Holo and Hydro aren´t trade in the same exchange, two equal tickers can bring some market confusion.  All HOLO investors wants a reaction, guys!

It's Holochain... a DHT system (similar to BitTorrent) but in fact Holo is the main competitor of Hashgraph with the advantage that Holo is opensource and not owned by a company, it already has a product (or better... has already many products) and has already completed its ICO with an excellent result and is doing very well in exchanges after ICO ... so even though Holo is less known and despite the huge hype that goes around Hashgraph ... well maybe Hashgraph came too late!

BUT it is the content creator itself who is at fault, not the website hosting service. Generally speaking, open systems like Holo are going to be horrible for these sorts of illegal activites. For starters, privacy is not baked into the technology. So miscreants are already setting themselves up to be discovered  2) you aren't hosting an entire project, per se, but likely small fractions of data from an app. YOu can anticipate thousands and thousands of hosters proiding this service.  It's quite likely illegal activity will have little usability or readability on your hosting side of things because it will be randomly fragmented  As for participating in the Holo ecosystem, I would say that any abhorrent activity I witnessed would lead me to contact the app developers ASAP.",False

I am glad I did, that is how I find out about Holochain, I am totally enthusiastic and that project really promises!  I participated in ICO, and just like you, I will buy holoport to support this project! I had to go to bank to order Visa Electron to be able to pay Holoport. If maybe anyone knows how long this price for Holoports will last and how long they will be available on indiegogo, please let me know! I ask this because some holons in Holo telegram group mentioned that this price for Holoports will last just for a few days.  I don't really care, that many don't even know that Holochain exist!

Early investors gain a better return on investment because their Holo will represent a certain amount of computing power on the network for hosting. As hosters on the network compete to obtain decentralized app data to host, smaller amounts of holo will be demanded in order to gain hosting.  To put it in a dollar context, lets make this overly simple...  if 1 holo = 1 dollar...  There will be a cost for hosting data for decentralized apps. Developers will need to pay for this (and users will indirectly pay for this by paying within the application). They will buy Holo.  If at first it cost 1 holo (around 1 dollar) for basic amount of computing power...over time as more individuals grab Holo Ports and host data to earn Holo, they will compete to gain contracts for hosting. Perhaps someone will be willing to host the same amount of computing power for 95 cents  In time, we will see that people will compete to host decentralized apps for less than less Holo. But the cost and demand to host applications will not decrease. This means the value of Holo will increase in it's USD value.",False

It is a mutual credit accounting system.  Our developers have been at the forefront of alternative forms of exchanging value (aka “currency”) before bitcoin even existed. Their masterpiece, Holochain, is even just a piece of a larger puzzle, Ceptr. Holo is large enough to try and grasp, so this page will be devoted to Holo/Holochain news and basic understanding only. The full picture will come sooner than you think.     What are Holochain and Holo?   Holochain is a data integrity engine for distributed applications. It uses a validating DHT (Distributed Hash Table) where every user has their own chain. A transaction is signed and countersigned onto each parties chain and then this information is published to the shared Distributed Hash Table. (Never heard of a DHT? One of the more famous Hash Tables used is found in BitTorrent.) THIS IS NOT a blockchain.    Holo is an ecosystem built on top of Holochain and composed of hosts and users of distributed computing. Hosts can host truly distributed apps and get paid in Holo fuel for hosting.   Holo fuel is not a token or a coin—it’s an asset-backed mutual-credit crypto-accounting system. Holo fuel combines the idea of mutual-credit currencies that enable healthy ecosystems of flow and balance with cryptography for data integrity to create a type of cryptocurrency designed to be useful and relatively stable for the promotion of growth in active ecosystems, and not stagnant, volatile, or conducive to speculation.   Simply put, we are building Holochain to create not just a decentralized internet, but a distributed internet. Applications of all kinds will be built on Holochain and since it will be truly peer to peer, the future internet will not be beholden to the current internet hosting industry.

FAQ  Why call it Holo? Holo comes from the word hologram or holographic. Any part of a hologram contains the whole image. If you try to cut out a piece of a hologram, you learn that the whole image is still there. Holo is holographic in that an agent not only signs transactions to their own chain, they also back up small amounts of data from the applications via the shared DHT. Just like BitTorrent, if a user who uploads a file is cut off from the BitTorrent DHT, so long as there are other nodes hosting data for the file, the whole file is still there. The same will be true for Holo.    Is anything being built on Holochain right now?  YES   We currently see development on a number of  distributed apps, including… - Clutter is Holo’s version of Twitter -Serverless wiki called FractalWiki -Holochat, a chatroom for team collaboration -DPKI, a cryptographic key management tool  Can I mine Holo?  No. You can earn Holo by hosting data from our distributed applications.    Why a DHT as opposed to a PoW or PoS based algorithm?  A number of reasons. It allows for truly global scaling. Currently the top cryptocurrency, bitcoin, is facing extreme constraints on transaction usage. The top decentralized computing platform, Ethereum, is experiencing the same problem and we are not even close to mass adoption.  In Holochain, sharding via the DHT allows the nodes to only hold portions of the global transactions within the system, allowing for massive scaling to take place.  It is lightweight enough that cell phones could run a node on our system.    Okay, so Holochain is distributed. How is that different from decentralized?  The difference between distributed and decentralized is the difference between all of the blockchain technology currently in place and Holo.  Holochain will be distributed, which is to say truly peer to peer. Blockchains are decentralized in that there is no central authority controlling the network, but every single action must be sent through the network to be verified by every node. This is unusually burdensome for activities that are more than just “currency” exchanges.  Many people like the security provided by PoW blockchains where every single transaction is recorded in a global ledger held by 10,000s of people. This is completely unnecessary when we look at broader transactions that can occur in our society.  Take Twitter, for example. A blockchain based micro blogging platform is needlessly wasteful. Why would someone tweeting need to run their tweet to be validated through a global blockchain?  Or P2P Air BNB. If John wants to rent to Jill, does that transaction need to go through every single person in the network? Why would they have a say in that? This is where everyone having their own chain comes into play.  Holo is much, much more than digital cash or digital gold.    Here are the many ways in which Holo will be utilized:     Social Networks, Social Media & VRM: You want to run a social network without a company like Facebook in the middle. You want to share, post, publish, or tweet to shared space, while automatically keeping a copy of these things on your own device.   Supply Chains & Open Value Networks: You want to have information that crosses the boundaries of companies, organizations, countries, which is collaboratively shared and managed, but not under the central control of any one of those organizations.   Cooperatives and New Commons: You want to create something which is truly held collectively and not by any particular individual. This is especially good for digital assets.  P2P Platforms: Peer-to-Peer applications where every person has similar capabilities, access, responsibilities, and value is produced collectively.  Collective Intelligence: Governance, decision-making frameworks, feedback systems, ratings, currencies, annotations, or work flow systems.  Collaborative Applications: Chats, Discussion Boards, Scheduling Apps, Wikis, Documentation, etc.  Reputational, or Mutual Credit Cryptocurrencies: Currencies where issuance can be accounted for by actions of peers (like ratings), or through double-entry accounting are well-suited for holochains. Fiat currencies where tokens are thought to exist independent of accountability by agents are more challenging to implement on holochains.      What does agent-centric mean?  Yet another way Holo is completely unique in the cryptospace. All blockchain and DAG currencies are data centric. In a sense, they treat data as real as opposed to the abstraction of reality it is. This one gets a bit deep, so keep your thinking cap ready and dive into Arthur Brock’s categorization of the data centric approach seen in blockchains today and Holo’s agent centric approach.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JV8QZsNpFok    Stay tuned for big news and developments!",False
