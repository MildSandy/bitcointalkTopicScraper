Buy VIB tokens without using an exchange  February 21, 2018 by Vasja Veber  After our extremely successful ICO, many of my friends and family members wanted me to explain how to buy our token. For them, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies were still a fairly new phenomenon and they simply did not have the tech know-how of buying or selling them. Now, when more people know the basics, it has become easier for them to venture into the world of Viberate.  Viberate is on a mission to become a global digital marketplace where musicians get paid in cryptocurrencies. This has numerous benefits, such as faster and more transparent transactions. To achieve this and to offer enough liquidity, what is crucial is a massive adoption of crypto coins and tokens.  At Viberate, we always strive to give every imaginable solution to make the process of getting VIB tokens as fast and simple as possible. Therefore, connecting with Changelly, the cryptocurrency exchange service, is a huge step in the right direction for us! Yes — our VIB token has been added as a trading pair, which makes it even more accessible and easily obtainable.  VIB token listed on Changelly  From now on, you can purchase VIB tokens by credit card via the Changelly service. All you have to do is get an Ethereum wallet (learn how to get it here), which only takes a few seconds, and you’re all set — you can then buy tokens with your Visa or Mastercard. It is safe to use, too, since Changelly uses two-factor authentications and doesn’t store funds, but instead just processes them directly to your wallet.  And there’s a ‘bonus track’. Listing the token on the platform allows a seamless exchange with more than 80 other tokens and coins. As we want to facilitate the whole process, the purchase can now be made directly on our website — which means an even faster service and a friendlier user experience! For more information, see the step-by-step tutorial on how to buy VIB on Changelly.",False

Buy VIB tokens without using an exchange  February 21, 2018 by Vasja Veber  After our extremely successful ICO, many of my friends and family members wanted me to explain how to buy our token. For them, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies were still a fairly new phenomenon and they simply did not have the tech know-how of buying or selling them. Now, when more people know the basics, it has become easier for them to venture into the world of Viberate.  Viberate is on a mission to become a global digital marketplace where musicians get paid in cryptocurrencies. This has numerous benefits, such as faster and more transparent transactions. To achieve this and to offer enough liquidity, what is crucial is a massive adoption of crypto coins and tokens.  At Viberate, we always strive to give every imaginable solution to make the process of getting VIB tokens as fast and simple as possible. Therefore, connecting with Changelly, the cryptocurrency exchange service, is a huge step in the right direction for us! Yes — our VIB token has been added as a trading pair, which makes it even more accessible and easily obtainable.  VIB token listed on Changelly  From now on, you can purchase VIB tokens by credit card via the Changelly service. All you have to do is get an Ethereum wallet (learn how to get it here), which only takes a few seconds, and you’re all set — you can then buy tokens with your Visa or Mastercard. It is safe to use, too, since Changelly uses two-factor authentications and doesn’t store funds, but instead just processes them directly to your wallet.  And there’s a ‘bonus track’. Listing the token on the platform allows a seamless exchange with more than 80 other tokens and coins. As we want to facilitate the whole process, the purchase can now be made directly on our website — which means an even faster service and a friendlier user experience! For more information, see the step-by-step tutorial on how to buy VIB on Changelly.",False

Many governments referred to Slovenia as the Silicon Valley of Europe, but so far there has been no major breakthrough in this area; however, it seems that with the advent of blockchain technology, we are getting closer to this ambitious vision, and the government of dr. Miro Cerar is increasingly aware of this. That is why the Prime Minister, dr. Miro Cerar, the Minister of Economic Development and Technology, Zdravko Pocivalšek, and a number of State Secretaries attended a working meeting at the Viberate premises today. Together with some other successful domestic blockchain start-ups, they discussed the advantages and traps posed by this technology and the aim of making Slovenia more attractive for the domestic and foreign blockchain companies. https://themerkle.com/slovenia-is-becoming-a-target-destination-for-blockchain-companies/",False

To speed up the process of suggesting changes, we upgraded the system which detects completely faulty links, so you will get the immediate response that the link is not correct. That way, you can minimize the time you spend suggesting changes to the database and maximize your efficiency.  Verification for all accounts  As of today, SMS verification is mandatory for all accounts, including Facebook and Google, which means you will get a text with a code to verify your account. This way, we’ll be able to minimize the number of fake registrations and provide additional security. In the upcoming updates, SMS verification will be implemented for withdrawal requests as well. In case you created your account with Facebook or Google and you want to change the password on the site, our system will recognize it and tell you to switch to Facebook or Google account to proceed.

Please check our contribution guide here: https://medium.com/viberate-blog/viberate-contribution-guide-f3f62cfec3ba  Viberate Contribution Guide  December 4, 2017 by Matic Magister  As we know a lot of hard work goes into curating entities on Viberate, we’ve prepared a brief instructional guide to help you speed up the process and avoid denials as much as possible.  GENERAL RULES FOR ALL CHANNELS  Following these rules will greatly reduce the time you spend contributing to the platform and the time our curating team needs to check the submissions. The content from any channel you add should not be older than 2 years (applies only to new entries and not to the links already in our database). Please don’t add artists that are either inactive or deceased. We’re a live music platform, trying to help artists get booked and paid. Please don’t add links leading to empty channels and don’t replace the existing links with ones that have a different url, but lead to the same channel (YouTube channel links are the most common example here).  ARTISTS  Below, you’ll find some general guidelines for the links that Viberate showcases in the artist profiles. To some extent they also apply to the venue profiles (explained in the venue section below).  Mandatory Links  When adding a new artist, you have to include one of the 2 mandatory links in order for the submission to be accepted. Enter the link to either the artist’s Facebook or Spotify page, and at least one other social media channel.  ✅Spotify needs to start with https://open.spotify.com/artist/... Spotify user profiles will be denied. https://open.spotify.com/user/… ✅Facebook must be a page, not a profile. We accept only legit or verified pages, all of the fan pages will be rejected.  Other links This is a page, we will accept these. ✅Twitter We’ll accept legit or verified twitter accounts. ✅Soundcloud Make sure it’s not a fan-generated profile and that the channel has content. ✅YouTube Make sure it’s not an auto-generated profile (they usually have the word “topic” in the name). The channel should also have some content uploaded to it.  An example of an auto-generated profile ✅Beatport Only submit links that start with https://www.beatport.com/artist/umek/4177. Don’t submit dj.beatport links, as they will be rejected. ✅Instagram Make sure it’s not a fan-generated instagram profile before submitting the link. We accept private and open profiles. ✅Homepage There aren’t any restrictions when it comes to homepage. Just don’t link other social media channels here. ✅Google+ Make sure the account is legit or verified. Fan accounts will be rejected. It should also have some content uploaded to it. ✅Mixcloud Only link legit accounts with actual content. ✅Songkick Make sure the account is legit or verified and has at least one event (upcoming or past) listed. ✅Bandsintown We accept verified accounts or accounts with 10+ events listed on the profile. Empty ones will be rejected. ✅iTunes https://itunes.apple.com/si/artist/umek/80110059.This is what we’d like our iTunes links to look like. Don’t add links to specific albums or tracks. ✅Shazam It has to be a legit or a verified account. ✅Tumblr Just make sure it’s not a fan-generated profile. ✅Gigatools Make sure it matches the artists name and contains at least 5 (past or upcoming) events.  VENUES There are no mandatory links for adding new venues to our database, but we’d appreciate it if you could add links to at least some channels, to ease the workload of our curating team. When curating existing venues, please follow the guidelines that apply to artists.  EVENTS When it comes to events, you can only add them to our database. You can’t curate the existing ones. You can add events in the main menu in the upper-right corner (+ADD) or directly on an artist’s profile. The difference is, when you add them to an artist’s profile, the artist will be automatically added to the line-up.  ✅Add an event via the menu bar (+ADD) ✅…or directly to an artist’s profile  When you’re adding an event, and can’t find the venue listed in the drop-down menu, you can type the name of the venue and address in the Venue Name field, and we’ll add it to our database.

N.9 is a real treat. https://medium.com/viberate-blog/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-imogen-heap-eed92fdefd60  February 23, 2018 by Nina Frančeškin  Working with the 2-time Grammy Award-winning artist has been a sheer delight. Heap is an exceptional and inspiring performer, known to be an early adopter of the blockchain, and her main role in our advisory team is to help further guide us in being the best service for the live music industry that truly works for the music maker and to spread the word about Viberate. To give you an idea of the energy she brings to the table, we’ve put together a list of just a few interesting things you probably don’t know about her.  10 things you didn’t know about Imogen Heap  Viberate’s celebrity ambassador Imogen Heap  1. Heap was classically trained in several instruments including the piano, cello and clarinet and taught herself to play the guitar, drums, array mbira and the Hang. 2. She has been exploring music technology since her early teenage years, when she was often exiled to the room filled with it as a form of punishment at her boarding school. That’s when she taught herself the basics of sampling and sequencing. 3. Growing up, she was split between classical music and rave. 4. She began writing songs by the age of 13 and signed her first record deal at the age of 18. 5. Her first major break came in 1996, when she performed four songs between sets by Eric Clapton and The Who. 6. Heap has since released 4 studio albums and 4 extended plays, got 6 Grammy Award nominations and 2 wins. 7. TV-show freaks will recognize her single “Hide and Seek” that was featured in the season 2 finale of The O.C. series, while theater buffs will undoubtedly spot the background soundtrack she composed for the Harry Potter and the Cursed Child play. 8. She played keyboards in Jon Bon Jovi’s song “Queen of New Orleans”. 9. Heap crowdsourced 20 unique animators from all over the world to make the stunning music video for “Telemiscommunications”, the electro-pop ballad she released together with Deadmau5. 10. Although she’s British, some 42% of her shows were held in the US.  All in all, Imogen Heap is the best celebrity ambassador we could imagine. She’s an exceptional artist that’s been a source of inspiration to many of today’s superstars — including Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande. She is widely known for her long-standing interest and involvement in blockchain technologies (learn about her Mycelia project here), and that is just another reason why we, at Viberate, are so excited to have her on board.  And she might even join us at our headquarters sometime in the future. How about that?",False

The result  is a much better overview of the agencies’ landscape that users can easily navigate through. I hope this will only be the beginning of the site's upgrading, and we will soon get a better and easier search. Because it is nothing less than Viberate Team.

The 160% growth in one day forced intraday traders to take profits. Consequently, the market closed significantly lower at 0.00003747.     // -- Discuss and ask questions in our community on Workplace. Selling continued for a few more days until the market went as low as 0.000023 on December 28. Sensing a bullish higher low was in place, participants bought positions, and pushed the market as high as 0.000065 on January 28, 2018. At that point, however, the market was nearly overbought, and that was enough for bottom pickers to take profits. Since then, the market has been correcting, but this dip offers you the chance to buy near a firm support level.  Technical analysis reveal that VIB/BTC is well on its way to retest support of 0.000025. Trading volume has been anemic since the January 28 surge. This indicates that sellers are losing ammo. In addition, the trading range has been gradually narrowing. Eventually, ask and bid prices will meet and when that happens, the market will most likely explode up.  The strategy is to buy as close to 0.000025 support as possible. For now, we will employ the simple buy the support, and sell the resistance play. A successful retest of 0.000025 will most likely take the market up to our initial target at 0.00005.

What inspired you to get involved in the cryptocurrency space?  I got intrigued by the main idea behind Viberate, which is, to put it really simple, democratizing the global music business. It levels the playing field for all parties involved. If this catches on it will bring big changes to music industry, especially in the field of artist bookings, negotiating label deals and the management of copyrights.  When you are looking for investors in traditional business environment, you can get blocked easily by couple of influential people or companies not showing any interest for a groundbreaking project. We’ve made a detailed business proposal that was thoroughly scrutinized online by everybody interested and crypto currency allowed us to get investment for this project from many major and micro investors. We raised $1M in seed capital and then went on to execute one of the most successful ICOs in the music industry to date, raising $10.7M in under five minutes. In a little over four months we managed to hit every deadline set in our roadmap, so the project is going as planned.  Aside from over 160,000 artist profiles we are now tracking stats and featuring information for 60,000 venues, couple hundred thousand events and around 2,000 booking agencies. It is an open sourced database, so users add around 2,000 new profiles to Viberate every day and in exchange we are giving VIB tokens to the contributors. We won't stop until we change the music industry for good.  What impact do you think new technologies (like cryptocurrency) will have on the future of electronic music?  They might totally change music business. Right now, there are already at least five companies developing new solutions for the protection and management of music copyrights. The current system of copyrights is obviously not working, as it didn’t offer a working solution for this since the rise of Internet. The system of blockchain and cryptocurrencies allows you to monitor use of every single track used in digital world.  On Viberate we are also introducing smart contract for artists bookings that will bring more transparency to the market and give power to all parties involved, not only the dominant one. These are only two issues we can solve with new technologies and they are already solid fundament for big changes in the music industry, though there are many more. We have many more ideas but I can’t talk about them just yet.  amazing facts  Join the revolution www.viberate.com",False

And we’re no exception. Although we rely on the social media channels to get our message out and spread our word (and VIBs), the posted content can quickly turn from talked-about to talked-badly-about.  Spamming is just bad. Bad for the followers and supporters, bad for consumers, bad for our brand’s image — it decreases the effect of our objectives and damages our credibility. Our spam sensors are, therefore, always on high alert and lately, we’ve noticed a rise in it on our social media channels. To build a strong and genuine social media presence, we at Viberate have to make sure our communication is as clean and spam-free as possible.  Therefore, we’ve fine-tuned our promotion rules and prepared a general promotion guide to ensure that only the content of the highest quality gets to be shared with our audience.

We’ve just made important changes to our rulebook on rewarding the promotional activities on social media.  From now on, good content will carry the day, while spammers can say goodbye to potential rewards. So, if you want to earn tokens by promoting our product and vision, there are a couple of things you need to know.  First things first  After you successfully connect your social media channels to your Viberate account, it’s time to start promoting. On your Viberate profile, you’ll find mentions and links which we look for when calculating the reward. Some of these links are permanent (such as the links to our websites and social media channels), while others (links to blog posts, articles) change from time to time. To qualify for the reward, you have to include them in your posts.  Hard work pays off  It is also not enough to just share or retweet the provided links or mention us on social media. These kinds of posts are not well-accepted and will thus no longer be rewarded. So, make sure you write constructive, informative posts with relevant and useful content. And don’t worry, we’ll notice your efforts and reward you accordingly.     Eyes on the prize  We put quality first. That is why on Facebook and Twitter, high-quality posts with lots of likes and shares will get you to a higher rewarding rank. To prevent spamming, we’ve also updated the rules for promoting on BitcoinTalk: from now on, only users with constructive posts and a full-member status or higher will be able to benefit from the rewarding system on the platform. Oh, and don’t forget: attaching Viberate’s official BitcoinTalk signature to your posts will rocket you into a higher rewarding rank too.  Check our updated Promotion Guide",False

And we’re no exception. Although we rely on the social media channels to get our message out and spread our word (and VIBs), the posted content can quickly turn from talked-about to talked-badly-about.  Spamming is just bad. Bad for the followers and supporters, bad for consumers, bad for our brand’s image — it decreases the effect of our objectives and damages our credibility. Our spam sensors are, therefore, always on high alert and lately, we’ve noticed a rise in it on our social media channels. To build a strong and genuine social media presence, we at Viberate have to make sure our communication is as clean and spam-free as possible.  Therefore, we’ve fine-tuned our promotion rules and prepared a general promotion guide to ensure that only the content of the highest quality gets to be shared with our audience.

Viberate is a crowdsourced live music ecosystem and a blockchain-based marketplace, where musicians are matched with booking agencies and event organizers. The aim is to list and map the global live music industry, deliver more transparency, increase payment discipline, and enable under-the-radar artists to gain exposure.  Heap and Viberate will work creatively towards empowering those in the live music segment in listing and mapping the global live music ecosystem by building a database of profiles for musicians, venues, agencies and event organizers. The project’s goal is to set a standard for the live music industry and connect the stakeholders in a way that they will be able to get in contact and do business with one another directly on the platform.  Vasja Veber, Viberate’s co-founder and COO, says that Imogen Heap is the best celebrity ambassador they could imagine: “Influencer marketing has been a hot topic lately and as a music service we are always on the lookout for partnerships with famous musicians. Imogen is not only one of the best artists out there and an inspiration to many of today’s superstars, she is also widely known for getting on the blockchain train before it was cool. We respect that and that is why we are so excited to have her on board.”  The vision of the two-time Grammy Award-winning artist is a sustainable music industry ecosystem. With her Mycelia Creative Passports project, she is working on new potentials for music makers and the services who interact with their works in light of the distributed ledger technology and smart contracts. She says: “Blockchain has become the long overdue catalyst for the music industry to update its policy and business models toward music makers and to provide quicker and seamless experiences for anyone involved in creating or interacting with music“.  Once she discovered Viberate’s mission, she felt excited about the opportunities Viberate could give to the music industry: “Anything that involves music makers being independent and having space where they can reach out to anybody who wants to make business directly with them is a really positive thing.”  https://www.xlr8r.com/news/2018/02/viberate-announces-collaboration-with-imogen-heap/",False

I've seen the news that a new crypt currency is coming to the market, and because it seems an interesting idea, I've posted here to share with you.  ico600x315new.png  World known and acknowledged tech DJ Umek and his co-workers sent a novelty to the web space a month ago with the desire to bring some order into world music chaos. An online platform that promises to make musicians and listeners what has been IMDB for movie actors and filmmakers has been called Viberate.  UMEK.jpg  Umek-–-Live-@-WMC-2012-Winter-Music-Conference-Mixmag-DJ-Lab-Miami.jpg  So they created Slovenian startup team Viberate, which the European Commission selected one month ago for 8 young European companies that will change the world music industry. On September 5, they will present their own crypto coin, intended for paying music performances.  Viberate currently offers insights into more than 120,000 profiles of musicians, and the platform will soon be upgraded into a music marketplace where music event organizers can hire in exchange for paying in coin crypts - including their own crypto currency, which they named it Vibe.  viberate_kampanja_press_1200x800_2.jpg  Viberate is already using great names in the world music scene. Among other things, the official profile was taken over by the super-star Robbie Williams, which is a huge recognition for a small Slovenian startup. The announcement of the new crypt coin for music is already echoing in the world public, especially on the so-called ''Blockchain'' scene, since the team was joined by Charlie Shrem, founder of Bitcoin Foundation and one of the first people in the world to recognize the potential of bitcoin. In the world of crypto currencies, Shrem has a cult status, and Viberate joined as a consultant because his idea is close to him, among other things he managed the first discotheque in the US, which used bitcoin as a means of payment.",False

Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments.

To provide greater security and grow a healthier user base, we’ve decided to implement an SMS verification as well. In practice, it means that upon registration, you’ll get a text with a PIN code to verify your account and complete the registration process. This way, we’ll be able to minimize the number of fake registrations and provide additional security. In the upcoming updates, SMS verification will be implemented for the transactions as well.

Just using VIB to perform all the action doesnt mean it has  value.  Bying something with a token doesnt give a token value, its the thing you buy that has value. If VIB is just a medium of exhange on a platform it wont capture value. The VIB developpers need to take a real look at this or their token holders are headind for trouble in the long run. For example a dual token system where VIB is burned or/and minted. Burning VIB when entering data (this would be an incentive to hold,without VIB the platform wouldn't be able to function) and pay outs (coming from advertising) in ETH. Just non waterproof suggestions, but I hope to see decent answers from the team instead of usage examples.  ",False

Cryptocurrencies are our chance, this is our moment.   TEAM When we were raising our seed round everyone told us to emphasize our team in our presentation. So in the end our deck was around 30% about the people, working on the project. One of the investors then told us in the simplest way possible, why they invest into teams and not projects. He said: “I’d rather invest into a great team with an OK idea than into a crappy team with a great idea. You can have the best idea in the world, but can’t execute it with a bad team.” 2. SOLVING OUR OWN PAINS We started the project because we were lost in the flood of trends in music. New artists emerge daily and it’s hard to be on top of things, no matter how experienced you are. When you’re solving your own problems, you’ll go extra mile to nail it. We’ve always followed the rule that said: “If we want it to be good enough for clients, it first needs to be good enough for us.” The same goes for Viberate. 3. KEEPING IT REAL The ICO boom has seen some insane valuations for projects that were barely existing as an idea, scribbled on a napkin. Vasja already shared our thoughts about uncapped ICOs, but it’s not only about not having a cap, it’s also about where you set it. In order to develop all planned features we need around $6M and then we need all the money we can get to advertise it globally. We could spend hundreds of millions on advertising, but we set our ad cap at another $6M. It’s a lot of money, but global campaigns cost much more than that. Still, it’s enough to kickstart the service and go from there. 4. WE ACTUALLY EXIST This isn’t really an argument when you’re raising money from VC funds. But apparently it is when you’re selling tokens. Viberate already exist as an awesome service, where you can explore the world of live music, find new acts or if you’re a musician — open up a profile and use it to monitor the popularity of your career. By buying VIB tokens, you are contributing to a project that already has value and a vibrant community covering our backs. The database you see today was built with the help of over 50 thousand contributors. We achieved a lot, but that’s only the tip of an iceberg. Here’s what’s still in front of us. 5. MUSIC ISN’T GOING ANYWHERE The guys at Hacked.com said it best: “Live music isn’t going away, and becomes more valuable as recorded music sales continue to decline. The potential to provide disruptive services which actually benefit the industry they target is great, and even a 10% take of the industry leader in ticket sales would equate to almost a billion dollars in annual revenues.” Recorded music is nowadays mostly a promotional tool to help drive ticket sales. For most of musicians, their primary revenue source are live shows and there’s no sign of changes here. A lot of artists are giving away their music to fans for free and hope that they will show support by attending a live show. That’s why we decided to put our focus entirely to the live music segment, because we’re sure it will only get bigger.",False

You ask, we listen. From now on, it won’t be possible to add artists and venues that are already in the database or pending, and the same goes for suggesting changes for their profiles. When you try to add an artist or a venue to the database, the system detects the links to their social media pages and prevents you from adding an existing entry. That way, you can minimize the time you spend contributing to the database and maximize your efficiency. @viberate",False

Let’s take a look at the changes.  Say hello to the SMS account verification Up until now, users have only had to verify their newly created accounts via email. To provide greater security and grow a healthier user base, we’ve decided to implement an SMS verification as well. In practice, it means that upon registration, you’ll get a text with a PIN code to verify your account and complete the registration process. This way, we’ll be able to minimize the number of fake registrations and provide additional security. In the upcoming updates, SMS verification will be implemented for the transactions as well.   Faster transactions, better results Speaking of transactions, there are some updates in this area too. As our user base has grown exponentially, there has been an ever-growing number of transaction requests, which is why we’ve decided to speed up the process by determining the minimum amount that you’ll be able to withdraw from your Viberate account and transfer to your wallets or exchanges of choice. The limit is currently set to 100 VIB. This way, we can provide a faster service and an even better user experience. Cheers to that!  Greater efficiency in building the database Yes, we’ve made it happen. You ask, we listen. From now on, it won’t be possible to add artists and venues that are already in the database or pending, and the same goes for suggesting changes for their profiles. When you try to add an artist or a venue to the database, the system detects the links to their social media pages and prevents you from adding an existing entry. That way, you can minimize the time you spend contributing to the database and maximize your efficiency.",False

Let’s take a look at the changes.  Say hello to the SMS account verification  Up until now, users have only had to verify their newly created accounts via email. To provide greater security and grow a healthier user base, we’ve decided to implement an SMS verification as well. In practice, it means that upon registration, you’ll get a text with a PIN code to verify your account and complete the registration process. This way, we’ll be able to minimize the number of fake registrations and provide additional security. In the upcoming updates, SMS verification will be implemented for the transactions as well.

Let’s take a look at the changes.  Say hello to the SMS account verification Up until now, users have only had to verify their newly created accounts via email. To provide greater security and grow a healthier user base, we’ve decided to implement an SMS verification as well. In practice, it means that upon registration, you’ll get a text with a PIN code to verify your account and complete the registration process. This way, we’ll be able to minimize the number of fake registrations and provide additional security. In the upcoming updates, SMS verification will be implemented for the transactions as well.  Faster transactions, better results Speaking of transactions, there are some updates in this area too. As our user base has grown exponentially, there has been an ever-growing number of transaction requests, which is why we’ve decided to speed up the process by determining the minimum amount that you’ll be able to withdraw from your Viberate account and transfer to your wallets or exchanges of choice. The limit is currently set to 100 VIB. This way, we can provide a faster service and an even better user experience. Cheers to that!  Greater efficiency in building the database Yes, we’ve made it happen. You ask, we listen. From now on, it won’t be possible to add artists and venues that are already in the database or pending, and the same goes for suggesting changes for their profiles. When you try to add an artist or a venue to the database, the system detects the links to their social media pages and prevents you from adding an existing entry. That way, you can minimize the time you spend contributing to the database and maximize your efficiency.",False

ABSTRACT This paper describes the crowdsourced booking and payment platform for the live music industry that will ultimately be scaled to all live creative engagements. Based on the Ethereum platform, it utilizes smart contracts that solve decades-old problems that live performers have with getting demand, determining their value/price, negotiating terms, executing agreements and getting paid. Its main pillars are an innovative database of millions of artist profiles, ranked according to social media popularity; a tokenized incentive program for musicians’ fans; a talent booking process; and a blockchain-based contract and payment system. The paper explains two main parts: • The core focus of the service: live music ecosystem database and a live music marketplace, and • the implementation of the blockchain technology and the Vibe token.",False

Small, independent music enterprises such as underground clubs, labels and local event organizers are bullied out of the business by big, often even corrupt, corporations on a daily basis. This represents a dooming effect on the cultural diversity of mankind. The preservation of independent creative engagements is a crucial driving force for maintaining our creative spirits that define us as people. The live music market’s demand side is represented by the event organizers while the supply side is represented by musicians. Musicians need agents in order to land enough gigs to make a living, and most of the musicians don’t stand a chance of getting spotted. Only a fraction of a percent of all the world’s musicians have proper representation and are lucky enough to have music as their primary source of income. The rest are left on their own, struggling with exposure in a heavily saturated market, dealing with marketing, sales, networking, legal, taxation and debt collection issues instead of focusing on the creative part of the music business. Many times those artists don’t work with contracts, are often not compensated for their work, or don’t have the option of working legally at all (ex. cash payments, tax evasion). Absence of a powerful and honest intermediary often means trouble for the artist in any of the aforementioned fields. There is a clear need for an entity that would effectively and safely represent all those who don’t have a privilege of an agent. Blockchain technology offers the best tools for this task.",False

According to Vasja Veber, COO and cofounder of Viberate, 1.2 million dollars’ worth of tokens will be daily distributed among users that actively contribute to the website in order to cherish applied efforts. In his statement, Mr. Veber also stressed that examined approach not only means that some of Viberate suppoters will be able to quit their day jobs, but also gives the token, inherented to Viberate’s ecosystem, the utility value not a lot of blockchain projects have. Viberate encourages everyone who have ever dreamt to work in music to join its rapidly developing community. Along with pure enthusiasm for the company’s vision and love of music, it requires active contribution to the platform developing",False

Yes, the more you contribute the higher the reward. The bounty pool gets distributed among 3 segments: Contribution, growth and promotion. We release 5000 VIB daily which get distributed among participants. If there are more participants, the reward gets smaller because everyone gets a share of the pool based on the amount they participated. We’re hiring more people to start covering the weekends as well but it still takes anywhere from 48 to 72hours for your submissions to get checked because the response from the community is really overwhelming. So basically It's not that if 1000 people contributed the same day each would recieve 5VIBs but those that contributed more would recieve 7VIBs and those that contributed less 3VIBs. #viberate  @viberate  @Viberate_com  @ViberateOFC",False

They have introduced a rewarding mechanism, allowing anybody to earn crypto in return for curating profiles on their live music platform.  Viberate made waves this September, when they raised 10.7 million dollars in an ICO, becoming one of the most successful crowdfunding campaigns to date. Since then, the company has been implementing new services according to the plan; the latest one is their long-awaited rewarding system.  The mechanism will reward everybody who curates their database of musicians, venues and event organizers (adding or editing profiles) or promotes the platform to the outside world. For more information regarding the listed activities, you can check Viberate.com. Vasja Veber, COO and cofounder of the Slovenian-based company, claims:  “Investing a 1.2 million dollars’ worth of tokens to repay our contributors’ efforts not only means that some of them will be able to quit their day jobs, but also gives our token the utility value not a lot of blockchain projects have” For 2,000 days, money will be evenly distributed among the contributors, which translates to 5,000 VIB tokens daily. It is worth pointing out that the token, inherent to Viberate’s ecosystem, is already listed on five crypto exchanges, including Binance and Bittrex, while additional solutions for an even wider token adoption are underway. Viberate has just announced that supporters will “very soon” be able to purchase VIB tokens using only their credit cards via Changelly as well as start using the popular Jaxx wallet.",False

This value is earned by posting information on bands, be it show reviews, interviews, or finding a whole new band that gains a following. In much the same way Steemit rewards value to its writers as well as its readers. Having an eye for spotting good talent, or pointing out clever criticism can benefit you directly by being awarded Steem Dollars for your voice. Each of these operate in a way that not only awards the initial artist but critics and commentators being rewarded for their part in the debate.  While all of these are excellent ways to enjoy the luxuries of life, it’s also great knowing that thanks to e-Chat’s DSN, if a country were to ever take a hard line against encrypted communication (US, and Poland, I’m looking at you both) e-Chat’s information can be distributed throughout millions of devices around the world, keeping information free, even in changing times.

People see it as tireless partying with backstage passes, free drinks from the rider and private jets with porn star stewardesses. Sure, for some it may be, but for the majority it’s a job like any other. There is a slim chance of success and you have to work your ass off to at least get close to it. Most of those who try, fail.  One of the more pressing issues is the fact that only an awfully small number of musicians have a proper representation — everyone else is left to fend for themselves, struggling to get spotted and land enough gigs. I hope this won’t sound pretentious, but the whole idea of Viberate is to find solutions for precisely these kinds of problems. And our recent launch of booking agency profiles is just one of the many steps towards fixing what’s broken.  Our database currently features about 2,000 booking agencies from around the globe, including all the big names of the industry. Users are now able to see the rosters of musicians that agencies represent and, of course, find all the necessary contact information in one place. We have put a lot of effort into making the interface clean and friendly in order for musicians, managers and event organizers to fully utilize this new tool. It will help them introduce and promote themselves, which can eventually translate into more bookings, while agencies, on the other side, can take advantage of our ever-growing musician database that currently consists of 150,000 profiles. I am confident that new business and partnership opportunities will arise soon.  By launching the booking agency profile database, we’ve just unlocked another achievement. We are happy to see that the market has rewarded us for our hard work with a surge in the daily trading volume of our token. At its peak, the daily volume reached up to $150 million, a figure we hadn’t dared to dream about. Thank you!   This progress is just fabolous!

Yes, the more you contribute the higher the reward. The bounty pool gets distributed among 3 segments: Contribution, growth and promotion. We release 5000 VIB daily which get distributed among participants. If there are more participants, the reward gets smaller because everyone gets a share of the pool based on the amount they participated. We’re hiring more people to start covering the weekends as well but it still takes anywhere from 48 to 72hours for your submissions to get checked because the response from the community is really overwhelming. So basically It's not that if 1000 people contributed the same day each would recieve 5VIBs but those that contributed more would recieve 7VIBs and those that contributed less 3VIBs.",False

Yes, the more you contribute the higher the reward. The bounty pool gets distributed among 3 segments: Contribution, growth and promotion. We release 5000 VIB daily which get distributed among participants. If there are more participants, the reward gets smaller because everyone gets a share of the pool based on the amount they participated. We’re hiring more people to start covering the weekends as well but it still takes anywhere from 48 to 72hours for your submissions to get checked because the response from the community is really overwhelming. So basically It's not that if 1000 people contributed the same day each would recieve 5VIBs but those that contributed more would recieve 7VIBs and those that contributed less 3VIBs.",False

Since then, the company has been implementing new services according to the plan; the latest one is their long-awaited rewarding system.

Why will we integrate VIB into Jaxx? Just yesterday we were featured on the biggest Slovenian TV network. In the article, the journalist said that there are around 2,000 crypto tokens out there at the moment. Personally, I think there are a lot more, and I would lie if I said I was not worried about that. Ever since we have successfully executed our ICO, my phone has been ringing relentlessly with people asking me and my team to help them with their ICOs. Most of those projects are based on really bad ideas, and you can see from space that people are only in it for a quick buck. But there are also some good ones, and here and there, I come across an idea that is really promising. The problem is that no one in our team has the time or energy to take an advisory role in any of them, regardless of how good they are. We want to keep our focus on Viberate.  We now have two products — one is the Viberate.com platform and the other one is our VIB token. With so many tokens already out and the tidal wave of new ones, it is more important than ever to keep developing business around one’s own currency. That is why we strive for VIB to be integrated into as many good global services as possible. We are already listed on the majority of the significant global exchanges, including Bittrex and Binance. Our friends over at ICONOMI made VIB available to their fund managers, and today, I’m proud to announce that Jaxx, one of the most prominent crypto services in the world, is integrating VIB into their wallet. Only a very small fraction of the world’s tokens has had this honor, which is why this is a huge recognition for us and our vision. If you are in crypto and don’t have Jaxx, go and get it on the App Store or Google Play, so you can access your coins anytime by the use of your smartphone, via their user-friendly interface. It also works as a plugin for Chrome. Being widely accessible and very easy to use, Jaxx is a service every serious cryptocurrency issuer should consider, as it is particularly important for your currency’s wider acceptance.  The token will be integrated into Jaxx on December 21.",False

Viberate, the blockchain start-up that raised 10.7 million dollars in one of the most successful ICOs to date, has rolled out a rewarding mechanism solution. This means that everybody who helps grow their live music platform will get paid in their VIB crypto token.  “Investing a 1.2 million dollars’ worth of tokens to repay our contributors’ efforts not only means that some of them will be able to quit their day jobs, but also gives our token the utility value not a lot of blockchain projects have,” claims Vasja Veber, COO and cofounder of the Slovenian-based company.   For 2,000 days, money will be evenly distributed among the contributors, which translates to 5,000 VIB tokens daily. It is worth pointing out that the token, inherent to Viberate’s ecosystem, is already listed on five crypto exchanges, including Binance and Bittrex, while additional solutions for an even wider token adoption are underway. Viberate has just announced that supporters will “very soon” be able to purchase VIB tokens using only their credit cards via Changelly as well as start using the popular Jaxx wallet.  The newly implemented mechanism will reward everybody who curates their database of musicians, venues and event organizers (adding or editing profiles) or promotes the platform to the outside world. For more information regarding the listed activities, you can check Viberate.com.  “Our research shows that more than a half of Viberate’s users participates in co-creating and promoting the platform out of pure enthusiasm for the company’s vision and their love of music. Since users play a crucial role in helping us change the music industry, we want to reward them for their efforts, as they are actually a part of the team. Moreover, the Viberate points of our existing contributors were transformed into VIB tokens, their number being multiplied by 6.5. Our biggest contributor’s points will, therefore, result in more than 42,000 VIB, which translates into approximately $7000 at press time – not bad for roughly one month of work.”  Veber explained the reasoning behind the solution.   It is also worth noting that the music industry – already a huge one – is poised for additional growth in the coming years. According to a report from PWC, revenue is expected to grow 3-3.5 percent and reach 26.5 billion dollars in 2018. Veber, therefore, urges people interested in music and crypto technologies to join them and “become a part of the movement which is fundamentally changing the music business”.   https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/anyone-can-now-earn-vib-tokens-on-viberate",False

Make artist compare themselves to others locally.  Make it possible for artists to highlight their best creations, their favorite songs of theirs, maybe artist quotes (Shows the personality of the artist)  Make artists release ""exclusive"" content, like banners, bio, a personalized webpage. Every artist should have an option to personalize his page to make him stand out from the crowd, and show personality. Make it a creative process.  Make your page a goto when fans want to find info about an artist.  THE SOCIAL MEDIA OF ARTISTS:  Make it possible to subscribe to artists, like how you would subscribe to a youtube channel.  Have a feed for your subscribed artists, where you can filter to their songs or social media posts etc. (like subscribing on youtube)  Have an explorer feed, where new artists content pop up based on your subscribed artists.  Make the site a goto when you want to know ""whats up"" with your favorite artists, or when you want to find new artists/music.  There is potential to literally be the social media of artists.

You have to buy a ""cashless"" card in order to buy the foods and drinks in the venues. I could see a future where this cashless are replaced with VIBs (A card that you can fill with VIBs). A good argument for why events would utilize this is that it would increase the amount people spend on venues, therefore it would be appealing for event organizers. Why it would increase spending is because of a psychological trick, people spend more when they use something other than a ""real currency"". Apps use this all the time, you buy a type of in-game currency with real money and use the in-game currency to buy stuff in-game.  Making a VIB version of cashless would also increase the advertisement, as everyone on an event would be forced to learn about VIBs.",False

So I expected 43 VIBE-points (around 250 VIB) for those changes.  Today´s ""Participation Summary"" stated    So my question is, did you...

The rewarding system consists of 3 distinct parts:  - Contribution. Users get rewarded for adding new artists, venues, events or curating existing ones. We try to process every submission as quickly as possible to ensure users get their well deserved reward. Once the submission is accepted it usually takes about 24 hours for our servers to fully sync all the data and present it on the platform, so please don't resubmit entries twice. - Growth. Growth is divided in 2 major sections. 1st one being registrations and 2nd the referral and mail invites. - Promotion. We reward users for spreading awareness about Viberate through FB, TW and Bitcointalk. Posts made on FB and TW are valid for 3 days, while we analyze Bitcointalk daily posts. Great posts with good engagement can get you ranked higher, which means you'll be awarded more VIB for the same action. No one likes to see spam, neither do we, so please don't overdo it on social media. Someone also asked me about daily average earnings: https://www.viberate.com/participation <- Scroll to the bottom of the page where we present the daily average earnings.  The dynamics are no longer the same as they were with points. So how much vib you get completely depends on how many users are participating. If there are less, you receive more and vice-versa. Our curating team is really swamped with all the new submissions so it might take from 24-72 hours to check every new entry.  ",False

I received 3 VIB for my contribution. Although i don't know for what exactly.  I added 1 artist but i got mail he wasn't accepted, because it doesn't meet their requirements or the artist is already in their database.  Well artist i tried to add it, still doesn't exist in their database. Don't know what could it be wrong.  Its well known artist in my country, rather taking more folk music style and not pop/dance oriented style of music. But ok will try add it later.  Maybe i got VIB for validating my twitter and facebook account.",False

On October the 6th the price was 0,25 $ per VIB, today is 13,9c $. Price of Cardano was 0.025 $ on October the 1st, today is 0.027$. Somebody said that there was 4000 applications from people who wanted to buy VIB on ICO. He also talk of huge demand. Today there is 1810 VIB token holders. So demand is not huge. Even all of those ICO applicants didn't buy the token. But I have to admit that there is a big 24h volume and very good exchanges: Bittrex and Binance. Congratulations for that. But those exchanges mean that there is going to be price manipulation. So we can expect some pumps and dumps, but some people on this forum are constantly howling, that this is the last opportunity to buy cheap VIB. This are the same people who are howling the same at HIVE and SNC (slovenian projects) But nothing dramatically happend in past months. Everything goes as may be expected in crypto.",False

So much space one could run in circles and get a workout, although i doubt anyone will. The only running we do is when we see chocolate on the table.  This is just space, reserved for our curating team which is almost as large as our entire old office was.    Our founders think that a driving simulator (https://www.nerv-teh.com/), an xbox room, a pool table and a real shooting range will make for a better, more relaxing, and productive working environment… Well, we couldn’t agree more!

If I know that my ICO will lose so much in value I will invest more in VIB and SNM. I don't know about GOLEM but SONM is their direct competitor (more advanced when you google GNT vs SNM comparison). Keep in mind as long as Bitcoin will rise other crypto may stay neutral or slightly lose/gain.  My advice check SONM - their project is 6 months younger, long term with 444 Millions vs 1 Billion Token supply and 3x cheaper right now. Consider leave some FIAT in BTC - is on rise, it will be profitable for sure.  If I have choice only between VIB and GNT I will choice VIB… Token supply is 5X less (200 Million) with lower total coin supply price will rise quicker and there is more room to grow and it's cheaper $0.15 VIB  vs $0.22 GNT but the choice it's Yours.",False

Quote from: vveber on October 30, 2017, 03:43:29 PM  I don't know where did you get the information about the app. We never said it was going to be launched that fast. For your reference, you can check our roadmap, that is published on www.viberate.io and check our progress. So far we are on top of everything and meeting the planned deadlines.  Also, thank you for using the platform for your business, I would love to hear your feedback.  Finally, someone from the team. As for feedback, the web app is working fine. I have managed to find up a few unsigned bands through it and also some of the artists who claimed their profiles to and land them gigs at my place of business. It is kinda hard being mobile if you are running around from the sound booth going towards the stage while also scheduling the next appointments for your lined up gigs. I mean, I can't just lug a laptop while running around the venue. That is the reason why I was anticipating for the mobile app release. It makes everything easier for the end users who are mostly on the go. I am even planning to put a ""Powered by Viberate"" sticker in my place of business soon.",False

This was the main purpose of Viberate, but it seems that they are not interested in pushing this agenda anymore. Was it just a big smoke screen to garner attention from the multitude of musicians here? That is the question that I would like the Viberate team to answer. [/quote]    Btw its coming!

I really don't understand some people here. If it's not today because you want it today, then that means it won't be ever. That's your logic there. Have you ever heard of the word 'development'? Viberate is trying to build a global platform based on blockchain payment system. Even if they put out an app now, what good will it be if the blockchain and VIB token is not integrated with it yet? Jesus people, have a little patience and give the team a chance to develop what they promised. They've been in the business for long time and I would be really surprised if they didn't deliver.",False

ICO should be sold to international buyers... not just close friends. Now you're pumping people in this small community that do not understand why the price is not x10 x20 to promote and advertise... you're a real joker... you make my day every time I read your crap on this board!  btw.... how's Tezos going?

You may also help them gain more artists by registering their names there as well as getting some VIB points which will, later on, be converted to VIB coins.

Becouse of great team! They will deliver everything on time      and awesome features for worldwide adoption  1. Booking agency profiles are coming soon as the fourth type after artist, venue and even profiles. Viberate is targeted towards unsigned artists, but at the same time we need the big guys on the platform because they attract lots of attention. And the only way to have an active superstar roster on Viberate is to offer a great service to their representative — booking agents. Agency profiles will feature the whole roster of each agency. Picture buying stuff on eBay and clicking on a merchant’s username: it takes you to everything that merchant sells. It will be pretty much the same with our agency profiles, so if you’ll be checking out Coldplay and see Paradigm as their booking agent, you’ll be able to click on that name and it will take you to Paradigm’s whole roster, all ranked and grouped in Viberate fashion. It’s going to be a great tool for promoters as well as for agencies who will have a chance to claim their profiles. It might sound a bit cheeky, but we believe that we can make such a good product for them that their own existing websites will become secondary for them. 2. Integration of the first blockchain features is also scheduled for the end of this year. It’s important for us to get the Vibe token out to anyone who wants to own it and right now only the fastest out there managed to get it in our crowdsale. Soon everyone will have a chance to get their hands on some Vibe tokens by contributing to our platform. By the end of 2017 we will implement the first awarded actions, giving out Vibes to contributors, who will add new profiles into Viberate’s database or curate the information in existing ones. We will distribute 5,000 Vibe tokens each day among contributors, who are a key factor for Viberate to grow at a fast pace.   We have a lot of work to do in the coming months and that’s why we will more than double the amount of people working on the project. We rented new offices that are able to accommodate up to 60 people and by the end of this year we plan to move there with around 20 new employees, bringing the total number of people working for Viberate full-time up to 40.  www.viberate.com",False

So that's 100% - it's a good difference between 33% and 100%   So when someone... let's say DXB2017 tells you: if you buy at 12c or 14c its good.... you will still make money after it hits better price... he is right .... but you will profit less!!!   SO BELIEVE ME.... THESE LITTLE CENTS, WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. DON'T BE A FOOL AND BUY NOW AND MAKE THEM MONEY WITH SCAM ICO. LET THE PRICE DROP TO ICO PRICE OR LOWER!",False

Despite the fact that they are bragging about 4min42s and that actual sale was around 1mio. What is your opinion on fact that a lot of additional funds were send which they returned?? Apparently there was over 20mil they returned. From my perspective it is a sign of big interest in ICO even if they did non-public pre-sale and it is clear that they would sell it in minimum time the whole ICO.  Let's change perspective for a second and step in their shoes. You are working on your own ICO and ofc you are raising funds you need to kick-off your project. Would you say no to ppl who want to invest in your project? No ofc not. You can say ""yes they can do it over ICO..."" but if you had ever done business in your life you know that you grab a chance when you see it especially if ppl waving with money. You don't say ""ohh you are interested, ok, WAIT for ICO..."". If you ever went out to pick up a girl(I hope you did ) and you had girl interested in you and there was a chance for ONS did you grab it or you said ""WAIT"" I'll be ready tomorrow? Same goes for them. They didn't have to hype ppl into investing because from my research they are respected ppl in Slovenia and I believe DJ Umek(if you know who he is and what career is behind him) is not that stupid to get involved into something that could destroy something he lives for and worked for last 20 years. So calling them scammers and hypers and other names might not be appropriate and from my perspective either you don't understand business in general or you are simply jealous for some reason.  On top of this I guess you know hot to check initial token holders wallets and you will see that a lot of bigger holders are still holding and some of them even bought more. And majority are from ""pre-sale"" so go figure why. And majority of those few who got in at ICO did sell. I see this as these guys still believe in their project.  I'm one of those who were left out and did buy some yesterday at high price and know that sooner or later it will pay off.  I might be wrong at my analysis and I agree with you that they did f*ck up with private pre-sale but as investor I understand and would probably do the same. Only that now I would make it public somehow .  Would love to hear your opinion on my theory.",False

If they collected money from friends and closed private groups, they should do some pre-ico or whatever. ICO is crowdfunding and should be open for people and who comes first gets it. What they did with ICO is wrong and from all persepctives it's a fraud what they did. And do not understand that they went that way. But it seems money is over anything. I'm not saying Umek is scammer, the whole team decision, selling ICO with pre collected money and put 9mio in first block they reserved for themselves is far from what ICO is all about. So saying we sold ICO in 4min is wrong, since they sold aprox. 1mio$ in 4min. This ICO would be sold very fast, probably in an hour or 2.... maybe bit more. But they were affraid not to get in, because there were a lot of people waiting for this ICO. So they did what they did. By doing this move, they lost credibility.  I never said this project is bad, it's just how they did it is wrong.  As for who hold VIB's for later or who sells now its decision of each holder/trader. I never said this is bad project... It's just bad decision from the team for doing such a bad move on ICO. As I said before.... if this would go under investigation... would end up very bad. So no idea why they did it this way at all. That's why China banned ICOs and want to regulate them and many other countries will follow... because of ICO's like this one.  I wish all the best for this project and as I know many holders and want to see them get rich... driving lambos and porches and whatever they thought they will drive by earning with Vib's  Cheers  ",False

Even when rate rises like you say. Small fishes, like we are, aren't important for the rate. It's all about the big investors. investors never just hold. When you got VIB during the ICO for 0,085 $ and rate starts at 0,11 $ they will directly sell their coins and make a huge profit. Rate decreases sharply and they just buy again.  And I looked at other promising coins like OMG and WTC (thanks szesch) and it's true what he said. Everybody knew those coins will be successful. Because they had a good idea, good team, good roadmap etc. Like VIB. Still the rate dropped at the beginning because starting rate was above ICO rate.  Don't assume investors and traders behave like we do. We buy some coins and hope to get 500% in 1 year. An investor who sees a safe 30% profit, will definately take it!",False

But where did you get 92%, it was not even near those numbers. And the transaction that bypassed the ICO wasn't received in advance, but after the start of the ICO. I don't think it's such a big deal. Of course it is totally understandable that you lost trust in them. It's still solid project that will take a large share in multibillion dollar industry of live music and good opportunity for investors to make huge profit. If you'd hate them for one little mistake they made, you'll be the one missing the profit. If you want to make profit on the market you shouldn't hate or like anything, because this would mean your emotions make decisions. If you want to make profit you must set emotions aside and rationally think about what will make you profit. Emotions will make you loose all the time.  The demand for VIB tokens is insanely high. For the pas month I've been receiving several offers to sell my VIB tokens OTC and I also know some other holders that receive such offers all the time. The last offer I received a few day ago was 0.25USD. Of course I just laughed and said no way. I've invested in several ICO's this year and I've never received any OTC offers for the tokens. So I think this really shows how huge demand for VIB tokens is.",False

None of us are going to sell the tokens at ICO price. We will all set our selling orders at 0.01 - 0.1BTC or even more than that.  This token is just too precious and the market demand is extremely high since there are only a handful of investors from the ICO.

Thank you for showing interest. We appreciate it!  ""What makes new/unknown artists stand out? When I look at viberate I see the same artists which I would find when I would look on event sites or youtube, I am even having a pretty hard time to find unknown artists, which I so far only managed to do by typing random letters in the search bar. I believe Viberate is aimed at getting those that have no manager or big fan base some additional exposure as well, right?""  You can find many unknown artists by using our filters correctly. They're enginered so that venues, event organizers and promoters can find artists that are on the rise. You can even find them based on their fan engagement by switching to content in the filters. Artists that have a strong and engaged fanbase tend to stand out from the crowd. Filters are meant to to find a specific artists or show broader range of artists. I'll give you an example: I want to host an indie/rock event and need australian artists to cut some traveling expenses and my budget is tight, but I'd still like to find someone people actually like. I'll use our engine to find exactly what i need. I can then open their profiles, check their stats, quickly glance their feed to see if i even like the guy. Once we implement block-chain of the entire booking structure, you'll be able to book a chosen artist directly from the site. Here's a video how i would do it.   http://recordit.co/pkecCfR91c  Artists with very small fan base or those that are just starting out, will be able to get their friends to rate them on Viberate and gather traction this way as well. Our engine offers filtering by user rating as well.  ""Are you aiming to become the exclusive ""manager"" of artists in some cases or will you simply act as a potential additional ""manager"" to the ones that require additional methods to get bookings ?""  We just want to offer artists that aren't well known a gateway to be discovered, showcased, booked and paid from our site. We haven't yet thought about being exclusive or additional management as you've put it.  ""How long will it take for the tokens to hit the exchange? Any exchange? Probably not planning to sell in the short term, yet I find it an interesting question to ask.""  We're talking to several exchanges, some major ones too. I can't give you the details yet as deals need to be finalized first, but it's looking very promising.   ""Will we get to see a balance sheet regarding the operation costs?""  As any good project, we'll offer investors some sort of insight how the funds have been spent.",False

I'd like to thank you for taking the time and actually read the entire concept. I've collected all your questions in one reply, so here goes...  ""I understand Viberate will be good for Sally, but saying this it seems the pub-and club-owners are your (paying) audience/clients you basically need to get on board. How will you bring  into using your service?""  Half of our 12M cap will be spent on raising awareness about the project, meaning we'll be launching a targeted global campaign to attract audience to our platform.    ""Will most of these ""one-man-companies"" make the effort to search for artists actively? (I don´t know any, so I wonder how engaged they are in searching, but I guess there are less pubs/clubs then artists, what means more offer than demand, so that the pub-and club-owners don´t usually make the effort to do the search!?) Did you do something like a field-research to find out?""  We've done extensive research in this field. For several years we ran our own successful event agency and experienced all the struggles and pitfalls that come with the business. Majority of venue owners don't have access to such comprehensive, discovery metrics, therefore they book often overpriced artists based mainly on word-of-mouth. We want to change that and offer venue owners and event organizers a smarter way to fill their events and make a profit doing so.  ""And will the pub/club-owners be able to search artists from their town/region (your website says ""Each entity profile is furnished with all available social media links and analytical insights"" so I assume this will be mandatory in your plans?""  You can already discover artists based on their country of origin. We go even further and offer you detailed analytics, which measure the popularity of a certain artist based on their social media fan base and engagement. Those metrics allow venue owners to discover artists that are on the rise and snag them on their way up before the major labels discover them. There's an additional incentive for artists to use those metrics as well. They can track, measure and make better decisions when launching their social media campaigns. You can read more about our analytics here -> https://www.viberate.com/interesting-insights/how-do-you-use-stat-circles-on-viberate  ""And if there are enough interested pub-and club-owners: how much do they know about crypto´s - e.g. how much will you `teach´ them how to credit the smart-contract with enough VIBE´s to pay the artist ?!""  I think all modern crypto ventures will have to face the fact, that the larger audience doesn't yet understand the workings of the crypto-currencies as well as we'd like them to. A lot of time, effort and funds will be spent educating the people. With the recent uprise of the crypto-awareness around the world, we think that doing business this way will become mainstream.  ""What are your plans for these ´clients´?""  We want to create a global marketplace where fans, artists, venues, event organizers and ticketing services will be able to seamlessly communicate across the platform and do business. Our plan is to educate and offer all involved parties a better general understanding of the crypto-world, smart contracts, tokens and block-chain technology to ease the transition from the old to the new.   ""Another thought on this: when the problem for the artists are pub-and club-owners the screw them up, will those pub-and club-owners join a smart-contract?""  Of course. We have it explained in our whitepaper:  Bookings on Viberate will be made using Ether (ETH) and Vibes (VIB) along with following these steps: • Upon digitally signing the contract, the event organizer (buyer) pays the agreed number of ETH or VIB plus a service fee to a specially created wallet that holds the coins until the event is fully executed. • The event organizer has 24 hours to file a complaint in case the artist has breached the contract in any way (no-show, cutting the performance short for an unexplained reason, excessive behavior, etc.) and after that period ends, the artist fee is released to the artist’s wallet. • In case of a breach, a dispute is triggered, which is handled by a trained tribunal of music business experts who give the verdict based on provided evidence (photos, exchanged e-mails, etc.). The members then vote to decide whether to return the withheld fee to the organizer or clear the payment into the artist’s wallet.  ""While reading I also though ""what´s in for me?"" and found your answers in Whitepaper 5.2.1. for 2 of the possibilities I have a question: • referring friends ---> will you hand out referral links (nowadays more and more don´t like to send and/or receive ref.links) or will you implement an more convenient solution? • writing editorial content ---> may you give 2-3 ideas?""  The referral mechanics are still being developed and we're taking into account all the pros and cons of existing types of referral services to create something users will want to use. As for editorial content. You can write about Viberate in general, offer weekly/monthly/yearly analysis and predicitions of the artist market, describe different sections, make user friendly tutorials,... The possibilities are endless.  ""Last but not least:  Whitepaper 5.4.3.: ""so that people, who won’t be able to attend the event...will be able to sell the ticket to other Viberate users via DTX and charge the price in ETH or VIB.""Did you already planned to make a cap, lets say max. 5% over the regular price, to solve one of the todays bigger problems with the secondary markets (""or an e-Bay ad to purchase the ticket for multiples of the actual price"")?""  Taken from our whitepaper:  With DTX fans will be able find peers who cannot go to the event but have bought the ticket. Fans will be able to set the maximum price they are willing to pay for the ticket or buy the ticket right away from an existing member who is selling it.",False

Viberate has always been a community project. The initial database of musician profiles was built with the help of over 50 thousand contributors, who got nothing in return for their work. Sometimes being a true music fan and feeling like a part of something big is enough. But we believe that community work should result in sharing the proceeds of its efforts. One of the main purposes of the Vibe is investing into the growth of the service. We will reward community efforts with Vibes from our bounty pool. The pool will be fuelled by the profits from excercising our business models. The below scheme illustrates Vibe's circle of life.  “The platform is extremely user friendly and with the analytics provided coupled with the ever growing database, Viberate will undoubtedly become a key tool for promoters, agents and venues alike.”  Earning and spending only makes sense if the token's value grows. Initially we will assure the value growth and liquidity with buybacks. A portion of Viberate's revenue will be spent on buying Vibe tokens from the market and putting them into the bounty pool for contributors to earn. This way the value of the token will grow along with the size of the service. Eventually, the Vibe will become the go-to digital currency for booking live performances by musicians around the world.   + crypto world  = long term win-win situation",False

We are not interested in the world of recorded music, royalties and copyright. It’s an interesting field and in definite need for help and we hope that our fellow founders in Musiconomi, Voise, Opus and others will give the massive recorded music market a much needed kick in the butt and let musicians make money again by producing good music.  What we are interested at is giving musicians an opportunity to charge for their gigs in cryptocurrencies. We want to do for music what Airbnb did for tourism. Need an even clearer explanation? Let me give you an example. Let’s say Sally is a great guitar player and a songwriter. She wants to make an extra buck by having her own songs played on the radio and by playing live on weekends in local pubs and clubs.  If she wants to earn royalties for her new track “Why don’t you love me anymore?”, she goes to one of the aforementioned services.  If she wants to look for pubs to book her and charge in Vibes for her performance fee, she goes to Viberate.  If you have any additional questions, join our Slack channel or visit our ANN thread on Bitcointalk. And set your calendar to the 5th of September!

I like that quote:  Viberate has always been a community project. The initial database of musician profiles was built with the help of over 50 thousand contributors, who got nothing in return for their work. Sometimes being a true music fan and feeling like a part of something big is enough. But we believe that community work should result in sharing the proceeds of its efforts. One of the main purposes of the Vibe is investing into the growth of the service. We will reward community efforts with Vibes from our bounty pool. The pool will be fuelled by the profits from excercising our business models. The below scheme illustrates Vibe’s circle of life.

The profiles are daily updated from a variety of social media and streaming channels, ticketing services and online artist calendars.  The profiles feature Official social media links User ratings Daily updated stats from all major social media and streaming channels, including fan growth, user engagement and fan geo distribution Recent content (audio, video, photos) Gig dates with ticket links Contact info   ▄▄▄ A DECENTRALIZED COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICE, FUELED BY THE VIB TOKEN  Viberate has always been decentralized in its core. The database has always been open for public, so anyone could add new artists. We managed to build the database we have today with the help of over 50,000 contributors and we will always keep it open for anyone to take part in maintaining its relevance.  Such level of decentralization allows Viberate to be on top of rapidly moving trends in the music industry. Using the blockchain technology to crowdsource the curating process of the information in musician, venue and event profiles is the only reasonable and rational way to keep the database up to date and relevant.     Those 50,000 Viberate contributors didn’t get anything in return for their contributions. Now the blockchain technology allows us to reward them for their work with Vibes (VIB) from our bounty allocation. The VIB represents the atomic unit of our crowdsourced concept, and the service’s growth and relevance depends on it.  The VIB will become a go-to currency for the music industry as a whole. Besides using the tokens on the Viberate platform, there will also be an array of smart contracts connected with music industry where VIBs will be used as a core currency. One of our main purposes is investing into the growth of our service and rewarding community efforts with VIBs from our bounty pool.  ▄▄▄ THE FIRST EVER BLOCKCHAIN-BASED LIVE MUSIC MARKETPLACE  With the database and communication channels in place, our platform enables the implementation of a live music marketplace on both, B2B (musician-event organizers) as well on B2C (ticketing, crowdfunding live performances) levels.    >>OUR PRODUCT IS ALREADY LIVE AND KICKING WITH A LIVELY GROWING COMMUNITY OF ARTISTS, BOOKING AGENTS, MANAGERS AND FANS WAITING FOR YOU TO JOIN THEM.   ▄▄▄ TEAM  The team behind the project is a combination of experienced managers, event organizers, developers and cryptocurrency experts. View team members with their LinkedIn profiles here.   ▄▄▄ MARKET    According to a research conducted by CISAC and UNESCO, the music industry has an annual turnover of $250 billion USD. Live performances take up to one third of that amount. There are around 50 million music events taking place globally each year. While represented artists account for a small fraction of a percent, millions of smaller artists are unrepresented. Their fees range from less than $100 all the way to a couple thousand USD. The live music sector is growing rapidly, due to a technological development, which allows people to engage in music easier than before (it only takes a Mac and a YouTube tutorial to become a DJ).  An estimation, based on the above numbers predicts the addressable market of $35B per year in unrepresented artist fees.   ▄▄▄ BUSINESS MODELS  The platform allows for the implementation of different business models in a B2B as well as in a B2C segment. On a B2B segment, Viberate can act as a marketplace, targeted advertising platform, networking tool and a data analytics service. On a B2C segment, we will tap into the ticketing business.
