Otherwise, on what technical/financial basis did eGold investors invest?  4)   You have made some changes in your Whitepaper, especially about unsold GIF tokens               a. In the first version that I read (V1), you wrote that all unsold GIF tokens will be burn               b. According to the peoples who read your V1.1 version, you spoke about burn only 50% of unsold GIF tokens               c. According to your current version (V1.2), there is no longer any sentence about unsold GIF tokens (!) So I implicitly understand that you don’t want burn unsold tokens. If I want to read the older Whitepaper version, where can I find them ?  I’m sorry to tell you like this but the last point (Whitepaper changes) is absolutely not normal ! Investors made ourselves researches, we invested because we are interested in your project (and especially in his reward conditions) and finally you change the most important thing  the reward for GIF holders (indirectly but if you don’t burn unsold tokens, you mathematically dilute holders shares). I understand that you hope to sell more tokens but you should have known that a part might not be sold ! Moreover I don’t understand this behavior because you reach your soft cap… or maybe you have misjudged this soft cap?  I really hope receive an answer from you.  Thank you.  Now I'm waiting an answer but I don't really hope to have one...  GIFcoin is a SCAM ? (I precise that I'm an investor, so don't speak about FUD thx)",False

Operating in the lucrative online gaming arena, VitalBet already has a share of the annual $533 billion global gaming industry.  The company’s origins stem from the creation of a small team circa 2011, which was initially centered around affiliate marketing. After many associations, the company’s research pointed to the profitability of the betting and gambling arena. From that focus on producing bookmaker and gaming website catalogs in their home country of Bulgaria, six months later VitalBet penetrated the UK gaming market by producing betting affiliate catalogs. By 2015, a number of countries had been added to VitalBet’s client portfolio.  From a peripheral service provider’s point of observation, the company realized that it needed to develop a standalone betting site as “being [the] owner of a bookie was something very proﬁtable and powerful.” The company concluded its research at the end of 2014, enlisting site builders and opting for an ICO model in late 2017 to further expansion.  At the outset of 2017, VitalBet also decided to accommodate the upswing in cryptocurrencies and added bitcoin as a transactional currency to the site. Players are now able to both transact with bitcoin on the portal and also place bets with the virtual coin. From there, it was a short step to employing the ERC-20 protocol of the Ethereum platform in order to pitch the GIFCoin ICO.  VitalBet’s primary focus in the ICO is an aggressive advertising and marketing campaign through which it hopes to grow its user base substantially. The company has ambitious plans to enter the ranks of the top 15 bookmakers worldwide, each of which collects around $750 million per annum.  https://btcmanager.com/ico-review-gambling-investment-fund-coin-gifcoin/",False
