As our next-generation crypto-fiat brokerage platform ZiChange is only days away from its release, we would like to take the time to introduce you to some of its most important features in a series of detailed posts so that you can use its advantages to their full potential.  Today we would like to focus on the platform‚Äôs technical side - and we are proud to offer you a trading infrastructure of unrivaled efficiency and security. From the very beginning of the project, we have outlined a number of crucial goals. Our brokerage platform had to be able to process thousands of transactions at once, accommodating a large user base that included both retail and institutional investors. It needed to set a new industry standard for security and data protection. It also needed to have an intuitive and easy-to-use UI, offering a smooth user experience both to seasoned crypto investors and enthusiast making their first steps into the brave new world of digital assets.  To achieve all these ambitious goals, we have chosen to use Microsoft Azure as a foundation for our trading infrastructure. It is a solution used by thousands of large-scale projects across various industries, and it allowed us to maximize ZiChange‚Äôs potential. Microsoft Azure makes our platform both highly accessible and at the same time secure and resistant to any attempts to steal or corrupt data. It is also mobile-friendly - an indispensable feature in our day and age. ZiChange platform can accommodate a large number of user at once due to dynamic scalability and efficient use of resources.  We are currently working hard to merge two of Zichain‚Äôs most important products - ZiChange and CryptoEYE - into a single resource that would allow you to receive all the latest news and high-quality market analysis and instantly conduct trades based on this knowledge. The new version of CryptoEYE will feature an optimized multilingual and responsive UI/UX as well as a multilevel cash for accessing big data with high performance and low latency.  As always, we look forward to your feedback - as we strive to continually perfect our products, our clients‚Äô opinion remains our most valuable tool.""",False

During the Token Generation Event (TGE), we plan to issue no more than 703,125,000 tokens, of which up to 450,000,000 can be sold to investors. The share of tokens sold to investors will stand at 64% of the total issue. For example, with the sale of 450,000,000 tokens, additional 253,125,000 tokens will be issued, of which:  ‚Ä¢ 147,656,250 tokens (21% of the total supply) will belong to the project team. ‚Ä¢ 70,312,500 tokens (10% of the total supply) will be forwarded to the Advisory Board. ‚Ä¢ 14,062,500 tokens (2% of the total supply) will be a reward for participating in the Bounty Program. ‚Ä¢ 14,062,500 tokens (2% of the total supply) will be a reward for participating in the Referral Program. ‚Ä¢ 7,031,250 tokens (1% of the total supply) will be distributed through Airdrop.  To motivate participants to invest at an early stage, tokens will be sold at a discount of up to 65% on the final round price (US$0.1). The discount will gradually decrease until the end of the TGE. Private sale: The private sale is divided into 2 rounds. First round with 65% discount off the final token price and the second round 40% discount off the final price. Pre-sale: During this stage, the price of a token will be US$0.08 (20% discount on the final price). Token Sale: All remaining tokens will be on sale with the discount of 13%",False

BAMP is a convenient solution suitable for every talented fund manager that gives access to the asset management infrastructure and all-in-one trading platform. CryptoEYE is a platform for people curious about cryptocurrencies with which they can get all market data, read news related to their portfolio, and learn information about coins or tokens.

A new wave of the technological revolution will be based on artificial intelligence, machine learning and blockchain. The latter will automate many processes and make them safe, transparent and reliable. Blockchain is an ideal solution for making payments, bank transactions, currency exchanges, and other operations, which are subject to a high risk of fraud or leaks of confidential information while being processed by existing systems.  For example, Zitoken (ZCN) is the ERC20 token in the Ethereum blockchain, which acts as an internal currency fuelling the ecosystem of our services.  We are also creating BAMP - platform that allows to create customized funds with automated administrative functions (investment policy statement supervision, accounting, risk management and others). The platform offers all required infrastructure to maintain generally accepted standards of safety and transparency in asset management industry. An important feature is the ability to manage fund assets using convenient trading infrastructure that allows to trade on most exchanges through one terminal.  Moreover, Zichain aims to create a cryptocurrency broker that will bridge the gap between the world of traditional finances and the developing crypto space. We will provide retail and institutional investors with an exclusively legal and transparent solution for conversion of fiat money to crypto-assets. Our main input to the market will be a combination of accepted operational standards of the traditional financial industry and the values that drive blockchain technology development such as simplicity, convenience, and security.  ZiChangewill eliminate obstacles which institutional and retail investors meet when they venture into the world of crypto-assets.",False
