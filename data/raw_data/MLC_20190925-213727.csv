Product weight, tariffs and automatic delivery calculation.    It’s been already 2 weeks since the logistics section was launched on FLOGmall. During this time mistakes and bugs have been corrected, and now we’re glad to present this update to our dear users. The section includes the subsections ""My Templates"" and ""Create a Template"". Now each shop on the platform can specify regions, to which delivery of their goods is carried out ( all regions will be indicated in a template by default), and also exclude from the list countries in the specified region, to which delivery is not carried out (for example: delivery to Europe, except for Monaco).  Creating a template, a seller specifies its name (for example: ""Delivery for Europe"", ""Delivery for North America""), name of the delivery service (ChinaPost, DHL and so on), delivery price for a kilogram of product (for example: 1 kg of product - 200 rubles) and time of delivery. The created template can be duplicated on all regions by the button “Apply to all”.  In a card of each product there is a new category “Weight”, which is set obligatorily by a seller while creating a new item. You can also fill this category for the goods created earlier.  Buyers can find a new section - ""Delivery"". For the authorized users a country, specified by them at registration in a private account, is established by default.  Ordering goods, for which a seller has already established tariffs, user can independently choose a country/mean of delivery and see a total amount of the order with delivery, and also the number of days, which it will take.  Shortly, for not authorized users the program automatically will be able to determine location of buyers by the IP address and to offer delivery options to their country. If delivery to the region is not available, user can contact the seller and specify this information.  Thus, delivery to your country and its cost are calculated automatically. Buyers don’t need to contact the seller personally to find out mentioned options anymore.  We remind you, that it is the first edition of logistics. Further, calculators of the most popular delivery services will be integrated on the platform (Chinapost, SDEK, etc.) to improve quality of service for our users. Thanks to these calculators, there will be an opportunity to determine the exact cost of delivery by a particular service directly.  Logistics launch is another step to full automation of shops on FLOGmall.  Also, our users will see global updating of design and conversion to beta-version of the website. Due to the mentioned conversion, interface of a seller and buyer remains without changes for a while (we understand, that it needs improvement, but at this stage such work will be senseless, since it will be changed in the beta of the website all together)  Stay tuned to see the latest news!

Nomenclature release for product positions at shops, cart upgrade and status sections for online stores’ ads.    Work on the nomenclature of product positions is completed. The functionality of a product nomenclature is finished and updated on the website. Now each online store can set up to 2 modifications to each card of goods.  Automatically, one of modifications in each card of goods is color. At the same time, modification ""color"" is not obligatory and seller can remove it. Each modification has a restriction - no more than 7 variations. Thus, each product  can have no more than 2 modifications with 7 variations in each of them.  If the online store has a need for the bigger number of modifications, then it should create higher number of goods.  For example: Smartphone Apple iPhone Xs. Modification No. 1 Colour: Gold, Silvery, Grey space. Modification No. 2 Memory: 64 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB.  This section is extremely important for the platform. Now purchases can be carried out without need in communication between buyer and seller. Also it will allow FLOGmall team to implement automatic import of goods from the online stores, created on popular CMS platforms.  Upgrade of a buyer cart. Now all users have an opportunity to add products in a cart without authorization on the website. The platform will remember items in your cart, and after authorization or registration of the user on the website, it will continue processing of the order.  We want to note that after processing of the order on FLOGmall, both buyer and seller receive e-mail with detailed information on product positions and its modifications. Thus, a seller on FLOGmall will be able to react to new orders quicker, and a buyer will be able to make sure (once again) that everything is right.

We have moved about!    Hello, dear friends! Today we are here with strategic news: FLOGmall is officially moving about! Not geographically as someone could expect but to the main domain! Read below about the ‘place’  you can buy your favorite products from the alpha version!  This weekend, our developers have made a good transfer of the platform alpha.flogmall.com to the main domain. Attention! The alpha version on which you used to buy and sale goods for cryptocurrency is officially located at flogmall.com now. And now all the development and future changes will be located at this address. It does not matter what you are thinking about at the moment: about alpha, beta or already mature product!  Why did we do it?  Because all the traffic that we receive every day from the mad number of links recorded on different resources and social networks, went directly to the site, which not long ago held the legendary ICO. And, although we do not forget about it, ICO is already a little history and it does not make any sense to transfer a new audience to this site. But we all remember why we are here - to develop the platform, so from this day on, FLOGmall radically changes the strategy!  We begin a huge layer of work on the development and investigation of the platform. Now the main task is to increase the audience, attract new happy users and stores that risk to develop in the future so much that they will become a full-fledged organized ecosystem. For our part, we promise you to bring the functionality of the platform to perfection, repackaging of social networks and new cool content, and we ask you to help us in expanding the community. Tell your friends about FLOGmall, repost in social networks and you will be rewarded!  It is worth saying that we did not bury the site that was dedicated to ICO, it just moved to the domain flogmall.io, on which our mirror was situated for a long time. If you really miss the old landing page, you can visit it as easily as the previous one, log in and pass KYC procedure (for those who procrastinate so much that haven’t done it yet).  The main platform will get visual updates as well. We plan to introduce new sections. The section ""about FLOGmall"" will tell you how FLOGmall was born, who are the pioneers of your favorite project and why it is called ‘a new ecosystem of the future’. The ""Help and assistance” section will contain all the detailed instructions on how to use the site. Also we are waiting for the section “Partners"", sections on the ecosystem and MLC, promotional offers, where we will post all the purchases for MLC with an unprecedented discount and products with cashback. At the moment the nomenclature is entered in the test mode, and still our developers work on the improved version of safe transactions. But all these updates will be the subject of separate posts.

Welcome to all the  crypto-enthusiasts! As far back as in 1516 Sir Thomas More wrote “Utopia” - a novel about an ideal democratic state, with a developed economy and humanistic principles. We declare, the idea has gone beyond the books! Such a state is quite possible in a modern society and it is called Decenturion! Happy end is guaranteed:)    Way back in May, the founder of the Cryptonomics Capital Fund Nikolai Evdokimov announced the creation of the ""world's first blockchain state"" Decenturion. It should become a model of a fair and honest state that promises us equality.  Many of you have already heard about this state and, for sure, read quite ambiguous reviews. Someone strongly believes in the project and considers the emergence of a decentralized state to be a logical continuation of the development of the crypto-community. Others say Decenturion is another Titanic, which is doomed to drown on the way to the Islands, where it will settle forevermore.  But one thing we know for sure: just three months have past and according to the official website it has already got more than 250 thousand residents. Decenturion uses decentralized technologies in Economics, law and social sphere and also helps to introduce them to other states.  What is more, it promises its citizens direct earnings from each startup that has become a part of the state. Now it is in the process of acquiring the territory, that will give the Decenturion the right not only to obtain the status of an independent state, but also to become a full member of the UN. We suppose you have already guessed what we are driving at…  Right! FLOGmall entered into a collaboration with Decenturion and now we are linked by a single blockchain. We got acquainted with the plans of the project, felt their benefits and thrilled with the idea. Decenturion members as well as we are rooting for the development of Crypto-Industry, therefore, the becoming an infrastructure project for the citizens of the state means to give an impetus to the development of a new branch of the crypto-community world.  On the whole, we would like to note that such a cooperation will influence the development of FLOGmall a great deal. We believe it with every fibre of our being. Just imagine - the whole society will benefit from our platform that provides services, purchase and sale of goods inside the latest state. The scale of the idea makes one feel dizzy!  The conditions of intrusion of the project on the territory of ecosystem involve issuing for the citizens: our platform will release additional DMLC  tokens that could be used within the Decenturion ecosystem. All in all it was produced 100 million DMLC tokens, 50 million of which were distributed equally among the population of the new state. About the function of these tokens, and what backers will absolutely appreciate thanks to this collaboration, read below!  DMLC tokens will be used by citizens of the decentralized state and people who want to buy our altcoins from them and act as a discount on FLOGmall platform services.  Any resident of Decenturion will be able to pay up to 25% of the cost of services on our platform, and the remaining 75% one has to pay in traditional MLC.   Thus, citizens of the decentralized state automatically become direct participants of our platform and also DMLC token traders around the world (of course, it can also be sold to others who wish to hold a new token). So, what we have: a limitless backbone of FLOGmall agents around the world who will promote the idea of our platform to the masses and bring to FLOGmall even more users from different parts of the world.  If you are a direct owner of MLC who has just begun to worry about the fate of your token - it is not worth it, you only benefit from it. Because each new user, seller, buyer on the store of the platform - it does not matter, will increase the demand for MLC tokens.  In fact, DMLC is a promotional token with a limited edition dedicated to such an enviable partnership. This token will not be brought to the stock exchange by us, and it has no Mallcoin functionality. MLC has always been a beloved first-born and it saves it’s position. All services of the platform, the official rate of ATES and purchase of goods on the official store are tied only to our token. So, are you ready for the new members of our family?",False

You will receive unfrozen tokens two weeks earlier than you could expect!    One says if your bounty hunters love MLC more than Bitcoin they are perfect. Our bounty hunters belong to this category, therefore, today we appeal to you, our dear!  By the way, we will be sending you UNFROZEN tokens at once! We promised to unfreeze your tokens on October 20, but due to a slight change in the rules, we will distribute them to you two weeks earlier the scheduled date of unfreezing, that is, since October 8!  We would like to apologize in advance for technical inconsistencies and delay in token distribution. The delay has occurred due to some features of our Smart-contract, which does not provide mass distribution of tokens. Therefore, to distribute tokens this way, we have to do it manually. There are 5500 bounty hunters, on average, sending tokens to one recipient takes 10 minutes or so.Therefore, by simple mathematical calculations, we can understand that Frodo will deliver the ring to Mordor even a little faster than we will send such amount of Mallcoin manually.  The most significant is that our Smart-contract sends frozen tokens. In fact, we would send you frozen MLC during six months, then we would manually  send commands to each transaction to unfreeze tokens, which would take another half a century. That was why in order not to waste time and not to grow old together while anticipating, we decided to do the following: we began to create a Smart-contract that would be able to send tokens en masse.  Our Smart-contract sends frozen MLC to the new Smart-contract, which has the super power of mass unloading, that will send tokens directly to you in blocks at once. But there are some pitfalls. This Smart-contract cannot send frozen tokens. Technically, we cannot now hedge at this point, because, objectively, we understand even if we send you unfrozen mallcoins and strictly threaten you not to spend them before the deadline, a good half of you will consider us mad and won't care a dime any ignominious ban. Also, if we freeze all the sent tokens manually, we will spend a lot of your and our time, nerves and money, and in the end, still miss a couple of dare-devils.  So, the most optimal and mutually pleasant version is to start a mass distribution of already unfrozen MLC two weeks earlier than expected, since October 8. That is, the first bounty hunters will start receiving their tokens this day. According to the preliminary plan, the distribution will take a week, but, even if the worst scenario takes place, by October 20, each bounty participant will become a full MLC holder. And since the day of pay one can dispose of his/her tokens as he/she wishes. To cut a long story short, you can start thinking over the plans on your amount of cool tokens.  What is more, for the most active members of our community, we are preparing a new way of making money with the help of your favorite project. We are launching a new referral link, where you can involve your friends into the project, earn on their purchases and grab a good bonus for broadcasting the project news. So, do not forget that not only FLOGmall keeps watch over you, but you also have to follow FLOGmall! The referral link is in development by now and it is ready to fly into the operation next month.  By the way, as soon as you get your MLC, you can safely participate in the new competition from FLOGmall together with BTC-Alpha exchange, which is now listing our token! Haven’t you hear about it?

Total market capitalization of the exchange is $216 019 998 333, and volume for 24 hours is $16 111 325 233. By the way, MLC has already added some matches: to bitcoin, etherium and traditional USD.  You know that it is always hard for young altcoin to ‘hit on’ the first exchange because trading volume (or as we say experience points ) is at zero yet, but listing is desirable. So, like the first woman should be experienced, as well the first exchange should be safe, even if it is not extremely famous. For the first listing FLOGmall chose proven foreign exchange SIMEX (not familiar to Russians though) with plainly good capitalization. Why? Because it is famous in the west and as we said before is in top 20. Guys are truly our like-minders, they understood the idea of our project at first sight and estimated the importance for crypto industry in 100%. How could not we become partners?  You will also be able to know the SIMEX better and to be among the chosen amount of russians, because the popularity of the exchange in our country is growing faster.  Maybe it is not the first one and not the top-5 world exchange, but it is our first exchange and we are very happy with such a result because we will have many interesting events with our friends SIMEX! So, guys!  Click the link https://simex.global/en, register, examine the functional of our first exchange and observe the momentum. Participate in tenders and of course hold MLC tokens. Because it is to our advantage to help the young MLC token to grow and have big capitalization. Engage more communities to help MLC with development together. Of course wait for the listing at new exchanges. Some say these events are just around the corner😉  If you didn’t manage to buy MLC during the ICO, but already see yourself as a happy owner, you can become it at the SIMEX exchange right now!  We remind you that for all the holders who completed KYC procedure, tokens have been DEFROSTED! And a variety of actions with MLC is available exactly for you now! If you have realized that you still didn’t complete KYC, it is high time you did it. Guys, stop hesitating! It is to your advantage!

Besides, it is said in the report that blockchain industry is only beginning to develop, but UK has all the chances to become a leader in this realm.  “UK is one of the most important world’s financial centers and recently has become a leader in financial technologies.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION! This day has come…  The day when ICO will stop! This day has come! FLOGmall in tears… because we are so happy!  We remind you that today is the last day of FLOGmall ICO! And also the last opportunity to buy MLC tokens with an attractive price! It’s like a black Friday but in July. There’s no limits, you can buy as much as your wallet can contain, because your future profit depends on the number of your tokens now.  Cause today is the last day when the bonuses 20-25% from FLOGmall are available. On the 21st of July at 2 a.m. Moscow time all the bonuses will fade away and you won’t be able to buy tokens with the best price! Time is running out!  There won’t be any extensions! Tomorrow you’ll wake up and see that you can buy MLC tokens only at the exchange or you need to wait till the official start of the ATES. And it’s another story. So don’t let other parties into your relationships with FLOGmall, keep the magic of attractive price!  Also we have some unpleasant news. Since yesterday we have received massive attacks on our official websites. It is not dangerous, but unpleasant and even understandable because of the coming end of ICO. Our team successfully deals with the temporary difficulties and now sites are working. Soon all the attempts will be reduced to zero.  In some countries or regions problems with interface can still occur. If during the day you will have some problems with entering your private account or website, don’t worry, we will prevent all the difficulties during the day.  Do you want to buy our tokens at our platform, but can’t because of technical reasons? Then you can buy MLC tokens at our partners KICKICO https://www.kickico.com/ru/campaigns/51872/flogmall and Klooway https://klooway.com/preview?id=145173e1-8e5b-4fb9-a0fa-95c5fa7619de .

Then what if we tell you that approximately in 10 years bitcoin and all other altcoins will become the most widespread method of payment for goods and services?  You don’t believe it? The research group from Imperial College London and Social Investment Network eToro came to such conclusion and published a report called ‘Cryptocurrencies: Overcoming Barriers to Trust and Adoption’. British researchers consider that if we want the world to embrace cryptocurrency, the following functions should belong to them: store of value, means of accumulation, medium of exchange and unit of account. Moreover, researches are sure that cryptocurrency is already can be treated as means of accumulation.  Research group underlines that ‘if bitcoin and other digital currency want to correspond to the last two criteria, they will require a progress in such realms as scalability, user interface and control.  In 1723 the first arithmetic machine came out, almost 200 years after, in 1942,  Atanasoff-Berry Computer was developed, and the first email was delivered in 1971. Only 30 years after the technology became popular because of the user-friendly Hotmail interface. The first bitcoin transaction took place almost 8 years ago, and today we can see that it is becoming to be suitable for requirements which are intended for fiat money. Researches from eToro consider that bitcoin and other cryptocurrency will become common in approximately 10 years. Of course there are barriers, but it’s possible to overcome them.

Support your team and wait for the results. 4. IMPORTANT! One repost in the social media + one email address = ONE bet. If there are more that one bet, all will be deleted except for the first.

IMPORTANT: we accept bets related only to full time and overtime. Why? Because the amount of possible variants related to penalty kicks can rise up as high as temperature in the south of Russia in summer So, if you put ‘draw’ in the full time, you still need to name the supposed winner after penalty kicks, because in play-off there’s no such thing as draw.

Guys, we finish our acquaintance, so meet the last altcoin on this week - AdEx (ADX). It is the 26th cryptocurrency added as a method of payment and yes, FLOGmall creates partners faster than Marvel new Avengers.  AdEx is blockchain-based Ethereum exchange for advertising. The goal of the platform is to replace traditional patterns of internet advertisement like YandexDirect or Google AdSense. Smart-contract as a main benefit is a key feature of all FLOGmall’s partners. AdEx guarantees no agents, which provide crystal clarity for the whole system from choosing the advertisement to payment. All the functions are defined in smart-contract, which makes realization of process much easier and guaranteed.  At the moment team of AdEx developers work on prototype, which will include solutions of new level. It will allow advertisers to communicate with buyers without transaction delay.  Not so long ago AdEx informed its users about collaboration with NEO cryptocurrency. Some people even call it chinese ethereum. Developers are planning to relocate the platform to NEO blockchain, which will allow to improve the platform. To be more precise, it predicts that platform will support some types of digital assets, will run decentralized trading, obtain digital certificate to provide trust to public blockchain and legal protection of all its assets, digitized through NEO platform, support several programming languages like C #, Javascript, Python, Go and others, plus provide absolute interchain compatibility.  By January 2019, AdEx developers will have released platform AdEx v.2. Work of this platform will focus to satisfy needs of rising amount of clients and advertisers who use the platform.  So, ADX holders, unite! As usual, look for your favourite altcoin in methods of payment, buy and test the temptation for all the benefits of FLOGmall!

Have you noticed that all shopping malls, means of transport an even convenient stores in your town started to use contactless payment which no one could imagine before? Then what if we tell you that approximately in 10 years bitcoin and all other altcoins will become the most widespread method of payment for goods and services?  You don’t believe it? The research group from Imperial College London and Social Investment Network eToro came to such conclusion and published a report called ‘Cryptocurrencies: Overcoming Barriers to Trust and Adoption’. British researchers consider that if we want the world to embrace cryptocurrency, the following functions should belong to them: store of value, means of accumulation, medium of exchange and unit of account. Moreover, researches are sure that cryptocurrency is already can be treated as means of accumulation.  Research group underlines that ‘if bitcoin and other digital currency want to correspond to the last two criteria, they will require a progress in such realms as scalability, user interface and control.  In 1723 the first arithmetic machine came out, almost 200 years after, in 1942,  Atanasoff-Berry Computer was developed, and the first email was delivered in 1971. Only 30 years after the technology became popular because of the user-friendly Hotmail interface. The first bitcoin transaction took place almost 8 years ago, and today we can see that it is becoming to be suitable for requirements which are intended for fiat money. Researches from eToro consider that bitcoin and other cryptocurrency will become common in approximately 10 years. Of course there are barriers, but it’s possible to overcome them.  Not so long ago we published analysis of Ipsos company, which made a research about acceptance of new technologies in Europe, Australia and USA.

The high level of protection allows Apis token to protect all your data and guarantees your contracts security. All information goes through the special secure server, and the company just keeps information and doesn’t use it for other purposes.  The foundation of Apis Token algorithm is based on market research which has been working out for 15 years. Developers found out that objective reasons were not the only cause of market fluctuations. It was also psychological reasons. In case of the last happened abrupt ups and downs of currency. The same can relate to cryptocurrency market. Artificial intelligence analized all the causes of such ups and downs and excluded it from the exchange rate. As a result, company promises to provide users with regular income without fear to lose invested money. In general, according to developers’ opinion, artificial intelligence allows to get the best out of the currency fluctuations without losing money which were invested. Minimal rate for investment will stay on the same level, while general rate of cryptocurrency will continue to rise.  APIS cryptocurrency is not for mining. It means that all the tokens of this cryptocurrency were released at once and  can be released only by developers of this cryptocurrency. The amount of released tokens at the moment can be estimated as 4,416,350,572 tokens.  APIS token is now listed on Bit-Z, IDAX and its platform is developed to the level of closed Beta.  APIS has been already added as a method of payment! Go to the alpha version of website, buy goods and stay with FLOGmall!",False

Mastercard creates a system for performing anonymous transactions in the blockchain network. Taking in account real hostility to cryptocurrencies, the corporation decides to adopt some technologies.  A patent for a system, designed to facilitate the transaction`s speed in the blockchain was mentioned on the website of the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in the description of solutions of the problems. According to the Mastercard document, the transparent nature of the blockchain is an obstacle for the integration of this technology for daily payments. The innovation will be applied both for business and individual consumers.  Imagine, for example, someone wants to give a gift to a person without letting him know the details of this transaction. Moreover, a lot of companies will not be interested in providing for competitors and other third parties with such data as the volume of transactions.  To solve this problem, Mastercard Corporation has found a solution that helps to make the transaction, the details of which will be publicly available in order to preserve the credibility of the data. At the same time, it is impossible to track transactions and information on the transaction, by which it is possible to identify its participants. But you know that a number of cryptocurrencies are based on the anonymity of transactions.  Mastercard decided to do it otherwise, and to achieve anonymity without using a publicly-available digital currency, perhaps even trying to keep the ability for law agencies to track illegal transactions. Although this point is not described in details in this patent.  While the cryptocurrency is using p2p transactions, the Mastercard system still relies on a third-party server that maintains a user profile database. Together with the identity data, each profile contains a ""top secret"" section. After receiving information about the transaction from the company, the server hashes the transaction information, combining it with a secret section in the profile. After that, the hash can be published in the blockchain in order to prove the integrity of the transactions without revealing their specific details.  By the way, Mastercard has a large number of patents for development of blockchain in recent times. This Corporation is studying the technologies of the distributed registry for the verification of payment systems.",False

One of the key advantages and differences of FLOGmall’s ICO from any other ICOs is the built-in automatic exchange of tokens, that is called ATES (Automatic token exchange service), FLOGmall to another cryptocurrency. The functionality of this service is partially similar to the internal service of mutual obligations. At the same time, it is an automatic mechanism for exchanging tokens between holders without participation of the site. Automatic exchange of tokens occurs for the performance of a useful action on the site. When buying FLOGmall tokens at the pre-ICO or ICO stages, a user who wants to become a token holder receives a significant discount on token purchase. The platform sets the official rate for the sale of MLC tokens on the automatic token exchange service (hereafter ATES) equal to 1/1000 ETH, which is higher than the selling of MLC tokens on the pre-ICO and ICO stages. After launching the site, the token holder gains access to ATES At ATES, he/she can exchange his/her tokens purchased at the ICO stages to sellers and other users who purchase site services. At ATES, he can exchange his tokens purchased at the ICO stages both with sellers and other users who purchase site services. Thus, from the very first day of FLOGmall operation and ATES operation, users get the opportunity to exchange their MLC tokens with other users.",False

European experts analyzed how modern society understands the technology of blockchain and they predicted that interest to blockchain will grow. Such studies are conducted annually, taking into account sex, age and ethnic characteristics of the respondents. The last one was held from March 26th till April 6th in 2018 and it covered 15 countries, each of which had about thousand respondents.  The results showed that 66% of Europeans know about the existence of cryptocurrency. Someone will say, super, it is more than the half. But the FLOGmall team has an eye twitching that there are still people in this world that don't know about the existence of a digital currency, while our users are buying goods with it.  Nevertheless, 35% still agreed that the crypto industry is ""the future of online purchases"". Another 35% predicted its excellent growth in the next year.  If we consider the world statistics, in general, the population's awareness about the cryptocurrency is more than 50%. The title of the country, where people know about cryptocurrency the most, goes to Austria - 79% and Poland - 77%, while in the United States only 57% of people know what the crypto and tokens mean.  Only 1/10 of respondents had cryptocurrency ever. Moreover, the survey showed that users of online-bank applications are much more likely to have cryptocurrency than those who are far from using such applications. Guess where is the highest percentage of crypto assets? No, not in China. In Turkey! 18%, the lowest one showed Luxembourg - 4%.  25% of respondents noted that they are planning to buy some tokens soon. While most people continue to consider cryptocurrency as a dangerous investment. They think it has more risks than investments in real estate, government bonds or the stock market and such people are not ready for adventures.  Among the best ways of investments in Bitcoin in 11 of the 15 countries of the world, people have chosen special websites. Respondents from Spain, France and Luxembourg rely on financial and banking consultants, while Italians say they consider both ways as equally important ones.  But not everything is so bad in Europe! Also, statistics showed that 70% of the leading companies supplying IT services to market infrastructure are preparing first blockchain projects.

Recently you could not buy with BTC even a bottle of beer in the pub, but today people can buy houses with cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, in Russia, there is still no trust to digital currency, and some people consider it as really dangerous method of payment. Why is it so? Let's go deep into this question.  Cryptocurrency has a long-term successful history of development, it gathers recognition and love of people from all over the world. The growth of the trust level between the crypto enthusiast and the tokens will be evaluated by the fact whether these tokens will be chosen or not for making the transactions concerning a huge real estate or million dollars. We believe that this fact is very important.  The first official mentioning of buying a house with cryptocurrency was in Canada in spring 2013. A local resident decided to sell his father's house for 405 thousand dollars. At that time, the Bitcoin rate was $45, that means the owner got 9000 BTC. Now the Bitcoin rate is 6373$ per 1 BTC, and therefore one question arises to that owner: my friend, how do you feel? They say that at that moment, the Canadian owner of the house wanted to invest in some projects in the Internet. And we really hope that he did not invest and stored his BTC in order a bit to grow.  Another crypto enthusiast from Israel sold his villa in 2014 for 5000 Bitcoins, and, for sure, he does not feel bad either. So, one more question to the readers: why are we still afraid of buying an Iphone with cryptocurrency, if 5 years ago people began to use cryptocurrency without fear, registration procedure and SMS?  In the modern world, crypto experts believe that the US and Japan are the best real estate markets using cryptocurrency. But even in Russian minds, the notions ""cryptocurrency"" and ""real estate"" are not strange anymore. In June 2017, building company in Russia M9 Development said that it is ready to sell real estates with cryptocurrency.  By the way, what is this conversation about? Ask yourself a simple question: Are you ready to buy right now a house in the center of Moscow with digital currency? We have on alpha version couple of samples Half of you would give up, refusing from the adventures, but we do not ask you to sell your flat and paint the town red. Just imagine how easy could be the life with cryptocurrency in the future: simple process of buying a house, fast transactions, safe transactions, no inflated commissions.  And FLOGmall is approaching to this future. The first private crypto enthusiasts are ready to get rid of their real estates with the tokens right within the alpha version of our website. Our website gives you opportunity to buy or rent houses with cryptocurrency in any city of the world! By the way, on our alpha version there are private ads with houses in Belarus, villas in Turkey near the Black Sea, offices in Moscow and flats in the Russian villages. And the range of ""crypto-residences"" from all over the world is growing every day. Well, you see, it's cool to rent a house somewhere in Montenegro with cryptocurrency that you had since 2014?!  Trying to approach to transactions with cryptocurrencies, we come across not only the ambiguous positions of the authorities, but also some nuances that cause fear among market participants. But the market is developing so rapidly that it is not necessary to become a buyer for Bitcoin right now. It's just enough to think it over today (in a positive way) in order to participate in this market tomorrow.",False

Yes, now we are developing ATES:  One of the key advantages and differences of FLOGmall's ICO from any other ICOs is the built-in automatic exchange of tokens, that is called ATES (Automatic token exchange service), FLOGmall to another cryptocurrency.  The functionality of this service is partially similar to the internal service of mutual obligations. At the same time, it is an automatic mechanism for exchanging tokens between holders without participation of the site. Automatic exchange of tokens occurs for the performance of a useful action on the site.  When buying FLOGmall tokens at the pre-ICO or ICO stages, a user who wants to become a token holder receives a significant discount on token purchase. The platform sets the official rate for the sale of MLC tokens on the automatic token exchange service (hereafter ATES) equal to 1/1000 ETH.  After launching the site, the token holder gains access to ATES At ATES, he/she can exchange his/her tokens purchased at the ICO stages to sellers and other users who purchase site services. At ATES, he can exchange his tokens purchased at the ICO stages both with sellers and other users who purchase site services. Thus, from the very first day of FLOGmall operation and ATES operation, users get the opportunity to exchange their MLC tokens with other users.",False

Friends, we are glad to inform you about important decision… We prolong our ICO for a while!  We reached Soft Cap, we met a lot of like-minded people, cool partners like KICKICO, Klooway, Viuly, we worked with such altcoins as Colossus, Cloakcoin, Solaris, Verge and started to popularize cryptocurrency but… If someone likes his job and he works hard, can he try to work perfectly? - yep!  June 26 should be the day when FLOGmall ICO will end. But we get an incredible amount of feedbacks from the people who don't have enough time, from our investors from Europe and the United States, who are currently solving the necessary legal issues in order to become participants of our project!  Why did we decide to do it?  Because of such interest in our project from Western investors, we just could not miss this opportunity. All our holders will get benefit from this.  On the website the contributions during the ICO stage are already $13,997,237, it means that the total amount during all stages is about $17,201,272. There is a chance to reach a total Hard-Cap - $24,000,000. So, should we give up right now?  Why is it so important? Reaching hard cap means an opportunity to improve the marketing strategy, and the right marketing strategy is our chance to popularize the world of cryptocurrency.  In our plans: the expansion of the community in Europe and the US, and we can achieve such results:  -More target audience → -More opportunities to develop the website → -More shops, goods and services → -More opportunities for MLC token on the exchange and ATES!  We announce a new day for the end of our ICO: July 20th!  This is the deadline for the end of FLOGmall ICO, nevertheless, there can be possibility of premature end of this stage, when our plans will be fulfilled.  The bonus system is still on, all bonuses will be the same till the very end. Also, we pay your attention that all plans concerning listing and sales are unchanged, and about each news FLOGmall will report personally!  We have worked really hard but we could not have done it alone! We thank our partners, investors, and, of course, the best bounty team who are so loyal and who every day promote our idea of cryptocurrency!  Thank you for being with us. Thank you for your support!

Many projects involve a lot of money and modern technologies, but they do not bring the success. Why is this happening? FLOGmall makes marketing of ICOs simple and clear!  You know that our project uses 79% of investments for a marketing campaign, and we are not the only one who understands that it is necessary. A lot of ICOs use the money for maintaining a high level of activity, but they do not get the desired effect. What to do? Let's first indicate the market opportunities, dividing them into chargeable and free. Let's start with the free one.  From our own experience, we can tell you that you need to create personal pages in all social networks. Now the society gets information only via the Internet. So, upload the information! Communicate with your user, have fun with him and share the news. It brings together. Our company has communities in almost all well-known social networks: Facebook, Vkontakte, Instagram, Telegram, Telegraph, Twitter, Medium, Reddit.  Next, start the bounty program and airdrop. It is a great way to attract new users desiring to get the tokens for free Translate the terms of participation of these programs into different languages, remember, your goal is not only your country but the whole world! Create as many unique contents as possible and give them to the participants of bounty program for sharing.  Pay attention to Telegram. Create a couple of chats: in the English language and in your own languages to communicate with people from different parts of the world. Pay extra attention to China and South Asia, because they are the Gods of sales.  Add your ICO to listing websites, many of them have the possibility of free publication.  In social networks, like Vkontakte and Facebook, it's easy to talk with admins of groups about the publication of interesting content about your project. Remember: you must be creative!  For sure, you visit different conferences in order to promote the idea of your project. Try during these conferences, especially during the private meetings, to negotiate with experts who are interested in you about the review of your project. And promote their reviews!  Fulfilling such simple instructions, you already get the minimal coverage that can bring the first investment. What to do then? Right! Use investments for the chargeable activities, that, for sure, are already ""gathering dust in your marketing wardrobe"".  Chargeable marketing has the MAIN role in your ICO, so do not get greedy if you want to achieve success in your promotion.  Chargeable marketing can mean anything. It can be publication in mass media, huge advertising campaign on TV, on the Internet, in shopping centers and airports. Of course, most experts and influencers will refuse to publish information about you for free. Therefore, for the famous celebrities, you have to pay.  Ah, yes, an important point! Do not forget how important it is to reach out to private investors. Because they are people with experience and therefore you need more private investors than admins of the community on Facebook. What exactly can be interesting for the potential holder of your tokens:  - Business plan and presentation (95% of ICOs do not have a clear business strategy and for this reason that they can not collect the necessary funds);  - Roadmap for the project;  - The structure of the token;  - Marketing analysis (and plans to promote your ICO or blockchain-startup);  - Simple white paper (with financial, marketing and perspective analysis);  - Onepager, that provides all the necessary information on one page;  - A good review about your project that will attract investors;  - ROI analysis.  If you have all of the mentioned above - congratulations! You can safely submit applications to venture and hedge funds! The most important is starting to launch the ICO make sure that you have all the necessary documents, that you carried out the necessary analysis and a clear strategy.  Why do we give away such useful information? Can our competitors use it? We believe that positive competition is a key to successful development of the whole market and the self-improvement of the project!  So, stay in touch with FLOGmall! See you!",False

Klooway is an international online platform for hosting ICO companies. Remember, not so long ago we told you about Alexey Khayrutdinov's trip about strategic issues to Moscow. This is just one of them. We have signed a legal agreement with the company, according to which Klooway is entitled to sell our tokens by their specialists.  Thus, now you can buy our tokens in three different ways: traditional one - in personal account of FLOGmall, proven one - KICKICO with bonuses from their platform, and new one - from Klooway with their benefits.  What is the convenience there? - you ask. Many beginners have problems with buying tokens. Someone can not understand the process of conversion of fiat money into the cryptocurrency, others have difficulties with wallets, while others are not cryptocurrency holders at all. Klooway kills these pains: there you can purchase cryptocurrency in any conceivable way, even with the help of Qiwi-purse or cash in their office.  By the way,apart from the given convenience, the guys provide the bonuses from their site. Having redeemed the right to sell quite a large number of MLC tokens, they can now give their customers good discounts. You can find out all the details on their personal communication channels, which we will publish below.  Therefore, if the phone rang suddenly - do not worry, take the phone and do not be shy, Klooway is now our official partner.  Telephones of specialists: +7 499 455 03 67; 8 800 551 69 02.

We consider this as a form of gambling, ""- says the website of the clinic. Why these tokens are considered as especially dangerous - is not known yet.  Among the symptoms of addiction to cryptocurrency, scientists include muscle tension, anxiety, constant monitoring of prices of digital assets (at night as well), thoughts about trading or other actions.  ""For some people, trading in cryptocurrency is becoming a way to escape to another world, because the world in which they live, they do not like,"" says clinic doctor Tony Marini.  In the rehabilitation center, ""cryptocurrency  abusers"" work in groups where they tell their stories and with the help of specialists try to get rid of their addiction. According to experts, every tenth trader from the US is addicted to cryptocurrency.  Many countries are really engaged in studying the issue of addiction to cryptocurrency. South Korea, for example, is one of the countries where the addiction to cryptocurrency causes serious fears of the authorities and may become a reason for the rigid regulation of the digital currency market. Russia also belongs to a number of countries that paid attention to the new human disease. In Moscow, a free service of psychological support has already been launched for miners and cryptocurrency investors.",False

Now we are conquering with our minds and charm the Parliament of the Russian Federation. How Maxim Teleshev with our partner Arthur Lipatov took out the project to public - read below!  Last week on June 7 in the capital of our homeland, Moscow, the International Blockchain Conference took place in the Federation Council. Among the invited persons at the event were members of the Federation Council, State Duma deputies, Governors and Vice Governors of the regions of the Russian Federation, heads of large companies, representatives of commercial banks, and experts in crypto business. It is a great event for the domestic crypto industry, at which the next successful performance of the FLOGmall team took place.  In March of this year, there were bills brought into legislation in the State Duma, regulating the market of cryptocurrencies, ICO and crowd-funding, as well as concepts that define ideas about digital law, digital money and other segments of crypto economics. At the last conference legislative initiatives on legal regulation and predicted the progress of building a digital economy in Russia were just discussed.  The event of this format takes place in our country for the first time, but today it describes itself as one of the authoritative discussion platforms for discussing crypto politics and the results of its enforcement in the Russian Federation. Results and proposals made within the framework of the event are planned to be systematized and presented to the authorities, participants of the crypto community and descendants for the future. As you can guess, the conference was so successful that the organizers decided to carry out an annual event.  Among the speakers, one could meet modern crypto-celebrities: Juvan Lee, organizer of Fintech Week, as well as CEO of NexChange and of Venture Fund - Arrakis Ventures; Pushkov Anton, Managing Partner of the Intellectual Property Center of the Skolkovo Foundation; Sidorenko Elina, the head of the group on assessing the risks of turnover of cryptocurrency in the State Duma of the Russian Federation; Karl Eckstein, Professor, Doctor of Law, Honorary Consul of the Russian Federation in Switzerland.  By the way, Djuvan Li and a member of our team Maxim Teleshev talked for about an hour and a half. He told us about the secrets of holding the ICO in the Asian countries, revealed a couple of secrets that will later help us in our future Road Show.  As part of the presentation of projects, Arthur Lipatov introduced us from the stage, if anyone forgot - he is the charming community director of FLOGmall, as well as the father of the Russian Silicon Valley, our partner. Some of the residents of the Silicon Valley also showed their achievements in the exposition sphere.  And although we had some problems with the transportation and installation of a two-meter high plasma, it was a positive experience that brought to us such fruits as 50+ handed out business cards to interested enthusiasts, new acquaintances and agreements with investment funds, and most important - the admiring eyes of the public, which found out that our security token (which is not often found in the domestic ICO), and that in general someone is doing such suitable projects in the Russian countryside.  It was a productive meeting, one of those after which you get tired in a good way so that you miss the after-party (""But please do not write about this"" - Maxim Teleshev )  Follow the further trips of our team, we have plans to conquer the whole world! And stay with FLOGmall!",False

It's the built-in automatic exchange of tokens, that is called ATES (Automatic token exchange service), FLOGmall to another cryptocurrency.  The functionality of this service is partially similar to the internal service of mutual obligations. At the same time, it is an automatic mechanism for exchanging tokens between holders without participation of the site. Automatic exchange of tokens occurs for the performance of a useful action on the site.  When buying FLOGmall tokens at the pre-ICO or ICO stages, a user who wants to become a token holder receives a significant discount on token purchase. The platform sets the official rate for the sale of MLC tokens on the automatic token exchange service (hereafter ATES) equal to 1/1000 ETH, which is higher than the selling of MLC tokens on the pre-ICO and ICO stages.  After launching the site, the token holder gains access to ATES At ATES, he/she can exchange his/her tokens purchased at the ICO stages to sellers and other users who purchase site services. At ATES, he can exchange his tokens purchased at the ICO stages both with sellers and other users who purchase site services.

Not so long ago on Hakaton in Skolkovo we got acquainted with a cool team of developers. The guys achieved the second place there within the largest forum for specialists from different areas of software, and then joined our team of blockchain engineers. It was their help that our team wrote for you a working prototype of a secure transaction on the Ethereum protocol using Metamask. Why Metamask? Because it is a convenient and easy-to-use cryptocurrency wallet for fast Internet payments and the storage of ETH and derivative tokens. Everything works very simply. You install a plug-in for the Chrome browser for quick payments and transactions within the Ethereum network and for work with cryptocurrency exchanges, and without any complications you use the benefits of our safe transaction. This application in our case kills absolutely all headaches. FLOGmall with Metamask can identify the user. In simple words, this is our guarantee that you are you, your payment is your payment, and it refers to a specific order. Prototype of a safe transaction, of course, is not finished completely, but it is already fully functioning. And very soon it will be published on our site. At the moment, we are putting in order the external appearance of the transaction and we`re transferring the currency into USDT. USDT is the fixation of the actual value of the cryptocurrency in dollars. That is, the rate of your token remains the same as it was at the time of the closure of the transaction and will not be changed. If for the seller the currency is immediately converted into USDT, and if it goes to him even for a maximum period of 40 days, then no matter how the rate will be jumping during this time, he will receive his amount in an unchanged state. Very soon, friends, we will represent this device officially! This is a work of a great scale, and we did it together. Because FLOGmall cares about the security of your tokens!",False

To earn it is easy: by completing challenges,  by accomplishing certain activities such as unlocking achievements, completing levels and finishing the game.  Cryptocurrency is absolutely anonymous (without unpleasant surprises), the speed of transactions is very fast. The maximum emission is 266,116,933,498 XP.  XP was launched in 2006 and since that moment it has achieved great success. Now it is one of the main coins in the field of online games. The working on the project team in 2018 is going to get a big breakthrough, negotiations are already on with the developers of the most popular games. If they are successful, the Experience Points will be able to reach $ 1 per piece. By the way, now one token can be bought at a price of $ 0.000150 per piece.  At the CoinExchange stock market, the daily volume of trades is 35 million dollars. Given the overall capitalization of the project, we can say that this is a very weak indicator. And it means that the increase in the value of the token can be prolonged.  If you play any kind of online games, then you just have to buy Experience Points. And there are three reasons for this. First, the value of this token is ridiculous (man, that's less than one cent), second, these tokens in the near future can be used for purchases inside the most popular video games.  Third - you can profitably spend them on FLOGmall. Buy a new Macbook Pro, for example, which will support all the latest updates of the video games. Your cyber-enemies will surrender just having heard about such news.",False

One of the key advantages and differences of FLOGmall's ICO from any other ICOs is the built-in automatic exchange of tokens, that is called ATES (Automatic token exchange service), FLOGmall to another cryptocurrency.  The functionality of this service is partially similar to the internal service of mutual obligations. At the same time, it is an automatic mechanism for exchanging tokens between holders without participation of the site. Automatic exchange of tokens occurs for the performance of a useful action on the site.  When buying FLOGmall tokens at the pre-ICO or ICO stages, a user who wants to become a token holder receives a significant discount on token purchase. The platform sets the official rate for the sale of MLC tokens on the automatic token exchange service (hereafter ATES) equal to 1/1000 ETH, which is higher than the selling of MLC tokens on the pre-ICO and ICO stages.  After launching the site, the token holder gains access to ATES At ATES, he/she can exchange his/her tokens purchased at the ICO stages to sellers and other users who purchase site services. At ATES, he can exchange his tokens purchased at the ICO stages both with sellers and other users who purchase site services. Thus, from the very first day of FLOGmall operation and ATES operation, users get the opportunity to exchange their MLC tokens with other users.",False

Not so long ago on our platform, a user from Moscow ordered a brand new Ipad 512 GB spacegray. And there was a delay in delivery. This is not a very pleasant coincidence, when exactly this color, size and RAM of the gadget was not at the right time in our storehouse.  But we were lucky. Aleksei Khayrutdinov, who was by chance in Moscow, solving strategic issues, decided personally to organize delivery to the buyer. Alexei had a business meeting in the Federation Tower, therefore, it was decided to transmit Ipad there, not leaving the spectacular panorama of Moscow City. In general, Alexey and Maxim handed Ipad personally from the hands of the founders with video shooting, fanfares and other flavors.  In this photo - the image of a real person who already uses all the benefits of FLOGmall and spends his cryptocurrency. Meet Gennady. Gennady already uses Ipad, purchased for a real Ethereum and he is already thinking about buying a Macbook. Ipad was given to our user by CEO FLOGmall Alexei Khayrutdinov, and also he granted a bonus in the form of cashback 20% of the purchase for the prolonged expectation.  In addition to the delivery of the goods, we also talked about the importance of the project, the development of the cryptocurrency and even predicted the future that awaits us all. Very soon our new episode ""How We Do ICO"" will be released on Youtube, in which we included this interview. Soon you will see everything by yourself, and there is also a beautiful panorama of Moscow City - as a bonus.

We came back from Moscow  Hey guys! Recently we`ve told you about the cool crypto conferences that our founders went to conquer. Alexandr Zalogin was left by the fate in hot Krasnodar city at the party organized by the Youtube channel called Vlogchain, and Alexei Khayrutdinov was waiting for a long flight to Moscow, where he had to meet real sharks of the capital's trading. What is it for - read below!  The cryptoparty was amazing. And not only due to entertainment show and funny DJs, but also due to heated discussions and intensive brainstorming. But for those who are fans of their work - even evening rest during day off is slowly flowing into a fruitful action. ""We solved the business cases, shared knowledges, smoked hookah"" (c) Alexander Zalogin.   Now we move to Moscow.  To begin with, the Platinum meeting in Moscow was like clockwork. For the performance, we were provided with 10 minutes, in which to fit in, was as difficult as to put on tights over the head. Almost impossible.  To tell and to show from all sides the project of such scale for a short time - unreal. Therefore, Alexei had to take another five minutes, skip the most interesting graphics from the presentation, wind up the organizers` clock at 5 minutes later. Despite all this, speech turned out to be lively and interesting. A brief summary about the participation in the project, possible benefits and how to make profit  (information already known by each of our readers), as well as a promotional code + 50%, were received by 150 conference participants that day.  This is why our CEO was caught in the lobby, on the stairs, and at the exit from the conference hall, in order to clarify the issues of investment as fully as possible and to join the project. And ten-minute performance at 13:00 was stretched to the evening party by hands of the capital audience.  We brought a big suitcase of events from Moscow (besides traditional souvenirs and lack of sleep). But one thing at a time: about the results of the trip we will tell gradually in all official sources of communication. Follow our news!  We meet in the next post!",False

If you forgot for a second, in what age we live with you - in the 21st. How did it happen that people in the world of technological progress, where they speak about the cryptocurrency from every source, do not know about its existence yet? Read below!  Not so long ago, Dalia Research company conducted a study of interest in cryptocurrencies in different countries of the world. The team evaluated the knowledge of local residents about the crypto industry, as well as their willingness to acquire and own digital assets.  The survey involved about 29 thousand respondents from different parts of the world - the United States, Britain, Germany, Brazil, Japan, South Korea, China and India.  75% of the respondents ""heard something"" about the cryptocurrencies. Population of Japan and South Korea are best acquainted with digital assets - 83% and 87%, the lowest numbers - in Brazil, 60%. Yes, the vast majority, but what to do with those who are still out of the loop?  Only half of these 75% of people who heard about cryptocurrency knows what cryptocurrency really is,they know that it is not a tricky fraud of ICO-founders , and the term ""farms"" have nothing to do with cows and goats. And again, the highest levels of awareness go to Japan and South Korea.  After the prices for cryptocurrencies go up and down like McGregor on the warm-up, then reaching a peak, then again falling to the economic bottom, the researchers asked the question: is anyone going to invest in the cryptocurrency after all this? It turned out that from half of 75%, about 4% of respondents want to buy digital assets. On average, this figures for different countries ranged from 3 to 6%. These data, especially in comparison with high levels of awareness about the digital assets market as a whole, show that the cryptocurrencies are still at the early stage of their adoption time.  By the way, 7% of all respondents are lucky owners of different tokens.  Researchers worked hard and even divided the interviewed group into categories of education, fields of activity and gender. Discarding all gender stereotypes, we claim: you can meet a man-cryptocurrency holder more often than woman! The difference in the sex distribution of owners of cryptocurrencies is 11%.  It is interesting that respondents with a higher level of education are more likely to own cryptocurrencies. There are more owners of digital assets who have higher education by 12%.  Such results, friends.",False

A distinctive feature of Mallcoin entry to the exchange is that the rate of this cryptocurrency will already be provided with the current exchange rate at ATES and will have its lower level, which tends to the rate of the most profitable offer at ATES on the day of Mallcoin entry to the exchange.  It will vary within the range from 0.0001666666667 to 0.001 Ethereum. According to the laws of supply and demand for tokens, at the first stage the rate will quickly equalize with respect to the ATES rate (price smoothing).  If the average rate of the MLC token on all exchanges is higher than at ATES, then there will be a complete (partial) repurchase of tokens at ATES as a result of space arbitrage. The official rate on ATES will then have the average exchange value of the MLC token value.  If the rate on the exchanges is lower than at ATES, it will not incur a loss of investment for investors, as they will be able to exchange tokens at a fixed rate of ATES.  It is also worth saying that the demand for the purchase and sale of MLC tokens on exchanges does not directly depend on the demand of users of the FLOGmall system, but is market-based, so Mallcoin's exchange rate can significantly exceed the official FLOGmall exchange rate.",False

Such disappointing results were provided by economist Alex de Fris.  According to the expert, at the present time the BTC network consumes about 2.55 GW of electricity, but by the end of 2018 it will surely reach the mark of 7.67 GW. For example, the population of Ireland consumes 3.1 GW, and Austria - 8.2 GW.  Do you feel the scale of energy consumption? Now wonder that the discussion about how much mining of cryptocurrency harms the environment every day only gets hot.  Let's try to consider the situation from the other side. Imagine how cryptocurrency is in demand, if a person is willing to spend such amount of energy resources, knowing that thereby destroys the planet. Just think how much cryptocurrency is becoming desirable for us, if we are ready to harm to the environment.  But what's the point of spending an immense amount of electricity to convert the cryptocurrency into fiat money with huge commissions and tax deductions?  As you already know, FLOGmall decides not only the issue with the unrealized cryptocurrency but gives a chance to spend it with benefit. It also gives you the opportunity to earn cryptocurrency inside the site without a harmful mining.  For this you have several ways:  Take advantage of our bonus system; Buy MLC before listing of token on stock exchanges; Wait for the release of the unique service ATES on the site.

Thousands of sellers have already found their buyer at FLOGmall and signed the first official deals in history for cryptocurrency. And all is within our site!  In the column of private ads, the success of a deal depends not only on the popular price-quality ratio, but also on trust. At the moment, the FLOGmall team is working on the concept of security and moderation. But we are talking only about alpha version of the site.You will have to contact the seller personally.  Perhaps you will ask why more and more people come to us every day with their ""stuff""? Because this is still the most convenient way to earn cryptocurrency, bypassing mining and the theft of public electricity. You can sell any unnecessary thing and get real cryptocurrency for it, which you will use in the right way.  And so FLOGmall solves two problems: painless earnings for any user and attracting new users. Because, although we live in the age of cryptocurrency technologies, the cryptocurrency for many people still does not have significance, as for us. Surprisingly, we know! And if our idea that you can not only buy Bitcoin, but also earn it using your ""stuff"" will be understood by at least one user, he is already involved. Definitely!  It works almost as simply as the FLOGmall bonuses. Try, you will not regret!  See you at Alpha!",False

Is it stable?    Blockchain tries to rid the world of greedy IT companies, Bitcoin ignores Wall Street offers and fights with Bitcoin Cash, the Ukrainian ICO market has grown by 90% ...  And, in the meantime, the Russian legislation will not still figure out the questions of regulation of the cryptocurrency business. And although it is already possible to pay with cryptocurrency inside commercial Internet sites, even in some restaurants this method of payment is considered as unofficial one and it is not protected by the state. Moreover, by banks it is still considered as dangerous, provoking criminal activity and aiding terrorism.  Is everything so bad in the rest global economic powers? Let's figure it out.  Firstly we'll note that along with Russia, such countries as India, South Korea, Australia and France plan to draft law on the regulation of cryptocurrencies. Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, China, USA, Canada, Brazil, Britain, Germany deny the need to regulate the cryptocurrencies. Why is it happening? Because of lack of necessity.  For example, in China cryptocurrency exchanges and ICO - are banned completely and irrevocably. South Korea also banned the ICO, but its cryptocurrency exchanges are on the contrary, thriving in ""gray zone"". The ""gray zone"" means illegal business and, by the way, such business is very popular in all Asia, Europe, North and South America, Australia and Russia. And they seem to be happy with it. Well, only Japan has officially allowed the existence of cryptocurrency exchanges at its territory yet.  The only sphere left now without repression is payment with the cryptocurrency and the convertation of cryptocurrency into fiat money. Payments with cryptocurrency are allowed almost everywhere, that means that FLOGmall is your best solution in this case. Because we have no limitations for you. And we are not even talking about your investments. You can exchange your cryptocurrency for any commodity of everyday use and vice versa, a thing that has long been collecting dust in the wardrobe- for the Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other cryptocurrency.  You forget about unnecessary gestures: do not convert cryptocurrency into fiat, stop attending exchanges with their boring charts, and just buy at the site with the cryptocurrency in the form that is stored on your cryptocurrency wallet.  On average, the purchase on FLOGmall takes 2 minutes 24 seconds. What can not be said about the choice ... Because the range of goods is growing and changing every day.

Automatic exchange of tokens occurs for the performance of a useful action on the site.  When buying FLOGmall tokens at the pre-ICO or ICO stages, a user who wants to become a token holder receives a significant discount on token purchase.

We had an article not long about these theme:  Why are people still afraid of online-shopping despite such figures? We conducted a survey among our users and the most popular answers to the question are:  Fear like ""expectation-reality""; when the reality has not borne out the expectations. Unwillingness to pay for shipping; Fear of an advance payment, or even the whole amount of payment to an unknown person and to be duped. To give money personally to the seller-consultant is somehow safer; Desire to get at least some guarantee documents, but .... The last point, as it turned out, is the most important. Therefore, let's talk about it. How to be assured that your purchase will reach you safe and sound, or at least it will be just delivered to you. Without the call to a lawyer and other legal persons  To protect the interests of buyers from fraud, on our site there is a service called  ""Safe transaction"", within which FLOGmall acts as a kind of arbitrator. The transaction is done with the help of smart-contract and MLC tokens.  Making a purchase using Safe transaction, the seller receives payment only after the goods are received by the buyer. That is, until your order is on the doorstep of your house, and you do not confirm it personally, the seller will not get your money. Otherwise, you have the right to open dispute about this transaction.  As soon as the seller sends the goods, the buyer receives a track code to track the shipment and can control at any time at which stage of delivery his order is.  What will happen if the buyer wants to ""dump"" the seller? Buyer will not want it, because he will be motivated to close the deal in order to get an additional bonus in the form of Mallcoin tokens and a positive rating as a site user.  The most curious people will ask: What other advantages does smart-contract have? Only using smart-contract you can get the most truthful information about each seller. Smart-contract records all the nuances of the seller-buyer relationship, therefore, only the person who actually made the purchase would be able to leave a feedback about the product. So you avoid thousands of sweet but fake feedbacks and reviews.",False

Seven commandments which you don`t know    Do you know that MLC tokens are tokens of ERC-20 standard? No? Well, now you know. If for you this abbreviation is completely new and means nothing, then start reading the text below! Go!    What is ERC-20, and why haven't you heard anything about it? Most of ICOs use the Ethereum network as a platform or, more precisely, the smart- contracts of this network. During fundraising campaigns, organizers of ICO usually accept ETH or BTC as payment, charging investors with tokens instead. More often these are tokens of ERC-20 standard, as in the case with FLOGmall.    What does these three letters imply? ERC (Ethereum Request for Comments) is an official protocol using which you can make suggestions for improving of Ethereum. Number ""20"" means the identification number. That is, the tokens of the ERC-20 standard are actually smart-contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.  The ERC-20 standard has a set of rules that you should follow in order for a token to be accepted and to be able to interact with other tokens on the network. The tokens themselves are blockchain-assets, which can have value, and can be sent and received like any other cryptocurrency.    Why did you need to create ERC-20? Before this standard, there were some problems of incompatibility between different forms of Ethereum tokens. Because each of them hides its own unique smart-contract. Ultimately, for a stock exchange or a wallet to support a token without problems (by the way supporting of a growing number of tokens did not become problematic) it was necessary to create a new unified protocol.    What is the difference between the ERC-20 tokens and the traditional cryptocurrency? Here everything is quite simple. The difference is that they are tied with the Ethereum network, they use the format of addresses accepted within this network and are sent using Ethereum-transactions. Accordingly, transactions involving ERC-20 tokens can be tracked in the block browser.  It is important to understand that the ERC-20 tokens are not completely independent as it was mentioned above, they are based on the Ethereum blockchain, on the distributed computing capabilities of which they rely in their work.    Why were ERC-20 tokens created, and who would need them? They can be not only a cryptocurrency in the standard sense, but they also act as project shares, certificates that confirm the right to assets or points in the loyalty program. Well, of course to fulfill all these functions at once. Among the most famous tokens based on the ERC-20 standard are 0x, Aragon, Dentacoin, EOS, Civic, BAT, Kucoin, TenX, TTron and Mallcoin for sure.  Well, did you figure it out? Now you can say that you are an expert in ERC standards. Stay with us, we will continue to sort out all your questions!",False

Are you ready for interesting facts? In 2017 figures of retail sales in worldwide e-commerce equaled $2.3 trillion, and according to the forecast for 2021, revenues from such sales will grow up to $4.88 trillion.  Why are people still afraid of online-shopping despite such figures? We conducted a survey among our users and the most popular answers to the question are:  Fear like ""expectation-reality""; when the reality has not borne out the expectations. Unwillingness to pay for shipping; Fear of an advance payment, or even the whole amount of payment to an unknown person and to be duped. To give money personally to the seller-consultant is somehow safer; Desire to get at least some guarantee documents, but .... The last point, as it turned out, is the most important. Therefore, let's talk about it. How to be assured that your purchase will reach you safe and sound, or at least it will be just delivered to you. Without the call to a lawyer and other legal persons  To protect the interests of buyers from fraud, on our site there is a service called  ""Safe transaction"", within which FLOGmall acts as a kind of arbitrator. The transaction is done with the help of smart-contract and MLC tokens.  Making a purchase using Safe transaction, the seller receives payment only after the goods are received by the buyer. That is, until your order is on the doorstep of your house, and you do not confirm it personally, the seller will not get your money. Otherwise, you have the right to open dispute about this transaction.  As soon as the seller sends the goods, the buyer receives a track code to track the shipment and can control at any time at which stage of delivery his order is.  What will happen if the buyer wants to ""dump"" the seller? Buyer will not want it, because he will be motivated to close the deal in order to get an additional bonus in the form of Mallcoin tokens and a positive rating as a site user.  The most curious people will ask: What other advantages does smart-contract have? Only using smart-contract you can get the most truthful information about each seller. Smart-contract records all the nuances of the seller-buyer relationship, therefore, only the person who actually made the purchase would be able to leave a feedback about the product. So you avoid thousands of sweet but fake feedbacks and reviews.  That's all for today, my friends. We are sure that only with FLOGmall you can achieve such level of trust. So, go safely to alpha version of the site, and let's start getting acquainted with e-commerce industry with cryptocurrency! Time flies, and you are still without purchases.  We meet at FLOGmall!",False

We were asked recently ""What do I need Livestore for?  I can easily watch video on youtube. How do you want to surprise me?"". Therefore, we would like to answer this questions immediately! All advantages of Livestore and visual content are mentioned in this post! Let`s go!  In his question our opponent did not take into account some of the most important features of the project, that are the key ones and do not regard Livestore and video sales. However, first let's tackle the question of the need for these innovations.  Why is Livestore necessary, and how is it going to deal with problem of the confidence to the seller? Initially, video is more attractive way of interaction with the audience. First, it provides an opportunity to increase conversion and helps users to understand the product better. As the statistics shows, after watching the video the volume of sales was raised in the online store by 64-85%.  Secondly, let's confess to each other honestly. We do not like to think. It is easier for buyer to watch video in which an unknown man will tell everything about the product, and even turn it around in front of the camera. It's easier and more pleasant than reading a long and tedious description, even if it contains the most incredible technical features. It is always more interesting to see clearly how GoPRO shoots, rather than read about the resolution of 4K video.  Statistics shows that 55% of users watch video content carefully, and this is the highest indicator among other types of content. So, people are already saying that until 2020 all online stores will be turned into video sales format.  The industry is developing fast, until recently we had mobile phones with IrDA, and a 2.0 Mp camera was considered as luxury. There was neither technology nor especially the Internet. And today we can make funny videos with cats, immediately post them on youtube and get likes and views. And it is really cool!  We have already written about our collaboration with Viuly, and if you didn't notice this text, then pay attention now. Viuly is a decentralized video platform based on blockchain. And they kindly provided for FLOGmall the opportunity to host video of our users on their platform.  Now all our video-stores will be stored and placed under the guidance of our new partner. Also, with Viuly, we agreed on a new format for video sales, which will allow to buy goods from FLOGmall directly using the video on Viuly. Functional device and working version of our technical integration will be available in the coming weeks and each of you will be able to go to FLOGmall in order to create your own video-store.  In general, it is hard to escape a conclusion that thanks to video content, the whole industry is changing radically. The buyer has the opportunity to become better acquainted with the goods, the seller has the opportunity to sell goods more profitable. Companies that use video in their marketing, from year to year, increase profits by 49% faster than the companies that do not.  Video content is a new step in the development of e-commerce. The step is high enough. No doubt.",False

How cryptocurrency finds its true identity    In 2017 because of the realization of the rapid growth of the cryptocurrency, the world literally went nuts. Number of cryptocurrency holders is keeping increasing, its demand is growing, and the state is afraid of the impossibility of its taxation. That is why we hear all these conversations about the short-term trend and the early death of the new economic era. All media say that cryptocurrency is a bubble that is about to burst and overwhelm all its former admirers. Is it so? The main argument brought by the witnesses is the insecurity of the cryptocurrency and the rapid change of needs of audience. They say, it will be played enough and forgotten as not the most successful computer game.  Let's finally look at the cryptocurrency not as an investment, but as a real mean of payment.  There is FLOGmall. Every day at the platform, sales are made for any cryptocurrency of all varieties and colors. E.g.: right now, if you go to our website with 1 BTC, you can buy six Iphones X 256 GB, two electric kick scooters HX, and there will be still change for clothes. Isn`t it that very security of the cryptocurrency, that many people are trying to argue? Thanks to FLOGmall, cryptocurrency has quite real material security in the form of everyday goods. And it is only the beginning. This is what you can say to anyone who asks about guarantees of your investments.  Cryptocurrency is strongly breaking through the barricades, which modern society builds. For example: in January 2018 more than $1.2 billion was attracted to all kinds of ICO, and the number of cryptocurrency holders has long exceeded 10,000,000. And no matter how skeptics resist, the cryptocurrency will sooner or later becomes an integral part of everyday life along with fiat money. Do you also know this already?",False

This token was issued by Verge Currency.  Verge (XVG) is a decentralized cryptocurrency intended for users for whom confidentiality is very important.  Before we will introduce to you more details about Verge token, let's talk a little bit about their partners.  At the present moment, it is possible to pay with Verge tokens on such resources as Pornhub, Brazzers, Nutaku. The question of pornography is quite acute in our society, however, we can not deny the fact that billions of dollars are circulating in this industry.  Fundamentally Verge is built by using a Bitcoin fork, but clearly emphasizing privacy. They use several networks with anonymity, such as TOR and I2P. The IP addresses of users are completely hidden, and it is impossible to track transactions.  Verge Currency says that its goal is to create cryptocurrency designed for everyday use by ordinary people, and its mission is to allow mankind to make direct transactions quickly, efficiently and privately. With Verge currency, companies and individuals have flexible options for sending and receiving receipt of payment.  If you are already a happy owner of Verge, welcome to FLOGmall, because now XVG token is one of the official methods of payment.  We meet at FLOGmall!",False

The token will be used as the payment unit for all transactions in the FLOGmall system and as a basis for interacting with other digital services.  And important point is ""Hedging the risks"" The hedging on FLOGmall is that the artificial creation and retention of the minimum value of the official token exchange rate equal to 0.001 Ethereum or 0.3$ (calculated as the fiat equivalent value) creates a minimum conditional capitalization of the tokens and maintains this rate at a given level. This, in turn, gives confidence in the sale of tokens in the area of this value in an indefinite period of time (even with small volumes of trading on this token).  After the main ICO and site launch, it is planned to place a token on a number of other exchanges in the near future. A distinctive feature of the release of our token to the exchange is that its exchange rate will be provided by exchange on ATES. It will have its lower level, which tends to the rate of the most favorable offer on ATES (the lowest) on the day of Mallcoin release to the exchanges.",False

That is, in general, before passing the SEC control, your token is originally a Utility-token. This type of token is useful, but it is not item of securities, unlike Security-token.  Why did we make our token as Security token? Firstly, registration with the SEC is a obligatory requirement for our investors from the United States. Investors from the United States made it for us clear that they are ready to invest in securities and are absolutely not ready to invest in ""candy wrappers"" or funny money.  Secondly, now there is a positive dynamics in the listing of SEC-tokens on various cryptocurrency exchanges. Most likely this dynamics will lead to the fact that sooner or later, all tokens that can earn you money will be recognized by the SEC. We decided to take care of all legal issues and documents in advance.  As Mr. Clayton from the SEC says, almost all ICOs are security offers, but language of official documents and white paper are treated in order to show a token as Utility one.  What will happen when the SEC finds out that the Utility was sold to a US citizen being representing as item of securities? Most likely nothing good ... We are not ready to risk so much and stitch our investors up.  Here is a link to all documents in the official website of SEC :  https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1735574/000173557418000001/0001735574-18-000001-index.htm",False

First day!  A few minutes ago (GTM) the first day of ICO FLOGmall was finished.  The fees were: 560 994$  ""Strange"" - the curious skeptic will say, because the amount of fees turned out to be small and reaching of the soft cap is still far away. Indeed, the amount was very modest.  Why?  Beforehand FLOGmall team decided that we will not create mass activity and flooded traffic until the start of the ICO.  That is because of the fact that at the stage of pre-ICO we already faced a hacking situation of the personal account and problems with the working process of the website. Because of it, all the activity that we created for months has gone.  We are able to put two and two together and learn through errors!  By the way, our hedge funds and investors think also so, saying that first we will just “pass through this day” and make sure that everything works correctly, and after that we will make great transactions.  Of course, before the ICO, we made a lot of security audits, we thoroughly reorganized our personal accounts and made a number of tests. However, the ""combat mode"" is always on as the best way of security, so today's day can be considered as the day of ""breaking-in"" the whole system.  For those who have already purchased tokens: we express you a special respect from our team and thank you for the trust!  ICO stage will last until June 26 and now, when we are sure that everything is working correctly - we can move into the stage of active PR and advertising.  We remind that during the first days of the start of ICO, there are special bonuses for you up to + 25% to your deposit.

Therefore, make your tea, open medium and… enjoy your reading!  Greetings, ladies and gentlemen! We have already started to introduce new altcoins, located at the site, when suddenly it turned out that you don’t know even the old ones. To avoid a lot of questions, let’s devote today to analysis of “inhabitants” of the alpha version of our site. There are six heroes in the TV series “Friends“, and FLOGmall has even senenteen friends-altcoins. Therefore, make your tea, open Telegraph and… enjoy your reading! You are all already here experienced cryptousers, so we sincerely hope that such giants as Ethereum and Bitcoin do not need to be presented. You all know about Buterin and Satoshi, these names sound from almost every Chinese alarm clock. Their younger brothers Ethereum Classic and Bitcoin Cash live on our site. ETC is the same blockchain platform for developing decentralized applications based on open source smart contracts. Just remember that ETC is the fifth largest crypt in the world, and that’s enough. Bitcoin Cash is a Bitcoin fork. Another Bitcoin Fork is Litecoin. Peer-to-peer electronic payment system, the fourth largest cryptocurrency by the value of the total cost. Greetings to Monero. Cryptocurrency based on the CryptoNote Protocol, designed to maximize anonymization of your transactions. It’s another fork, but already from Bytecoin, which came to this world in 2014. Such a thirst for anonymity gave rise to accusations of Monero in “aiding” the trade in drugs, weapons and pornography. In General, the dark side, and all that. But this is only the tales of Sherwood forest, while the popularity of Monero is growing. By the way, our second charity project — Real.help likes to mine this crypto. Another diarie from the TOP10 popular cryptocurrency is Dash. It is an open decentralized payment system, also is a fan of the anonymous transactions mechanism. There is no central management, emission occurs on mining. IOTA is a new open source distributed register that does not use a blockchain. IOTA transactions are free regardless of their size, transaction confirmation time is small, the number of transactions processed at the same time is not limited, and the system is easy to scale. And it’s a real miracle, friends. NEO and the company Antshares behind it, is the first blockchain party in China. It combines traditional mechanisms with the digital economy, calling it a kind of smart economy. It manages intellectual assets by using the blockchain, and indeed for a long time already takes pride of place in the TOP10. Another participant in the TOP10 of the world ranking of the world’s celebrities crypts — Ripple. It was launched in 2012 and reached the mark of only $0.8. The Protocol supports tokens, commodities, or other items such as frequent flyer miles or mobile minutes. It’s decentralized and it operates without the participation of Ripple company, all kinds of banks and other divine intervention. Ripple fork — Stellar is also conveniently located in the payment methods on our platform. It is a real-time currency trading platform supported by the Stellar Development Foundation, a non-profit non-stock fund. Come on, let’s find out about the little-known. Which you will not find in Wikipedia, and learn only from us. Hello, Cardano. Again, a decentralized platform that provides integrated programmable value transfer. It dreams to create decentralized applications and contracts in an inexpensive and painless way. Written in a highly protected language Haskell, if that’s what it says to you. EOS — a new architecture of blockchain, designed vertically and horizontally, along and across to scale decentralized applications. Million transactions per second and the solution of problems of excessive traffic? Yes, it’s here. What do you know about the Throne? It’s no longer a sci-Fi movie, it’s a blockchain Protocol to create an entertainment system around the world with free content. Well, finally, someone smart enough to earn on mems and funny youtube videos! The first Tron app has already appealed more than 10 million users. The first company, that have created a platform for using the traditional currency as Bitcoin — Tether. Their crypt has no centralized issuer and can be available for issue to everyone. Using digital equivalents of real currencies, Tether ensures the stability of quotations. The tether platform currently uses virtual analogues of the Euro and the us dollar (for example, 1 us dollar — 1 USDT). NEM — new economy movement — cryptocurrency written in Java and JavaScript. NEM is special, it forms a blockchain with the use of an importance proof algorithm. Look, your right to form a block is affected by three components: the balance of the wallet, the activity of the account (the number of transactions) and the time of the account on the network. This is a completely new platform.Check it out! You have already read about our partners Viuly and ColossusXT in another posts. But we have some other old friends that we have wrongly kept silent about. It’s KickICO. Their platform was founded with the purpose of carrying out activities for the collective fund raising for the benefit of the realization of human ideas. By using the site KickICO now anyone can create a campaign for the ICO. Do you want your own token? It will take a couple of minutes with KickICO. Well, are you tired of discussing the ideas of decentralization of the economy, democratization of Finance, freedom, equality and brotherhood? Let’s take a break for the weekend, and we will continue from Monday with a brand new Altcoins, “inhabiting” the FLOGmall platform.",False

What`s the connection between Bitmain, FLOGmall and Wall Street? Good news! If you feel like you are miner, join us here as soon as possible! Because the official store FLOGmall received a big batch of ASIC from the company Bitmain. This company is the largest manufacturer of mining equipment from China. To make for you everything clear, they have already signed the agreement about the location of the mining firm in Washington and they say the whole Wall Street is already nervously talking about it everywhere even in couloir (French “corridor”).  Now you can buy any Bitmain`s equipment in the official FLOGmall store with any crypto currency from the payment list. Think about it. It’s possible to buy the device that gains crypto also with crypto. It’s almost like buying 100$ with Olympic symbols for 150, but in case with crypto it’s even profitable. This investment won`t demand extra money, vice versa it will produce additional profit. It`s like your children after eighteen. FLOGmall takes care about the transportation of your goods on the territory of the whole Russian Federation and CIS countries. By the way, this is what our Cargo 677 does, that inner nature you could know because of the video in the previous post. No longer you need to contact the manufacturer directly, we will bear all the difficulties of negotiations for you. Next step — we control quality of the goods, pack your order, ship and deliver it directly to your hands. In general, we provide full assistance of the goods during the transportation without unnecessary talks and problems. At the present moment our team deals with expanding the list of equipment for mining. In case you did not find the necessary provision or for example you want to mine only on Antminer X3, and on others it`s not allowed for you because of the religion, just tell your wishes to our specialist. Don`t be shy. In alpha-version of FLOGmall you can find feedback form and send a letter with your request. So, are you ready to begin your own marvelous experience in mining with the help of FLOGmall? *mining — is the processing of transactions, in the digital currency system; process which extracts value from Bitcoin",False

New collaborations!    The society is slowly moving to blockchain technology, because it is fast, convenient, and everyone likes the idea of decentralization. If you monitor the rapidly developing world of cryptocurrency or if you are even ready to roll up a small blockchain revolution with us, you will definitely appreciate the information below. So, our new partners – a young platform Viuly, but which has already blown up its audience. They position themselves as a decentralized video platform based on blockchain technology. And yet it is possible to earn some money, because their ICO has already passed. Not bad, huh?  What is decentralization and outright revolutionary of Viuly? Here,let’s take, for example, YouTube. All uploaded videos on YouTube are stored on Google's servers, that is, all uploaded material is under the control of a certain group of people. And if Petru from Google doesn't like the video with your dog, it will be removed immediately at his discretion.. Viuly developers claim that videos uploaded to their platform will be stored on the servers of millions of people. And it’s up to the users to decide which video to block and which not to block.  Another plus is that there is no barrier between the advertiser and the author: neither language nor financial. It is rumored that the advertiser will no longer overpay, and the author of the video will not give 60-70% of the income to the creators of the platform. It’s about decentralization.  Now, what is the essence of our friendship? You have been asking question for a long, what are the strengths of FLOGmall and the fundamental difference from other e-commerce platforms.Exactly! It’s stores in a unique format of a Livestore. Viuly kindly provides the opportunity to host videos of our users on their territory. Now all our video stores will be stored and placed under the leadership of our new partners. Also, we have agreed with Viuly on a new format of video sales, which will allow you to buy products with FLOGmall directly from the video on Viuly. The functionality and working version of our technical integration can be seen in the coming weeks and each of you will be able to go to FLOGmall in order to create your own video store.  And, as you might guess, the Viuly token has already been added to the alpha version of our site, and if You are the lucky holder, you will discover a marvelous new world of goods for your favorite cryptocurrency.  Isn't that a miracle, friends?  Read more about our next collaborations (and they are already >45, for a second) You will learn from our everyday posts. Stay in touch, what suddenly Your favorite token will also soon appear in the ranks of FLOGmall?",False

For customers:  1.Exchange of cryptocurrency for First Marketed Consumer Goods (FMCG) and Services on our Platform FMCG - a variety of electronics, household appliances, clothing and everything that every person needs every day. We used to buy these goods in regular online stores and retail chains.  Among services it is planned to launch such areas as real estate (rent, sale), digital-marketing, financial services and so on.  2.Access to goods and services from around the world Our platform serves as a single aggregator of a large number of sellers and stores from around the world. This will save a significant part of the funds on purchases, as the seller will sell the product or service directly to the customer, bypassing intermediaries that are large retail chains, as well as aggregators of various services, including financial institutions and payment systems.  3.Transparent and safe purchases FLOGmall offers the customer a fundamentally new look at faceless online stores and e-commerce sites with thousands of sellers.  Each customer repeatedly encountered the fact that when viewing the catalog of goods/services on the site, he/she cannot get a real idea of the store/seller. We see pages of absolutely identical images and descriptions for the same goods.  With online purchases, in most cases, we cannot go to the seller on another continent to see the goods live or evaluate the service offered in person. Many purchases have to be done almost with your eyes closed. Of course, the issue of trust in the seller at the time of purchase has always been and will be relevant.  Thanks to the unique format, FLOGmall allows to follow the assortment and events of the store, and crucially - to make sure clearly that the seller really exists and it is exactly who claims to be.  The e-commerce industry and video blogging has been going hand in hand for many years. Now both these industries are used on a single site. The era of impersonal online stores with gray catalogs is a thing of the past, they are being replaced by live stores with real people.  4.Payment by any altcoins Imagine the following situation: the buyer has traded on cryptocurrency exchange for a long time. As a result, he has left a certain amount of cryptoassets, which are not the most demanded. Cryptoasset does not move on the exchange and remains unused by the buyer. Or, for example, the investor has participated in many other ICOs, purchased their coins, but the issued tokens have not gained or gained insufficient cost at the moment.  On the other hand, there is a seller who is not against selling his/her product/service with this particular cryptoasset. Thanks to flexible FLOGmall filters, the customer easily finds such a seller. As a result, the customer solves the problem of selling the ""hung"" cryptoasset, and the seller gets a profit in the cryptoassets that he/she chooses himself/herself.  5.Fair information on each seller Smart contract with a secure transaction fixes the interaction of the seller and the customer, so only the person who made the purchase, would be able to leave feedback about the goods.  The rating system allows you to evaluate the store on the basis of real statistics on 4 key indicators (the delivery time of the goods, the correspondence of the goods/ service description on the site to the obligations fulfilled, the price of the goods, the friendliness of the seller when communicating with the customer).  6.Real, detailed responses on each of the products If the customer wants to purchase a particular product, then when viewing the product card the system will automatically show all the video reviews and responses on it on the site. And since a review or a response can only be made by a real customer, then such information can be trusted.  7.Cashback and discounts for internal cryptocurrency The FLOGmall site provides customers with increased cashback when paying Mallcoin tokens, as well as the opportunity to receive discounts when purchasing goods for Mallcoin.  8.Secure purchases using a smart contract Listing the fee, the customer can be sure that it will go to the account of the seller only if the goods reach the destination point. As soon as the seller sends the goods, the customer receives a track code to track the shipment and can at any time see at which stage of delivery his/her order is.  Based on the executed smart contract, the site automatically transfers funds to the seller's account only after the customer confirms the receipt of the goods and its proper quality. Otherwise, arbitration on this transaction will be opened.  In this case, the customer will be motivated to close the transaction due to the fact that he will receive an additional bonus in the form of Mallcoin tokens and rating as a user of the site.  9.Simple navigation on offers of sellers The site provides convenience of searching and studying the product range. The catalog of products on FLOGmall is equipped with filters and division into categories, which makes the search effective for the customer.  10.Convenient display of prices with reference to Fiat/Cryptocurrency Sometimes it is difficult for a customer to assess how profitable to buy a particular product/service in foreign currency. It is even more difficult to calculate the benefits in cryptoassets, the volatility of which is much higher than that of fiat money.  FLOGmall displays the prices in the selected cryptocurrencies with their equivalent in US dollars, which is most convenient for the majority of customers to perceive.  11.Purchase of goods/services with cryptocurrency WITHOUT participation and commission of the site If the customer makes a purchase from a seller who has collected enough positive responses and estimates, he/she can with minimal risk make payment directly, without the Secure Transaction and the guarantor from our site. Thus, the site does not impose its services on customers and always offers an alternative.  12.Sellers Moderation At FLOGmall, bona fide sellers are placed, who undergo an internal moderation before the publication of goods and services.  13.Multilingual communication FLOGmall offers tools for effective communication between customers and sellers. Built-in online translator, integrated with Google Translate, allows you to negotiate the purchase of goods/services in a multi-language format, without going beyond the platform.  The user and seller can communicate with each other in their own languages, and FLOGmall will automatically translate their correspondence, making it understandable.  14.The role of the community in the development of FLOGmall FLOGmall allows ordinary customers to participate directly in the life of the project. Customers can vote for their favorite sellers, record detailed responses and earn on it, thanks to the contests.",False

The contributions of each participant are summed, and therefore the main criterion in the selection of the winner will be the sum of purchased tokens MLC by its referrals. So, prizes:  The first place and a cool electric scooter HX. And it does not matter where you will ride it - along cobbled European streets or in Russian remote Siberia, you will enjoy this win absolutely.  Second place - Apple AirPods. Yes, yes, the ones that are wireless, which will not get tangled in your pocket.  Third - a backpack XD Design 15.6 Click. Laptop for work? Grandmother's pies? 13 homeless kittens? This backpack will fit everything.  The results of the competition will be announced within 10 days after the end of the ICO. The notification of the results will come via a general mailing list, and, of course, will be published in all official communication channels.  Why are you still watching how the scooter drives beside you? Do not miss your chance, put a tick in the calendar, hang a reminder on the mirror in the bathroom, and ...  Stay with FLOGmall!",False

By the way, the company has been operating in the Asian market since 2005, and their methods work!  A closed meeting with a cocktail party, a section of business knowledge, meetings with VIP investors, non-stop pitching and even first cryptocurrency ATMs (which you did not really see) was held from 6 to 8 April in Hong Kong.  The official partners of the event were IbdI, an organization that unites the associations of the blockchain community , Genesis Block - crypto-enthusiasts, with a global mission: to bring cryptocurrencies and blockchain to the masses, Startup Grind is a global startup community created with the support of GOOGLE for training, encouragement and communication of entrepreneurs, The Bitcoin Association Hong Kong are those who support the bitcoin enthusiast communities for the further advancement of their technologies.  In these two days members of our team – Maxim Teleshev, Alexei Belov and Hermogenes Korolev presented the project to a narrow circle of interested audience, revealed to us the secrets of product promotion in the Asian stock market from leading experts and have institutionalized the practice of intercultural communication. Pitch was a great success, investors showed interest, asked questions, took contacts and promised to support the project. This trip gave us another interesting experience that has already grown into quite a specific negotiation. FLOGmall acquires new supporters and gain more hearts.  In the near future, on April 16, our team will be in Dubai at another global meeting.

Then read the text below as closely as possible, because it is with its help you can earn cryptocurrency without overstretching any of the muscles of your body.  To begin with, what is airdrop. This is a free distribution of tokens to absolutely everyone for a very simple algorithm of actions. Usually, the company that distributes free coins by airdrop will not ask you for a long testing of bugs, nor the translation of whitepaper into seven languages of the world, nor thinking about the design, advertising in their own social networks. Nothing that can make you cry from exhaustion like Kim Kardashian.  No need to learn complex spells, search unicorn horn or carry the ring to Mordor. All you have to do is to create a crypto-wallet. In order not to suffer with the choice of the desired cryptocurrency, the transition to its official page and registration of the wallet there, we can go the path of least resistance. Take MyEtherWallet (MEW) - one thing, and create an account there. Converting from the stock exchange in MEW any number of Ether and waiting drops. There are other blockchain platforms that deal with the same algorithm, but MEW is the most popular web wallet that supports most tokens.  By the way, FLOGmall has already held its airdrop-campaign and, it is said, its members have already caused violent flows of friends' envy, because already at the end of the ICO they will have the n-th number of our tokens and half-kingdoms in addition.  Method number two. A bit more complicated, but from this - no less pleasant. It is necessary to sweat a little:  adjust the internal compass on search of free distributions and bonuses.  Many companies in the course of advertising strategies arrange massive free distribution of coins. Mother Teresa-style way to tell about the project to a wide range of users. Most cryptocurrency startups have a marketing budget (seriously?!) and free distribution of tokens is one of the popular ways to spend it. If you hang in our telegram for a long time, you already know that FLOGmall allocates 75% of its budget to carry its idea to the masses. And our users who have logged onto the stage of pre-ICO can already see the bonus tokens in their accounts, to go there day and night, to admire and show others. All you had to do was to register on the site, deposit any amount in Ether, let it be your favorite number, mom's birthday, or the number of posts of your president, and wait. Someone additionally asks for a subscription to communication channels, such as Facebook, twitter, instagram, but you already know that FLOGmall was born to make life as easy as possible for its users.  The third way, the final one. You perform simple tasks, but it is worth noting that you receive insignificant money for this. There are a number of projects that are ready to pay you small amounts in a crypto currency equivalent for a number of simple actions: viewing advertisements, performing tasks, like posting about project on personal social networks and even playing games. You can play dice, casino, play solitaire, watch commercials at least for days, and you will get tokens for this. That's all, friends. Now you have several magical ways to try to earn a couple of tokens. Sleight of hand and no fraud!  So, and why are you still sitting in the telegraph?",False

One of the key advantages and differences of FLOGmall's ICO from any other ICOs is the built-in automatic exchange of tokens, that is called ATES (Automatic token exchange service), FLOGmall to another cryptocurrency.  The functionality of this service is partially similar to the internal service of mutual obligations. At the same time, it is an automatic mechanism for exchanging tokens between holders without participation of the site. Automatic exchange of tokens occurs for the performance of a useful action on the site.  When buying FLOGmall tokens at the pre-ICO or ICO stages, a user who wants to become a token holder receives a significant discount on token purchase. The platform sets the official rate for the sale of MLC tokens on the automatic token exchange service (hereafter ATES) equal to 1/1000 ETH, which is higher than the selling of MLC tokens on the pre-ICO and ICO stages.  After launching the site, the token holder gains access to ATES At ATES, he/she can exchange his/her tokens purchased at the ICO stages to sellers and other users who purchase site services. At ATES, he can exchange his tokens purchased at the ICO stages both with sellers and other users who purchase site services. Thus, from the very first day of FLOGmall operation and ATES operation, users get the opportunity to exchange their MLC tokens with other users.",False

We dismantle the scam: stay there.    According to the dictionary ""scam"" is a deception, a fraud. We make a note that it's not good to deceive people.  After getting acquainted with this article, you will learn how to recognize a certain scam out of a thousand cases.  We begin with an introductory tour. Did you watch the film Ocean's Eleven? Most of the scams are so clumsy that they do not even closely resemble the sophisticated machinations of Ocean and his guys. All the scams can be divided into two unequal types. The first type is subjective - it is the most common, unoriginal fraud, when someone collects your money via the distribution of loud promises about the myriad wealth, the house in the Maldives and the gold of the gnomes in the attic, he buys this house to himself, and next day he is out the reach and the border country of your residence.  There are the objective scams also. When the project is like an immature teenager: small, complex and does not think about his actions, and the team, which is working on it, cannot find a common language and, instead of looking for a specialist, it punishes him immediately. Objectively, it is a failure; no money will pull them out of the dug hole. But who cares about objectivity, when money is burnt?  Unfortunately, there are more and more projects like that in the industry nowadays.  Let’s discuss the structure of subjective scams, and how they can threaten Let's take a look at the examples of subjective scams.  1. Christopher Columbus was discovering America alone, so he did not have a problem, which we will discuss further. If the project has three or more founders, then the common language is more difficult, and sometimes it happens that one of the comrades says his loud ""It’s OK this way!"". He folds his hands in pockets and legs on the table and stops working at all. The same thing was with one ICO project of social network on the blockchain, one of the founders just disappeared in an unknown direction even before the network was completed.  2. The second rule is ""do not take the dirty linen out of the hut."" The quarrel ruined ICO: in 2017, the Tezos service died in such a way. The investors of the project filed the complaints due to the fact that the founders could not divide the assets among themselves. Was it the intent to cheat - it is a controversial issue, but in any case, it plunged the project into an intermediate state between the subjective and objective scam. And all the same, the innocent investors suffer from that.  3. The sense of humor of the founders often also makes a profit, even if the humor is black. It was possible to collect up to 1 000 000 dollars for ICO project Piramidum and a number of other ICO-jokers, who initially stated: love me for who I am, I cannot promise anything and I will not do anything either. But black PR is also a PR, people liked it and the pump reached the unprecedented heights.  This is all a subjective scum, when the founders have a clear intention to deceive you but there is no conscience. And now we are going to discuss the objective scam and a couple of secrets of his identification  The objective scam is much more difficult to recognize, it requires special skills, analytical mindset and the willingness to spend a lot of time to study the problem.  We would recommend a number of simple techniques we find effective, so that the range of accidents should be narrowed to the minimum:  1. Study the methodology of A. Pavlyut on the evaluation of WP: in fact, it means that the White Paper should simply and easily expose the project. If the creators twist idioms as they want - blow the horn! There is clearly something wrong here. The exceptions, such as ICO Telegram or Filecoin will always be, but they are exceptions.  2. Focus on the team's experience. In most cases, the team that gathered only under the ICO and does not have experience in real business for 3-5, or better - even more - years - it is the story without a happy ending. Do not believe me? Look at e-commerce projects in Russia or even some of the dotcoms in the early 2000s in the US, and everything will fall into place.  3. And most importantly: estimate the level of involvement of team members in the project. For example, if a project is about the implementation of a new technology in blockchain, and it is headed by the project lawyer and three more workers specialized in humanities, a reasonable question arises. And vice versa, when the project is technically simple, but overcomplicated with economical and financial concepts, IT professionals team is not a good choice.  The described things could be considered simple, but all together they create the foundation, on which you can build your own financial well-being and critical thinking towards the ICO projects.  Friends, tomorrow we will move from theory to practice. Stay in touch, we will analyze the concrete examples of the scam on your fingers, think together how this could be avoided, and get a little homework to determine the inner world of one of the last scam.

Investor's benefits:       1.The increase in the token value after the launch of the site      One of the key advantages and differences of FLOGmall ICO from any other ICO is mathematically justified possible benefit, calculated by means of the built-in FLOGmall ATES (Automatic token exchange service) to another cryptocurrency.

Automatic token exchange occurs for the performance of a useful action on the site. When purchasing FLOGmall tokens in pre-ICO or ICO stages, a user who wants to become a token holder receives a substantial discount on their purchase. After the main ICO, the site launches the process of its monetization through the provision of additional services and functionality. The site undertakes to ensure that the token rate on the automatic token exchange service (hereafter ATES) will be higher than the rate that was in the pre-ICO and ICO stages.     After launching the site, the token holder accesses to ATES. At ATES, he/she can exchange his/her tokens purchased at the ICO stages to sellers and other users who purchase site services. Thus, from the very first day of work, FLOGmall shares the proceeds of the site with the holders of the tokens. Also, the holder can realize purchased tokens to any user who sees the growth prospects for the token due to the closest placement of the token on the exchange.         2.Mallcoin token release to exchanges      3.Hedging the risks      The hedging on FLOGmall is that the artificial creation and retention of the minimum value of the official token exchange rate equal to 0.001 Ethereum or 0.3$ (calculated as the fiat equivalent value) creates a minimum conditional capitalization of the tokens and maintains this rate at a given level. This, in turn, gives confidence in the sale of tokens in the area of this value in an indefinite period of time (even with small volumes of trading on this token).      4.Discount up to 80% on site services      If you have been thinking for a long time and considering FLOGmall as a trading platform as a professional seller, then becoming a holder of tokens for pre-ICO and ICO, you get a discount of up to 80% on the services of the site immediately after its launch. If you are considering FLOGmall from the point of view of an ordinary customer, then becoming a holder of tokens for pre-ICO and ICO, you get the opportunity to exchange tokens for goods with the benefit of up to 80%.",False

FLOGmall to you with new victories    A two-week forum, Cryptonomics Capital, in Moscow ended on March 28. And our co-founder, Maxim Teleshev, returned home from it.  Cryptonomics Capital is a large investment fund, which gathered thousands of investors and presented hundreds of products. And this is exactly this exclusive product line that makes different this rapidly growing start-up. Specialization - almighty cryptocurrency and incendiary ICO, naturally.  Our task at this forum was not only to show the goods itself, but also to make useful acquaintances, join the party, and go to the intelligence service in the capital's cryptopolis.  And this is exactly this particular forum where we got to know the famous actor and philanthropist, Konstantin Khabensky. The only one who broke through the barricades of those wishing to get acquainted with the projects, two-meter guards and another small door of the black entrance, was our Maxim Teleshev. I took a breath, discussed our second charitable project real.help, showed in details the strengths and advantage of technologies and handed over all the documents.  For closer acquaintance.  Also, we got in touch and talked with the head of the Cryptonomics Foundation, the host who mentioning it? Because if FLOGmall is already a growing almost independent child, then real.help is still a baby that it desperately needs attention. Through interaction with the cryptocurrency fund, we will be able to reach the right media channels, which will be able to share the big deal to the world, which means that even more children will be able to get all help they deserve from our project.  They did not ignore FLOGmall, boasted how successfully we completed the pre-ICO, which was very interesting to the head of the Cryptonomics fund. Decent end of the party is what? That's right, the exchange of contacts. We did not avoid this rule and have already contacted the fund, sent all the necessary documents, and, perhaps very soon, you will learn about another interesting collaboration.  But it's not so easy to stop the founder of international e-commerce, who has already begun to enjoy a taste of Moscow's crypto parties. A new day is a new forum. On March 29, we were waiting for #Decenter Cryptoevent Moscow 2018, and it was completed for our project as fruitfully as possible. Almost like the annual harvest of potatoes in Belarus, but this is not accurate. The forum provided us with the acquaintance of the owner of one known exchange, Dmitry (for objective reasons at the moment we can not disclose the secret of the last name and indicate the specific name of its exchange), while the recent conference in the warm city of Sochi brought us together with another host of the exchange - Michael. And now, right now, at the moment we are negotiating the placement of branded stores selling goods with cryptocurrency.  These are all news, friends. Upcoming conference in Hong Kong, Dubai and a secret closed presentation (for a secret club of cryptic fans) of our real.help and FLOGmall projects  in the Confederation Tower in the capital.  We can not disclose all our secrets to you in one day, so we will issue them in a dosage. Stay in touch with FLOGmall!",False

About blockchain:  1. Fair information on each seller Smart contract with a secure transaction fixes the interaction of the seller and the customer, so only the person who made the purchase, would be able to leave feedback about the goods. The rating system allows you to evaluate the store on the basis of real statistics on 4 key indicators (the delivery time of the goods, the correspondence of the goods/ service description on the site to the obligations fulfilled, the price of the goods, the friendliness of the seller when communicating with the customer).  2. Secure purchases using a smart contract Listing the fee, the customer can be sure that it will go to the account of the seller only if the goods reach the destination point. As soon as the seller sends the goods, the customer receives a track code to track the shipment and can at any time see at which stage of delivery his/her order is. Based on the executed smart contract, the site automatically transfers funds to the seller's account only after the customer confirms the receipt of the goods and its proper quality. Otherwise, arbitration on this transaction will be opened. In this case, the customer will be motivated to close the transaction due to the fact that he will receive an additional bonus in the form of Mallcoin tokens and rating as a user of the site.  About our token: Mallcoin - cryptocurrency, which can be exclusively paid in the FLOGmall platform. This token will be used as the payment unit for all transactions in the FLOGmall system and as a basis for interacting with other digital services.  Some points about our token:  1. Cashback and discounts for tokens. The FLOGmall site provides customers with increased cashback when paying Mallcoin tokens, as well as the opportunity to receive discounts when purchasing goods for Mallcoin.  2. A range of additional services for professionals. The seller has the opportunity to purchase additional services on a fee basis for tokens mallcoin.

Choose your favorite one!    How to protect the relationship between the buyer and the seller, what happens after the buyer sends the goods to the cart and pays for it? Who deals with the development of your transaction, and what protect the goods from unknown forces while en route? Let's figure out!  In order to elaborate all possible scenarios, we have created four possible interactions. Situation one - ""impending threat"". The buyer purchases the goods through a free private ad, unprotected by the ""Safe Transaction"" option. In this case, the buyer must independently weigh all risks, carefully come down to the choice of the seller and accept the fact that in this case, FLOGmall is not responsible for accidentally arising consequences.  The goods are paid according to requisites specified by the seller. You can choose the seller according to the platform rating  (this is the date of registration, the number of completed sales, the seller's review). FLOGmall enables any seller go through an identification process by the KYC procedure.It's voluntary, but if you are interested in increasing the level of credibility and bringing your relationship to a new level, we advise you to meet “face-to-face for an interview”.  All communication between the seller and the buyer are carried out privately, through the users accounts. It should be noted that if the seller receives complaints from customers, the platform retains the right to decide to block a particular seller.  Pattern two is ""Traditional"".  Here everything is the same, only with the use of the ""Safe Transaction"". In this case the purchase of goods can be completed only with MLC tokens, since they provide you with the right to protect your transaction. It is simple to conduct: using our famous ATES or buying tokens at the official exchange rate of the site.  The seller receives a notification that confirms the order is paid and to send the goods. As soon as the consumer receives the goods, the system receives a notification that the transaction is successfully completed , and both parties are satisfied. And only then the payment for the purchase goes to the user account of the seller.  In the future, the seller can exchange the MLC for any desired cryptocurrency available on ATES or exchange MLC on various crypto exchanges. Also MLC can be used as a means of payment for various services on the platform, advertising, for example. If we draw an analogy from the fiat world, this pattern is similar to purchasing goods on the eBay, using the PayPal payment system.  With a  use of ""Safe Transaction"", FLOGmall retains a commission of 2 to 5% from the buyer.  Pattern three and four - ""special."" The partners of this transaction have changed: the buyer is an online store.  What will happen if the buyer's needs are not satisfied, he will not receive his goods, or his expectations will not meet the reality? In this case, the platform acts as an Arbitrator in the manual mode for each transaction. After the opening of the dispute at the site, the moderators receive an appropriate notification and are included in the process of resolving the conflict situation.  To do this they need to understand the situation better, collecting detailed information about the received goods, methods of shipping, and even provide a tracking number for the goods. The moderators will help set the record straight, deciding which party is to blame. We understand that a certain percentage of fraud from the total number of transactions from buyers is inevitable, with the entire industry. To compensate such operations, a budget will be determined from the general fund for the ""Safe Transaction"".  You can choose any interaction, but who will protect your transaction better than FLOGmall?",False

Not only because they see the highest evaluation mark from the adviser named Kovalenko Anna Vladimirovna, but also because they are finally getting to know our token from all possible sides. Leaving no secrets between them.  Today, once again, we delve a little deeper into the economics of our token (if you are intrigued, but time, religion or calluses on your fingers do not allow you to flip through the White Paper). If you are new to our site and do not yet know what kind of merit triggered fate to brought you to our site,we will share the main bits in a nutshell.  FLOGmall provides an open source cryptographic token - Mallcoin. Mallcoin is the same full-fledged cryptocurrency as Bitcoin, Ethereum, litecoin and other coins, and they can be used as a means of payment immediately inside the FLOGmall platform.  Our token has a limited issue (250,000,000 MLC), is not exposed to inflation, weather, or psychological stress. Soon we plan to let our token grow into adulthood graduating to cryptocurrency exchanges, but while it is still living with his parents he must report all of his movements.  Why is our token so beloved by thousands of people? The most important thing FLOGmall offers to its investors is a completely new way of positive cooperation: All revenue of the project will be fully sent to ICO Mallcoin holders starting from the first day of the site functioning..  Additionally, we hold an ace up our sleeve,ATES our built-in automatic tokens exchange service. Our long term subscribers feel butterflies in their stomach once ATES is mentioned. A simple and transparent system with an internal token rate and a clear algorithm of tokens sales between sellers and buyers of the site. Nixing the necessity of using various crypto exchanges ATES allows the possibility to purchase tokens directly from the site.  The distribution of the total mass of token is fairly simple. 10% are taken by the team, 7% by the highly respected bounty participants, 9% by the reserve fund (everything for the smooth platform operation), and the rest 74% goes to our numerous ICO participants.  The FLOGmall team's tokens are blocked for 2 years with four six-month periods of usage restriction. The tokens of the advisers and the persons who rendered feasible assistance to the site in the early stages for six months.  A short three month period is given to Bounty participants. The reserve fund tokens are partially blocked. 20% provide a reliable home front to the site and can not be blocked. The remaining 80% will be distributed on the international market from May 2019, with the purpose of attracting new hungry people looking to spend a little crypto.  Also, 2,500,000 MLC will be allocated to our second charity project on the basis of Real.help blockchain.This particular number of tokens will allow maintenance of the site for 8 years and be sure that, in any twist of fate, assistance will be rendered to those in need of help. In this case, tokens are subject to gradual defrosting, on average - 1% of the total fund per month.  All other tokens are not frozen and remain fresh waiting for the new owners.  When it comes to our platform, the creation, issuing or mining of tokens after the end of the ICO period is not provided. You can transfer tokens at the end of the ICO period, but can you part away with them after such a close acquaintance?  Mallcoin has a strict binding to Ethereum, and these two have a keen connection, almost like Hachiko and the professor. Therefore, depending on the Ethereum rate change, MLC token  automatically changes accordingly . Now, at the bottom you can carefully review our table. There are all rates are displayed in $ USD for your convenience.    Now it is clear for you! Right ? With each subsequent stage of sale, the value of Mallcoin will increase. The maximum possible benefit of 600% has gone to the early preSale investors.  A possible earnings of 300% is achieved by purchasing Mallcoin tokens in the pre-ICO stage.  Bonuses of 200% can be obtained through the acquisition of Mallcoin at the ICO stage, when the bulk of the tokens will be sold. It is important to note that the Mallcoin tokens will not have additional emissions afterwards. And all unsold tokens will be destroyed.  Do not let a small but promising token die out! Go to the official website and support Mallcoin right now. FLOGmall will make it worthwhile.  Two commandments from the White Paper say: ""If the minimum goal is not achieved,all collected funds will be returned to the participants."" And ""immediately stop the ICO after the implementation of all the tokens allocated to the participants at all stages!"". So it goes, friends. We hope that we have uncovered the biography of Mallcoin from all sides, and you will no longer have questions about his childhood, adolescence or youth.  If you still have any questions, ask them in any convenient instant messengers, and we will happily chat with you about the anatomy of the crypto industry!",False

Investor's benefits:       1.The increase in the token value after the launch of the site      One of the key advantages and differences of FLOGmall ICO from any other ICO is mathematically justified possible benefit, calculated by means of the built-in FLOGmall ATES (Automatic token exchange service) to another cryptocurrency.  The functionality of this service is partially similar to the internal service of mutual obligations. At the same time, it is an automatic mechanism for exchanging tokens between holders without participation of the site. Automatic token exchange occurs for the performance of a useful action on the site. When purchasing FLOGmall tokens in pre-ICO or ICO stages, a user who wants to become a token holder receives a substantial discount on their purchase. After the main ICO, the site launches the process of its monetization through the provision of additional services and functionality. The site undertakes to ensure that the token rate on the automatic token exchange service (hereafter ATES) will be higher than the rate that was in the pre-ICO and ICO stages.     After launching the site, the token holder accesses to ATES. At ATES, he/she can exchange his/her tokens purchased at the ICO stages to sellers and other users who purchase site services. Thus, from the very first day of work, FLOGmall shares the proceeds of the site with the holders of the tokens. Also, the holder can realize purchased tokens to any user who sees the growth prospects for the token due to the closest placement of the token on the exchange.         2.Mallcoin token release to exchanges      3.Hedging the risks      The hedging on FLOGmall is that the artificial creation and retention of the minimum value of the official token exchange rate equal to 0.001 Ethereum or 0.3$ (calculated as the fiat equivalent value) creates a minimum conditional capitalization of the tokens and maintains this rate at a given level. This, in turn, gives confidence in the sale of tokens in the area of this value in an indefinite period of time (even with small volumes of trading on this token).      4.Discount up to 80% on site services      If you have been thinking for a long time and considering FLOGmall as a trading platform as a professional seller, then becoming a holder of tokens for pre-ICO and ICO, you get a discount of up to 80% on the services of the site immediately after its launch. If you are considering FLOGmall from the point of view of an ordinary customer, then becoming a holder of tokens for pre-ICO and ICO, you get the opportunity to exchange tokens for goods with the benefit of up to 80%.",False

Today we will try to figure out what to do if the demand is not proven and what if the site has not yet accumulated 1000 real purchases from 1000 different buyers.  As the saying goes,  the journey of a thousand miles starts with single step. And the way to millions of purchases starts with the first applications. So, following the simple scheme of openness and obvious benefits, we have already received more than a hundred applications for the purchase of goods for cryptocurrency via the FLOGmall platform. And this is not the limit. Why are we so self-confident and proud? Simple because we got an ace up in the sleeve .  Even now we are preparing for collaboration with the KickICO platform , which will allow the lucky owners of Kickcoin to become twice happier, and we will be a thousand times more pleased with ourselves. Spoiler: we are going to announce for them the acquisition of a wide range of products on FLOGmall.  Let us be frank: Kickcoin is not the most popular cryptocurrency because it takes a line somewhere between 200 and 400 Altcoins in the coinmarketcap list. But it's only till it becomes a means of payment on FLOGmall. We promised you to give the movement to the illiquid coins, in order to make them popular, so we do it ! Since we always fulfill our promises. In practice,we are the ones who demonstrate to you the case of selling goods for Altcoins that are not included in the top-10. It's like getting married for love, not out of calculation, and then suddenly get rich quickly, having received an unexpected inheritance from a distant relative ... which, by the way, can also be spent on our marketplace. Whatever one may say, the fate of all of us persistently leads to FLOGmall.  It turns out, in fact, not having a ready-made product, we are already launching the sale of goods on the alpha version for real Altcoins.  But that's not all! We are ahead of the curve, the individuals are keeping up with hundreds and thousands of offers of goods or services . We hear their call on various resources, branches, forums and telegram channels, and we can not simply  pass by.We will not leave our people in trouble.So very soon all these single and dropped, floating around the Internet will be digitized and gathered in a large family of private ads on FLOGmall.

What we can present to you this week: now you and your favorite seller will have a secret of correspondence! To exchange the funny memes is not possible yet, but to communicate in the user account and in relation to the flypage- no problem!  If you are a seller, then prepare to show the goods - personally,in all its glory and advantages to the public. Now you have the right for the presentation photos. You can upload promo pictures of the product from all sides to be sure to win the buyer. Well, or just to show off ...  If you have failed to figure out the methods of payment for a particular seller, now you can relax. We solved this problem and developed  the correct display of the cryptocurrency icons specified by the seller or the store when filling in the profile after the registration as a payment method. That means if your seller can receive from you only Bitcoin or Ethereum , then you will be aware of his wish in terms of all his products. Get ready with various altcoins in your wallet, well, or wait for help from ATES (it will help manage).  No more faceless profiles! Now your happy face will be able to view the entire multimillion audience of FLOGmall (try not to be photographed in the same way as for documents).

Several authors advice on attracting an audience.    In the last post you learned about our personal methods of attracting customers.  Today we would like to add a couple drops of Tabasco to our warmest speech and reveal to you some more secret ways (not without our own experience, naturally). If you suddenly are going to start your site or just are interested in every part of the huge mechanism in the crypto industry.  The first thing that should be done to attract a larger part of a diverse audience is to create an entire list of goods at zero additional charge. This will create positive excitement around the platform and will cause the audience to trust you as Lois Lane to Clark Kent.  Being motivated is always essential. The first commandment of e-commerce is to encourage and reward your stores, thus provoking interest among new users. There is one technique we use to attract ""freak-sellers"",honored by the public for their madness aka dedication. Focus placed on viral advertising always works.  If you already include outstanding people in your work , you should not stop. Bloggers, celebrities, and simply public people will draw attention to your site, like Messi draws people's attention to Lay’s. For example, you can begin to sell your goods on FLOGmall on the auction model in real time, while broadcasting through all public resources and social networks about this event.  Further, when you have set the world ablaze in search of creative promotion of your site, you can safely give yourself a grade ""5"" for admirability and return back to the origins. Google Adwords, ads in national search engines (such as Baidu in China), Instagram (bloggers + targeted advertising via Facebook functionality), Facebook ads, and ads of bloggers on Youtube are provided for your convenience. Who says that new is well overlooked and  old is not effective enough?  Lastly , the countries you are going to have an impact on with all your crypto-fibers. First, outline the range of countries with the maximum loyalty legislation to the cryptocurrency. We rely on China, India, USA, Canada, Japan, Switzerland, Vietnam and South Korea.  That's all the advice, friends. Now you are in a secret circle of insiders and you know as much as we do. But we still aspire to surprise and inspire you in the next post. Do not miss us!",False

How much can the project earn from this turnover with its services? What are the reasons for these conversions?  A long time ago in a distant galaxy, the""Remarkety"" Company has conducted an independent study, which showed everyone, whose hand had ever touched a button to buy on Aliexpress. The number of users, who have ever been associated with online shopping, amounted to 1 billion people. The same study revealed the volume of the world e-commerce market for 2016, it is $ 1.86 trillion.  According to the data of this study, with the help of simple mathematical calculations, crumpled receipts and cotton buds, we built an average amount of purchases per user per year. You will be surprised but you spend around $ 1860. This is the cost of about half the house in the Russian Black Sea outback, where it smells nice of salt and baklava after the fence, and the dolphins can still pay taxes to you.  So, accordingly, the total turnover for 500,000 people will be $ 930 million. And this is only 5% of active holders of cryptocurrency!  Based on the results of the questioning of the crypt holders held by us, with our own strength, with sweat and blood, we had impressive data in our hands. 1486 people took part in an independent study, answering the questions: do you have a cryptocurrency? how you use the crypto currency? would you use the cryptocurrency to buy goods and services on a single site, along with fiat money, if there was such an opportunity? And that's what we managed to get out of this:  36% of people responded positively and voiced unrestrained desire to buy goods and services for cryptocurrency;  9% - answered negatively;  55% - have not yet decided on their crypto appropriateness.  But, like not all Gagarins are the cosmonauts, not every questioning is 100% objective. Taking into account a small unrepresentative sample of respondents, we decided to use only 15% of the actually agreed questionnaires, which amounted to the very 5%.  If you read this text just for the sake of secrecy, how much can the project earn from this, then we have nothing to fear here either. Get double leaves, write down. We identified the same amount in $46.432.542.29 of the annual revenue of FLOGmall (specified in the ""White Paper"" on our website), which requires only 5 of the same percentages that correspond to the regulatory values for the e-commerce market and confirms our previous calculations.  Stay with us and you will learn how to prepare the product promptly and not let the competitors to take it away, how to develop a sustainable advantage and not let it be broken.  And remember, FLOGmall is ready to share even the most terrible of its secrets.",False

This is the retailers’ pressure on customers and large costs of sellers on inefficient marketing campaigns.  The FLOGmall platform is designed to solve both problems, at the same time everyone - both sellers and customers - will benefit.  An individual and transparent approach to the goods and services purchase at attractive prices is possible only in the absence of the retailers and wholesale distributors intermediation. Customers should decide by themselves what goods and services they want to order. The main goal of the FLOGmall platform is to provide customers with the opportunity to choose what they need, rather than what it is profitable for retail chains to sell.  Sellers working with FLOGmall will not need expensive marketing. FLOGmall allows to create easily your own marketing programs to encourage customers directly. Thanks to the new LiveStore format, the seller has the opportunity to present the product in a more qualitative way, to increase the trust index to his own business, to win a loyal audience and, as a result, to increase sales.  The FLOGmall platform mission is to change completely the goods and services market, by using extensive experience, in-depth knowledge, as well as the interest of the largest sellers and ordinary users all around the world.",False

There are some important points for ICO participants (token holders):  - Possible benefits after starting the project with ATES (is an automatic service for exchanging Mallcoin tokens (MLC) between earlier holders and platform users). - Scheduled floatation of Mallcoin token on popular cryptocurrency exchanges. - Hedging of risks (The hedging on FLOGmall is that the artificial creation and retention of the minimum value of the official token exchange rate equal to 0.001 Ethereum or 0.3$ (calculated as the fiat equivalent value) creates a minimum conditional capitalization of the tokens and maintains this rate at a given level) - Benefit up to 80% for site services. You get a discount of up to 80% on the services of the site immediately after its launch.

No, they are not forced, this is not slavery, the fanaticism and true love for their work looks like so.  Our developers have written the basic functionality, they repaired the personal cabinets, in which the users and sellers can live with their baskets, purchases, products, can hide the crypto currency in the wallet and conduct the secret correspondence. You will already be able to purchase the goods of your dreams, the only thing is that while sales are not yet automated, you will write to the seller from our site directly, and he, in his turn, will catch your message on his email. Yes, the purchases are still in manual mode, but they work! It's alive!  But this is a matter of time.

If to speak for statistics, you can connect a premium Netflix account for almost 11 years for $ 946 and watch the ""Black Mirror"" on the repeat without stopping. This is about whom and what does the soul rests with.  On average, an investment of 30000-300000 MLC will give you a profit of up to 22.5%, and a pleasant investment bonus starting at 300,000 MLC will be 25%, which at a minimal price is $ 24,000.
