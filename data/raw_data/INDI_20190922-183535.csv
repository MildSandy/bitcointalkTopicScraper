If the user/personnel has no prior connection with Indicoin, he/she can send in the ideas for improvement and the members of the committee then decide whether or not the idea is viable and can ultimately do some good to society. But if an INDI holder wants a special proposal which would help shape the society better, then it would be listed as any other proposal which can either be upvoted or downvoted. However, to speed things up and make better grasp over the idea the member can induce the ""critical"" option embedded within DApp.  2. Voting is completed as soon as consensus is reached. If a consensus is not reached i.e the community chooses not to vote the proposal will be rejected and no coins will be distributed, There will be various parameters at every stage to earn Indicoins as the reward which includes the importance of the document, voting pattern of users, whether raised under the provided timestamp etc.  3. The date of completion will be decided both by the user and the community. The user will have the opportunity to input a specific period of time according to social proof starting the voting process. After the time is over or a consensus reached whichever earlier, the project will be deemed completed.  4. The execution of any proposal would not be moderated or monitored by any specific person or group because this is a DApp and which works on the transparent voting process. If however, some member notices some discrepancy in voting then he can send his feedback. Senior member will then review the query received. The more your proposals are successfully passed you raise your level.  The community monitors the project execution , The actual proof of work provided by the user will be voted upon by the community . If the community deems the project is appropriate and the evidence substantial then indicoin will be distributed to the user .  5. If the proposed idea/change will be upvoted and funded by the donations of community members. Donations will be accepted and managed for community development programs. Initial funds will be used if DApp needs to be developed and managed over time.  6. First of all, uploaded documents cannot be deleted so it leads to a platform of true facts and figures which are approved by the community and cannot be forged or misused. So, it avoids the condition where one can delete and repost the same proposal over and over again. Along with that, the community members who downvoted the proposal will be rewarded Indicoins. The tokens allocated for that particular proposal will be equally distributed between downvotes. This way the battle corruption that we will come across in executing the selected project tasks would be won, and multiple smart contract and integration would help us to overcome the obstacles that we would come across.   Please spare some time to read our whitepaper if you're still having some query or ask us. We are open to your advice and feedback. Thank you for your interest in Indicoin.Type a message",False

As when people will be rewarded with some thing like indicoin by doing something good towards society then it will motivate people to do good. More and more people will come in it and demand will go up for Indicoin. Let me explain you in detail.  I am a community member. Any Indicoin holder is a community member. I raise a proposal of doing any task which helps in the upliftment of society say for example I am planting a number of trees.  So what I do now is I raise a proposal. The proposal now gets reviewed by other community members. This proof of work is now reviewed by other members of the platform by a transparent and unbiased voting process. The group members will either upvote it or downvote it. Upvote means they are satisfied that I really did it, downvote it if it seems that I did the trick and didn't actually do the job. As a whole, votes will be calculated and if I really did plant the tree I'll be rewarded Indicoins  This is just one example I am illustrating.
