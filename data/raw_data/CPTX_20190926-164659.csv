Most of the ICO's are working in the internet. You can't really see what exactly your money going to. We want to build something in real world. An island where we can do any project that we can. Where we don't need to rely on the prices for electric power or rent.  For example: Tomorow your goverment will bann any mining activity in your country. Or will create somehow a new rules of regulation, that will restricte your activity. But if you will have your mining assets in offshore island you will not worry about such things.  We will put an environment around the mining farms. In future even maybe some kind of appartments for our investors. So you can come and see everything for yourself or even just take a rest there. Or maybe you will make any kind of new project. And you need to gather a team in one place. Why not ?  Completely decentrelized closed infrastructure. Sounds fantastic but everything is actually real. And not so dificult in realisation.  Any more specific questions? Or if you have any proposals? Feel free to ask.",False

This is not real as you do not own and gobern your islands and are subject of any state regulations that may arise, how can you make sure the government will not alter the project timeline and what guarantee you can give to your investors?",False

Yes, you are right to maintain complete autonomy is a—Ç utopia and we do not claim that it is possible. But at the moment we are negotiating with lawyers from three different countries. These countries are either very loyal to the mining as such or are directly interested in investing in crypto-economics. The bottom line is that we plan to start from one island to develop it into the network. And then we will not depend on the legislation of one country. Thank you for your questions.",False
