Edenchain lied about initial circulating supply i.e it was supposed to be 80M tokens but currently circulating supply is at 126M. 2. Edenchain raised more money than the actual claimed 24M HARD CAP.  What's the confusion? 1. How did circulating supply increase and why wasn't it disclosed during the token sale? 2. Did Strategic partners allocation had no lock?  What's the answer? 1. Edenchain had 40% tokens for sale at a price of $0.06 concluding total cap at $24M. 2. Edenchain had also reserved 15% tokens for strategic partners that means they could raise another $9M over $24M. 3. Strategic partners allocation had the same lock-up as the public sale.  So the extra circulating supply is including the strategic partner's reserve which they sold pre-post token sale.  Who's at fault here? 1. Edenchain - They should have promoted the strategic partner reserve from the beginning and should have been firm on possible extra HARD CAP raise. 2. Community - Investors should have read whitepaper and token metrics properly as Strategic partners 15% allocation was mentioned clearly in metrics and they should have anticipated this.  Edenchain & community, both had equal part in giving birth to this confusion.  Edenchain should have been public with their strategic partner's allocation sale progress same as the public token sale. Community investors should at least read whitepaper and documents than just expecting 100-1000x. This way, the community wouldn't have raised questions at this stage if strategic sale progress was transparent and public.",False
