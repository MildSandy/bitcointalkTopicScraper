You can also help the project by spreading information and we will appreciate it a lot however, we do not have a bonus program because we do not think that it helps the project in any way. All bonus programs do is just build fake hype. If you REALLY want to help the project you can contribute in the ICO. We MIGHT do a giveaway for people that spread information. The giveaway will most likely not affect the total supply. We will announce it officially on our social medias if we do any giveaways.",False

You can read more about them in our whitepaper.  •  Burglaries: Over 2,000,000 burglaries are reported each year ONLY in the United States. Only 13,6% result in arrests. Homes without security are up to 300% more likely to be broken into. In the United States a home burglary occurs every 13 seconds.  •  Heart attacks & Strokes: 614,000 people die of heart diseases ONLY in the United States, that’s 1 in every 4 deaths. About 47% of cardiac deaths occur outside a hospital, which suggests that many people don’t act on early warning signs. This costs the United States $200 billion each year. An estimated 17.7 million people died from cardiovascular diseases in 2015 representing 31% of all global deaths.  •  Most homes are not smart: Homes are not smart or connected and even the smart homes that currently exist are not smart enough and definitely need an improvement.  The solution to these problems is ProKareX  ProKareX is a decentralized blockchain-based system. Our sensors and cameras, which will be installed in your house, will protect your home from burglaries and if a burglar tries to rob you, the police will be notified immediately but he will not know that there was a signal sent to the police so he will not run and they will easily be able to catch him. The police will temporarily get a live stream from your house so they will know what the burglar is doing and where he is going. After they have caught him, the live stream will stop and they will not be able to access it again unless there was another burglary happening at your house. If someone in your house experiences a heart attack or a stroke, our system will immediately send a signal to the emergency line in your country and an ambulance will arrive as fast as possible. Our whole system is waterproof. Sensors and cameras are also dust and moisture proof. This guarantees their precision and accuracy.  People that permanently live in your home like your family will have small bracelets on their wrists that will grant them permission. The bracelets will be used for monitoring your health as well. If you are inviting guests in your home that do not have bracelets, you can temporarily set the system so it does not detect them as burglars. However, people without bracelets will not get their health monitored and therefore if something happens such as a heart attack or a stroke you will have to tell the system to call an ambulance through a voice command. The bracelets used for the system permission and health monitoring are FREE. You will tell us how much you need when you are ordering the system.  If you have close friends that come to your house a lot then you can upload a picture of their face to the system and the system will know not to detect them as violators until you remove their face from the system.  If you have a pet or multiple pets in your house then we will give you a special collar to put on him so the system detects him separately and makes no false signals. That way the pet will be able to roam freely around the house without any problems. The collars will also allow the system to monitor their health and you will be able to see it on the mobile application.  The constant monitoring of your health includes: -RHR -Heart Rate -VO2 -ECG -Blood Oxygen -Skin Temperature -Body Temperature -Blood Pressure -Thermal Imaging -Respiratory Rate You can check all this data on your phone by using our mobile application, which will be connected to the whole system and you will be able to customize things and change certain settings if you wish.  The main computer will be installed in a secure and hard to get place in your home. It will resemble a box, which will be waterproof and all the cables will be waterproof as well. Even if a burglar gets to the main computer box the signal would have already been sent. You need to have a code to be able to open the main computer box. When a signal is sent there is no beeping happening in the house so the burglar will not even know that police is already coming. When the burglar is inside all the doors will get locked. The only place the burglar can get in and out from is a window. By the time, he leaves; the police will be there to catch him. If he goes in and leaves too fast and the police are not able catch him at the house, they do have the live stream from the cameras so they can see how he looks and put him up as ‘’Wanted’’ and also pursue him the same night. The police will not have permanent live stream from your house, they will only have it when the burglar is inside, once he leaves the live stream stops and they are only left with recordings so they can pursue him and have evidence. They will be able to open the live stream through a special app made only for the police however the system will know when to live stream to them and when not to. Therefore, when nothing is happening their app does nothing and they have no access to the live stream.  The sensors and cameras will work 100% together to provide precise and accurate information. They will work as one AI body connected to the main computer, which makes it the smart system it is. Together the sensors and cameras can recognize feelings, temper, and generally your mood. Considering they are smart AI, they can also recognize guns. Therefore, imagine if you are with your family in your home and an armed robber breaks into your house. You cannot call the police because if you do he will harm someone, so he is holding your family hostage. The system will not just simply signal a normal burglary but it will signal a one or more armed violators who are holding hostages, so the police will know what they are going up against, they will also get access to the live stream so they know where everyone is and can execute a proper operation without anyone being harmed. After everyone is safe and the violator has been neutralized and put into custody the live stream will stop and the police will not have access to your home. Only you and your family have full control over your system in your home.  Our sensors will also be able to detect if a fire has started in your home. The sensors will work with the cameras like mentioned before, so they will not just send a signal when there is a little bit of smoke from a cigarette or from cooking. They will work together so they detect both smoke and fire and there will not be any false alarms. If a fire starts and you are not in your home, a signal will immediately be sent to the emergency telephone number. Even if you are in your home, and a fire starts and it is not from cooking or something that you have control over, a signal will be sent to the emergency and to you, so you can put the fire out or evacuate. We will offer a fire extinguishing system that can also be connected to the sensors. Therefore, when a real fire starts the system will quickly trigger the fire extinguishing system and will put an end to the fire if possible so it does not grow into a bigger one. The signal to the emergency telephone number would have still been sent, so the fire department will arrive to put out anything that is left and secure your home. With the fast detection of a fire and the well-timed triggering of the system, ProKareX will guarantee the safety of you and your home.   We will connect your home into one. Your electronics will be connected to the system, so you will be able to control them with your phone and get a lot of information about how they perform on the mobile application. If a certain device is not working properly and it consumes too much power, you will be able to see that on the mobile application and get it fixed. You will be able to see which devices are turned on. That way you can check if you have left the iron or the stove on, so you can just turn them off from your phone. You will not have to worry about devices being left on anymore and having to go check them. This will make your life much easier. Everything you need will be on your phone.  Voice commands are a big part of the system. The system with the voice commands will be connected to the internet so that way you can ask your system to search something up that you need and it will answer you. The best part is that you can name the system, so you can call him or her whatever you want. For example if you wanted to lock the electronic door you can just say ‘’Chris lock the door’’. You can name it any word you want; it does not have to be a human name you can just name it ‘’System’’ if you wanted to. You can control the whole system by using voice commands. The system will only answer in the room that the question was asked or the command was given, that way it will not disturb other people in the house. The volume of the system can be adjusted from the mobile application. However, you could announce something in the whole house if you wanted to tell the kids to come for dinner. The voice commands are not just basic commands; the potential of the AI is huge so it will be like talking to a human being. Having this will make life easier for everyone that lives in your home. In the settings, you can make it so when you come home the system will welcome you and when you leave, it will say ‘’good-bye’’.  We are building a company, which will guarantee the safety of people and their houses; it will make their lives easier. Our calculations show that our company can run on the soft cap of the ICO 2500 ETH for 3 years only developing products. We plan to start a good revenue flow in a few months after we close the ICO. More revenue flow will come with time as we continue to build and sell our products in more countries. The main goal of the ICO is the hard cap of 12500 ETH, which will allow us to run the company at its best with maximized marketing and everything else needed.  The system, which we provide is our main product. It is a gateway to most of our services. If you have the system, you are able to use all of the services on our mobile application. The system consists of these products: •   Sensors •   Cameras •   Main Computer Therefore, if you were to order the system you would have these three products in your house and you will be able to use the services that the system provides including everything on the mobile application. These three products are specially designed for the system they are high-tech designed by ProKareX.  There will be no additional payments other than the price of the product. With this, we are aiming to minimize the total cost of everything, so it can be more accessible to the large amounts of people. Still we will be able to function without any problems and at our best. There will not be any: •   Delivery taxes. •   Installation taxes. •   Additional Work taxes.  The way our system is built is to be very durable to anything. Nevertheless, we do offer system maintenance. If you pay system maintenance for a month and something happens with the system in that period, we will repair the system free of charge no matter how big the problem is. You can make it automatic so every month you pay or you can pay in advance for months. The system will notify you if your system maintenance is ending. The money collected will be used for further development of our system, products, and our services. The monthly cost for the system maintenance will be as low as possible and there will even be discounts if you purchase for 6 or 12 months.We cannot tell you an exact price yet but it will be around $20 if purchased for only 1 month. There will be reports so everything is transparent and you know where the money is going.  We will create a special system for schools, kindergartens and for companies that have big headquarters and need a good and reliable security and health monitoring system. This special system will be much more complicated than the one for homes. It will be able to process the information of thousands of people at once without having any difficulties and the notification system will be much more advanced. There will be a separate special application for this system. The protection of schools, kindergartens, and people in general is very important. The system will be connected to scanners and will be able to detect if someone is carrying a weapon or a bomb. Therefore, it can prevent a terrorist act and save hundreds of lives. The system will be highly advanced with high-tech and will be able to cover big areas; this means that it will be more expensive. We are targeting big companies and institutions that have the budget to afford it. Normal security systems simply are not good enough for big institutions they cannot provide what we can. This will bring big cash flow, which will allow us to continue development and expand worldwide.   About The ICO The ICO is LIVE  The ProKareX token is a utility token.

We will update our roadmap when there is something important that needs to be added.   Pros and Cons  Pros 1.   ProKareX is a decentralized blockchain based system. This means that data cannot be hacked, faked, rewritten, or manipulated in any way. Which will guarantee that only you will have access to your system and recordings.  2.   Our team is full of experts. We have experts in the health sector, health technology sector, security sector, blockchain technology sector, law & jurisdiction sector, marketing sector, technology sector, science sector, engineering sector etc.              3.   Our products will guarantee stable cash flow after the ICO ends.  4.   We have enough people in our team to be able to execute everything we plan in time.  5.   Partners will help us distribute our system in countries that we currently cannot. We are planning to be able to distribute by ourselves in most countries in the future.  6.   There is no other system as advanced and capable. We are developing more than just a smart home system.  7.   If we do not reach the hard cap of the ICO, we will continue developing and will be able to get to a stable cash flow, even though it will be harder.  8.    Everything we do and will do is checked by our lawyers to make sure everything is right and no problems will occur.  Cons 1.   It will take time to overcome the use of the normal popular security systems. Many people are not open to the new technology.  That is why we will do our best with marketing and showing people how much better and easier it is to use our system.  2.   If we do not reach the ICO soft cap of 2500 ETH in the planned time, we will have to extend the ICO until we do which will slow down the product development, but it will not stop it.   3.   Getting local police to use the mobile application will take time and hard work but we have plans for that so it should not be a big problem in most countries.  That was a small overview of ProKareX.
