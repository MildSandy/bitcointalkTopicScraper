Zhaojun’s answer: Going well, we have completed the development of dcrm3.0, dcrm4.0 is being developed.  Question: how is Zhaojun connected to Fusion project?  Joey’s answer: Zhaojun is one of FUSION’s developers!  Question: full time? does he have a profile on linkedin or elsewhere?  Joey’s answer: Yes, Zhaojun works on DCRM full time! Along with other developers, they are all based in Shanghai!  Question: Hey Joey, what can you tell us about the DCRM development, are you involved at all with that?  Joey’s answer: I hope that you guys are aware that Bitcoin, Ethereum and all ERC20 can now be Locked In through DCRM. And yes, I am involved in the development of DCRM. Just not in core development but required components around it We can see more different types of assets in the future. We will provide a list of them upon release! And yes it includes stablecoins BNB indeed is an ERC20 which can already be Locked In  Joey’s comment: We can see more different types of assets in the future. We will provide a list of them upon release! And yes it includes stablecoins. BNB indeed is an ERC20 which can already be Locked In. But also Gemini USD for example; which is ERC20 as well  Question: Will any BTC fork work in first version ? BCH, etc?  Joey’s answer: YES! Any blockchain that uses ECDSA algorithm is confirmed working!  Question: Nice!!! So,  the only thing that keeps us away from mainnet releasing is the problem with the hybrid consensus timing, right?  Joey’s answer: I can’t comment on what keeps us from the MainNet.. but I can say that the TimeLock issue that there was before has been RESOLVED!  Joey’s comment: But yes, there is a issue with the Hybrid Consensus at the moment  Question: a new issue?  Joey’s answer: No, no! The TimeLock issue there was before was resolved. Hybrid Consensus is a different thing!  Question: ah ok....the hybrid issue continues to be your target, right?  Joey’s comment: The developers are working hard on resolving the issue, and a lot of progress has already been made!  Question: So do you have any doubts that the problem will be solved? Or are you confident that it will be solved n just a matter of time? Great news thus far  Joey’s answer: Of course I am more than confident, everything in life is a matter of time. Rome wasn’t built in one day as well!  Question: Are you proposing to change the hybrid consensus mechanism. Will it still be POS/POW?  Joey’s answer: No we are not, the time is working on resolving the issue.  Question: Completely agree but I think a few people were fearful that the team was met with some unsolvable issues! This little update should be enough to convince all those who were scared to finish buying their nodes. Thanks for the communication tonight  Joey’s answer: There really is no need to panic at all. Let’s be realistic, this is crypto.. this is Telegram.. this is a chat with 10.000 people and barely anyone knows each other.. it’s a scary world.. but rest assured. FUSION is here to stay and deliver what it promised from Day 1. This is cryptofinance!  Question: It was hinted that the nodes would be optimized for cpu . Can you share a little more on this topic? Would a gpu miner be overkill and earn no more than a well built cpu node? This is huge for me looking forward to hearing back!  Joey’s answer: A GPU mining rig would be overkill right now, Zhaojun has already said that VPS would be good to set up a node.  Question: I recall. Are there any specifics for the VPs requirements so I can begin to compare quotes to host? Thank you!  Joey’s answer: Just a regular VPS (usually 2 cores, 4GB RAM) should be good as a VPS  Question: Can you run multiple nodes on one vps thanks  Joey’s answer: I think you have asked that question before! Yes theoretically you could, but I wouldn’t recommend it!  Question: I hope others are hear to ask their tech questions before you go. Most of mine are answered. I’m def curious about the existence of a Fusion treasury, our standing after the lawyer meetings in manhattan to discuss utility vs security, and if FSn has a lawyer to enforce any patent infringements  Joey’s answer: Well, the current Hybrid Consensus issue has to do with the timing where one is going faster than the other. Which makes it that they don’t end together.  Question: Have you selected a second stable coin to include in the dcrm? Perhaps usdc or gusd?  Joey’s answer: GUSD is already working!  Question: Has Andre reviewed any of the code as yet. Thanks joey ?  Joey’s answer: I have no idea, haven’t seen any code review from him!  Question: Is 3k tps your maximum future target or are you going to use side chain or shardining to support fast tps for exchanges?  Joey’s answer: We will improve TPS overtime yes!  Question: What about the website?  Joey’s answer: Yes, the website is currently being worked at. It’s really getting nice! Just as you would expect  Question: Some ppl said it is delaying too much....any particular reason? Can you say when it will be on line?  Joey’s answer: There is no particular reason, nor is there a delay. Everything is going according plan!  Question: Joey how close are you in  developing native FSN token wallet. Thanks my last question appreciate it.  Joey’s answer: This is something you should expect to see upon MainNet!  Question: Any dapp?  Joey’s answer: The word dApp is a veeery big word. There is a lot of work in progress, already yes.  Joey’s comment: Stay posted the upcoming 24hours.. There might be a small suprise  Joey’s comment: DCRM 3.0 implemented the DCRM algorithm on a Peer to Peer network. It offers RPC API calls and cross-chain support for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Now, it's time for DCRM 4.0 to rise. DCRM 4.0 will be implemented on the actual chain including Lock In and Lock Out on the chain.

First of all, we had Zhaojun a core developer from Fusion answering some questions, and also made some comments in general.  Question: So do you think running the supreme node will require something along the lines of running a VPS on Vultr or AWS with like Ubuntu 16.04? I know the details aren’t out yet but just trying to get an idea of what I’d be looking at  Zhaojun’s Answer: VPS will be ok. CPU computing power is more important because DCRM needs more computing power.  Question: How about gpu?  Zhaojun’s Answer: This involves dcrm's cryptographic algorithm compute process, there is no gpu implementation, perhaps in the future there will be.  Question: I see, so currently supreme node is designed for cpu more then the gpu, am i right?  Zhaojun’s Answer: Dcrm will be optimized based on CPU first.  Zhaojun: We have tested dcrm on aws, azure, alicloud and more vps.  Zhaojun: We need to make changes, the community's opinions and help are great. We're trying to build a developer community where developers discuss code and progress, and community developers have built dcrm web app projects. We'll see these are great projects. Join the dev chat: https://gitte[Suspicious link removed]/FUSIONDC/Lobby  Zhaojun: This is the dcrm test wallet that developed by community developer. @numfebris  He's a very senior developer. Great! (Regarding the screenshot which can be found in the developers chat (link above))   Holly Kasun our new CMO answered a specific question with gives us a small inside look at what her thoughts are regarding strategy for creating awareness from people in the crypto space.  Question: What is, in your opinion, the best strategy to get awareness from ppl in crypto space, considering most of them are used to things like airdrops, etc?? And what is the best strategies to use to get attention from ppl out of crypto? I would love to know your opinions/plans to those...  Holly's Answer: Off the top of my head not in any order:  1. Exchange listings and coordinated PR around those announcements.  Some exchanges are pushing for us to do airdrops.  I’m not opposed to a structured one-time “prize” type of airdrop rewarding activity, but I can’t get behind “free-for-all” sloppy style ADs.  2. Crypto specific news outlet coverage.  Funny thing, most of the crypto outlets make you pay for story or press release coverage.  Very verboten business practice in traditional pr.   3. A crypto specific social media influencer campaign.  Structured and programmatic.  4. Crypto specific newsletter coverage.  Email marketing is still VERY effective.  Switching topics: trad Financial / business coverage:  Mainstream biz pubs: Forbes, CNBC, Fox Business, WSJ... messaging is about educating and applying Fusion to solving real business pain points.  Thought Leadership.   Buis/ finance can also be covered in some of the above tactics too, but messaging is different.",False

Why are some companies already willing to put assets of over 12 billions US$ worth on Fusion?      For Business automation. Previously ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) tools and other systems helped companies automate their business processes but they were limited by their internal capacities. All companies have their own supply chain, customers and related business partners. These processes all function in silos and as a result cannot benefit from the efficiencies of automation. After asset digitisation, these processes can be programmed in smart contracts to achieve thorough automation, improving efficiency, scalability and reducing costs.     Consider that each company or cryptocurrency is like a small lake or little river, they have their own limited ecosystem. Indeed, maybe there is diversity and some are relatively bigger than others. Take a company like Alipay for example, a huge company but theoretically still bound by the limitations of existing as a predominantly isolated ecosystem. Even bitcoin is the same! If you want to send RMB using Alipay to another person, that person needs to have a registered account with Alipay. If they lock-in on fusion, it is just like the lake pours into the ocean, all value in different ecosystems will be inter-connected. FUSION will be the huge ecosystem that enables all of these separate parts to interact together. Value in one ecosystem can exchange with others as long as they are locked-in on the FUSION Blockchain.     Complicated financial instruments become feasible on FUSION. In today’s world, even agreements involving 3 different parties often makes costs unacceptably high. However, if all the assets are locked in on fusion, a programmable smart contract involving 10+ parties, handling 20+ different asset types, based on 30+ different conditions, is just some lines of codes. And importantly, code guarantees that it will be executed exactly as it is written.  The companies who have committed to lock-in assets on FUSION see the advantages which could make them unbelievably competitive when they are facing their industry competitors. That’s why they are so excited to lock-in their assets on fusion.  Question 2: Do you see the Fusion platform being used more than Ethereum and if so, how do you plan to gain marketshare?  So far, there are 2 major areas using Ethereum.  One is that Ethereum is serving as a Dapp/Smart Contract platform. Thousands of Dapp/Smart Contract are running on it. Although most of them today are useless, we can see it is as being significant in the future. Once the performance and throughput is significantly increased, we can expect it could be very amazing. Another function is issuing tokens. Fundamentally, people are using Ethereum to help them with their bookkeeping ledger for their tokens. It became very hot during ICO booming period.  Because we added a bunch of very significant functions on fusion, which is really necessary for finance, definitely, FUSION will be used more than any other platform. I can give you 2 very simple examples:  1. No other platform today including Ethereum has realized value over time. (In Ethereum, future token flows can only be expressed as a smart contract which cannot be shown as an assets in a wallet). Fusion however, has a “time lock” feature that can realize factoring, bonds and achieve bank acceptance very easily.  2. Even for ICO issuing token, people will find great advantages to issue token on FUSION compared with Ethereum. We all know Ethereum supports issuing tokens on Ethereum platform. After the project has its own main net, projects need to rely on exchanges or other centralized institution to execute a token swap (exchanges usually only support 3 months for a swap or even less). And once the tokens are swapped, they cannot interact with smart contracts on Ethereum any longer. If a issue token on the FUSION Blockchain when their Mainnet goes live one day, they don’t need to ask exchanges to execute a swap, they can use FUSION’s ‘Easy Swap’ function (Just a simple mapping process). Tokens that are issued on FUSION are just like locked-in token. If a project want to transition to their own native chain, users and holders can easily lock-out their tokens if they want at any time.  There are so many more examples to add to the points above. Just remember one thing: Fusion is targeting the Finance industry which is much much bigger than crypto today.  Question 3: If we have a supreme node do we need to run it in our machine? If so what is the expected hardware spec? Can we keep it actively running in some AWS or Azure space and if so can you give us a sample packages and costs that would satisfy this criteria?  Yes, you will need your own machine. So far any information that relates to how to run supreme nodes has not been released yet. Please stay tuned as we will release a manual for running supreme nodes including suggested hardware spec.  Question 4: Is it theoretically possible to pool together for a Supreme Node while locked-in to FUSION blockchain, or under a Fusion risk-free smart-contract?  Theoretically, it would be very difficult or maybe even impossible to pool together to run a supreme node. But for staking with POS, it will be very easy. The system accepts tokens with time-lock to stake. Which means even if you don’t know how to stake, just set a time-lock on your FSN (like from now to 3 months later) and send it to others who knows how to stake. This is not like lending, the transfer of tokens is more like a sale. The remaining part of the tokens (from 3 months to forever) in your hand will automatically become full functions of FSN 3 months later.",False

The 6 features introduced were: •Lock-in Lock-out — The ability to Lock-in crypto assets from other blockchains onto the Fusion blockchain, for interactions with other assets, and then locking the assets back out (releasing them back to external blockchains) — Initially 4 token types will be supported: BTC, ETH, ERC20 and USDT •Token ‘Time Lock’ — This revolutionary new feature actually redefines how we address and characterize a store of value. To date, Fiat or Crypto currency was defined by 2 parameters — type ($, €, BTC, ETH etc) and amount. The Fusion blockchain will for the first time include a 3rd parameter built into all locked in assets, which denotes the time period of using the token, separately of ownership. By default this is defined as unlimited (so long as the token is owned). But, it also allows defining a timeframe where the token usage is separated from its ownership, meaning the token may at that period be temporarily ‘used’ by others. This will enable very efficient implementation of various financial use cases (to be detailed separately), and is currently under patent application. •Short address notation — Mapping of the inconvenient and very long address string to a short and highly usable ‘Account’ number. This will help to encourage adoption from the Finance industry. •Cross-chain support — Support for cross-blockchain smart contracts. •New token issue — Support for issuing tokens on fusion, similar but not the same as ERC20 on Ethereum. •Token swap — Easy Swap for FSN ERC20 to native FSN token on main net Fusion blockchain– No need for 3rd party exchange to exchange ERC20 based tokens for native FSN.  Beyond these features, some more information was disclosed on the Fusion architecture: •The average block time on Fusion will be 15 seconds, theoretically supporting 2000¬3000 TPS. Block sequence will consist of 9 transaction blocks, followed by a lock-in/lock-out block; This latter type of block requires a special node called ‘Supreme node’ to pack, for which staking of 5000 FSN will be required. •The block reward for transaction blocks will be 2.66 FSN, and for lock-in/lock-out blocks 6 FSN, halving in approximately 2 years. •In terms of token economy, FSN will be used as gas for smart contracts and as the judgement fee for conditional judgements (eg event/time based triggers).",False

The current FSN token issued in the token sale is an erc20 token. When FUSION's mainnet is in the production environment, FSN holders will transfer their ERC20 token to native tokens on the FUSION chain. PoW and PoS will both be employed since the consensus of FUSION is the Hierarchical Hybrid Consensus Mechanism. PoS is used to set a limited permission for smart contract calculations to ensure the safety of the smart contracts and PoW is use to select packaging node. The FUSION protocol uses node grouping to realize parallel computing of smart contracts. Every group can randomly select a node to compete for bookkeeping. Since there is competition for bookkeeping not all the nodes and the numbers can be controlled by adjusting grouping numbers, the environmental protection and the safety of FUSION can be well balanced.",False
