At the same time, the matching engine was released publicly, and the order book which is being used already by our several Institutional clients can be seen at any point. We we are not releasing the exchange yet to the public is because we will not satisfy the capacity of the public inflow, due to the downtrend in the ICO market. And we do not intend to release something half done or partially well made.  Margin trading is already ready. We will present it to the public in November. Everything is fully on track and ongoing.

I decided to write to you myself.  The case is the following.  The platform which you can download is from Metaquotes. We took their platform and developed the software to trade cryptos and have crypto accounts in addition to Fiat accounts.  The platform can sustain up to 250 000 users at the same time in the same second. Which is literally 6 times more than any web platform can handle. The button for google play works when you use your android device. It allows you to download the Android APP.  Metaquotes software has been in the market for over 20 years. And we decided to build it up and improve it.  Regarding the web platform. No worries. Will be in place as well when the exchange is opened for trading.  We arent going to miss  out our target audience )),False

One of the most efficient and feasible solution is a hybrid exchange. Hybrid exchange combines two types of cryptocurrency exchanges: centralized exchanges (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX).  Centralized exchanges are controlled by a single entity, and the system requires all data to be sent and be received by one single point, usually a private server or a hub. A single point of entry makes it easier to access information, and thus making it more susceptible to a leakage. For example, Facebook is a centralized platform. The recent Facebook data breach was easily executed due to the million users’ data being stored in one place.  Transactions executed on a centralized platform are cheaper and more efficient to run than the ones on DEX. Furthermore, centralized exchanges offer a third-party oversight that ensures that all the transactions are executed accurately. Centralized exchanges have been the standard in real world, however, users are troubled that a third-party gains access to their private keys. The main concern is that the keys might be compromised, and the information can be illegally or legally accessed by private individuals, companies or government structures.  In decentralized exchanges all the information passes through many points connected, instead of a central point. A decentralized network relies on host of computer, without a single point-of-connection. It is based on blockchain — constantly growing chain of ordered information, which is built in such a way that the blocks cannot be corrected. They eliminate and avoid censorship of information: to hack information you would have to find a way to access every single point at the same time to hack into the network.  DEX are more expensive, but they are also more trustworthy. They mostly rely on software rather than a third party. Decentralized exchanges are a meeting point for sellers and buyers. They do not offer any guidance or instruments like liquidity, latency or other market instruments that make centralized exchanges more attractive for customers. Decentralized exchanges are not accountable or liable to government or to their users.  So, which platform is safer and more convenient for customers?  Sometimes it is easier to deny both than simply pick one. Hybrid exchanges combine functionality and liquidity of CEX and the privacy and security of DEX. One of the recent developments in the industry is the Hedera hashgraph that will offer a fair public, distributed ledger, decentralization and combines performance and security at its best. From its whitepaper: “Hedera directly resolves the five fundamental obstacles to mainstream market adoption of public ledger technology: Performance, Security, Stability, Governance, and Regulatory Compliance.”  Another example is the emerging hybrid and licensed, fiat-to-crypto Ternion Exchange. The Exchange combines security and reliability of centralized platforms as well as liberating aspects of decentralization. You can try a demo version of the Exchange here.  Hybrid exchanges are a beginning of digital transformation that we can observe and participate in today.",False
