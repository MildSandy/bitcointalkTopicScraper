(Bitcoin started tumbling in December 2017 - AICoin kept making new highs for 5 more months) The token investment committee has taken a couple of positions that are slightly in the red and on Friday (So EXCITING) we are signing the purchase agreement for our equity stake in Sevamob. So execution of the strategy is continuing regardless of market conditions. In other words we are in profit. One similarity between stocks and tokens is that the underlying value and the price in the market can diverge drastically. In a bull market both shares and tokens can become overpriced and in a bear market (such as we are experiencing now) things can be underpriced. AICoin is currently trading at a discount to the value of the underlying assets. Whether this is a buying opportunity or not is something you need to make a decision about.

Three more were added in November of 2017 bringing the total number up to 13. I will have to ask people on the trading side why they decided on that starting number. But as a (little bit of a trader) I can answer why not 100. Cryptos move, not exactly in lockstep but largely in sync with one another so you add no benefit nor do you diminish risk to trade a huge variety of tokens. Smaller tokens have lower capitalisation which increases the liklihood that you will end up not being able to execute a trade without moving the market. There are also issues of counterparty risk. I believe the team looks for 3 viable exchanges to place orders through for each token we trade. For us to use an exchange for trading, they must pass our internal controls for counterparty risk. You can listen to AIcoin founder Gavin Smith's talk he gave at Blockchain Money in 2016 on how we class counterparty risk of exchanges. AICoin is not a security as it generates a return through software licensing. Though we have no control over people that wish to buy the token from other sources we do not accept token holders if they are resident in the United States through the First Global Exchange. If this does not answer all your questions, join the SLACK channel where members of the community are very friendly and giving of information. They are a great bunch of people. Lots of professionals, lots of business angels. Not your usual pump and dump crew. We are all working to build something amazing.",False

AICoin, a proprietary investment group, has the potential to entirely disrupt the conventional venture capital model using the unique properties of blockchain smart contract technology. The investment group, made up of over 2,000 AICoin token holders vote on which start-up to invest in using the transparent voting capabilities embedded in AICoin's smart contract. The goal - to use the collective knowledge of all token holders to build a portfolio of highly profitable investments in the most disruptive technologies in the world today, AI and blockchain. The entrepreneur wins, both by accessing capital and gaining the attention of the 2,000 active investors that form the AICoin 'Collective' who may also wish to engage in later stage investment in the company.  How does AICoin generate its equity investment capital?  AICoin will use a 2 stage strategy to generate profits for AICoin Collective token holders. Stage one uses the Collective’s capital to trade the most liquid cryptocurrencies using decisions made by proprietary AI models developed by AICoin’s founding team. These profits will be used to drive stage two of the strategy – ongoing investment in AI or blockchain start-up companies.  With 1.5M EUR of profits currently available in the ‘Stage two’ Investment Pool, the AICoin Investment Board is actively seeking the best projects from around the world for equity stake investment. The board, which is in place to select the projects that will be showcased to the Collective is led by bitcoin pioneer Jon Matonis and made up of both AICoin founders and Collective members. In the first 100 days of trading AICoin’s proprietary models have generated nearly 3m EUR in profits, half of which has been set aside to invest in early stage companies. When the stake in those companies is sold a few years down the road, those profits when added to those generated through AICoin’s trading may make AICoin the unexpected winner in the race to see which altcoin will be the most valuable in years to come.   How are start-up investment decisions made for AICoin?  “Whilst a venture capital group or angel syndicate is subject to the bias of a single or small group of individuals, AICoin will leverage off the experience of all its token holders to decide which companies to back,” states Marcie Terman, one of AICoin’s founders. “We use AI to make trading decisions in cryptocurrencies because that is the right tool to profit from both the exhileration and fear that drives the volatile and immature crypto markets. But we believe that human intelligence and experience is the best tool for making complex start-up investment decisions. So we use the ‘Wisdom of the Crowd’ to drive decisions for stage two of the strategy,” stated Terman. “AICoin token holders are currently discussing the merits of various proposals in our online forum, bringing knowledge from their own careers and education to help us make informed choices during the upcoming vote.” For the engaged investor, AICoin provides an outlet for choice and control not offered by the VC, angel syndicate or crowd funding model.  “AICoin has attracted a very specific type of person,” stated AICoin founder and AI model developer Gavin Smith. “We’ve got alot of people with advanced degrees in maths, AI, the sciences as well as existing business angels who have been drawn to the AICoin long-term wealth building strategy. Think - the Berkshire Hathawy of blockchain and you have the flavour of what we are trying to achieve with AICoin.”  AICoin will make the first of its investments in early Q2 of 2018. “The goal is to amass a capital war chest that will allow investment in projects of quality whenever they appear on the horizon,”  continued Smith. “This continuous flow of capital also means that if a company meets their milestones, AICoin could increase their stake rather than selling the position to a later stage venture investor. This benefits token holders,  who as early stage investors usually get pushed out by VCs who typically get involved after the angel round has absorbed the risk of investing in an unproven company. It also helps entrepreneurs who can continue to focus on building their company rather than losing focus as they start searching for the next round of investment capital.  Founders interested in presenting their projects for consideration should visit the blogpost on How to present a company for AICoin Investment or email investment@aicoin.io for further information. Please share this story with appropriate people who can benefit from knowing about AICoin and our investment programme!",False

I have assigned the AICoin Admin person the job of contacting social networks where they advertise and getting them pulled off whenever they post a video or something.

You will likely get a faster response on there.  You are absolutely correct that holding BTC directly would have given you much larger Absolute Return over that time period, but you also assumed the full risk. Just before that timeframe you could have seen the value drop that same percentage.  The reason aicoin is so attractive is the AI's ability to side step these risks. While straight return is certainly key, consider also the Sharpe ratio and the Max drowdown. It is certainly too early to have enough data for a solid Sharpe, but this early analysis is unbelievable once you wrap your mind around the concept. These numbers are what ended up getting me excited. That and watching how productive the aicoin team is.

But here is the process: BTC Withdrawal Go to the AICoin dashboard and where you would normally enter the ether address for sending your XAI, enter the bitcoin address where you want your bitcoins to be sent and click the Request AICoin Withdrawal button.  You will receive the confirmation email which must be clicked within one hour. You will see a message on the dashboard saying the request is being processed. At the same time email support@firstglobalcredit.com the number of bitcoins you want removed from the site. It is your responsibility to make sure that support sees your request and emails you back confirming the bitcoin withdrawal.. There is at least a 24 hour delay before your withdrawal is added to the queue where the withdrawal alert is displayed on the dashboard . Withdrawals are processed manually once a day by  a First Global director. Due to high transaction fees, until further notice BTC withdraws of 0.001 or less are suspended.",False

In 2008 to bail out the banks Western governments devalued fiat currencies in a measure that was branded Quantitative Easing. What that means is the governments printed money to back out of the mess created through the debt crisis. That is an oversimplifiction, but the net result is that the money that you and I have saved for our retirements (if you have that kind of forethought) is devalued significantly. With bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies this abuse of power is no longer possible. (Also an oversimplification) Your statements about bitcoin (which actually have nothing to do with AICoin. Not sure why you ended up here?) are not based on knowledge. If I may suggest you put a bit more time into understanding what cryptocurrency means. The benefits. The power shift they will create. It's not going to be a comfortable transition. Change is always painful. But it is not a scam but a revolution. Read.... Learn..... Think......",False

And yes, you are spot on with your assessment, XAI belongs on coinmarketcap and we are creating the API that will allow this. At present our focus is on internal growth. Trading strategy is underway and we already have $350,000USD to invest in start-up companies. So that's the next big issue on my TO DO list. Making sure we are positioned to attract the right kind of investments. In terms of exchange listing, we will be voting on whether the collective wants to put the money into being listed on one of the exchanges that will list coins for payment. (Remember, US Exchanges are OFF THE TABLE right now.) As it stands right now, we are building a track record and value in what the token owns. As soon as we start reporting earnings more publically the coin will get known quickly. I would argue that now is the time to get your position sorted out so you are invested as is appropriate to your portfolio. Because once we start putting this more generally into the world, the bargains will be over. [This is my personal opinion only based on me believing strongly in what we are doing.] Marcie",False

This event will have implications for the Coin Pool if two viable coins are created. This is our current view on our holding policy during this transition period. 1. We will remove coins from exchanges that state they will not support the additional coin if it becomes viable. This is simply to protect our assets – if a second viable coin results from this hard fork then we need to ensure we receive the benefit of that asset. 2. Our core BTC holdings will be moved into our own controlled offline wallets for the duration of the split. While we usually hold a significant percentage in offline storage, the quantity we hold in this manner will likely increase; this is a risk mitigation activity – with our own controlled wallets we ensure immediate  access to both coins as soon as their respective blockchains stabilise. We will need to maintain some holdings on exchanges to allow model trading to continue subject to caveat 1 above. 3. The models have no knowledge of an impending hard fork and any previous out come (a single example is insufficient for training purposes) so some manual override may be required. Rules around this are as follows 4. We will not be short ahead of the split (even if the models at that time have adopted short capability into the live trading model). 5. We will not go long more than the capital allocated to trade bitcoin (we have had suggestions that we put all funds into the coin ahead of the fork to maximise the holding of both coins – we believe this would present too much risk for the Coin Pool). 6. Within these parameters we will look at sentiment ahead of the split and may increase or decrease the bitcoin holdings compared to the model suggestions at the time. We will keep the collective informed of what is happening during this process. Once the blockchain(s) settle down and are stable we will include the new coin in the pool of assets traded by the model (assuming there are two viable coins and chains). The coins distributed will represent the funds available for each chain (e.g. if we held 100 BTC then we would hold 100BTC and 100 newBTC, each coin would be traded on it’s own chain model) The cash element of the bitcoin pool will be allocated to the model on the chain which exhibits the highest hash power. If there is a single viable coin then this will be the “bitcoin” model and will follow previous bitcoin pool weighting allocations as prior to the split. I want to emphasise we are not making any call on the likelihood of one or two viable coins or the “correct” solution; we just need to be prepared to maximise our potential as it unfolds.",False

In my opinion, I hope the concentration is in the backend and AI itself.  Making the site responsive for mobile should be done sure, but base functionality is more crucial.

Then after week 1 it was 3.8 American pennies because the AI was long all cryptos. Then the AI sold all cryptos and the market tanked. Then we published this blog:  Back of a napkin assessment of AICoin today… September 15, 2017 Over a much needed cup of coffee Gavin and I were chatting about AICoin and trying to second guess what Wintermute will do. He outlined the following to me and I wanted to just share it with all of you. When the AICoin ICO ened August 28th, Wintermute the AI was long pretty much everything. It took a 4% profit out of the market in the first week. Then it went flat/negative all cryptos right before bitcoin started coming off so we are now sitting on a big pile of USD, out of almost all cryptocurrency. Consider this, during the ICO 1 BTC bought you 100,000 XAI. Since Wintermute got out and we are now sitting on a big pile of cash, with bitcoin trading at around 3,000USD, 1 AICoin is not worth 0.00001 it is worth 0.000013 or 30% more than when we started 18 days ago. And today if you wanted to buy XAI with bitcoins, your one bitcoin would not buy you 100,000 XAI, now it will only get you 78,000. Trading of AICoin will start this Sunday at noon UTC on the AICoin dashboard. If you want to try to buy some you need to register an account and deposit your cryptocurrency on the site so you are ready to trade. It can take several hours for the display on the dashboard to update with your deposit. So be sure to give plenty of time for your deposit to register before you plan to start trading. Formal valuation for week 2 will be published later today.",False

The AICOIN audit is now complete and total subscriptions have been confirmed. We will now move on to assigning bounty allocations. When you visit the AICOIN dashboard Saturday morning, you will see an additional row in your dashboard titled Bounty Allocations. 2.    Everyone eligible to receive coins (through subscription or bounty) will receive an ethereum address – this is where your coin allocation will be initially assigned. 3.    Bounties will be transferred to this address in 3 stages.  The first will be delivered in the first week in September, the second in October and the third and final stage will be in November 2017. 4.    When coins are delivered to your dashboard, you can request to transfer them to your own address when you are ready. To do this enter the destination address and the quantity to transfer into the dashboard. If you choose to keep any of the coins on the AICoin system then you will have full functionality to vote from the dashboard. Thank you for joining us in the AICOIN ICO.

We are about a day behind in our work of bringing AICOIN online. This is due to the somewhat manual process of identifying and unwinding subscriptions where people submitted ETC transactions to their ETH address or BCH to BTC addresses! Our expectations are now the following.      AICOINS will be issued to subscribers later today and you will have an address in your dashboard that will be viewable on the ether blockchain. We will publish a ‘how to’ guide for people a bit less familiar with viewing blockchain holdings.     Monday Sept. 4 – the starting valuation will be created based on the opening positions Wintermute takes in the various cryptocurrencies.     Funds will be moved into brokerage accounts and we’ll be off and running.  You will be able to view the NAV of the trading pool from a link on the dashboard.,False

The Collective follows an investment strategy that provides profit potential from two interrelated revenue streams designed to accelerate return on investment.  The first stage uses the funds collected during the ICO to make short term trades in multiple cryptocurrency markets using  proven artificial intelligence models. The second stage takes trading profits and makes seed investments in promising young companies in the fields of artificial intelligence and blockchain. These investments can be taken in the form of a traditional equity stake or in the purchase of ICO tokens.  As part of the governance process, an Investment Board will be created. The primary responsibility of the Board will be the preliminary review of investment proposals presented to the Collective for funding. Their goal will be to narrow the number of proposals down to no more than five every quarter. These finalists will then be presented to the token holders of the Collective to vote which of the proposals will receive funding that quarter.  The Investment Board is made up of five members; two appointees’ will be selected from the developers of the trading models (First Global Credit). One appointee will be an independent representative with knowledge of the world-wide start-up market – Jon Matonis, one of the original founders of the Bitcoin Foundation has agreed to take on this role; and two appointees’ will be elected from the population of AICoin token holders.  Any AICoin token holder is eligible to put themselves forward as a board candidate. To fulfill their duties they must have the time needed to review proposals presented to AICoin. The board will engage in online meetings to discuss the merits of the individual proposals and jointly come to a decision on the opportunities to be presented to the Collective. Some token holders have already stated their intention to apply for board positions and the process will commence directly after the end of the subscription period. Candidates will be provided with a forum where they can present their qualifications and state why they would be good candidates to become an integral part of the start-up selection process. There will then be an on-blockchain election where token holders vote for the candidate they favour.  Following the vote, the candidate with the highest number of votes will be appointed for a two year term and the candidate with the second highest number of votes will be appointed for a one year term.  After the initial candidates are elected there will be follow on elections every year for one of the two posts.  All token holders are entitled to apply for a board position. To apply send an email to board@aicoin.io with the registered username on the site. A full list of applicants will be compiled before kicking off the formal process two weeks after the close of the ICO. The vote will take place 2 weeks later using the smart contract voting mechanism.  Learn more about AICoin at – aicoin.io Learn more about First Global Credit Setup an account at – account",False

AICOIN is the first passive investment product being offered by blockchain industry regular First Global Credit, a cryptocurrency capital markets company that has been serving the crypto-ecosystem since 2014.  In response to the opinions of a significant number of AICOIN subscribers, First Global Credit management has made a decision to revalue the token from its initial price of 100 AICOIN’s (XAI) to 1 bitcoin to 100,000 XAI to 1 bitcoin. This brings the price of an individual XAI token from approximately $37 US dollars (based on where bitcoin is trading on the 12th of August) to 3.7 US cents. Once the post ICO, after-market for XAI is established, the underlying asset value plus market demand will set the price of the token. First Global Credit CEO Gavin Smith and one of the strategists who designed the coin’s unique 2-stage profit building approach had this to say during a recent REDDIT AMA event to discuss the finer points of AICOIN. “By implementing this, effectively, as a coin split it will not adversely impact existing subscribers who will simply have the same subscribed value through a much higher number of tokens with a price still linked directly to the price of bitcoin.”  Though this change has no tangible impact on the value of the token which is linked to the market price of bitcoin during the ICO, the logic behind the change is that it will make the token more attractive post ICO when the token starts trading on various exchanges including First Global Credit’s multi-asset trading platform. “Since AICOIN is a functioning investment collective with underlying assets plus a potential revenue stream from day 1 and not a start-up whose value is driven only by potential profit at some point in the future, AICOIN will trade on the asset’s value plus potential, not just potential alone in the open market,” stated First Global’s Chief Operating Officer Marcie Terman. “But a market is still a market, and we have a responsibility to token holders to create an environment where they can trade the coin should they wish to. This speaks to setting the price initially at a level that will encourage participation of speculators that did not choose to buy-in during the ICO.”  The AICOIN ICO will continue until the market cap of one billion coins are spoken for or until the 28th of August after which there will be a brief pause to finalise the details governing the Singapore based holding company that has been formed to hold assets on behalf of token holders. The token will be tradable on the First Global site where it also can be used as collateral to trade over 500 stocks, futures, FX and cryptocurrency contracts.

In essence, this project uses Machine Learning to predict profitable trades in the cryptocurrency market. The tokens are comparable to a share in an investment fund. The more profit the ML algorithm makes, the more valuable the tokens become. This way investors can participate in the profits of the algorithm (which is far more involved than the trade bots you can buy, as they do not use any form of statistics).  At the same time, the token will be tradeable, which further increases the gains of token holders due to speculators and traders.   Quote They actually have one and it's also ending this week.

The reason the cryptocurrency markets are good targets for A.I. trading is that there are still a relatively small number of participants and many of them trade emotionally. The A.I. learn to spot opportunities in the market that people may miss due to excitement with upward moves or fear at downwards ones. The developers doing this work for AICoin do it for big banks. So they know their shit. The A.I. has been trading a live account since March and is making really good money. (ouraibot.org) Thinking that A.I. does not work in trading is JUST what Goldman Sachs wants you to think so they can continue to make money from it! Of course in crypto Goldman's is not involved just yet. That's why individual investors can really benefit from AICoin. Before the banks start messing around with crypto trading people like you and me can still make money out of it. Then there's the start-up investment. That's where the really BIG money will come from. There are going to be amazing start-up companies in A.I. and public blockchain. And AICoin is going to buy into some of those at the very start. I think its terrifically exciting and fun.,False

You are quite correct that the first is the asset +profits generated from trading the cryptocurrencies. But since the profits from crypto-trading are added to an investment pool that quarterly invests in a blockchain or Artificial Intelligence start-up the underlying value of the coin will be the trade profits plus the potential of the seed company investments. And remember it is likely there will be a new seed investment every 3 months.

Subscribers to AICoin benefit from state of the art Artificial Intelligence models to actively trade cryptocurrencies on their behalf.  The vision behind the AICoin proposition is to create a completely autonomous trading engine working on behalf of the AI Coin token holders that operates 24x7; automatically executing trades across the different cryptocurrency markets and making profits wherever opportunities present themselves.  These profits can then be invested by the token holders in exciting new projects in the fields of AI and Blockchain so token holders get double the benefit from trading profits.",False
