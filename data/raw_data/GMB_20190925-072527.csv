Today, 55% of all product searches start with Amazon, 28% with Google. Companies like Amazon, Google or Facebook can leverage their power to eliminate competition and become even more of a dominant global force. As a consequence, smaller online retailers will become more and more marginalized and dependent on the goodwill of the big players.  The Vision For those and many other reasons, we are introducing GAMB — the Global Alliance of Merchants on the Blockchain. GAMB is powering the decentralized marketplace of the future, ultimately governed by smart contracts, with no decision making unit other than the owners of the marketplace themselves. Merchant Alliance members (token holders) propose rules and regulations which — upon approval — can be programmed into smart contracts, so that transparency, trust and sustainability are guaranteed. Our objective is to start building the future of e-commerce today, without a negative impact on performance or user experience. This can only be achieved by carefully analyzing all components of a decentralized marketplace and successfully migrating them to a blockchain environment. GAMB, supported by Gambio and its growing merchant base, is in a unique position to lead the industry into a sustainable alternative to Amazon, based on open-source software powered by blockchain technology. We firmly believe that merchants need to be empowered in order to provide the best products and the best services to consumers.  The Token We have designed the GMB token to facilitate the initiation or conclusion of a transaction for a good or service on the GAMB marketplace. Every merchant, regardless of what e-commerce software is used, can become a member of the merchant alliance, simply by acquiring and owning tokens. They can then introduce proposals that will be put to a blockchain based — and therefore foolproof — vote amongst the stakeholders. The Pre-ICO phase will start on July 4th, 2018 and you will be able to register via our website http://gamb.io  References: Whitepaper: https://gamb.io/files/gamb-whitepaper.pdf Twitter: https://twitter.com/GAMBproject Telegram: http://t.me/GAMBcommunity",False
