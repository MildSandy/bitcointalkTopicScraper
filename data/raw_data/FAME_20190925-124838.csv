If we thought there was no market for our platform, we would not have developed it.  In the global modeling and photography industry, our target group consists of approximately 5 million customers that we can reach through global marketing campaigns.  We are very well versed in this area and know what our target group wants and what our competitors (local agencies, other platforms for models or photographers, etc.) are offering. At the moment there is no competitor who reaches the level of functionality and usability of our platform, not by a long shot.  In summary, there is a target group of 5 million customers, no serious competitors (just local agencies or poorly developed platforms) and with a successful ICO we can reach our future customers and establish the Fameone platform in the worldwide modeling and photography industry.  So yes, we are very confident that our platform will find widespread use in the modeling and photography industry.  Regards, Katrin from the Fameone Team",False
