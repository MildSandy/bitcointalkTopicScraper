The market for commercial and civilian drones is slated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% between 2015 and 2021. Even with this rapid growth, lack of regulation and inefficient protocols regarding safety and automation make the process of implementing new uses for drones difficult and slow.  Enter BlockchainTaxi  BlockchainTaxi’s platform will become the scaffolding upon which the automated drone superhighway system of the future is built. BlockchainTaxi will provide the framework for smart contracts to be built that use blockchain technology to automate operations like air traffic control, pre-arranged inspections of structures, disaster responses and any other large scale drone application that requires logistical coordination on a macro level. BlockchainTaxi’s Coin will act as the currency and medium of exchange for payments between service providers and customers (for uses such as air taxis and drone deliveries).    Flying Cars?  By being the exclusive partner of Passenger Drone, BlockchainTaxi will be implemented in a real world setting in the near future. Access to Passenger Drone’s hardware infrastructure will allow BlockchainTaxi to be one of the first end to end, intelligent eco systems for drones. Other manned drone manufactures such as eHang, Kitty Hawk, Volocopter and Airbus can become time and cost optimized by building upon the BlockchainTaxi framework - a framework which will already have been proven in a real world setting. By adapting and expanding the Passenger Drone model to other aeronautic industries and manufacturers, BlockchainTaxi will become the foundation of a worldwide intelligent network of drones.  About Passengerdrone  Passenger Drone has developed one of the world’s first fully-functional, state-of-the-art autonomous aerial vehicles. Passenger Drone is slightly larger than a compact car, can be easily transported and parked in any garage space. This is not just a futuristic vision, Passenger Drone has already concluded manned test flights and has an equally substantial working technological framework.     How BlockchainTaxi Works  BlockchainTaxi is an application for the drone space and can be used in the following capacities:  Smart navigation protocol: New York City can have different flight protocols than Paris, but both use the BlockchainTaxi platforms to create smart contracts enabling the same drone to fly in both locations while remaining compliant with the individual air traffic regulations. The BlockchainTaxi application can store navigation route data recorded during manned test flights, meaning the smart drone ecosystem can be informed by countless hours of human flight.    Ecosystem for contract compliance: BlockchainTaxi provides the scaffolding to build Smart contracts on top of that can govern autonomous drone operations like inspection of bridges, wildlife and agriculture as well as maintenance of drones, pricing for services and any yet undiscovered future drone applications.    Ecosystem for economic transactions: Smart contracts can be used to automate payments for those same drone services. The entire network of inspection, maintenance and services (like air taxi rides) and payments for said services can be automated and executed by the BlockchainTaxi platform.  Regulation friendly model: BlockchainTaxi helps the entire drone industry move forward by ensuring compliance with local flying regulations as information on the blockchain cannot be tampered with. This gives regulators the ability to create sensible legislation with complete confidence that compliance will be mandatory.   Proceeds of the Tokensale  The funds collected during the ICO will be allocated to developing the following aspects of BlockchainTaxi’s platform. Development will start immediately in tandem with the crowdsale. Funds received during crowdsale will be automatically distributed in two Ethereum addresses. This will be done at a ratio of 30% to 70%, where the 70% will immediately go into hardware and integrated software development. The 30% is allocated for other categories, but in practise more than 70% will be going into development.  Ongoing Application Deployment: The BlockchainTaxi app needs to collect a large cache of data from human pilots. This cache of data is the cornerstone of BlockchainTaxi's interconnected global network. The initial round of funding will be used to hire a developer team and build out the app.  Ongoing Passenger Drone development: As BlockchainTaxi perfects it platform its hardware partner PassengerDrone will work to fully integrate BlockchainTaxi into its line of manned drones (air taxis).  Regulatory approvals and establishing new routes : BlockchainTaxi will lobby legislators to be integrated into the FAA’s NextGen system and will use this as a model for integration into air traffic control systems worldwide.  Marketing BlockchainTaxi Service: Once BlockchainTaxi’s infrastructure (platform, app and initial user base) have been solidified BlockchainTaxi will focus its efforts and resources on mass adoption.    Token sale structure  60 Million BCT will be available per SAFT agreement during the presale and token sale, for total of 25,000 ETH. The token sale will be structured in 3 tiers: presale, Tier 1 and Tier 2. All tiers will be governed by smart contract.  Presale will be capped to 2,500 ETH and will automatically end when all tokens are sold. In the case that not all tokens are sold, the remainder tokens will be added to Tier 1 with Tier 1 conditions. As soon as the all tokens from Tier 1 are all sold, Tier 2 conditions automatically come into effect. Smart contracts will be developed by Applicature (Github link coming soon)  Presale:  Presale will start on 15.12.2017 at 09:00 UTC and run until 15.01.2018 or until all 10 million tokens are sold.    Any remainder BCT from the pool of 10 million BCT that is unsold during presale will be added to Tier 1  Tier 1 and 2:  Tier 1 of the token sale will start on 20.01.2018 at 09:00 UTC and run until either: all tokens are sold, which is when Tier 2 will automatically start, or 20.02.2018 09:00 UTC. Tier 2 will start immediately upon completion of Tier 1, independent of how many days of tokensale are left until the final closing date of 20.02.2018 09:00 UTC.    Token allocations  28% of the total supply will be held by the team, used directly for development (25%) and future marketing (3%) of the BlockchainTaxi application. 10% is held in reserve for liquidity / unforeseen costs, bringing the total held by the team at 38%. 2% will be allocated to various bounty programs: 1% for Country Managers and 1% for media bounties. This brings the total held by tokenholders to 62%. We strongly intend to uphold this division of total token supply, no matter the amount sold.

Lawmakers want to make sure that when the drones start taking to the sky in our cities, that drones from company A and company B can talk to each other to avoid collisions and also conform to the rules of that country or city. A drone in say New York can fly at a different height as in Paris. For hardware manufacturers and companies providing services via passenger drones, it will be much easier and less costly to adopt a operational software that already has all these things built in, so they don't have to start from scratch. Part of the funds raised will go to lobbying with various governments and city lawmakers, so that we will be the first at the table and can shape the conversation around passenger drone laws from the start.  No special rights and interestss for the token holders, other than holding the token. The BCT token itself is used in the ecosystem not only for secure navigation, but also for payments, either from company to company or customer to company.
