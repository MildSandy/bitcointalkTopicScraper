It also allows Token owners to win prizes. To do this, you need to keep your wallets open and provide 35,000 WIRE tokens as collateral (mortgage) to install masternode.  Privacy The first consideration when creating a WIRE token is privacy and security. Coin blending and zero knowledge protocols are integrated into WIRE tokens. Both of these features will allow you to fund transfer anonymously, confuse transactions and prevent you from following them.  Gain Program You can activate your winnings program by connecting your existing social media accounts to the Social Wallet platform. Social Wallet posts will gain WIRE tokens on their platforms with their activities like liking, sharing, retweeting, commenting and so on. You will also have the chance to earn WIRED tokens by liking, commenting on company accounts.  Bank account card Social Wallet 3rd Party has agreed with a debit card provider. All users on the platform will have the chance to own a Social Wallet Debit Card. Debit Card has high user functionality and is no different from any bank's bank account card. You can use ERC20 tokens in your wallet with this debit card seamlessly in your regular purchases.  What is a WIRE Token? WIRE token is a crypto paradise that allows people to exchange value on the Social Wallet platform. After purchasing or acquiring wire tokens, users will be able to easily send them to other users with a few clicks on this platform.

Our founders are U.S and British Citizens with the core team composed of Americans, English and Canadian citizens. We are a fully transparent organization and operate within SEC guidelines.    Social Wallet is a first-to-market platform designed to enable cryptocurrency to be sent easily, quickly, securely, and most importantly, universally, over today’s existing social network infrastructure. No prior setup is needed by the recipient nor any advanced knowledge of the transaction itself. Social Wallet allows individuals to send cryptocurrency directly on the platform, through Facebook, Twitter, Email and User-to-User on the platform. Through the first fiscal year, we will have 14 of the top 20 social networks in the world integrated. The User Interface has been designed to be sophisticated for the blockchain expert, yet simple enough a novice can immediately navigate the platform. The user does not need to understand blockchain, wallets or deal with long addresses - everything is simplified.  The WIRE token is the utility token that powers the Social Wallet platform. WIRE is the first token to be listed on the platform. Our platform has the capabilities to incorporate other top cryptocurrencies into our platform giving each the ability to utilize our technology. There will be an application and listing procedure that each coin will have to complete before access is granted to utilize our platform. WIRE token facilitates the transactions on the platform. Transaction fees will be paid in WIRE. WIRE can also be used in a traditional manner with proof of stake, masternodes, quick sending, and heavy privacy features.    Social Wallet  Platform Preview  Twitter Sending Featured Video   Wire Token  Token Technology WIRE uses the XEVAN algorithm, it was founded by the Bitsend developers and has since then proven to be a stable, ASIC resistant and efficient algorithm. The Xevan hash algorithm is a unique combination from the dual X17 difficulty algorithm with an extension to 128 bits.  Masternodes and Staking WIRE fosters a decentralized and worldwide network by utilizing staking and masternode implementation. Token holders can earn network rewards (token minting) by keeping their wallets open and staking or by using 35,000 WIRE tokens for collateral and creation of a masternode.     True Privacy Security and Privacy were a top priority in the creation of the WIRE token. Coin mixing and ZeroCoin protocols have been integrated into WIRE. Both of these features allow for transaction mixing, anonymous sending and freedom from prying eyes.  Seesaw Reward Balance WIRE uses a variable Seesaw Reward Balance System that dynamically adjusts the block reward size between masternodes and staking nodes. The seesaw rewards feature helps to keep a balance between staking and masternode use. This technology was originally developed by the PIVX team.  Instant Sending Tokens are sent and confirmed in seconds thanks to the network of decentralized masternodes. The network allows the transaction to occur without need for the normal 2.5-minute confirmation period.   Wire Token Sale   Social Wallet has launched its WIRE Token Sale. The campaign will run until April 27, 2018. Each round, except the first, will last approximately 2 weeks in duration with each round successively lowering its bonus in 5% increments. In Round 1, buyers can anticipate a 25% Bonus. Round 2 will be a 20% bonus working its way down to 0% in Round 6.  The minimum number of tokens one can purchase is set at $100 USD within the cryptocurrency you are using. There will be a $150,000 USD purchase cap per round. This ensures everyone has the opportunity to acquire tokens and bonuses in each round. We value the smaller investor and find it beneficial to have the tokens widespread vs centralized by a few big participants. The Social Wallet Platform will go live on April 28th, 2018 which is the day after the sale is set to close and that is when Wire Tokens will be distributed.    https://sale.socialwallet.io",False

We are a social media platform that integrates cryptocurrency into existing social media networks such as Facebook, twitter and email. Our platform enables anyone to send cryptocurrency to another person on social media even without the recipient having knowledge it's coming as there is no prior setup or technical expertise required. This will allow us to compete with the PayPal’s of the world. It will also allow us to engage new users of cryptocurrency and teach them how to use it. Not by telling them about it, but by sharing it with them.  And check out our Social Wallet Initiative wish is a passion of ours and is the driving mission behind our company.   The Social Wallet Initiative will use our reach on social media to educate the world about the power of blockchain and cryptocurrency technology. It is the passion behind our company and we feel so strongly about it that 10% of the funds raised will be allocated to this cause. As of now, only a small fraction of the people on social media know about cryptocurrency. We plan to change this and will use our resources to do so. We will work closely with our community and look for opportunities where sending cryptocurrency to someone can change their life for the better. We will then use our resources to amplify these stories of “Social Good” so that new people can read for themselves real life instances of cryptocurrency affecting real positive change. It’s not enough to tell people about this technology, you have to show them the good it can do.  Our platform will be the on-ramp for blockchain newcomers worldwide, so that they can see the benefits of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency has the same capacity to change the social and economic landscape as social media. Millions of early adopter’s’ lives have changed, or forever changed the lives of others, through cryptocurrency. What separates social media and cryptocurrency is education. Mass adoption in cryptocurrency will come from education and opportunity. Therein lies our opportunity to educate. It is time, as a cryptocurrency community, to spearhead the mass adoption movement and amplify the positive effects of blockchain technology.",False
