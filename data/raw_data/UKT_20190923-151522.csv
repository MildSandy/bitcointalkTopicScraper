It is based on work with big data that are collected from crowd data and DMPs to a single storage.  When a visitor goes to the necessary URL, the system will automatically figure out what segment the visitor belongs to: traffic is divided into groups based on the information about socio-demographic characteristics of the visitors and their online behavior. Then, uData makes a list of recommendations for personalizing the content of a page for each segment.  The interaction of systems within uData goes in cycles: each subsequent round of redesigning a dynamic landing page (unless an optimal conversion rate is reached for a particular page) calls a set of specified hypotheses, their automatic check and correction. The systems are constantly learning and the volume of data in the database is growing all the time, which increases the value of a token.
