Over time, it is hoped that the increasingly global nature of the LET network would allow the value of LET to become a standard of value used to back the world’s most powerful credit reporting and data sharing system.  Eventually, Linkeye will move to add whitelisting or full credit history data of individuals and enterprises into its system, enabling financiers to better access risk and adjust their leverage accordingly - leading to a rise in financing and creating huge value for the world’s economies.",True

Linkeye does from the start, founding credit alliance and sharing the blacklist. Due to the individual privacy involved, the credit data is semi-public digital capital. The data will be desensitized and posted in a masked format. A sample of Linkeye data format will be: Linkeye ID+Masked ID (such as 220403198011)+credit evaluation+publisher (anonymous) +signature. The blacklists of dishonest people published by alliance members are divided into 2 parts: public data and detailed information. The public data will be issued and the detailed information will be stored in the blockchain, including user ID, full name, lending time, loan amount, lending platform, overdue time and alliance. This part needs to pay money for the query. The blacklists released by alliance is equal to the dishonest list issued by the law court. Linkeye demands that alliance members shall sign an agreement with borrowers before the lending. And the dishonest behaviors will be publicized on the platform. In the second stage, Linkeye will extend the data application to the individual evaluation report, building a white list. A more sound social credit system can boost the development of credit industry. It is expected to achieve the goal by the end of Dec in 2018. Moreover, Xu said that apart from the individual credit, the enterprise credit is a more serious problem. It is difficult to evaluate the enterprise credit because the credit information of enterprise is in a severe loss. Therefore, in the third stage, Linkeye will extend the credit evaluation to enterprise, covering each participant of credit industry. As for technical frame, Linke independently figured out a solution of alliance chain based on the hyper account book of Fabric, realizing PBFT algorithm and improving writing performance. Under test environment, the operation speed can touch 100k tps. In terms of scalability,  Linkeye uses the modular design to encapusulate the PBFT algorithm,smart contract, P2P communication protocol and block and makes each model become pluggable. At the same time, the smart contract can upgrade, which is convenient for the maintenance of extendsibility in later period.  Hope this answer your question.",True

LinkEye is back! Yesterday, people in the industry were discussing the return of LinkEye. As compared to July and August, the domestic currency exchange chain in China was much quieter in September and October. As a leader of Chinese blockchain projects, LinkEye is closely watched by people in the industry. The return of LinkEye uplifts the overall mood in the sector. Biran has contacted the LinkEye team to find out more about its current developments and future plans.  What has LinkEye been up to? The LinkEye team has held roadshows in 8 cities across China, which attracted huge audiences. On July 29*, the first roadshow was held in Beijing’s Four Seasons Hotel. In the subsequent three weeks, roadshows were also held in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Wuhan, Chengdu and Chongqing to let the public know more about the LinkEye team and better understand the LinkEye project. Since then, LinkEye has impressed thousands of investors with their steadfastness, rich experience and well-thought project mechanisms.  After the roadshows, LinkEye continued pushing its project by improving on technical details and actively communicating its product. After three months, their project has come to fruition. By actively researching on the technology, the LinkEye team has shown their determination in contributing to the development of China’s blockchain sector.  What are LinkEye’s next plans? LinkEye intends to implement their blockchain credit project in the global market. After examining various markets around the world, the LinkEye team found that other countries beyond China — such as America, Europe, South-east Asia and the Middle East — are also affected by the high costs of data sharing in the credit industry. Although the credit markets in these countries are in different stages of maturation, they face the same fundamental problem of high costs. As the world’s first and only team to record credit information directly on the blockchain, LinkEye’s innovation has successfully received a high degree of recognition from practitioners all over the world.  In a globalised environment, LinkEye will build alliance chains in every country to suit the needs of different national credit systems. Each alliance chain uses API to verity the credit data, thus forming a global credit data network system. Currently, LinkEye has already established a global blockchain credit and mutual sharing network, allowing trustworthy individuals to receive the best financial services, thus completely isolating fraudulent people.  Can the LinkEye team do well? The LinkEye team consists of about 100 staff members. They are clear about their mission and have been constantly improving on every detail of the project. Biran believes the LinkEye team is highly outstanding, and believe they can bring China’s blockchain technology to greater heights.  *Article is translated from an old Chinese news",True

Double 11 is destined to be a special day. Several shocking accidents happened to the circle of digital currency. BCH broke up the surging record of 400% historically, which is followed by LTC,DASH and HSR kept rising all the time. The circle of digital currency is picking up , so who is the next winner? On the path to blockchain globalization, Linkeye is the pioneer of the credit industry, the blockchain-based credit alliance is worth to get much attention.  LinkEye is a set of independent solutions of the blockchain-based credit sharing alliance. Based on the European, Southeast Asia and Chinese markets, LinkEye uses the deep integration of blockchain technology and economic model, and shares the data of bad credit list among members to construct all the individual credit data into a whole and forms a social credit database characterized by reliance and wide coverage. In this way, the social credit system can be effectively improved. It is significant for Linkeye to use technology to promote global credit development.  Linkeye team has rich working experience in credit loan industry and blockchain area. Currently, Linkeye has a clear entry point into the credit industry and has designed and developed the most efficient blockchain data sharing platform. The eight core mechanisms: Blacklist Mechanism, Membership Mechanism, Credit Mechanism, Arbitration Mechanism, Information Sharing Mechanism, Smart Pricing Mechanism, Data Security Firewall Mechanism, Open API Mechanism can ensure the alliance platform operate efficient and orderly. Meanwhile, Linkeye has reached a strategic cooperation with many top credit platforms at home to share the bad credit list.  It is noteworthy that Linkeye has spent three months conducting a deep investigation of the credit market in Southeast Asia and Europe. Linkeye found that the high cost of mutual-sharing data is a universal phenomenon in Southeast and Europe. Linkeye needs to not only cut the cost of credit evaluation, but also solve the present problems of credit industry in Southeast Asia and Europe. Although these goals are difficult to realize, we are familiar with Linkeye and believe that they will develop better. Linkeye will accelerate the globalization of Chinese blockchain and will set an example for other peers.     LinkEye will create a new world for you to convert the credit information into money  In the information age, instead of several upheavals of the traditional mode, the new thoughts are gradually accepted by people. According to people’s antiquated ideas about the financial industry, it is unbelievable for us to engage in financial industry if you don’t have much courage and wealth. However, the sound combination of internet and financial industry will break down this thinking. And the pioneer of this revolution is the LinkEye team, which is a blockchain-based credit alliance.  In order to be familiar with LinkEye, we must acknowledge what is the credit evaluation. Generally, the credit information is to collect credit. The credit is neither material capital, nor the good look. It is the accumulated moral quality after many financial business. People may doubt whether the invisible things can serve as an credit and transact unsecured loan.  Indeed, this can’t be achieved when the internet is not connected with the financial industry. Massive users’ credit information and assorted credit criteria make the credit system get into trouble. However, a sea of information on the internet and powerful storing function not only injected innovation into financial industry, but inaugurated a new world for LinkEye. This new world is to convert the credit into cash.  LinkEye is not the the first one to run the credit industry. The traditional credit industry is not only unofficial and lacking credibility, but easy to result in misconduct behaviors. The unsound and various credit criteria will take a heavy toll on the financial industry.   On the 29th of Nov, LinkEye was in Singapore, attending the BlockShow Asia Summit and was invovled in the Achain night. Here is some of the highlight for the day.   Why LinkEye founded the credit alliance with blockchain technology?   Because Linkeye wants to make the information more open, transparent, unchangeable and accurate. You can be a registered member of LinkEye if you are in urgent need of money.  During the process of strict scrutiny, the first step is to ensure the moral quality of registered member. The fictitious credit record will be phased out. Once be a member of LinkEye, you not only can enjoy the convenience brought by the credit system, but also have to accept the supervision of community, and regulate other members’ information. Mutual supervision can bring reliable credit information for us.",True

Linkeye was initially going to be internally funded by chinese investors and through a china-focused crowdfunding, but with the intention of becoming a global blockchain. They have since refunded investors from their previous ICO after the chinese ICO ban and will be hosting this new ICO targetting global investors, with a comprehensive roadshow format to introduce multiple investors in the region to the tech and idea.",True
