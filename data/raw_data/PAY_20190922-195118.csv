TenX and some other crypto companies were the unfortunate casualties though when their cards stopped working overnight through no fault of their own.  TenX released cards to some countries in Asia/Pacific region from start of 2019. You can currently apply for a card if you live in one of these countries: Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand. TenX were issuing new cards to residents of Malaysia too, but that has since stopped (perhaps due to Malaysian government cracking down on crypto recently) although some people in Malaysia managed to get cards before the suspension. They are not increasing the list of Asia/Pacific countries for now because they are concentrating efforts on readying to release cards in Europe first.  TenX are hoping to release cards in Europe sometime in the final quarter of 2019, and are working hard to achieve this.

The sad part about this is that Tenx created self inflicted wounds for no other reason. I'm glad that Julian is gone b/c he was part of the problem but he was not the main problem. I think the main problem with Tenx is the culture and lack of foresight on many important issues.  Tenx has failed to realized (even today) that having a strong community is the most important thing than anything else b/c if there is no support for the coin, the coin will die. It doesn't help when you down talk or mislead the community since 2017. Most people (like myself) who believed in Tenx from the beginning have lost in faith long time ago. Unless there is systematic change in Tenx, I highly doubt that Tenx could even survive next 2 years. I know Tenx is bleeding money and I think that was main reason why they restructure token reward system in favor of Tenx.

GENERAL-NEWS  Speculation, of course, but here are some information that you can verify for yourself.      TenX company announcement of Julian leaving (source)      Julian's video on YouTube regarding his stepping down (source)      A verified signature by Julian, linking himself to this Ethereum address #1 (signature, address #1)      His ""actual"" Ethereum address #2, with multiple 6,250 PAY deposits. There is a link between address #1 and #2 with this transaction (linking transaction, address #2)      Why do I think it's his actual address? It was pointed out on Twitter before that he was receiving 6,250 PAY every month, and he did not refute it, but said that he is ""waiting for the day when PAY is 100 USD and people complain about that."" (tweet pointing out 6250 PAY, his response, his response archived)      Deposits amounting to 2,222,035 PAY being deposited into what looks like a Bittrex deposit address, with various deposits coming from address #2 and presumably other address which he is in control of (alleged Bittrex deposit address)      Other than the initial 1.5M PAY tokens deposited 5 days prior to the end of 2018, the rest of the deposits came in AFTER the snapshot for their new token was taken, after 1st Jan 2019 (snapshot details)      Price of PAY/BTC on 25th Dec, before the deposits came in: 0.00010783     Price of PAY/BTC on 9th Jan, as of the time of posting this: 0.00004950     Price change in BTC: -54%  Summary notes:  There are 2 batches of tokens that were seemingly sold: 1 before the snapshot, 1 after the snapshot.  I believe the 1st batch of tokens sold before the snapshot was his ""own"" tokens - ie. PAY tokens that he bought with his own money off Bittrex and OKex for his personal trading / accumulation. As it was not ""given"" to him from the company as salary or benefits, there is no ""lock up"" to those tokens. These ~1.5m tokens were deposited into Bittrex and to take advantage of the price pumping into the snapshot hype.  I believe the 2nd batch of tokens sold after the snapshot was his ""salary or benefits"" tokens - ie. PAY tokens given to him as remuneration for his work at TenX, which is likely to have a legal lock up or holding period. Hence, the movement to the exchanges AFTER 1st Jan 2019, 00.01 +8 GMT time (TenX is based in Singapore which is +8 GMT).  It seems highly likely to me that Julian has dumped all his PAY tokens trying to sell the intermediate top into the hype surrounding the token snapshot. The price has fallen dramatically over the past 2 weeks, since the deposits came in. The snapshot period is also the perfect smokescreen to cover him exiting his position, since volume before and after would be higher than usual.  What do you guys think of my gathering of facts? My speculation? Of Julian? What do you guys think are the implications on TenX as a crypto services company? Would you trust them? What is their image like to you?What do you think of PAY token and their new TENX token?  I would like to hear your thoughts on this issue.

The question is why would you get out today when you went through HELL by holding the coin since July 2017 (I'm assuming), if you already waited out 16 months, why not wait it out another few months. If you go back to my previous post here, you will find that I was more critical of Tenx than you, I was using REAL FACTS to support my arguments.  The facts are Julian over promise TOO MUCH and this created fracture  in the community, if Julian just shut his mouth from the beginning, Tenx would of been in much better place. For example, Julian stated that they are going to get banking license in Q2, 2018. When he stated this ridiculous statement, I laughed my ass off b/c I knew that it was going to take at least few years to get the banking license. He created ""FALSE HOPE"" to people and frankly I was piss off. If you don't know for sure 100%, don't announce it to the world.  The upside is that I see less of Julian and also I like the fact that they got BIN number. Just BIN number alone changed my mind in positive way. People need to learn not to have ""attachment"" on specific coin b/c if you do that you are going to suffer in long term, just what happened to Tenx. At the begining, I strongly ""believe in"" Tenx and never sold single pay token even though price spike to $6/$7 in Aug and another on in Dec. I could easily made 6 to 8 times of money but since I ""strongly"" believe in Tenx, just like dumb f"""" I didn't sell anything. When I look back now, that was SOOOOOOOO STUPPPPPPPPIIIIIIIDDDDD.

The Dollar to Bitcoin ratio since the ico had rocketed and depreciated the token already by 5 times at least. looking back from this point - it is still a mistake. Actually, this token was one of the worst performers during the last peak of December, multiplying only 3-4 times it's btc ico price while a vast majority of all the other coins did 10 times their worth (and more!) dring the same comparable period of time. I only started to sell recently and already made 3 times gains with the money I recovered, and that's in a cruel bear market! The reason I was optimistic at first was that I believed they would dominate the card market and have an edge on all the other competitors. Now, I believe they missed the boat and by the time their card will be ready, it would be nothing special and one of many. (too many) Yes, the token will recover one day, but so will all the others.

Just sit back and hope everything goes well? That is what I did in last year. I was ""hoping"" that Tenx was able get their shit together and established organic growth from the community and that never happened. In fact, Tenx was able to pissed off supporter like myself to n'th degree. This wasn't overnight thing, this was accumulations of 11 months of no progress. By now, Tenx should valued $5 -$10 per token and should have multiple partnership with business/banks/coins but that is not case. To my acknowledged, Tenx only focused on moving to new office and hiring new people. I'm tired of their excuses, I only care about END RESULT PERIOD.  What do you have to show the communities of what Tenx accomplished during 11 months? Tenx supporter can't answer this question b/c they haven't done shit. I asked this question for few months and nobody could answer it. How sad is this when you can't even answer this question.

I remind you that they had $1 million dollars from angel investor before the ICO. They had the money to do their homework but they didn't.  Do you know the worst thing, Julian ""LIED"" to people about token rewards. He first said, token reward will be implemented in August then it was pushed back Oct but later he hinted there was Christmas surprise which turned out to be ""PARTIAL"" rollout of ETH. He later said that token structure will be out few weeks ago and nothing happened.  It is wrong for TENX to STRING people around. Most people bought Tenx b/c of token rewards.  Since 10 months, Tenx hasn't accomplished anything. I'm not talking about moving to new building or hiring new people. Again what exactly did they accomplished technically?  Not even Tenx supporter could ever answer this questions.  Going back to COMIT, why do you think it will matter in the end? Why is that Tenx is using Atomic Swaps? If they had trouble rolling out ETH, do you really have confidence that they could even rollout COMIT?  If you look back in my previous post I stated clearly that I want Tenx price to recover so that I could bail out this shit coin. I don't want another person to suffer where I did and held the bag for  10 months (counting). Do you really think I'm excited to see this price when it is still below ICO price. ICO ETH was 0.00286 and current price is 0.00198 ETH. Do you see the problem? If you held your Tenx token from the start (b/c you believe in the project like I was in the beginning) you got fucked where as swing trader made a killing.

The delay was due to the SEC changing their position.  I hardly think they haven't accomplished anything, they were live with over 100k+ cards before Wirex went down unexpectedly, that isn't nothing to me.  I still have confidence they will roll out COMIT, but I never believed the timeline to begin with, I always assumed longer due to them being a startup and tackling the financial industry.  I don't know about ETH price but it is above USD price for ICO and slightly lower for satoshis. Irregardless, there was a sweet opportunity to trade it for 5x last August, so you really can't blame the token. There was an out and you holding on for 10 months is nobody's doing but your own, you won't get any sympathy here. Besides 10 months isn't that long, people have coins they may have to take to the grave with them (just saying).

Why take chances especially there is so much unknown factors? They didn't scrap it for 2 reasons (in my opinion) 1. It gave false premise to many people who bought the token as a good passive income, in other words, Tenx PUSHED an idea that holding tenx token was good supplement income (indirectly) 2. Without token rewards, this token SERVES NO PURPOSE. Lots of people failed to realized that Tenx token serves NO functionality, it is just there. If there was no token rewards, most likely it would of not received lots of hype.  You speak about 100K cards but really how many people actually receive the card before wavecrest thing happened? Some people waited 6 months with no cards. Julian LIED to people so much that I really don't care what he says about anything now. Example, he insisted that in Q1, the cards will be sent out globally. That was laughable. They had lots of technical issues, do you remember partial ETH rollout?  Tenx is not startup company, so that is misleading statement, it is couple years old company. They first wanted to use Bitcoin protocol but decided to go with ETH and this is when they decided to rebrand the company to TENX  If you compare the coin with USD, that doesn't give you clear picture of coin performance. You needs to compare with BTC/ETH/LTC. This is due to high price fluctuation in BTC/USD price.  Yes, it was sweet opportunities for SWING trader make 5x the money while people like me who truly believed in the project/concept/team etc got screwed in the end. This essentially punished the people who believed in the project while rewarding swing trader who careless about Tenx. If you have this idea that ""it needs more time"" thinking, you don't know what you are talking about. In cryto world, the time moves 5 to 10 faster than real world, in other words, 10 months is equivalent to few years in cryto.  You said ""the world has never been fair"", really,  what planet are you living on. The whole system is in geared toward corrupt system where richer get richer while poor get poorer. Why do thing think bitcoin came out in early 2009, right after 2008 economic disaster?  Going back to Tenx, what exactly did they achieved? Don't tell me about cards b/c many cryto companies issued cards so that wasn't special. During 10 months, did Tenx partnered with actual companies/gov't or improved their technologies? After all, they are tech company, so what tech did they improve upon on? Is comit in beta testing phase?  Did they partner with other major coins? (Yes, I know about litecoin)",False

Who creates these private keys and how are they created to ensure that nobody knows what they are?  Today, our Senior Manager in Financial Risk, Jonathan, is going to give us a simple demonstration.  Everything related to the funds is printed on secure, sealed paper, similar to bank PINs.  Using a hardware random number generator, the private key is generated automatically. It is then automatically sent to the printer, then the sealer. All of this is done using an airgapped computer with a secure operating system to ensure that we are not vulnerable to network attacks.  The cool thing is that the keys are actually split. Each envelope shows the public QR code, reference number and wallet ID. Each envelope also only contains part of the key. Each envelope also states how many parts of the private key you need to have to access the funds. In this case, you need 4 out of 7.  To run away with the funds, you need to pool the envelopes with someone else. To prevent this, we store these envelopes in different secure locations with different parties such as law firms. The funds are also stored in multiple different wallets to further reduce risk.  Compared to companies who store all of their funds on a single ledger, which is vulnerable to just one person running away with the funds or getting kidnapped, this is as safe as it gets at the moment.  We are not vulnerable to any wireless attack, no single individual has access to the private keys, we have multiple law firms who hold these envelopes for us, and the funds are split across multiple wallets.  I hope that you now have a better understanding on what we have been working on, in particular the Treasury and the security aspects on the back-end.",False

Quite ugly from their side they've waited this long only to tell they can't deliver at the promised time. But on the other side, they need some strength to come out and admit they've behind schedule.  Another bad thing is that they didn't announce another time frame for the cards, but at least they've promised more frequent updates, which is something they should have had started months ago.

From the software side, Jeff was more than happy to provide a little bit of background about himself and his role here at TenX‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe hope this provides better insight into our Software team:  Jeff is a Software Engineer, who has been a part of TenX since October 2017 and currently the lead mobile app developer for both Android and iOS.  What was your profession prior to TenX, and how did you fall into crypto?  I have always been focused more on mobile development ever since I became a Software Engineer. At the earlier stage of my career though, I had dealt with low-level programming like embedded systems, Linux and Mac OS kernels.  How did you learn about TenX and join us as Software Engineer?  I attend meet ups or workshops once in a while after work & during weekends. One of the meet ups I had signed up for was about blockchain and that was where I got to know Paul through Mike Ferrer the community manager, who is a friend of mine.  I already had a small idea of what blockchain is, and invested a little in BTC and ETH by that time so I felt amazed at what TenX can possibly do if they really succeed with their ambitious plans‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut I definitely did not see myself working with them that time as first, I didn‚Äôt know they were hiring and second, I could not imagine myself working in an office situated inside someones house!  It was at least a month after the ICO when I heard about them looking for a mobile developer and I did not hesitate to send my application. It was not completely smooth-sailing as they were receiving tons of applicants and they treat everyone‚Äôs submission equally. But once they decide you‚Äôre in, they want you in, as in, right now! So after getting a confirmation message through Slack on a Saturday afternoon, I went straight to their house the next day and signed the contract, it‚Äôs been non-stop action from then on.  How do you see TenX making cryptocurrencies spendable?  It‚Äôs like how the computer was made personal, or how Internet access was made wireless; it has big potential to change the way people live and earn/spend their currencies  As a Software Engineer, what is a typical day like for you?  We follow the standard application development life-cycle. It usually starts from planning and analysis, whether it is a bug or a feature request, this step involves things like task prioritisation, requirements collection, estimation of task completion time etc.  After planning, that is when I start the development process, based on the design flow if it involves that. Once the app is ready for testing, it would be forwarded the QA team then to a closed alpha testing stage where the apps are released with a larger set of users, then we release to even more users in the open beta testing stage. If it looks good then we release it to public; if not, then the cycle restarts back to development stage.  Though the question is about a typical day, the whole life-cycle definitely does not finish within a day. So to answer the question more directly, a typical day for me would be anywhere within that cycle along with our daily stand-up, meetings, etc.  Where do you personally see TenX in 2 years time?  I see TenX still in Singapore, along with more branches in other parts of the world as well. Kidding aside, I would simply say, I see TenX still sticking to their culture and vision.  Aside from work, what keeps you busy and what do you enjoy doing?  I love to learn new stuff so I take online courses every now and then. On the other hand, I also love sports‚Ä¶ a lot. In fact, I join marathon and triathlon events regularly, compete in billiards competitions whenever I get the chance to train.  Thanks for spending some time to answer these questions Jeff, always great to hear of other peoples experiences!",False

Tenx should NEVER held ICO before legal issues were resolved first. If Tenx was uncertain about token rewards in terms of being legal or not, they should of drop it and replace it with something else that was legal. Currently, Pay Token serves NO PURPOSE, it doesn't do anything. This types of issues should of been discussed before ICO. Tenx should of iron out the problems and implemented some sorts of  back up plan but they didn't.  It is ridiculous to say to wait when we waited since July 2017. How long do we need to wait to see any progress with the project? For me, I tried to have positive mind set with Tenx and I must say that it is running thin every day.

Tenx has been spending their time putting out small fire while overall progress is nonexistence. Show me demo on comit or even screen shot of it, it is ridiculous.

I just went by trying to pre-register for card every few days... The huge majority of companies offering ""Bitcoin cards"" were working with cards issued by Wavecrest (most VISA, some Mastercard). Wavecrest cards - both VISA and Mastercard - were shut down, I guess that Wavecrest has done something wrong. It's not about Bitcoin, I think, since there are still (very) few cards working. All these companies try now to find solutions to have cards again for their customers, in a way or another. With some luck in the next 1-2 months we should start getting news from the luckier/faster ones.  If I would have gotten TenX card, it would have been in the same situation, but I ordered the card only in this February, so I'll have to wait until TenX solves this situation for themselves too and then wait in line even more until they deliver my card.",False

They are losing community support everyday and Tenx will be forgotten just like bitconnect. Speaking of bitonnect, to be honest with you what is the difference between bitconnect and Tenx? They both lied in the white paper and screw over original investor. What is it so hard for Tenx to release Eth wallet when Centra has already released 7 or 8 different alt coins on their wallet? I really don't understand it, what were they doing all this time? Such disappointment.  If you are original holder of Tenx, do not sell it, just wait it out little bit longer b/c even shit coin like Tenx value will go up. People should just bail if they made 2x of their money b/c Tenx doesn't have any bright future. They are dead in the water, who care about Comit when new and better coins are coming out everyday.

Please tell me where I misled people about Tenx? Is it not true, Tenx lied to community about token reward 3x (August,October, end of the year) or not having multiple coins available in the wallet or technical problem with rolling out ETH wallet. Where did I lied?  You should watch ALL Tenx youtube video before you make uneducated comment like that. Tenx end goal is NOT to be card provider but in fact they wanted transition into COMIT. My argument is that Tenx don't have technical skill set to be successful tech company. Just go back and read all the problem they had when they actually had working card/online wallet. Tons of technical problem.    Do you really believe Tenx is the only one in the market, the competition is going to get worse for Tenx due to new coins coming into the market. It is not true that Tenx is ""new"" company, in fact they rebranded to Tenx last year. If I remember correctly, they form a company in back 2015 or 2016 where they focus on Bitcoin blockchain but later change to ETH platform.

That they say for legal reasons is they will gift users everymonth a gift equal to what people expected with the divident. Secondly the token has more use than this.

I know for sure that PAY token holders will earn massively jn the future people just don't understand right now, what TenX actually really aims  I went to some talks of Julian and also spoke with him in person, and from all I've read and seen so far, TenX is one of the most developed companys in this industry and also one of the most forward-thinking  they never made any hype about their project, and yes, we had some delays with which I am also unhappy, but hey,...some things you just cannot change, especially when you are a start-up  a few days ago I cashed out a big stack of my portfolio and put 50% of that back in today in PAY, which is actually a lot  never put all your eggs in one basket, but with the words of Elen Musk, if you're sure about something than you can set everything on one card if you know it will succeed,...which I am not doing here, and which I don't want to advise anybody here to do, but as I may said before in another post,... TenX has one of the brightest future for me in this space  just imagine what is possible with COMIT  when companys are able to offer shares as tokens on blockchains, when governments start to issue their own crypto currencies, when many more digital assets get tokenized on blockchains, TenX will actually be one of the firsts who are able to combine those it is possible to be THE interface for the new era of the internet of values  just think about that,...and yes, the cards are a nice gimmick, and yes,...there are not even really starting their progress in terms of that.. but as far as I'm concerned, when I just compare TenX to other companys, they lightyears ahead   alright enough with my hymn of praise  have a nice xmas, and be excited for your xmas preseng üòâüòâüòâ",False

This happens with almost everywallet on a regular basis. Updates, changes etc. etc. Some people think that while a wallet is in maintenance you cant traide but trading is possible like normal. To get to the trading from within your wallet is not possible, you have to go to the initial bittrex page and from there you can go to the trading screen of the coin whose wallet is in maintenance. Just saying this because i read somewhere about an outraged guy who wanted to trade Neo on bittrex and accused them of putting the wallet into maintenance on a critical moment in Neo's trading history.

I truly believe that there is so much more to come for us as TenX clients and followers of TenX.  https://youtu.be/A2LFIECSD6c   He is not mainly talking about TenX, but more of Blockchains and their adoption in the future. I think the people at TenX have a very wonderful vision and perspective in terms of the future of the whole crypto space. And I think that, as Julian says, we will see MASSIVE changes through the adoption of Blockchains in our world.  And TenX is building just the very bases of profiting from that adoption in the future. I guess that for some, it may not seem like TenX is not working their way up fast enough. But when you invest a little bit of time. Study their whitepapers (TenXs itself and Comit), you get a clue what they are really focussed on. And that is nlt just being a credit or debit card provider for cryptos. It's sooo much more. When we will see the first states implementing their own crypto currencies like Russia, Australie, Singapur, Venezuela etc., we will need new instruments that allow us to connect those currencies throw a new way or network. It's not only states who will create their own tokens, it's also businesses, other legal institutions, stock exchanges and what more.  And comit could be a really good driver to combine all these new kinds of store of values.  I don't know exactly how TenX will implement their PAY within that system, but I'm pretty sure they will do that one or the other way.  The cards are just the start to a much, much greater project, which most people, I think, don't really see yet.  I can also understand that many of you are disappointed because of the delays and sometimes not so very straight answers that so many wish to get. But I also understand TenX when it comes to legal matters and so on. Also, it's a very new, still very small start-up.  And for what they've done and delivered so far, I can just kneel and say respect.   Some may think that, just because they got a shitload of money with their ICO, they are a functioning multinational corporation like amazon which can serve with a service like that. But that is just silly thinking. A startup is a startup,... no matter how much money you got in the first place.  And yes, money can solve many problems and make things easier. But it doesn't solve every problem a new company has to struggle with. Especially in such a new and complicated field, where you take responsibility for people money, have to care about regulations, new technical stuff that most never heard of before and so on.  And what's the most difficult part, I guess, is to find the right people, who share your vision with you and are as willing to do something revoltionizing like TenX is doing in my eyes.   I don't want to praise them to much, because I also expect a lot from TenX in 2018, and the following years. But I'm quite confodent that they will deliver. Maybe with some struggles inbetween, maybe with some delays. But they will deliver. I'm pretty sure of that.  Ahh,...and just a last thought.  I just switched some bitcoins and a few other Alts into PAY tokens the last days. Why? Because I think that the true value of PAY lies way, way, way above the price lines that we see right now, and might be seeing the next weeks also. But with the possibility of the market going down in the future, I think we won't have such a big impact on the price of TenX.  TenX will have a use case with their products (cards and comit), no matter how fast or slowly the market will grow. And the market WILL grow. Just that many shitcoins will leave the table in the future.  As soon as we will have clearance of the ""rewards"" of PAY, the price will no longer stay at these lows. And it doesn't matter if it's $3,20 , $1,68 , $2,43.  I'm pretty sure that we will see double digits in 2018.     Have a nice day!    Ps.  Thank you TenX Team, it's still, sooooooo cool to have a card where I can spend my BTCs and Ether! Looking forward for more coins to come! See you ;-p",False

No one single exchange is used to generate the exchange rate. Our engine queries a number of the top exchanges and attempts to conduct the trade on the best exchange based on BID price for each individual transaction. It is highly important the currency exchange happens instantly as fluctuations in price are considered a high risk in the short time it takes our engine to make the exchange. Due to this, the exchange rate is set slightly below the current highest BID offer on the chosen exchange.    It is important to note TenX are not charging any additional or hidden fees during this process. The rate displayed in the app is the rate that TenX sell the currency for (after exchange + transaction fees).  On other note, yesterday i finally used my TenX card for a first time and i must say that i'm very excited about it. It was easy-peazy and enjoyable experience. Very quick way to feel that cash in your hand and not virtual zeroes and ones. When my wife saw it, she immediately wanted one for herself, so i ordered another card for her  .  To tell you the truth i was skeptical guys, but when i see now how the card is working i became a fan! I will recommend it to all my friends also, its just really a great product.  P.S. My only regret is that i wish there are more currency's available than BTC, because sending money to the card is very expensive.",False

The problem is that regulatory framework is still in development and countries have to adapt their laws to the newly emerging cryptos that have to be considered as a security. But its a thin line. I guess what we are seeing currently is that exchanges want to protect themselves from potential lawsuits because its not certain what will happen regulatory wise. Its also hard because many tokens are kind of hybrid, they are currency, equity token and utility token at the same time. Im curious where this will end, but its certain that there is a lot of work to be done before this will be settled.",False

As we believe that the information we shared with them is also relevant to our community, we would like to list some summarised points below:  Crypto exchanges are not registered as platforms that can trade securities and other regulated products, so they need to ensure that every token or digital asset which they accept on their platforms is not a security or any other type of regulated product. For the overall industry, such due diligence efforts are part of a positive process that will bring more transparency and discipline to all market participants. To date, PAY token holders have not received any reward of any kind.  The PAY token was never intended to be a security or any other type of regulated product. To further improve its features, we are undertaking a review and update of its current structure and no rewards of any kind will be distributed to PAY token holders under such current structure.  The finalised terms and conditions in relation to rights of PAY token holders and the membership and loyalty programme, based on the updated structure, will be made available to you soon. Such terms and conditions will clarify that the PAY token is not intended to constitute a security or any other type of regulated product (such as an investment contract, debenture or unit in a collective investment scheme).  For a token not to be seen as a security or any other type of regulated product, there must not be any expectation of any receipt of investment returns by its holders. Therefore, we would be unable to provide any assurance that any rewards will be distributed to PAY token holders even under the updated structure and PAY token holders should not expect to receive any rewards even under the updated structure.  As shared by us on multiple occasions, this structure is to ensure that PAY tokens are widely accepted for trading on as many reputable crypto exchanges as possible.  The updated structure will keep crypto exchanges from receiving any potential rewards from PAY tokens, because such exchanges are not intended to be members of the membership or loyalty programme envisioned by us.  We are doing our best to complete the update of the PAY token structure as efficiently and quickly as possible with our legal advisors, and will provide a further update with more details when we are ready. We will update you with a blog post followed by a YouTube Q&A. We are confident that you, our community and PAY token holders will love the updated structure of the PAY token with the additional features.  We hope the above points clarify any existing uncertainties surrounding the PAY token for our community and partners.",False

Further you assume my math is wrong, but you fail to present more accurate numbers. I think you bought way too high this worthless piece of bits+bytes and you need to hype hot air to pass your losses on others.  The 0.5 rewards you mention, while they say themselves they earn from the 3% merchant side only 0.25%, and can't pass 0.5%, wher edo they come from? In addition the question then remains how the company can be sustainable? Yes, for now they have all your money to travel around the world, but it will be gone one day - and then ?   Quote from: moratar on November 30, 2017, 09:00:52 PM Quote from: leojust on November 29, 2017, 07:34:13 AM 104,661,310 tokens * $2,46 = $257,466,822.6 need to be collected  To make this happen we need 200 * <$ value of 0.5%> = $51,493,364,520 (close to a third of today's BTC marketcap: $167,024,234,822)  Under consideration that company tokens will get rewards as well, sooner or later (otherwise they would not have any use case or value) it becomes worse as you can imagine: 205,218,256 PAY tokens * $2,46 * 200 = $100,967,381,952  Let's calculate with 12k per person spent via the card in average, quite high, but may happen: $12,000 * 0,005 = $60 collected (0.5% reward)  So, to collect $51,493,364,520  TenX needs: $51,493,364,520 / $60 per person and yr  = 858,222,742 the amount of customer years required (one customer 10 years is equal to 10 customers one year). Bad assumptions give bad results 1) 12k usd per person per year -> most ppl who get tenx card were early in crypto bussines = they got cash. I got card for 1 month. My spending was ~11k usd in last month using card. My early spending should be close to 120k-150k usd per year. Average probably should be close to 50% or average yearly salary of person using card or more like 75%. I would say it is safe to assume 30k usd per year per user.  2) You don't count total value equal to 1 year earnings never ever!. This company will not case to exist in 1 year so this assumption that company vaporizes in 1 year is extremely faulty giving huge error. Look at Tesla P/E = infinity Netflix P/E = 189 Amazon P/E = 297 Yelp P/E = 489  (P/E is Price/Earning)  Average for tech companies is ~30. Good companies with good potential growth in future are 100+. So Tenx should have at least P/E=100.   So after fixing base assumptions, let's fix your calculations:  104,661,310 tokens * $2,46 /100(p/e) = $2,574,668 need to be collected  To make this happen we need 200 * <$ value of 0.5%> = $51,493,364  $30,000 * 0,005 = $150 collected (0.5% reward)  So, to collect $2,574,668 TenX needs: $2,574,668 / $150 per person per year = 17164 customer  using card.  As far as i can know they will get about 25k working card till end of 2017. So according to this calculation price NOW should be 2.46$(value used for calculations)*25000/17164 (really working  cards/amount from calculation) = 3,58USD per 1 PAY token.  If they get 50k working cards value should be 7,16USD, 100k working cards 35,8 USD. 1k working cards -> 1Pay = 0.35USD    Everything now depends how many cards were shipped! This is very valuable insider info.    there are 300 million ppl in crypto, rich like you, who will spent 11k per month in average? 343,289 customer years they need to justify the price you say, if they got rich customers only and company tokens can be destroyed as they never receive any rewards and the price development can catch up with BTC all the way long ?  you also hype hot air in my eyes, that is far from being reasonable numbers  I'm sorry for your losses, but take it as a man, you gambled/were fooled, do not try to pass it on to crypto-newbiews, that is not fair.   Actually it comes even worse, no rewards at all.

Quote from: leojust on November 29, 2017, 07:34:13 AM Quote from: btc_uzr on November 28, 2017, 02:44:42 PM I'm scrating my head about three things, I do not understand. Maybe one can enlighten me, please.  https://blog.tenx.tech/tenx-q-a-livestream-and-transcript-10th-oct-2017-146c826cf66c Quote 17) If we get rid of cards, will PAY holders still get the reward?  We cannot guarantee the 0.5% on any payment system, because on some payment systems we may not have 0.5% With any new payment systems that we are adding, we may be subject to different conditions. If we only get 0.25% from someone, we cannot forward you 0.5%. That said, we are not intending to remove the 0.5% from the debit card, because the commissions are there.  1) Do they consider to get rid of cards, if so what is their business then, if not why mention it in first place ?  2) They can't even offer the promised 0.5%, because they themselves may just get 0.25% and also have to cover operations, wages, offices, etc from it ?   3) My last question is the most important one. The only value driver for the PAY token is the 0.5% reward mentioned in the whitepaper as far as I understand. To justify today's token price of $2.46 right now derived from 0.5% of all transactions means:  104,661,310 tokens * $2,46 = $257,466,822.6 need to be collected  To make this happen we need 200 * <$ value of 0.5%> = $51,493,364,520 (close to a third of today's BTC marketcap: $167,024,234,822)  Under consideration that company tokens will get rewards as well, sooner or later (otherwise they would not have any use case or value) it becomes worse as you can imagine: 205,218,256 PAY tokens * $2,46 * 200 = $100,967,381,952  Let's calculate with 12k per person spent via the card in average, quite high, but may happen: $12,000 * 0,005 = $60 collected (0.5% reward)  So, to collect $51,493,364,520  TenX needs: $51,493,364,520 / $60 per person and yr  = 858,222,742 the amount of customer years required (one customer 10 years is equal to 10 customers one year).  Let's take a 10yrs forcast time (valid for some long term investors), it means TenX needs to have 85,822,274 customers spending $12k in average per year, and all company tokens must be destroyed. Otherwise the number roughly doubles to ~170,000,000 customers. If we do the math with 0.25% rewards it is >300 million customers required. Just to break even on today's token price, while BTC keeps rising. And break even means not to make any profit at all.  => Why does anyone buy it at these prices  ?  Tell me, please, WHAT do I miss here?? * Is my math based on wrong facts and weird assumptions? * Is there any obviously error I can't spot ? * Or sth else I'm too blind to see ?  I'm VERY confused, since it seems I miss a few major points and thus look like a fool not getting the actual point.  To be clear: I want a fact-based discussion about it, a major bit missing in my picture, please help me to get it resolved. If you call my valid question just FUD, I'll call you just a marketmanipulator in return, because you are obviously NOT interessted in facts but play with ppl's emotions, only.  Thanks to whoever is willing to point me to the missing bits, much appreciated. You actually managed to silence the TenX fanboyz, not one of them can answer your question without admitting the project lacks the ability to make a profit for card/token holders as suggested.  Well done using the truth to point out the failures of this scammy over promising under delivering project.  Meantime Dr Julian still has a cult following and is the savior for one and all.     Haha no he simply got the analysis wrong and nobody has corrected him yet. Let's go through it bit by bit now.  1) I don't even know what you are asking here but no their main business isn't to get rid of cards. It is to make it so that you can spend BTC, ETH, DASH, ERC20 tokens and more through their app. This is step 1 with the ultimate goal like others mentioned to be able to spend fiat  2) LOL what kind of random assumption is this? They ran an ICO and that is what pays for the office, wages, etc etc. They said several times now the 0.5 rewards will be coming soon either end of year or early next year there is nothing hidden here.  3) First off you use a wrong # in $2.46 but I will let that slide because that isn't the biggest mistake here. Your biggest mistake in the calculations is using the circulating supply as the right number. This is wildly incorrect as devs, founders, exchanges, none of these individuals will receive the dividend. I obviously don't know how many tokens this is but simply put your calculation will be off 100%.  Then after that because that is incorrect the rest is moot, but even then I couldn't understand what you were trying to do at all. It is a complete fail please re go back look at the WP and do some hwk. Because why are you even going 104m tokens x 2.46 for price justification? That is what the marketcap is it has nothing to do with payouts. Payouts are based on how much people spend and this will be distributed through the tokens that qualify which is the only math you should be doing imho.",False

I spoke with someone from china and apparently no one carries credit cards there, it's just all virtual on their phone.  When you sign up for a card, I think the physical card is optional.  You can get a virtual card and it costs less or it's free or something.  2) I think what they were talking about is if you withdraw money from an ATM, there is no merchant fee at the ATM.  Without a merchant to charge there's no fee that TenX can kick back money to the token holders (except for maybe the 2.75 they charge?).  I also think banks issuing their cards can make deals with some merchants that lower the percent taken by TenX but TenX is working on issuing it's own cards.  3) I did the math a while back and I came to a worse conclusion at first.  I used 200,000,000 instead of 100,000,000 in my calculations, so I got twice the number you did.  100,000,000 is in circulation and 100,000,000 is held by TenX.  Then I read that tokens on exchanges won't take part in the payout and I think (correct me if i'm wrong) the tokens held by TenX won't take part until they get distributed to employees and to other people during promotions.  So I estimated maybe 50,000,000 to 80,000,000 were going to take part at first then it will grow close to 200,000,000 minus what's on the exchanges as time goes on.  The 0.5% reward is what they are giving out right now.  They are currently getting a banking license (scheduled at the end of 2018).  With a banking license they can issue their own debit / credit cards and do the other stuff that banks do.  Right now TenX uses a bank to issue their debit cards so they get a smaller chunk of the ~3% merchant fees.  The 3% fees are split between the card issuing bank, visa and the bank taking the money.  In TenX's case they get a percent of what the card issuing bank gets.  When I search online for credit cards, I see a lot of credit cards that have a 2% cash back on them.  I'm guessing TenX can get up to 2% and the remaining 1% is split between the bank taking the money and visa.  So it's not unreasonable to think the 0.5% can increase significantly.  I doubt it will / can go beyond 2% though.  I believe coinbase has a debit card and it's pretty popular.  You can spend bitcoin and with a few uncommon modifications, you can spend ethereum.  The daily limits are pretty low though.  TenX does not charge anything to go from crypto to fiat (I think coinbase charges at least 1.5%).  I think when you sell your crypto, TenX finds the best price for you on a number of different exchanges instead of just one exchange so you get a better conversion price on top of that.  TenX has a few tokens that work on top of Eth and BTC in beta.  Even if the TenX card charges 1% to use their debit card, it's still better than the best alternative i've seen so far.    Right now TenX is not planning on charging for people or exchanges to use Comit (An Exchange protocol they are making like 0X only better because if you look into it, Comit can find better prices via a protocol like the routing protocol ""Open Shortest Path First"").  TenX is not even planning to use TenX as gas in the protocol.  I doubt coin holders would get anything from Comit other than deflation if Pay tokens are used as gas like 0x.  I'm also looking at the spending habits of some people I know who were early crypto investors.  They have crypto debit cards that charge them when they use it and they only complain about the low spending limits.  I think TenX limits are higher.  I won't go into the 0.1% cash back (in pay tokens) to the card holders because I think that's a wash (money going out and money going back in).  I view it as owning dividends of a debit card company while also owning dividends from their incomplete projects that are similar to Omasie go and ripple / coinbase / 0x.     If anyone would like to pay it forward I have a question.  What is a Visa program manager?  I heard about it a few days / weeks ago and asked about it but no one answered.  From a google search it sounds like it's just a step in complying to banking regs.  Does it do anything else?  Super thanks to anyone who answers this.",False

I got card for 1 month. My spending was ~11k usd in last month using card. My early spending should be close to 120k-150k usd per year. Average probably should be close to 50% or average yearly salary of person using card or more like 75%. I would say it is safe to assume 30k usd per year per user.  2) You don't count total value equal to 1 year earnings never ever!. This company will not case to exist in 1 year so this assumption that company vaporizes in 1 year is extremely faulty giving huge error. Look at Tesla P/E = infinity Netflix P/E = 189 Amazon P/E = 297 Yelp P/E = 489  (P/E is Price/Earning)  Average for tech companies is ~30. Good companies with good potential growth in future are 100+. So Tenx should have at least P/E=100.   So after fixing base assumptions, let's fix your calculations:  104,661,310 tokens * $2,46 /100(p/e) = $2,574,668 need to be collected  To make this happen we need 200 * <$ value of 0.5%> = $51,493,364  $30,000 * 0,005 = $150 collected (0.5% reward)  So, to collect $2,574,668 TenX needs: $2,574,668 / $150 per person per year = 17164 customer  using card.  As far as i can know they will get about 25k working card till end of 2017. So according to this calculation price NOW should be 2.46$(value used for calculations)*25000/17164 (really working  cards/amount from calculation) = 3,58USD per 1 PAY token.  If they get 50k working cards value should be 7,16USD, 100k working cards 35,8 USD. 1k working cards -> 1Pay = 0.35USD   Everything now depends how many cards were shipped!

Oh wait didn't they say they won't provide details as too how much cards there are now. And where's the proof there are 500 cards being shipped everyday. I tend to be skeptical when a company promises things that seem to be extended over and over again. I recalled that the cards were promised way before Nov. Then moved to November. Then now moved to Q1.  Asking for patience is fair for a start up. I do like the project and what it is trying to do. Would they be able to accomplish it? I'm not sure. But I do support what they want to do. And critism is something normal and important to drive people and company to be do better.  If by working you mean a product has a few of its product actually working. Then someone could just say I have a working debit card even if he had only 10 customers with working debit cards out of 1000 who ordered. I don't think that is really something to be proud of. I think that's actually a failure.  I hope you people are able to look at the big picture instead of only looking at yourself. The over all situation. Just because you got your cards does not mean it's a success. Specially those who actually invested in ico. If you want the company to actually do better. Offering constructive critism is important.  Saying that's its OK for people to wait 1yr for their cards is OK as long as I have mine already does not really help them grow. Even if I receive my card I will still push for the company to step up and actually be able to speed up their issuance. After all it is their main and only business angle at the moment.  Sure there were hiccups that delayed their issuance. But that doesn't mean they don't deserve critism for not being able to deliver at a reseonable time. A customer who actually criticize a product is helpful and constructive. That means he was disappointed but clearly wanted the product to improve. A customer who walks away without a word just thinks the product is trash.,False

Before I actually ordered this card and installed this app I was using another app. That app did not do any ico. No fundraising.  Installed it. Ordered an on online card for free. Loaded it up w BTC. Paid for my 1st item in literally mins. Compared to tenx they couldn't do that in 5 months. BTW I live in a 3rd world country. Surely if a small team of 3rd world techs can do that a team with better funding can do more.  Yup sure that app lost its card function temporarily. Buy its still far useful than the tenx app. I pay my bills using the app and send money to different bank accounts all within the app and in just a few clicks. Still can buy anything I want online with a local debit card where I send my funds to. I can also buy BTC on the app itself. I can even cash out at probably a thousand locations in my country instantly.  So forgive me if I have more expectations from a bigger more funded company. And BTW there were 2 of such app here. I just wanted an upgrade from a bigger company. So far mostly disappointed. Maybe we have better developers here. Or maybe tenx just need to step up and deliver better than some small 3rd world team with less funding and no fund raising.,False

Maybe one can enlighten me, please.  https://blog.tenx.tech/tenx-q-a-livestream-and-transcript-10th-oct-2017-146c826cf66c    1) Do they consider to get rid of cards, if so what is their business then, if not why mention it in first place ?  2) They can't even offer the promised 0.5%, because they themselves may just get 0.25% and also have to cover operations, wages, offices, etc from it ?   3) My last question is the most important one. The only value driver for the PAY token is the 0.5% reward mentioned in the whitepaper as far as I understand. To justify today's token price of $2.46 right now derived from 0.5% of all transactions means:  104,661,310 tokens * $2,46 = $257,466,822.6 need to be collected  To make this happen we need 200 * <$ value of 0.5%> = $51,493,364,520 (close to a third of today's BTC marketcap: $167,024,234,822)  Under consideration that company tokens will get rewards as well, sooner or later (otherwise they would not have any use case or value) it becomes worse as you can imagine: 205,218,256 PAY tokens * $2,46 * 200 = $100,967,381,952  Let's calculate with 12k per person spent via the card in average, quite high, but may happen: $12,000 * 0,005 = $60 collected (0.5% reward)  So, to collect $51,493,364,520  TenX needs: $51,493,364,520 / $60 per person and yr  = 858,222,742 the amount of customer years required (one customer 10 years is equal to 10 customers one year).  Let's take a 10yrs forcast time (valid for some long term investors), it means TenX needs to have 85,822,274 customers spending $12k in average per year, and all company tokens must be destroyed. Otherwise the number roughly doubles to ~170,000,000 customers. If we do the math with 0.25% rewards it is >300 million customers required. Just to break even on today's token price, while BTC keeps rising. And break even means not to make any profit at all.  => Why does anyone buy it at these prices  ?  Tell me, please, WHAT do I miss here?? * Is my math based on wrong facts and weird assumptions? * Is there any obviously error I can't spot ? * Or sth else I'm too blind to see ?  I'm VERY confused, since it seems I miss a few major points and thus look like a fool not getting the actual point.  To be clear: I want a fact-based discussion about it, a major bit missing in my picture, please help me to get it resolved.

Your concerns are valid. If I understand you correctly, you are assuming that the price of the token will pay for itself in a year. In a traditional stock, the logic you applied does not exist also; I know PAY isn't a security (maybe) and the reason is that with traditional stock the price is attached to partial ownership of the company too. But as a retail investor in traditional stock, let's face it, that amounts to nothing unless you own a majority share. In the same way the ""rights"" of a retail investor is ""like"" what we have now as a PAY token holder; nothing. Humor me for a second and assume we can ignore that fact. Traditional stock dividend is normally about 2-5% of the stock price, lets put it at 3%. With that you can use the 3% to back calculate what is the amount of transaction needed and project the amount of users it needs to achieve. I think that is a more realistic view.

They argued the figures just didn't add up. However, the community freaked out about it and the price tanked...  I personally think that their new business model of 6 month token lock-up for platinum feature cards (with much higher cashback etc) is now going to be a much greater token price driver. Why? Well, firstly the sell pressure is going to be drastically reduced as people buy to lock-up and not sell. Secondly the demand is going to increase IF the product is superior to anything else available (which on paper it will be). Finally, as the sell pressure drops, the buy pressure increases and the user base grows, Monaco will need to hold higher reserves of MCO to pay out the cashback (which they intend to buy from the Market).  But hey, the community want a replacement asset contract, so they're looking into that too - I just don't know how they'll make the numbers work with this either (even with only a 9million Circulating supply)...",False

It affects any Crypto card issuer who is VISA or MasterCard certified. They are all in the same boat.  There are three things involved effectively. The company behind the card (TenX in this case), the card issuer (was WaveCrest, think they may have been replaced now?) and the card certifier (in this case, VISA). Rules work their way down the chain. And the non-EU part is a VISA/MasterCard decision (VISA made it first, MasterCard followed later), so they all get affected.  I believe this should be resolved in the longer term. That was certainly the aim. But I don't know what the current state of play is.  For me, TenX is a long term hold anyway.

Just because you or other people in the waitlist haven't gotten your cards yet DOES NOT mean that TenX cards are non functional. Many users have shown that they have gotten the card and have shown through youtube videos how it works. I am in the waiting list myself (outside EU) and realize I have to wait patiently for my card but by no means does this mean they have no working product.  With 500 cards going out everyday and the EU list to be completed by Christmas we can all say this is good progress from where it began. For those outside EU expect Q1 2018 delivery and lest we forget they have outsourced the delivery now! All this combined should show you that they have a working product and they are working diligently to get it done.

I think the card is available in europe and asia?  The card is scheduled for release in the United States at the end of this month or early december (soft schedule).  It lets you spend BTC, ETH, EC20 tokens, Dash and maybe a few others using the card and an app.  .1% in pay tokens goes to the person spending money on their tenx card.  They're building a protocol that is going to be a bridge between exchanges banks and tenx card holders.  They aren't going to charge people money to use the protocol and they're planning on making money by being the first one on the network.    I suspect that if governments push tenx to be something other than a coin that pays dividends, you might see pay tokens used in the network somehow or maybe voting rights on something.  Tenx is currently working on a banking license right now too.  They said it would take around a year to complete.  This allows them to issue cards themselves and pocket more of the 2-3% debit card merchant fees that happen when you swipe the card.  I think Julian said they aren't interested in loaning out money and other stuff they can do with a banking license right now.  They also haven't mentioned what they will do with the increased revenue.  If they will give it to the token holders, the people who get the debit card or reinvest in tenx.",False

We risked our cash investing into Tenx. They could fail, they could run away with our money. We are past the extremal risky phase. Pay price is back to ICO level even though they didn't fail/run away with money. You are literally getting few month of successful work of tem, and you get ideas implemented into reality for free.  Sure other company can work very hard - but not always hard work ends with success.  Think about cake You can buy super tasty cake for 10 usd, looks great, smells delicious you even took a bit and it is amazing! Now you can choose to buy this tasty cake or maybe you will give 10 usd to some random guy and he will make cake for you. Maybe he will make it maybe not, maybe he will add some cherry on top which your cake dosn't have, or maybe he will spit into your cake... risk... and no reward.  Is it anywhere close to beeing wise to risk losing 10 usd, and waiting half a year for this guy to bake you a cake, if you can just pay 10usd and you can have tasty cake, one that you know it tastes good?   Same price but you get huge risk investing into copycat company. I do value Tenx more because they were really the first creating working live-traded-btc card. Why bitcoin is worth 30 times more than bitcoin gold? Preety much same coins, but BTC was first - you could use it you trust it.  With tenx you get possibility to buy BTC at BTG price, and you consider to buy BTG because maybe BTG will succed? For me it is insane to buy company-wannabe and pay same ICO-level price as for working company.

Was paying for airline tickets online, was buying car insurance online. It just works same as any VISA card + you get 2 extra features with tenx.  In shops, no cashier ever figured out it is somehow unusual card that pays using BTC. Shops had no idea i was are using BTC. Since all extra operations were done instantly by tenx, the moment you had enter your PIN number. No one can tell a difference, exept you - since you can see BTC transactions on your phone.   Crypterium is idea. Maybe it will be a company maybe it will be a scam, maybe they will run away with your ICO money, maybe they have no chances.... Tenx is 100% working company. Product was delivered to customers and successfully used by customers. It simply works.  You can really compare a ""Working company"" with someone that has idea to create company. Huge difference in having a house and planing to build one, you feel me?  Without house you are homeless, and crypterium is asking ppl to give their cash to the homeless guy so he can try building his new house. Kinda pointless, very risky, and not really rewarding.  Tenx already managed to create company, and their token price is at same btc price as when they were just starting company.  So you want to input cash into crytperium, and if they will manage to success, fight with competition than at best they make you lose not all cash but just a bit... that's like super retarded plan You already got TENX working with sucessfull company still at tokens at ICO prices.

I paid something on the web in USD, something in a local sport store in EUR and something else at Amazon Uk in GBP. Also used it to draw some money from ATM (approx 50‚Ç¨). Well, no problems so far and an exchange rate always very close to stock exchange rates - at least always less then 1% difference to what coinmarketcap calculates, so much better then using my usual credit card when I have to pay somethin in not foreign currencies.  End of this year I will do a trip to south america and I thing this card is ideal to get some cash there without much fees Realy like this opportunity.  Additionally I managed to add the card to PayPal. Only small drawback is that the card seems to prohibit transactions back to the card. So I was able to verify it for PayPal, but I think the 1.5$ PayPal charged me to send the verification code are lost. Never the less it is connected and verified now and should work without further obstacles.  The only think that still bugs me is transaction time and fees on the Bitcoin Blockchain. Last time it took alsmost one and a half hour to get my funds there although I used a rather high fee. It only takes 3 confirmations for TenX to confirm your incomming funds, but in that case there was a small period with bad luck on the BTC chain and alone 70 minutes for that 3 blocks. Plus waiting time until my transaction was included into the first block. I realy hope that ETH / ERC20 feature is unlocked for all soon.  On the other hand I consider moving my monthly income (at least that part of it that I can freely spend) to the card. Volatlity is still a concern, but overall it is just great. Go wherever an ATM is without minding the fee, spend wherever you are in local currency and gain money over time if BTC keeps increasing. And of cause adding volume to the TenX card will increase dividends for all, attract more people to buy PAY and make the investion in PAY a good one  I just like this product",False

Took me a short while googling to figure out what has happened.

Click me for a picture of the card   Well ‚Ä¶ since a lot of you may be waiting for it I think it is a good idea to describe my experiences with it so far. I have to excuse that for this post I somehow was to dump to get thumbnails in here. Also I was not able to do screenshots of the app directly, since the app does not allow to take some...   1) Ordering the Card  Well that was rather easy. Just install the mobile app, choose a pin and insert some personal data (mail address, name and so on). Then swap some small BTC to the mobile app that is worth at least 15 dollars and hid the card button on the front page of the app. There you have to insert some data about your address to get KYC level 1 (more about KYC later) and then you can order it. In my opinion rather simle.  2) Receiving the Card and Activation Well waiting was a pain. As mentioned it took three month between the order and the card arrival. In the meantime the app was only useful as a nice looking mobile wallet. Thats it. But finally on November 11th it arrived surprisingly. Interestingly I received the mail with the DHL tracking code one day after on November 12th xD  Activating the card is simple. Just go to the card menu point in the app and tab on activate. Then you have to insert the last 4 digits of your card number (that you only know once you have it in our hand ‚Äì I can not remember that it way printed anywhere else). Afterwards the card menu in the app changes. It now shows your card balance in BTC, SGD (Singapur Dollar) and in your selected currency (Euro in my case). The exchange rate for you seems to be fixed four you for 15 minutes once opening this tab.  On the bottom there are two additional panels for showing your ATM pin (thumbs up that it is so easy to see it) and a button to hit for reaching KYC level 2. Also you have the opportunity to lock your card right there in the app, e.g. when it is lost. And also you can unlock it right when you found it back. I like that function.  3) KYC level      Currently there are 3 KYC (know your customer) level around that are important for us.  KYC 0 is plainly that the company knows almost nothing about the customer. Maybe they have a valid Email address, but thats it. It is clear that TenX can not work with this level, because they have to send you something physical.  KYC 1 means that they have a working address where you can receive physical mail. This does not mean  that you are residing at that address or that your name is real. Just that post with that information gets delivered.  With KYC 2 it is verified you are a living person with exactly that name living at the address you gave them. This usually requires a photo of some passport or something similar as well as a photo of some document proving that your are residing at the address.  So why should be switch to KYC 2 with TenX card? Well due to the European Union money laundering laws the livetime load of a prepaid card (which is the TenX from laws point of view) is bounded by 2.500$ / 2500‚Ç¨ and the limit for daily ATM withdrawal is set to 2x 200‚Ç¨ / $. From December 10th onwards the limits will be even more sharp. Then livetime limit in KYC 1 is 250 ‚Ç¨ and one time limit is 100 ‚Ç¨ because of new EU regulations. This is nothing unique to TenX and also affects other similar cards (e.g. I have a Uquid card with same limitations).  So reaching KYC 2 will help getting the full potential out of the card. For this you must tab on the above mentioned panel in the app. Then you can select which type of document you would like to submit. I personally selected front page of my traveling passport and a page of a telephone company bill. You can chose to use your mobiles camera or some photo from the phone gallery right from the app. Note that I had to do this twice, because I somehow missed the condition that each picture must be smaller then 400 kbytes and the pics generated by my phone camera were larger‚Ä¶ The app does not warn you about it, I just got a message one day later that the size was to large. But after resizing them it worked.  It took two days and a few hours (it was sometime at night) for my card to switch to KYC level 2. Now the original button vanished and was replace by some FAQ and get support button. By the informations from settings menu my daily limit is now 20.000 $, single transaction limit 10.000$ and no lifetime limit. Note that two days is very quickly for the KYC 2, because the document musts be visited by humans. Many exchanges require much longer for the verification.  4) Using the Card Directly this morning my car complained about fuel being empty, so I decided to buy some with the freshly activated card. Well and what to say except from it worked just fine. Gave my card, they scanned it and asked for the PIN. I typed the one in from the app and the same moment I felt that my phone was vibrating because I got a notification about a successful payment.  Click me for a picture of the notification   Beside the notification from the app I also got an Email with the same information. The exchange rate was only 0.35% off the average exchange rate of Kraken and Bitfinex at that moment (I checked it before leaving the station). Very nice, because the rate at most European exchange is worse. Right now the rate is in an uptrend. Poor me, a hour later my fuel would be less expensive. But thats life.  Click me for a picture of the receipt  Overall Impression If this would be a review I would say its a 4/5 with the two minus points being the long waiting time and that currently I only can use BTC for loading the card. With other coins the daily use may be much higher due to lesser block times (e.g. Ethereum, all ERC 20 or ZEC) and lesser transaction fees. Never the less the product itself is working very well ‚Äì I was surprised that APP and physical card are working good together. This also may be a reason why it is so hard fining an other card issuer, because the application programming interface of WaveCrest that allows such an integration of the card is rather unique. Therefore I can understand that they chose this issuer for their cards.  But if TenX sticks to their plans in adding more currencies and finding either some new issuer or is sometime be able to issue their own cards ‚Äì well this is an amazing product.    Ps: For all those who got kind of burned when buying PAY tokens at higher price I have some investment strategy for you: buy more right now! Why? Well I also bought about 10 PAY when it was at 4$ each. I personally hate selling with loss if I do not require the money urgently, so I hold this token all the way down.  Now I bought additionally 100 at about 1.65$. So I am still in loss zone, but calculator said I bought 110 PAY for 205$, so if 1 PAY goes up again above 1.87$ I am already in the winning zone. The idea is simple: if you were thinking that 4$ was a nice price for a product, then be happy to buy more of it at even lower price So far so good. Stopping here right now before this post gets too long. Thanks for everyone that read all of what came into my mind and have a nice day.",False

Remembering the FAQ of TenX correctly it is important for the dividends to have your PAY in an erc 20 enabled wallet, e.g. a wallet that is allowed to perform contracts. I assume that there will be an ethereum based contract that will pay out the dividend to PAY token holders. So you can pick whatever wallet you like as long as this is ensured.  For exchange wallets this would mean that the exchange uses kind of real addresses and does not one or few addresses with multiple input addresses where deposits are only distinguished by the used incoming address and your balance is only stored in some database. I do not think that there is an exchange out there with this feature, so better monitor the TenX announcements and when it is time move your PAY of the exchange beforehand.  @ All other: thanks for your comments - I thought is would be nice having some user experiences from non-tenx team members. I also think it would be great if everyone that received his / her card would post here when it was ordered and when it was received, so we get an idea on how far they are with processing the long queue.",False

The logic of you guys is legitimately confused. Someone's first post has to follow a certain topic protocol?... Most people make accounts after a while of reading and not being able to stay silent any longer...because it's a pain to sign up to any new website and make passwords, verify, etc. So clearly this guy was sick of shilling and made an account to throw his 2 cents in. I don't necessarily instantly agree with their sentiment, I havn't tried to verify either way, but it's sickening to see the first response ""new account spreading FUD"" .... you guys must have a lot of neurons firing at once eh? Who is to say he's the all-knowing authority on the practices of WiredCard (or w/e it is) and their NDA's, but instead of disproving him (if possible) you jump straight to a non-argument.  For the record, since I'm assuming now either your post contents are garbage, or you bought an account with some months in it already (more reason to why age of account is meaningless), FUD is unnecessary doubt....when a guy says ""this doesn't make sense, this wouldn't happen this way"" and you don't even have any evidence to the contrary, that's not FUD....  If he were to say, like the other guy, ""Julian says TenX is currently way too overpriced at 1.59"" without any video or slack evidence (because no ceo in their right mind would say that in this market), THAT'S fudding bro...  God I really didn't have a dog in the fight but people who instantly shill and call FUD to anyone even with reasonable questions/doubts are 1000x worse than fudders  For the record I'm holding my tenx...and the only reason I'll sell is for short term elsewhere, but I'll go back as soon as I see some fresh ground being gained",False

Here is the update so you don't have to click my link if you don't want to.  ""Monaco just announced today that it has eliminated the asset SmartContract. This significantly reduces the long term value of the token. One thing that will drive the value of MCO, that I originally missed, is that the rewards for the card are paid in MCO (.75% MCO back). This means Monaco has to purchase MCO from the open market to give to card users. This will create demand, but since the tokens aren't destroyed, and most users will simply convert MCO to BTC or cash, it is hard to say it will be a major driver of MCO value. And this relies on Monaco not issuing more MCO, which I still can't find black-and-white confirmation of.  The other thing that drives value of MCO is that the cards that give you MCO back ""cost"" MCO to get. If you want a Platinum card, you have to buy 50 MCO and keep it for six months. However, the MCO isn't destroyed, and after six months you can do what ever you want with your MCO. It is hard seeing this adding much value long term.

Week hands like you go look for some other projects. It is a startup, they have a ton of things to do, but they don't have unlimited money to hire supporters. I ordered my card before you, but I did not send a single email. Why? Because people like you are the reason, that people with real need for support won't get help. They start talking bad, we all suffer, just because of people like you: When you ordered, it clearly said that there is a waiting list and you won't get an ETA! So what are you complaining about???  It is so funny, people with no clue come to crypto world and expect a lambo within a month... haha... But it works like this: Make your research, buy a coin, have a look at it a year later (earliest). Then you either did a bad research, had bad luck because somebody screwed up or you made some money.  The sooner all the people like you left the project, the more profits others make.",False

Some still waiting since July, others getting theirs in around a month. Personally, I'm in the UK and have been waiting since Sep 2. In a live Q&A a week or so back I think Julian said that in the EU cards would definitely arrive before xmas - yes, an age! Let's hope BTC hasn't topped (or worse; I think you know what I mean) before they arrive. I'm only keeping a modest amount mostly for using with the debit card. Also, with the news of Ethereum executing Byzantium, I believe TenX were waiting for this before introducing Ether as another option with the card - only testers  have been using it up to now.

It is important to TenX that our entire system, not just the card or the company, but the entire system is 100% legitimate, 100% legal. To be honest, we had expected Metropolis, not just Byzantium, but also Constantinople, to happen in October. Our original plan was to distribute it in October, but due to legal considerations, we want Casper to be live first. This will allow us to mimic that, and use a similar structure to distribute the rewards. In the event that Constantinople and Casper is delayed, we will explore other options to integrate and distribute the rewards. It is of the highest importance to us that our token is 100% secure, legal and safe. I just had a call with MAS on Monday regarding this. By the way, for those planning to do an ICO in Germany, I met BAFIN, the German regulatory body, and they are starting to become open to the idea of token sales.  https://blog.tenx.tech/tenx-q-a-livestream-and-transcript-10th-oct-2017-146c826cf66c",False

Centra aims to have their own blockchain and not just be a ERC20 token 2. Centra plans on having a Fiat Gateway on their mobile app so you can buy crypto with your USD exactly like Coinbase (this is probably the single biggest reason why I like them over TenX) 3. Centra Has way higher spending limits than TenX 4. Centra is shipping cards worldwide (first crypto debit card to ship worldwide) 5. All crypto stored on Centra app is 100% insured (yes you heard that correctly). In the event someone loses their crypto, you will get it back. 6. Centra Card will support 12 cryptocurrencies. TenX only supports 3 7. You will get 1% cash back with Centra and only .1% with TenX 8. Centra is opening their own marketplace to buy goods and services (Called Cbay and its released in 2 months). 9. New celebrity endorsements Mayweather and Khaled (not that this is very important but it adds a lot more credibility to the project). 10.

Approximately 20,000+ cards, reading between the lines of what is said in their videos. I could be wrong though. They don't want to tell because they don't want to give their competitors information.  I already received my card, I use it almost everyday. Works like a charm, i never had any issues with app or card.  It is a temporary card even though I live in the EU.

I used to think Tenx is great company. Extremaly open and truthtelling. I did order card from tenx almost 2 months ago. Till yesterday i did have 3000 PAY tokens. I did really trust them.  Since i am kinda suspicious and i like to get my doubts cleared i asked brandon.tenx on their slack what will happen if BitGo which holds all private keys goes bancrupt. I got replay that it will not affect Tenx becouse it is actually Tenx that holds all keys. So why BCC was not delivered to their customers. Reply was: Becouse it would compromise security.  But if you recall different story was written 2 months ago on Tenx blog. ""In case of a potential fork, our partner BitGo (who is handling the users‚Äô private keys) has not announced whether they will definitely support any other than the SegWit chain. This means, should there be a fork that sustains and you definitely want to be on both chains, you have to move your Bitcoins into a wallet whose private key you control. (https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) Remember that you have to withdraw your Bitcoins before July 31st because on that day we will not allow withdrawals or deposits."" Source: https://blog.tenx.tech/tenx-and-a-potential-bitcoin-fork-on-august-1st-8e64fb9481f8  What does that mean in my opinion:  Tenx has access to private keys but they didn't want to compromise security or they didn't want to handle it so they lied telling story about Bitgo, that it was Bitgo decision if users will get their BCC or not.   They LIED.  I don't care about BCC, i don't care if Tenx didn't bother about users BCC.  I care that Tenx to which i did put a lot of trust, and i considered it a GREAT company because they are always 100% trustworthy.  But once they got caught on a lie, I would like to get explanations, but I never got any. I got accused about spreading FUD and i got banned from Tenx Slack.  Well was i really spreading FUD? I found that Tenx lied. I was the one who had Uncertainty, Doubt becouse i noticed a lie, i would really like to have this Uncertainty&Doubt removed by some reasonable answer. But nope - ban was easier. Who cares about truth - it is easier just to close inconvenient topic.  Was it really eazier? For a company of which ""creator"" always says truth and transparency is very important.  That lie was the stroke that broke a camels back.  There were also other issues: 1) Customers who were in card queue since August or earlier (cant remember exact date) were promised to get card till end of October? or September. Seriously ? I paid for card in 25th of July. 2 months ago and still no card nor any email about progress. For sure i will not get card in September. October dosn't seem likely as well. Shipping usually takes 2 weeks. 2) Julian said Wavecrest issue won't affect Tenx - it is not really a truth as well. It does affect Tenx customers. If you want to think about tenx as a company 100% independant from customers than yes it is truth, but customers did get affected. I am from europe so i didn't care much about it. But it was a ""Red Flag"". 3) Eth wallets were promised to everyone - Not delivered. 4) Julian said he dosn't care about PAY value or about traders, and he dosn't care if traders will get reward from Tenx'es card users traffic Seriously? 25M PAY tokens is inside Bittrex. It is 25% of all tokens, and he dosn't care... whatever. 5) point 2+4  really sound like ""I don't care about you, i don't care about our customers,"" Those issues will affect YOU - our customers, but it won't affect TENX. It is your problem, not ours. Seriously how long will tenx last without customers, without profits? It will last only as long as they still have cash from ICO, as soon as ICO cash is burned Tenx will go bancrupt.   I really didn't care much about 1,2,3,4,5 becouse i TRUSTED tenx.  But if i get lied, and banned and my questions are not responded but they are censored, than i can't trust tenx any more.  I got very disappointed, i feel my trust was abused.   Am i really spreading FUD - No it is tenx words that did create FUD i am just a victim i asked for help. Asked for explanation and all i got was kick in ass, and middle finger was shown to me.",False

Good thing in your post is that you said you're uptight.  Well, so am I, so we're the same there.  I think if you stepped back from the situation and tried a view from 30,000 feet, you'd see that you'd give Amazon or Target or LL Bean more leeway if they F---ked up an order than TenX....and I don't see how Tenx made any mess ups yet according to your post.  They issued cards in Europe, and candidly admitted that Wavecrest bailed on them outside of Europe. So....what should they do?  They've got to get another company to make cards outside of Europe.  Will that cause delay?  Of course.  Should you liquidate 3,000 tokens?  No (unless you want to sell them to me!! haha)  You've got a guy who has pasted his face all over the internet; he's flying around the world meeting with big shots.  He'd be out of his mind to be a grifter, because he must know that people who invest in this company know how to buy a plane ticket and track him down.  Seriously....you've got to relax.  I liken posts like yours to the old saying ""if it sounds too good to be true...""  Listening to you whine about things that are typical in business transactions with Walmart, Target, Amazon etc. means, to me, that what you want out of Tenx is far more than ANY company can deliver.

Solutions as offered by TenX could be the start of this, but people doing so will probably hold only small amounts to contain the risk of big price swings.

It would be great if they could scale up quicker. - like any start up there is the risk of not carrying off the master plan - if they are very successful they might be bought by a large payment processor who doesn‚Äôt invest in the PAY token platform (since this is a cost that brings little long term advantage for the long term).",False

Majority of investors have limited amounts of money to spend, but still want to maximize their profits. PAY is younger than ETH, and will most likely go through a similar process = big gains short to mid term untill it stabalizes.  But at the end of the day, we are all just speculating. Diversifying is the key. Hopefully i can buy a couple of Ethers at 200$ in the coming weeks.  ",False

With Cryptos as popular as they are today, I still struggle to find people who have even heard of bitcoin.  If these things hit the mainstream then lots of new money will keep pouring into crypto.  If bitcoin goes up, so does everything else as it represents cryptocurrency in general as it has market dominance.  The real question is, what cryptos will still be around in a few years time.

They do however release an hour video of their progress each week (which is done live on facebook so you can ask your questions), so if you want to keep up with what they are doing and how far they have got, you can.  Once they come out of beta and people start receiving cards again (end of this month for the cards) the price will start to move up.  But it is exactly that, a ""long term"" investment.  If you are patient enough you can make a good return here.  TenX has a proven product that works, they are a very capable dev team, and something that really interests me which flies under the radar a lot is their COMIT network.  An update a couple weeks ago said ""We are a lot further with this than people realise"".  If they can deliver on their promises (which from what I have seen they are very good at doing this) then this has massive potential.  Ignore people that say the token is over priced, they have no idea what they are talking about and only base the value on the dividends (which most coins don't even have let alone base their value on) rather than treat the token as a share in the company which lets face it, it effectively is.  When I say long term, I mean 6 months and onwards",False

The road to success needs determination, hard work, persistence, learning from failure and of course TIME. Also, there will be competition and someone who doesn't like TenX grow. Go and Watch how Julian convince us that this is a long term project. What are you doing to support this project? Nothing, you just put your money! If you're short term trader, this coin is not for you. This is an investment. No one knows you until you succeed, being in the top. At least next year the price should reflect the value of the token.

All of the articles talk about Tenx (except for Nasdaq about Comit, their approach to connect blockchains). If you just got in and are mad about the downtrend right now, don't be, it will rise again soon, be glad you can buy some cheap coins on the way.  Reasons why it's not a p&d coin:  - They have a working (!!!) product, which already distinguishes them from 90% of the other altcoins - They have a very active marketing team and are very active on social media - They are super transparent about their product, they hold facebook live Q&A's every week if you have questions - They have a reward program for the token holders, excluding people who hold their tokens on trading sites, so rewarding hodlers  I was lucky enough to buy coins at 30k sats, so I've already made a nice profit so far. I don't intend to trade them anytime soon, just buy some more. I bought them because I believed in the product and realized they are only baby steps from where they can go in the next few years.  Unfortunately a lot of people only heard from them since lasts enormous rise, and made some losses while FOMO'ing, so a lot of newbies are mad atm and calling it a p&d coin, which drives the market down. But soon people will realise that their product works (especially when they release web and ios app this month), and the price will go back up, definately exceeding ATH.  It's a long term coin which got some lucky momentum when OMG and NEO were pumping, but p&d is not their intent, they state very clearly they want to reduce market volatility in its whole, so people aren't afraid and weary to use crypto for everyday life..",False

We are working on a solution to exclude PAY tokens stored on exchanges and in the internal TenX contract from receiving part of the 0.5% rewards so that you as the token holders receive more bang for your buck. 3. Everyone who is on the card order waitlist right now is planned to receive their card by the end of September at the latest. Probably earlier.

I think PAY could skyrocket when it will be added on Exodus becaue lot of people will exchanging from the other coins on Exodus to PAY (also very easily)  If you want to bring PAY to Exodus just send email to them on support@exodus.io or on their slack channel https://exodus-invite.herokuapp.com,False

So, technically, they are doing just that. TenX is an ERC20 token. On the Ethereum blockchain. Even if they do their own standalone wallet, it would still be backended by the Ethereum blockchain.  Payments monthly to start with, but their aim is to increase frequency over time. Going as rapidly as hourly. As a smaller investor, if they are sending ETH over the blockchain, I would like the option to either:  a) Delay my payment until there is enough there to make it worth sending  and/or  b) Choose the ""speed"" at which I get my payment. ie - the gas used.

I didn't ask them that. First payment will be small, obviously, as the turnover won't be much to start with.  But they have a live, working product. Which, for me, gives them prime market position to expand.  For me, they make more sense as a long term proposition. Your bet in that case is that they generate enough turnover to pay a decent return.

""Stick $500 into ICO, drive off in Lambo next month"" is, quite frankly, idiot thinking.  $1bn is a drop in the ocean compared to what Visa currently process.  From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_Inc.  ""In 2015, the Nilson Report, a publication that tracks the credit card industry, found that Visa‚Äôs global network (known as VisaNet) processed 100 billion transactions with a total volume of US$6.8 trillion""  $1bn is a tiny fraction of $6.8tn. To be exact, 0.0147% if you use the American system where a trillion is a thousand billion.  If they get decent market adoption, they should be able to process a lot more than that. And that's just Visa. I didn't look up MasterCard and Amex.  And think about it. There is room in the card market for Visa AND MasterCard. And others like Amex I suppose. So there is potentially room for more than one Crypto card. Although in time, one or two are likely to dominate. My guess would be TenX and Monaco.  They don't need a big % of just the $6.8tn Visa currently process to start paying off pretty well. Hell, even $100bn is only 1.4% of the Visa turnover quoted above. So yes, it can pay off. IN THE LONG TERM.  So if you have no belief they can ever achieve this, it's because you don't believe crypto will ever go mainstream enough to generate this kind of revenue. As it has COMMIT behind it - allowing multiple currencies to be used with it, TenX can. And, for me, that's a game changer.  I'm holding.

I can clear this up once and for all. I just asked them on Slack and they answered all the questions I wasn't sure on.  So ....  1. Payback to TenX token holders is 0.5% of THE ENTIRE SPEND through the card. So 0.5% of the big number. It is mentioned specifically in the white paper as well. In short, the merchant fee (0.5%) goes to the token holders instead. All confirmed by the team on Slack.  2. Token held in exchanges ARE included in the calculation. (Boooo!)  3. Follows on from 2 really. The EXCHANGES will get the payback ETH for any tokens people leave on exchanges. The ETH simply goes to the wallet the PAY is held on. If that happens to be an exchange, the exchange gets the ETH. I suppose it's possible some of them (the exchanges) could modify things so that ERC20 custom tokens are linked to the (exchange) customer. So the customer would get the ETH. But that's not how they are set up just now. And if changing it meant they lost free ETH, would they still do it? It's up to the exchanges. Not something the TenX guys can influence.  No matter to me. With those answers, and VISA turning over $16+ trillion in 2015, I'm holding!  2% of the current VISA turnover, and the payback sums will be very nice. Very nice indeed!  (I have a screenshot of the convo on Slack if anyone is sad enough not to believe me.)     Unfortunately, not the case. See the responses I fgot from TenX on Slack above. Specifically, point 3.

So from that 3%..... 0.5% is to token holders, so there's only left 2.5%. Then VISA and other bank entity that i don't remember takes their cut from that 2.5% left.  Sometimes merchants are only charged 1.5% and still .5% is paid to token holders. And the 1% left is for visa and the issuer bank and TENX takes almost nothing from it.

Quote from: EDisney on July 20, 2017, 06:12:33 AM I don't think it's worth holding PAY because of the rewards:  PAY will be dumped even harder when people realize how ""much"" they'll actually get from the rewards:  In the roadmap of the whitepaper they forecast $1 billion transaction volume for the whole year of 2018.  So:  $1 B expected transaction volume for 2018  0.5 % goes to token holders  205,218,255.948577763364408207 tokens minted   $1,000,000.000 * 0.5% / 205,218,255.948577763364408207 = $0.0244 reward per PAY token for the whole year of 2018. Yea, thats right, but correct me if im wrong.  if its at 1000B transaction volume, that would mean 25$ reward per PAY token a year. if you have 1000 pay it's 25 000$ a year. I think you can see where I'm going with this. Imagine you have 10 000 or 100k Pay tokens. You will never have to work again",False

PAY will be accumulated and HODL¬¥ed, TenX will be supported. This team will be the winner in the future, because they already are the superior choice now.",False

Increasing monthly payments should follow from that on as adoption rises and more people receive their cards, HODL that PAY.  You will earn some money from my purchases as well when I finally receive my card too, I can certainly promise you that.  Just thinking: My bank offers zero interest.

He also became one of our early card users and gave us invaluable feedback on COMIT (www.comit.network ). When TenX was doing the seed round investment in March 2017, we were introduced to his partner Bo Shen from Fenbushi. Fenbushi became the lead investor in this round and since both Bo and Vitalik are the fund‚Äôs main partners it was natural to list them on our website.

I didn't compare payment rates in details, so I don't know what Wirex charges in comparison, but TenX charges nothing on the customer side, just standard fees on the retailer side (like any card).  I also don't know when Wirex is converting your coins, there are conflicting infos on their website. Maybe you can tell me. TenX keeps your cryptos until payment, which is perfect.

Those strategies are always used in unison and force. I would guess that this is done by a competitor to lower market cap and reputation because there are serious financial resources involved in the market manipulation. Disclaimer: this is just my guess for peace of mind and I don't want to throw specific accusations around.  But I am not worried about TenX. Worst case: they get their future funding outside of the crypto world, they had done so in the years leading up to the ICO. Their first product is finished, here to stay and will benefit a lot of crypto users nontheless. PAY tokens get enough investment return (volume share payment) from the real economy, regardless of ETH or PAY price or TenX marketcap. PAY is a good investment in my opinion (as long as the Ethereum network doesn't go completely extinct), and TenX will continue to provide products for facilitating the mass adoption of crypto currencies.",False

The TenX product is finished and shipping. The software is ready on Android, soon on iOS. You can find Youtube videos of the team using the card internationally. I hope the next batch of cards is ready soon, I am eager to use it. The rates are way better than those of any bank in my country. A suppressed PAY price doesn't matter for this in any way.

I missed the ICO (some Youtuber mentioned TenX, I saw the vid after the ICO), but I am glad that we can still board this boat without penalty. Maybe I can help you with your math, I did some back-of-the-envelope calculations for several scenarios that are not in scope of the WP to guide my investment decision. I'm new to crypto, but a veteran stock investor. You are correct, the reward seems low, but that is because 1 billion is a very low assumption for turnover of a credit card issuer. In my opinion, this is a realistic assumption by TenX because crypto is not wide spread (yet). Usually credit card companies range in the multi trillion dollar range, that would equal more than 25 dollar reward per token per year. In contrast, stock dividends are paid from profit, not turnover or even revenue, and in comparison they are considerably lower in relation to the investment. One author (on Steemit if I remember correctly) was not impressed by TenX because he assumed a 100% yearly payout to asset price ratio, which I find ridiculous as an investor. I have never seen anything like this assumption in the wild.  This reward would be a tiny amount at first/possibly enormous amount later, in addition to the PAY increase through the 0.1% volume payback (or however this is called) and in addition to the PAY increase through assets bought via market adoption.  Usually, tokens only increase in value through market adoption, so why is everybody so upset about a double bonus which just is going to be low in the beginning? Better than zero. All other tokens have zero turnover payback. And zero revenue payback. And zero dividends/profits payback. Only increase in asset price, like this one does too. After all, the business has to be sustainable to be able to pay out for years needed for adoption, and it seems to be like that, plus a small bonus for investors.  Always do your own research, but I like it. I respect the team as well, they have a lot of content online. I also downloaded the wallet which is perfectly designed and bug free (can't order my card yet because of backlog and we can't use ETH and ERC20 yet, but I'm not in a hurry).  TL;DR, I think this project would be a great choice to invest.  Best regards and keep a cool head! And HODL the other coins, seems like we're still crashing.",False

The only reason this coin hasn't skyrocketed is because someone or someones are selling at bid price every time there is a small increase in price. They lose money to keep the price low.  If there was a natural sell wall because the coin is overbought the price would have stayed the same because you just don't sell cheap to lose money, you try to get the max out of your coins. Someone selling 0.000005 lower than last ask prince is someone trying to lower the price artificially.  Either they do this to buy cheaper later or they do it to sabotage the coin.

Probably most of the people are not in this ICO for the project, they are in it to make a quick buck. All they have seen is a token that has mostly only dropped in price and are quickly selling of their last tokens to atleast not get a loss from it.  This will keep happening till the actual investors (people who are in it for what TenX' Pay is) or the people who just want to make money in a medium to long period will start buying more than what is being sold. This will probably be the beginning of the next peak. The big question of course is when this will be. The order book isn't very promising for now with more than double the amount of people that still want to sell. Too many people see these ICO's and tokens as normal stock trading because they are only in it for the cash.  It wouldnt surprise me if this token goes to 0,65-0,8 USD before it gets new momentum.  Whether TenX is selling too or not is a whole other question that only makes this worse.",False

I picked up some PAY tokens last night at a decent price since I was like 10 seconds too late to get in on the ICO. It seems like a great product.  I have a couple questions so forgive me if its already been covered.  About the card, do we know if it is anonymous (besides crypto addresses visible on blockchains)? Do the big credit card companies require us to fill out our names with identification, or can we use the card anonymously?  Also, has anyone done the numbers on a good estimate of the .5% interest we are supposed to get monthly as token holders? Does that really mean we will be paid .5% of the total amount of money spent around the planet using the TenX card every month? But its divided amongst all token holders right? So the more people use it, the less we receive as a bonus? Maybe I read it wrong. Are there any good guesstimates about the revenue for this as token holders?  I'm glad to be a part of this project, as well as others. We're transitioning into a better decentralized system, and a big thank you to the developers who work their asses off to give us these opportunities",False

I'm not that guy nor is anyone else. Here's the best thing I can tell you- what makes crypto interesting is that you can be part-trader part-investor if you'd like. The caveat being that the market climate stay nascent and speculative. It's like the regular markets put into a microwave. Read, research, find what you'd like and use yourself and get involved. If the coin has a run and you want the profit, take it. If the coin heads south, hold it like an investor. Hence the reason to buy what you like and have some belief in.  I had lunch today with a friend from college who got his PhD in finance and is now an MD at Goldman. He worked at a place called Long Term Capital that had two Nobel prize winning economists that created models for trading. They nearly blew up the world's economy. An incredible story. The one thing he warned me against was being too technical in my approach to investing. I love the metrics and the analysis but it's a lot easier to invest in what you like.    My initial point was that this project seems more sound and stable than most and by no small margin. I don't understand what the debate or concern is about. With a few grand in well placed PR, the price could likely double but what for? So traders can take a profit? How does that advance a funded project? Impatience seems to be an understatement and in this shared venture, the passion that the users as investors as owners participate in, moves the needle. Hence the beauty of blockchain and it's limitless potential.",False

I've been watching/buying bitcoin since around $100 and I've seen those markets that without any broad-known catalyst just crash. And vice versa...and sometimes for months.  Sure, Asian exchanges will obviously help, and I think that PAY might be one of the solid tokens that holds value in a bear market, but anytime you hear a noob say ""look at other ICO charts!"" it shows how little experience they have in this scene.  Anyone who was playing around with crypto before the last bubble rush we just saw would see that this current trend in the market has the same looks as the other times it went bear. I'm not saying we're switching to down trend but I will say one should be ready considering how much 'real world' money just flowed into this market. They might take profits sooner than later rather than waiting for the market to drop, and bounce back higher than before.  I have no doubt the bull rush will return, but to think that it's over in 4 days I'm just not sure. We're in an accelerated time-space so maybe it WILL only be a few days bearish but my gut has the nerves that it'll be 1-2 months before we see fresh capital flow into here and start the next rush.   Dude is definitely at least 50% right when he says its FOMOs who drove the price up, because if the funding for this market was less centralized then it would just keep going up, instead of stalling when all the FOMOs have spent their last fiat hoping the price will continue climbing.  The noobs drove this market up, and the noobs are probably the reason the price is crashing all over the board, and why PAY isn't at $5 right now going higher in a bull run.  WE CAN PARTIALLY THANK HITBTC AND ALL THE FOOLS WHO USE IT FOR GETTING THE FIRST FEW SUCKERS TO PAY $10!!!  If people who actually believed in cryptos were the real investors, instead of 'traditional finance' noobs, we'd see much more hodling and the only sells would be fairly high. There are still a good portion of investors who are 1 yr+ guys which is how I made my money, but the fact that so many people are playing traditionally and turning the market bull to bear bull to bear makes it harder to judge which projects even truly have potential, as we don't know how many investors in any ICO are 'real' crypto lovers, or just people trying to make a guaranteed 200% and switch",False

How is this FUD? the fact you guys call it FUD is proof that you're freaking green horns here. Why don't you watch and learn from some older bucks instead of getting your asses impaled...both figuratively and literally...  This market is unnaturally high ANYWAY considering the layman still isn't beside themselves trying to buy into blockchain tech. I think blockchain is the future of everything finance, in one way or another. But that doesn't mean I smoke hopium...I gave that up years ago.  You need to provide better proof instead of saying these invisible whales are the ones dropping price...when actually often you fools think a 'wall got crushed' (lol) when they just cancel and relist xD  I got semi-heavy (for the average crypto buyer) into PAY as soon as I could because I forgot all about the ICO and didn't see the email til like 4 days later...$1.10 isn't a bad price for a team with this kind of transparency and goals... But you seriously need to understand that currently at least (probably due to the 'type' of money that's inflating this market) the price of any token regardless of utility is performing based on how the few major coins perform. Like it or not, fellow Mr. Experts, the money that blew this bubble up was not from crypto/finance nerds putting 500-5000 into coins like it was before...it was greedy 'traditional' money trying to play coins like stocks, and that's what we're seeing now.  I'll buy lower if eth crashes and takes ERC20's with it, and if I see it hit $2 I'll buy around then too depending on how active the buying is...but I'm also not gonna sit here and stick my thumb up my ass hoping that the market is just gonna throw billions back in because some nerds agree. I hope you guys are right are the market flips, trust me I'm not selling for cash but I have traded some other tokens for more stable ones in the event it goes bear-y, one of those being PAY only because of the hype and the fact that they seem to be closest to a user-friendly, massively adoptable product.  I like MGO too but seeing MGO get hit so hard wasn't fully surprising as they might even be a year away from a usable platform, but it DID still make me nauseous and it was a reality check that the day-trading mentality could very well be outweighing the hodl now a days...which is so scary cause coins gain real value by having a large amount of hodling...",False

I've noticed the air let out of the balloon a bit, and like I said in the essay above that traditional investing mindset is messing with the true value of these tokens. as the consumers are worried about market caps instead of milestones on the road map.  Any token now that has goals and misses them by a few days (even though every milestone is obviously tentative) gets shredded by the traditional investors who move to the next hot token, probably suggested to them via algorithm watching charts.      I guess they have a medium update today but it's singapore time so it'll probably be like 9 pm PST or so.

It's going to be a 10$ coin at some point and I'm happy to hold until then. There's a clear difference in a token like $pay and other altcoins and that's the market penetration potential combined with clear monetization plan. Truth is many coins have value the same way paintings have value, they're speculation on top of what you're willing to pay for them. But a token like $pay--it has a clear path to actual monetization for holders. I like knowing that my coin had that potential and the whole team working on it is incentivized to monetize the sh*t out of it. That's how they'll make most of their money.

So you are going to sell MCO and buy PAY then?  Distributing the 84M PAY tokens that were purchased during the only-minutes-long TenX ICO and finding an exchange for them is a big job that apparently will take Julian and the TenX team weeks to accomplish.  When those milestones are finished I'll have the option to exchange my MCO tokens for PAY.    Meanwhile VISA cryptocard Monaco's (http://mona.co) 9.67M purchased MCO tokens have all been distributed (I've got mine) to their purchasers,  who had a leisurely four weeks to buy them.

The TenX ICO raised 200,000 ETH, each of which bought 420 PAY tokens (=350 plus 20% first day bonus) that represented 51% of the total supply.  Thus there will be 200,000*420 = 84M PAY tokens at the exchanges when TenX trading starts (compared to only 9.45M Monaco MCO tokens trading NOW on Bittrex...).    When both coins exit their lockout periods, there will be 164.7M TenX PAY tokens total to 31.5M Monaco MCO tokens total.  Ownership in TenX is diluted by a factor of 164.7 / 31.5 = 5.22 compared to Monaco.  If the two cards are ""equal"" in the marketplace, then a single MCO token ""should"" be worth more than five times the price of a single PAY token.    But the two cards ARE NOT equal in the marketplace.  According to their terms of service, Monaco will issue their crypto VISA cards to 300M+ Americans;  TenX will not.  Check out Monaco MCO tokens.  They're the better bet for traders seeking a winning cryptocurrency VISA card play at the exchanges.  http://mona.co",False

Considering buying some PAY token as soon as they are available.  If world economic forum is predicting that 10% of global GDP ($7.8 trillion in today's money) will be on blockchain within 10 years and, if TenX and COMIT are the fabric connecting blockchains and providing payments, then I think it's important to carefully answer these questions as openly and clearly as possible, so that every single person can decide whether PAY is a good opportunity before them.  10 questions.  1. Do you need a TenX card in order to use the Andriod/iOS app for making payments where Visa/Mastercard is accepted?  Can the app be used on its own for such purchases?  2. If card is needed, then does the card details get ""sucked"" into the andriod app and you don't need to bother brining you card to the shop?  Or do you need them both?  3. COMIT charges no commissions, how can this be?  If it works like you say it does, then it seems a tiny fee like this could be a big profit maker for decentralized trades between cryptocurrencies.  Is there a future plan for COMIT to take small profit 0.04%?  4. Are there any other planned future revenue streams for PAY token holders?  5. What happens if/when cryptoC is ubiquitously adopted and no more Visa/Mastercard?  People the world over start paying and receiving payment directly in cryptocurrency.  Do PAY tokens receive any incentive to be held or do they become worthless at this point?  6. Can TenX wallet be used anonymously?  Or does it always require centralized registration?  7. Does the TenX wallet actually hold the private keys or are they stored on your servers?  8. When making a Visa/Mastercard transaction does the TenX wallet interact with the payment terminal using NFC and send TenX card details propagating back trough the payment terminal network, eventually reaching COMIT and then over the internet to the mobile device and finally to the TenX wallet?  If so, that seems to imply that you need to have a working internet connection on your mobile device in order to pay with TenX, which is fine.  Just want to understand in simple terms how it works.  9. Will TenX be making partnerships, deals and acquisitions with/of other payment processors and competitors?  If so, would PAY holders, either directly or indirectly, benefit from such strategic deals?  10.  Are other payment systems able to leverage COMIT?  If so, what benefit would TenX PAY holder have?  If this is the case, what would serve to protect PAY holder investment from being undercut by other competitors riding on top of COMIT?  OK, so it was slightly more than 10 questions because I snuck in subquestions.  My decision whether to buy PAY as soon as it's on exchanges will be largely impacted on your answers.  Thanks.

Considering buying some PAY token as soon as they are available.  If world economic forum is predicting that 10% of global GDP ($7.8 trillion in today's money) will be on blockchain within 10 years and, if TenX and COMIT are the fabric connecting blockchains and providing payments, then I think it's important to carefully answer these questions as openly and clearly as possible, so that every single person can decide whether PAY is a good opportunity before them.  10 questions.  1. Do you need a TenX card in order to use the Andriod/iOS app for making payments where Visa/Mastercard is accepted?  Can the app be used on its own for such purchases?  2. If card is needed, then does the card details get ""sucked"" into the andriod app and you don't need to bother brining you card to the shop?  Or do you need them both?  3. COMIT charges no commissions, how can this be?  If it works like you say it does, then it seems a tiny fee like this could be a big profit maker for decentralized trades between cryptocurrencies.  Is there a future plan for COMIT to take small profit 0.04%?  4. Are there any other planned future revenue streams for PAY token holders?  5. What happens if/when cryptoC is ubiquitously adopted and no more Visa/Mastercard?  People the world over start paying and receiving payment directly in cryptocurrency.  Do PAY tokens receive any incentive to be held or do they become worthless at this point?  6. Can TenX wallet be used anonymously?  Or does it always require centralized registration?  7. Does the TenX wallet actually hold the private keys or are they stored on your servers?  8. When making a Visa/Mastercard transaction does the TenX wallet interact with the payment terminal using NFC and send TenX card details propagating back trough the payment terminal network, eventually reaching COMIT and then over the internet to the mobile device and finally to the TenX wallet?  If so, that seems to imply that you need to have a working internet connection on your mobile device in order to pay with TenX, which is fine.  Just want to understand in simple terms how it works.  9. Will TenX be making partnerships, deals and acquisitions with/of other payment processors and competitors?  If so, would PAY holders, either directly or indirectly, benefit from such strategic deals?  10.  Are other payment systems able to leverage COMIT?  If so, what benefit would TenX PAY holder have?  If this is the case, what would serve to protect PAY holder investment from being undercut by other competitors riding on top of COMIT?  OK, so it was slightly more than 10 questions because I snuck in subquestions.  My decision whether to buy PAY as soon as it's on exchanges will be largely impacted on your answers.  Thanks.",False

They don't support signing messages with their native wallet yet... only imported addresses...  I even tried exporting my native address, recovering it's private key using my 12 word mnemonic phrase and importing it into a new Blockchain.info wallet and it still won't work because Blockchain.info generates a unique address on every transaction (sending and receiving).

So I'm on working holiday visa in Australia, and had been working in the same farm for quite some time. And wanted to know when I arrived here (how long have I been working here already?!), so just this friday i checked my bank tx's record, and found out that I had been in this farm for exactly 100 days. Totally random.  So the same night, after reading all new replies to my posts, I was bored and klicked on the ""Show unread posts since last visit"" buttion. About ten row's down, (out of the 50+ pages) i see this ANN thread, and I find out that the ITS is taking place tomorrow night.  Did some research about the company, I liked what i was reading.  Decision to invest was made, and just randomly thought that 1ETH should be a good sized investment for me. I then found out, that 1ETH in the first hours = 420 PAY tokens (me being a cannabis enthusiast I took it as a some sort of a sign )  Some hours later, I realized that I had been working in this farm for 100 days, and the company name TenX also represents the number 100.  (ten*x [roman 10] = 100). MIND = BLOWN Now that, I called a sign form the universe, AND there's no way I will miss out on this investment!

I am not trying to discredit anyone, I am pointing out the fact that the team knew that there was more demand than there was supply. And yet they didn't deem pertinent to implement any mechanism to mitigate the high influx of transactions. The result is that a large number of people who came properly prepared and didn't waste a second were still subject to the contingent while waisting money for a useless and costly transaction. That doesn't even account for the high proportion of potential participants who had other obligations at the moment the ICO opened.  Imagine a democracy where you could only vote in a one minute window regardless of your obligations, and there was a smaller amount of votes available than there are voters. And an individual can cast an unlimited amount of votes. And even if you manage to cast a vote in time, your vote risks not even being counted. Kind of a bitter democracy isn't it? But hey, ""nothing worse than somebody being salty because of it"" right?  I missed out on the Civic ICO. I managed to get in line and was cut short just before it was my turn. I was in a line, investments were capped to 500$ per participant. ""The early bird gets the worm"" I was told. Frustrating but fair. I am also thinking of the upcoming EOS ICO where the amount per participant will be capped and investments will be spread out over weeks to give a fair chance for everyone to get in. So yeah. I still think that the team was negligent of the fact that there was way more demand than there was supply. To me that should be a big red flag for any company.  I know this ICO will bring big ROI for all participants but this greatly reduces my long term trust for tenX.",False

However, your wallet might not be able to show the token, which also means you cannot trade the tokens from there. So what you would then need to do is insert your private key in a wallet that can (f.ex. MyEtherWallet). But the tokens would definitely be there. Best if a wallet allows you additionally to holding your private key to add ERC20 tokens manually, then you can add it yourself to show.

It definitely helps and I have read the article and watched the video. Two follow up questions:  1. As far as I can tell from your business model, the value of the PAY token to investors is dependent on people using your debit card to pay merchants with crypto. I am somewhat confused about your plan to spend a lot of money on developing routing and providing liquidity to the COMIT network. I understand how improving the COMIT network would decrease costs of using the card, even making the card more useful. Yet if the COMIT network is open source, a rival could simply open up their own debit card after you have developed the COMIT network, offer greater incentives to users, and people would use that platform. How do you plan to mitigate this threat?  2. In the video, it says that all payments through the COMIT network will go through TenX. It even says if that one day the debit card is not needed, payments to PAY token holders would still occur, but at a lower commission (0.05% instead of 0.5%), because PAY token holders would be paid a percentage of the COMIT transactions which are expected to have very low fees. I am still unclear about how we would be paid a percentage of COMIT transactions in that case if COMIT is open source. If it is open source, other companies can offer services such as decentralized exchanges on it, and customers wouldn't necessarily have to go through TenX. Why would people use TenX if there was no need for a debit card?  Thank you again for your thoughts and I look forward to your response.",False

How are you associated with the COMIT network project? COMIT is open source but we at TenX are the first ones to work on it.  2. Regarding the COMIT network, will people be able to exchange currencies on their phone app? Will this be without fee and will the COMIT network be monetized in any way besides the TenX debit card? Yes, this should be possible. The fee will be set by the individuals providing the exchange - since it is competitive we expect close to nil fees.  3. Are you planning on building a desktop decentralized exchange based on the COMIT network, or are there any plans to do so by anyone else that the community knows of? both - open to do it ourselves or work with others.  4. Will any other project utilize the COMIT network for decentralized exchange or just the TenX debit card? Definitely.  5. How will your TenX card based on the COMIT network compete with the Bancor, Cosmos, Polkadot, Internet of Coins projects? Why should we invest in your project and not wait for the next debit card based on these upcoming decentralized protocols? All these projects are awesome, but actually can work with us. There is no either or.  6. If there is a superior decentralized exchange protocol in the future, one that can incorporate cross blockchain smart contracts for example, how can the COMIT network evolve?

A few questions:  1. How are you associated with the COMIT network project? 2. Regarding the COMIT network, will people be able to exchange currencies on their phone app? Will this be without fee and will the COMIT network be monetized in any way besides the TenX debit card? 3. Are you planning on building a desktop decentralized exchange based on the COMIT network, or are there any plans to do so by anyone else that the community knows of? 4. Will any other project utilize the COMIT network for decentralized exchange or just the TenX debit card? 5. How will your TenX card based on the COMIT network compete with the Bancor, Cosmos, Polkadot, Internet of Coins projects? Why should we invest in your project and not wait for the next debit card based on these upcoming decentralized protocols? 6. If there is a superior decentralized exchange protocol in the future, one that can incorporate cross blockchain smart contracts for example, how can the COMIT network evolve?  My apologies if some of these questions don't make sense as I am not intimately familiar with the technicalities but I would appreciate if TenX could answer to the best of their ability.

Second, got some more/suggestion  1. If you say the pre-sale was for whales, others have noted whales can still participate in the regular sale. To make they do not get a HUGE supply and the community is diverse as possible, can we impose a maximum limit on the regular sale? I do not know what would be a good amount but maybe 50-100 ETH? Or 200 ETH? Just so somebody cannot take up another 1000k+ ETH in one go. I do not know if this practical but a suggestion to curb the whales from having a huge supply of the tokens. Perhaps just do this for the first hour or two, so that the little guy can get all they want then. After that hour or two, increase the max to unlimited again. I think this could work well and is a good midpoint for everybody. This way you still sell out, the little guy gets what they need, and whales already have their needs met. Seems like a win, win, win.  2. You cant release contracts that is understood, but nowhere online can I read about your involvement with visa and mastercard?

Regrettably I either couldn't find it or didn't quite understand the answers. When it comes to finances I am quite the layman.  When someone makes a transaction one can earn up to 0.1% of it in PAY. 1) but couldn't this theoretically become impossible, if people would hold on to their PAY and the limited supply is insufficient? 2) if PAY can be created through this payout, wouldn't this cause inflation in the long term?  PAY holders receive 0,5% of the transactions made on the TenX platform in Ether. 1) wouldn't this be a disincentive for people wishing to use TenX for payments? (It is a small fee, but see my following questions).  What fees are people using TenX for payments to expect, and what does TenX stand to gain on payments on their platform? 1) there are no transactions fees, but surely TenX will earn from payments. Does TenX charge a fee for exchanging crypto to fiat then? 2) how are current exchange rates calculated, from a specific exchange site? 3) just broadly, what will a TenX payer pay additionally to use the platform (no matter the form, fee, exchange rate...) and... 4) what will TenX earn per payment (in whatever form)?

I have a lot of ERC23 tokens that I would be willing to commit to the public TenX ICO in late June, but only if I know beforehand that the TenX ICO smart contract can handle them.  Saying ""oops - sorry"" ten minutes after the gates are opened on ICO Day is not acceptable.  This issue needs to be addressed and totally resolved before the final TenX ICO.  Here's some background:  https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/comments/5ydst4/explanation_of_the_difference_between_erc20_and/  https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/17054/erc20-vs-erc223-list-of-differences/17071  https://medium.com/@dexaran820/response-to-vitaliks-speech-about-erc-23-ad240a27490f  This issue is especially critical since TenX is presenting themselves as being a universal cross-token solution.  To have a ERC23 screw-up on ICO day would be a PR disaster for them.  And a final question - will PAY be an ERC20 or an ERC23 token?",False

Additionally, with the emergence of more and more different tokens, a growing number of users and businesses truly struggle to leverage infrastructure to make this inter-connectedness of physical and virtual platforms become a reality.   At TenX, we strive to offer the user access to an as large as possible range of blockchain assets at a maximum degree of convenience, while adhering to the highest security standards in the ecosystem.   We are able to do this by connecting blockchains, leveraging on the COMIT Standard (www.comit.network), which works in a completely trustless, instant and at a no cost manner.   To the end-user, we offer a debit card and accompanying mobile wallet that can be funded not only with Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Dash (DASH) but with virtually any blockchain asset. A TenX wallet can be used in almost 200 countries at over 36 million points of acceptance today. This is possible as we have partnered with major credit card companies such as VISA and Mastercard.   Moreover, users and businesses can exchange their blockchain assets seamlessly from one to another in a decentralized manner, removing any risk that is associated with current centralized solutions.

Another 29% of all tokens will be distributed to the public over time. Tokens will be set aside for community initiatives, business development, academic research, education and market expansion to name just a few. The exact details are specified below. A small amount of tokens will be allocated to TenX‚Äôs founders, employees and early investors as an incentive pool to ensure long-term alignment of interest and commitment to the tokens and their future value.   Each PAY token will be sold for 1/350 ETH, meaning 1 ETH will give you 350 PAY tokens. Other accepted cryptocurrencies will be converted live in ETH. There is a minimum purchase amount of 10 PAY tokens per purchase.   We will sell a maximum of 200,000 ETH worth of PAY tokens or equivalent in other currencies. This corresponds to a maximum of 20,000,000 PAY tokens, which in turn represent 51% of all tokens. Should this amount be reached before the end of the sale on the 26th of July 2017 10.59am UTC (6.59pm SG time), we will cut off the sale within the following 24 hours at latest.   In the case that less than 20,000,000 PAY tokens will be sold, the percentage of 51% of all tokens will be adjusted accordingly. For example, if only 10,000,000 PAY tokens will be sold during the ITS, this would only represent 20.5% of all tokens.   The token holders will receive 0.5% of the whole payment volume that is spent through the TenX debit card. The payments to the token holders will be paid in ETH (Ether), or the closest equivalent thereof in case of ETH being replaced by another asset in the future. Users of the TenX debit card will receive 0.1% from their spendings as an incentive in form of PAY tokens (similar to how users get air-miles on existing cards today). This incentive to customers will have a great benefit to existing token holders since this recurring redistribution of tokens will create an additional demand for tokens in the market. This additional reward to users in form of PAY tokens is bought on the open market and will create price support.   Please note that we will not issue any new PAY tokens after the Initial Token Sale.   Overview of Token Structure TenX will issue 80% of the tokens to the public. 51% of all token will be sold immediately, while 29% of the tokens will be distributed to the community over the next 4 years. This is testament to the fact that we want to be open and inclusive of the community, which we perceive as our most valuable asset. We believe it is a strong signal of trust if the community owns more than half of the tokens from the very beginning. At the same time, we feel it is essential that the incentives of the company are long term aligned with the ecosystem. In order to be able to support long term growth in a sustainable way, founders, early backers and the development team are rewarded with the remaining 20% of tokens in exchange for their efforts and resources contributed to the development of the PAY tokens.
