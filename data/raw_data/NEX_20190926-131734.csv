Their token distribution has always been public/honest and the founders tokens are locked for 2 years with a slow release. 50 Million NEX is the total supply and the circulating supply is about 28,000,000 which is decreasing because the platform is live and people are now staking their NEX for dividends which requires them to be locked out of circulation. Figures listed on CMC are incorrect and are based on neotracker which everyone knows has issues, correct information can be found on CoinGecko. CMC has already been contacted by many people to fix the incorrect information but they still haven't for whatever reasons. Also Nash isn't ""built on a garbage chain"" it's independent of any single blockchain with their off-chain matching engine. Only the token is a nep-5 but it can be switched to any chain if need be.  NEX is the first registered security token, it is about as legit as it gets. The product is live as an mvp and people are using it to trade their crypto cross-chain while always having control of their private keys. The only true thing is that launch was delayed which can be expected with any project but they have always delivered and the exchange has been live since September 1st.

Collectively we drive 1.5 billion tyres to the end of their useful lives every year. They can be retread and reused up to a point, but not endlessly. And at the end of their usefulness you have a conundrum. End of life tyres (or ELTs) are difficult to process for any kind of recycling, because they’re a complex mix of materials – natural and synthetic rubber, fibre and wire, all in a heavy and unwieldy package. They’re not biodegradeable, so tyres don’t rot down naturally. And every year we use more of them. And from this busy world Emjac is trying to solve this problem by decentralised process.  EMJAC aims to expand the penetration and knowledge sharing of our recycling concept and ecosystem around the world starting with major cities which produce the highest numbers of waste tyres.  EMJAC will integrate blockchain and traceability technology to solve the global waste tyres problem. EMJAC (EMJ) adopts the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem, well known for its decentralized approach that runs smart contracts to enhance the transparency and traceability of global waste tyres management to reduce illegal dumping.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2677729;sa=showPosts",False

We’ve made many improvements to the system since posting that roadmap (w.r.t., performance, security, and usability), and we are not going to launch any system until (1) it has a user experience that meets our high standards (2) it has passed an extremely rigorous security review (some of the best firms in the world), which is ongoing. We will launch when when both of these criteria are met.  Whatever the date: when we release, we aim to blow people’s expectations out of the water. Keep in mind that what we are doing is a new thing: no one has yet come up with a way to make decentralized interfaces accessible to non-experts and to allow normal users to benefit from these kinds of advances in trust, much less to combine them with the kind of performance we are envisioning. This stuff is easy to get wrong, and it is important to us that we don’t cut any corners.  Fabio Canesin: ...one of those mistakes was to publish a roadmap with expected dates, we will now work to establish a vision and communicate development of new products and markets but will refrain of pushing a public roadmap with dates.   And BTW:  On 18 January 2019, NEX will be holding an event in Amsterdam to present our work from the fourth quarter. We will provide more details such as time and venue in the coming days! #TrustYourselves   It will be huge, guys. Just have patience, that is all.",False

However, the appearance of Binance DEX and NEX will greatly solve the liquidity problem for decentralized exchanges. Personally, I really like the NEX project, this is the awakening giant.

The maximum contribution in the first ICO round is $1,000. There is no minimum contribution for this ICO, however if you are planning to send NEO you must contribute a minimum of 1 as it is not a divisible token. Participants may only contribute once per ICO round. For example, if you contribute $700 you cannot contribute another $300 in a separate contribution in the same round.  After contributing with NEO, GAS, or both NEO and GAS combined your NEX tokens will appear in your wallet after 1 block on the network. You have the option to increase your transaction priority fee which defaults to .0001 GAS. If you do increase your transaction priority fee, it may get accepted faster but we recommend that you do not exceed 1 GAS.  Please take your time during the contribution process to ensure no mistakes are made. We cannot make changes to contributions.",False

The communication was on subreddit of NEO:  Q: What's really going on behind the scenes of Neonexchange? I know it takes time but a 3 to 4 months miscalculation seems immense. Once their ico goes live the exchange should be ready to go no?  Fabio: The exchange doesn't need the ICO to be launched, but we are certain the sale will happen before. Our plans and road map have always been for opening the exchange for the public at the end of Q3, we are working hard to achieve that deadline. Behind the scenes we are developing what we said we would deliver, we are not a all hype and no product project - that is why we are more silent than usual ICOs, we are growing (currently 18 employees, we want to triple) and we understand the expectation of our community.  Q: What are the chances to get regulatory approval within the next couple of weeks?  Fabio: I can't reply that, but I can explain the process. When we made our consultantion we put forward all the planning of products and developments planned and what licenses each would need, in some jurisdictions. It is not a simple ""can I do this ICO ?"", so we already have green light on several of those items and revised some others. For the public offer what we are waiting is the return of the documentation and an acknowledgement that the process is over, so we have a solid set of legal backing that we can raise general capital with.  Q: Maybe regulation was a bit underestimated then? If u get approval how else will regulation slow down growth... It is just one of many hurdles I assume.  Fabio: Some jurisdictions are faster than others to go through the process, where going 100% in-house will be unpractical we will look at other alternatives to allow us to operate.   Maybe you can find you questions here (partially at least).",False
