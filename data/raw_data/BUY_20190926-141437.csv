Also we created the system that will be available not only for online but also for the offline trading. Less comission - more demand. Also at the end of this spring, Bpay is going to push its own bourse, where will be accredited all altcoins for the turnover in Bpay payment system. The tokens would also give possibility to enter the bourse and so, it would be charged as a commission for all bourse transactions.

It's taking not just crypto, but stocks, offline transactions, and other financial events and throwing them all into its system for better organization and aggregation.  Then it allows for the account holder to convert any received funds into crypto, fiat, or whatever and also to transfer into a bank account (or I guess, wallet address).  What's interesting is they also allow for a medium between crypto and credit card. Somehow if someone is paying in crypto, Bpay converts it into fiat to the seller's choice of fiat or credit/debit card processing via Bpay's visa backend.  The team looks kinda okay. The founder has been CEO of mobile companies for almost a decade. But he only got into crypto this year... That's okay since he has business experience. Business experience is usually lacking in crypto core teams. The CTO has 2 decades of experience in development... so that's cool too.  What worries me is their crypto experience. Other than that, the team seems good. I haven't looked into the companies they were associated with to see if the companies were super successful or if they went belly up.
