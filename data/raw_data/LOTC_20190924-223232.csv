Among the things we are planning is a ladder gambling.  Also there are so many in the world that there are unpredictable and reliable numbers. For a very simple example How much is the NASDAQ close tomorrow? even / odd  Have you ever heard of that form of gambling?  In addition to traditional gambling, Extremely addictive simple gambling!!!!  Serving traditional gambling provides a stable return, the goal is to increase the number of users by serving an aggressive new format of gambling.  We do not know all the gambling in the world. One of our temporary employees majored in world history.  He is looking for gambling in history we do not know. We learned from him that the lottery was one of the oldest gambling. Most of us are just developers. Humanities can not be excluded from all techniques, including gambling.  It would not be enough to answer your question. We aim to challenge the existing market itself because we are startup.  We will modify the content of the whitepaper and ANN Thered. Thanks for reading.",False

We were developing lottery system gambling system to match the Ethereum Block Number. Although the development of multiple one stop gambling is not difficult work and there is the easiest way to maximize ICO investor’s profit with users’ convenience, we have a question about why most ICOs that operate gambling do not provide these services. It is not understandable why they do not provide the service together while Sports betting and E-Sports betting are perfectly same system. By just registering to COIN-BET, user will no longer need to register to any other sites. We addressed various ways to maximize ICO investor’s profit with user’s enhanced convenience, and we are willing to launch the service for all kind of gambling with initiation of sports betting service which is most profitable platform. The development of sports betting and e-sports are almost completed, and horse racing, stock market, and ghost lag are being applied. A trustworthy game to match numbers is already available. For example, to bet with predicting trustworthy data is available for the unpredictable matching game such as “What is the NASDAQ index tomorrow??” We sincerely appreciate all the Bitcointalk members who provide valuable advices for our development, and many people who requested anonymity.   We promise that we will be the first and biggest one-stop gambling platform in the world.

What happens if scheduled tokens are not all distributed until the tokensale is over? That's not important. If the total amount of funds is 1 BTC 1BTC = 200,000,000 Tokens.   What is the expected value of COIN-BET's tokens after the tokensale? As with any other cryptocurrencies, the value of token is determined by the market valuation.   Who can participate in token sales? In general, residents of the United States, Singapore, China cannot participate in tokensale. Please be sure to check if there are any regulatory restrictions in your country or state   Why is COIN-BET different from other companies making an ICO?

The price of the token will vary depending on the amount collected.  It does not disappear or stretch, always 300 million tokens are fixed.  A description of the bonus can be found on the website.
