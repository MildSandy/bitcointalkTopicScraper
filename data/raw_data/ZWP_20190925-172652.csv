There will be some mechanisms implemented that allows merchants to reward users with ZWP tokens, which helps to bring an interest from people who may not be familiar with crypto yet.   Quote from: 320hz on August 07, 2018, 11:14:51 AM In the description of your project, I found information that users will receive a reward for sharing their data. Please explain what this means and what data do you mean?  The gist is that consumers are able to take back control of their data (such as age, country, shopping habits, etc), and the consumers themselves are able to choose when this data is shared to merchants. Should the consumer choose, they can store their data on the blockchain and they can choose how this is shared.  From the merchant side, they are able to give advertisements or promotions to a very specific demographic - such as ""people in London that are between 20-25 years old and have bought a computer related product in the last 5 days"". When the merchant is doing the promotion, they are able to know how many people are in this dataset and what are the statistics of the effectiveness of the campaign, but they are not able to see who exactly they are tar getting their promotions to.  I've also attached the section in the whitepaper that explains this - its quite a unique concept, so if you need clarifications let me know.",False
