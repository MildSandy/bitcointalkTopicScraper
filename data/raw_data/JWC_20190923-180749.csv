JWC can be exchanged for other coins (no guarantee yet) 3. Do these companies have a clue how to apply blockchain for TGE yet? If yes why no public information for investors? What is exit mechanism? Why high profitability? I made this simple scenario thinking based on condition/numbers from the whitepaper  Think about this applied scenario you invest into JWC ""Ventures"", they invest 250k-5m to a portfolio company for in exchange for 20-25% Ownership to JWC like stated in whitepaper, in 5-10 years one of them exits/sells the company (some others might not, or need further investment) and JWC will then receive 20-25% of the exit (in this scenario no further investment/dilution happened) and of that 20-25% profit of JWC, 20% will be used to buy back JWC tokens for unknown price and process. So an exit of 5m will result in 1-1.25M profit for JWC and 20% of that profit (if not reinvested, spent) 200k-250k will be avaible to buy back JWC coins for unknown price and process. So wait 5-10 years hope for exit and then hope further to be one of the lucky to sell JWC, or reinvest your JWC into maybe sub coins in a never-ending cycle Roll Eyes  4. If it works out nice, I mean stealing everyones IP and reusing it right? 5. The fund portfolio consist of team members of JWC, so raising for there own projects. Diversification makes it much more difficult to succeed/exiting one as complexity rises non linear (Venture capital investing, logistic, O2O, Nanotechnology, etc) 6. cool got crypto wallets",False

The “smart contract” transfers the money to the seller’s account only when the item has reached its destination. Cashback mechanisms can be implemented when paying with JWC tokens, as well as discounts. The “smart contract” ensures that the money goes to the seller’s account only after the item has reached its destination.  – Product origin Blockchain enables transparency and feasibility for quality and convenient access by any participant to the distributed ledger database. A seller can have a crystal-clear look at their cargo shipment and at the same time the buyer is able to trace the product’s origin.  – Trusted reviews The “smart contract” records the interaction between the buyer and the seller, ensuring all reviews come from people who actually bought the item.  – Addressing the counterfeit problem One of the key features of the blockchain is the immutability of its records. This feature makes it ideal for tracking the authenticity of for-sale products. Sellers or even manufacturers/suppliers can create certificates of authenticity for products.  – Supply chain In a token-based system, transactions amongst community members may be recorded instantly and securely using digital tokens. The parties would only convert any excess tokens into other assets from time to time on an “as needed basis”, limiting transaction costs.  – Loyalty Loyalty reward system acts as a fundamental community bond, for both merchants and customers. Any user participating in the “smart contract” transaction such as e-commerce one is encouraged to exercise integrity and honesty.  – Built-in smart contract modules With a Smart Business Contract platform specifically optimized for e-commerce and common data services, the JWC blockchain is ideal for many types of e-commerce applications. If a blockchain application is going to be built on the JWC blockchain, it will utilize the JWC as its means to pay for the execution of Smart Business Contracts and settlement of financial transactions.",False

For that reason, investing in the most exciting stage of tech startups is reserved only for those who can afford to “forget” about their capital for 5-10 years. In other words, if you invested 1 million USD into a typical VC fund, you would be locking up that 1 million USD for ten to fifteen years. As a result, the VC model is currently available only for accredited investors, institutional LPs and family offices. Asset tokenization refers to taking illiquid assets and issuing tradable tokens that give holders rights in these assets (“asset-backed tokens”), resulting in improved liquidity because the assets become tradable on cryptocurrency exchanges 24/7 every day in a week.  Blockchain Funded and Cross-border Solutions JWC is the blockchain digital accelerator trusted by the crypto communities. We provide direct funding to empower companies. JWC scales up our blockchain-funded decentralized and cross-border solutions and services to create corporations with: 1) Innovative and Industry-Disruptive Solutions, 2) Efficiencies and Cost-Saving, and 3) Highly Competitiveness.  Blockchain and Financial Assets Blockchain technology now offers opportunities for gaining returns in excess of those earned by traditional venture capitalists. This technology and its impacts appear complex and daunting by most prospective investors. Therefore, JWC will be a very unique opportunity for investors, enabling them to have access to venture capital opportunities in various industry sectors.  Diversification for Crypto Investors JWC offers qualified crypto investors the option to diversify some of their cryptocurrency holdings into a portfolio of proven and growing innovative tech startups, since JWC will selectively perform equity investments in those portfolio companies.  The Value Proposition of JWC Ventures JWC offers the following set of services: Fund Management, Global Partnerships, Deal Origination and Screening, Cultural Integration, Operational Excellence, Best Practice Implementation, Optimized Exits, and Trust & Credibility.",False
