As the Potentiam platform is been built on the blockchain, it was quite obvious it just makes absolute sense to crowdfund using cryptocurrency. Our cryptocurrency (PTM) is an integral part of the Potentiam platform. When users are given the opportunity to become a part of a project and share in the rewards as the cryptocurrency appreciate in value they become emotionally invested in the community. Not only does their stake result in the conversion into loyal users, but it also transforms them into an army of evangelists who provide free marketing because they are excited about the venture and because its adoption will increase the value of their cryptocurrency.",False

The rate of return on Potentiam is connected to the tokenomics of the platform.  Every transaction generating revenue on the platform is beneficial to the Potent vault members.

It is important to note it is a communal pool so the 30% of all network transactions fees that are sent to this pool are distributed evenly.  So for example, if you where the only participant and you placed 10,000 PTM in this vault because 10,000 PTM is the total communal PTM in the Potent Vault you would receive 100% of that reward, but also if there is 100,000 PTM and you only place 10,000 PTM, then you would receive 10% of that reward and so on.

It is clearly plain to see the team behind Potentiam are those that set up Britznbeatz limited in the UK. Every literature has indicated this, so to suggest a cautious flag about our project is nothing less than malicious and slander. We cannot let such people with ulterior motives tarnish our image. There are videos, articles about our business on reputable publications. All team members are clearly identified. I would have thought people can use their initiative or intellect to decide if a project is authentic or not. I have not seen a scam project with real people with a functioning business as of yet. As we have clearly identified ourselves this is no more than an over-enthusiastic individual trying to create some type of buzz for themselves. Have they reached out to see contracts have been signed by team members or not? I am quite sure the answer is no. Please go make your noise and name elsewhere.  And in regards to having no product to test, have we ever mentioned we have a finished product? I am quite sure if the culprit who is making such claims had a look or did any non-bias bitter research they will see a prototype on the website. And to even go as far to put up a solid tech stack. I wonder why he has not identified himself. As for KYC please have a look on the site, does it meet your requirement. And I believe the point of an ICO is to raise funds for a cryptocurrency based project, when did Venture capitalist ideas get into it.  Initial coin offering (ICO) is a means of crowdfunding via use of cryptocurrency which can be a source of capital for startup companies. Please we do listen but make informed and intelligent remarks not one because you are a biased or maybe working for a competitor.",False

There is no point trying to sabotage a really good project that has real use and potential except greencat is a direct competitor!  The founders of BritznBeatz.co.uk are the founders of Potentiam which is an affiliation of mother company BritznBeatz and are well known in the UK.  I have done my research and followed them and found that they have been interviewed multiple times so there are real passionate people behind the project.  The question that constantly pops up today is have they got a working product. People seem to be missing the purpose of an ICO which is to raise funds to finance an idea or project. If you had a fully working product and fully running company why raise an ICO. Nevertheless, Potentiam has built a prototype which is on the site to see, Tech stack is also clearly stated.  KYC and AML are also on token purchase page  I have faith in this project and will definitely be participating in token sale, If you don't like it please go elsewhere but stop spreading false propaganda",False

We have carefully structured a system that benefits everyone on the music ecosystem. A system that will eventually lead to the network becoming completely decentralised. It is a balance of meritocracy and proof of stake ideology. We use the term ideology because it has elements of proof of stake but not in its entirety. We have worked out a balance that does not rely solely on investor input on the network though we do recognise their presence plays a great importance in the network. We also recognize high-value users as the life and soul of the network, therefore we have a reputation scoring system that distributes value accordingly. We can't reveal too much as it's our secret sauce.",False

The same way you have several choices with products eg headphones, cereal, cars etc There is room for more especially when it comes to blockchain technology still being in its infancy. Now the thing is most of the music projects focus on the music artists solely. We have taken a different approach, we believe for the music industry to perform to its optimum potential you can't just make a change with one of the parts, you have to change the whole idea. Hence we are focusing on everyone on the music supply chain that includes everyone that contributes to the creation, promotion, and consumption of music. We place great emphasis on rewarding all those that make the industry function including the fans which are mostly ignored. Any social media platform or even business worth is based on the user base, hence we have taken the time to incorporate a structure and a reward system that would reach the fans/supporters. Most of the roles in the network are transferable or interchangeable. We are creating a system to raise funds for music creatives, and a means to gain exposure and importantly taking out all those that make it an expensive proposition or long winding. An ecosystem which comprises all the necessary facets of the music industry to collaborate. So we are not afraid of the current competition. I believe they will start to rewrite their plans and structure. We have a database already of music artists, writers, bloggers, producers, and music lovers we already work with. See our music publication https://www.Britznbeatz.co.uk and our work ethic and determination is second to none. Also, hardly would you find people doing what we are proposing to do at the moment.  Please anything you are unsure of or question you might have please do not hesitate to ask.

Our plans at Potentiam is to flip the current advertising model on its head. We intend for the community to generate revenue from advertisers directly while Potentiam will simply receive tiny fees for transactions on the site. The traffic big companies sell to advertisers is the peolple, who receive nothing in return. We will give the power rightfully to the people.  There are two basic ways advertisers will advertise on the platform;  1) The Advertiser will contact a member with a high profile feed directly, and place a request for a feature on their feed. The price is set and agree by both parties.  2) To increase the visibility of any digital media, advertisers can assign an amount of PTM with any piece of digital marketing media and select the payout rate per View, Share and Vote  which will be distributed accordingly till the assigned sum is exhausted.  At Potentiam the focus is on creating a platform that will improve lives of its members through quality in service with financial incentive, as they earn ad sponsored revenue which also reduces the amount of time wasted on spam amongst other benefits. If you provide a good service of value to people the reward will come. To answer your last question. Not specifically designed as such but the more the platform is used the more use of PTM and inturn its burn rate increases. However in terms of the value of PTM we believe it will reflect the exceptional value that we intend to make available to the world.  Hope that answered your question if you have anymore please dont hesitate to ask.",False

We spent a lot of time documenting our idea. It is based mainly on our experience with Britznbeatz, we identified what drives loyalty. And in so doing we have placed emphasis on:  1.Functional loyalty 2.Simplicity 3.Reward system We have created various opportunities on the network to incentivise users. Fans, music creatives, and even investors.   For example, the potent vault is the network stability tool which safeguards the liquidity of the platform. This grants potent vault members access to the whole of the Potentiam network for a time in return for locking-up(taking PTM’s out of circulation) PTM tokens for a specific amount of time. This also increases the IAM score of the holder on the network granting higher voting rights. In this case of functional loyalty, the potent vault adopters are in-turn rewarded for this action. All the use case on Potentiam are simple and easy to understand and adopt. People naturally look for the easiest, quickest route to solving problems and completing tasks. A reward is an obvious way to keep customers loyal. It’s the foundation of many loyalty schemes.  Remember all PTM holders benefit from 30% of the burnt fees the platform generates. Also, the whole network benefits from the actions of the potent vault members as they have temporarily taken PTM out of circulation(programmable scarcity).",False

Potentiam is far more than that, it is not only rewarding music artists but all those involved in the creation, promotion, and consumption of music. Potentiam is creating an ecosystem where music creatives e.g music writers, bloggers, influencers, producers, fans etc can interact and collaborate without the need for middlemen. It is an ecosystem centered on two main principles. 1. Capital 2. Exposure  Potentiam proposes to decentralise the focus in the music industry by empowering all those involved in the music supply chain.

We have a team of blockchain experts on Potentiam, Stefano Paluello who is one of the advisors on the project who has vast experience in blockchain architecture, he has worked for Shell and Microsoft. We also have Ali Zain who is the CEO of Ideofuzion who also has vast experience with Blockchain development. We are currently in talks with a major player in the UK which I believe you will definitely appreciate.  PTM token is structured as a utility token, it gives access to the network, its the unit of exchange on the network.  We have carefully structured the network in such a way that it can be beneficial to everyone, not just music artists or other creatives, but fans/investors. As an investor, we have a tool on the platform that grants access to premium content on the network, this is known as the potent vault, this also is a means by which investors who believe in the project can get involved. A minimum amount of PTM is locked up with the use of a smart contract for a term time and this gives you a certain degree of moderation rights on the network which rewards you with a 30 percent ratio of fees generated on the network. This tool is essential to the stability of the network as a whole. It also creates a form of scarcity of PTM tokens which can have a direct correlation to the value. We also burn 30 percent of fees the platform generates.  We started this project because of our experience in the music industry. It's been a continuous journey, we started out with managing emerging artists and quickly discovered certain obstacles in creating good exposure, to solve this problem it required funds, which in itself is another problem. So we set up Britznbeatz to promote the artists with our editorial content. As soon as we started we received an influx of demand and quickly realised we needed more writers. So we came up with a plan which was mutually beneficial to the writers, artists and ourselves. With the marketing of the platform, we incentivised readers to stay on by using promotions which we found limiting because of the nature of rewards we gave out. From there we came up with the idea of Potentiam.  I do hope I have answered your questions to your satisfaction but if anything is unclear and you have any more questions please do not hesitate to ask.

Potentiam is not only for emerging music artists but everyone on the music supply chain. We find most platforms/networks offer services catering to only the music artists. But on Potentiam we believe there are several factors that contribute to the creation, promotion, and consumption of music. We believe to build, market and maintain a music platform all these factors have to be put in an environment where they can collaborate at a fraction of the price it would cost using various platforms and the elimination of middlemen that would also have added their fees for connecting various parties. It will ultimately reduce the time and process involved in music creation and promotion. Also, a compensation scheme is built into the system to incentivize individuals to stay on the network. Everyone can earn from participating on the platform fans, music artists, bloggers, writers, producers etc Afterall it's a value rewarding music ecosystem. If you have any more questions please do not hesitate to ask, you can also join us on telegram for updates on the project. Also, we will have a private sale with great bonuses shortly so be sure to register to take part.  Telegram: t.me/PotentiamGroup  Thanks",False

This can happen in several ways and it is because anyone can play various roles within the ecosystem. For example, a music artist can earn rewards by supporting other music creatives by engaging with their content, promoting it in order to acquire iam which can be used to boost visibility in the network. A music blogger can write content about a music creative within the platform and earn a reward from the creative written about directly or even earn from the article written being engaging within the network. Even a fan with a popular feed can earn directly from brands promoting on their feed. Now, moderators earn a percentage from the pool of fees the platform accumulates. Most of the roles within the network are interchangeable. Just like in the real world where you can have music artists being fans of other music artists so it is too on Potentiam. Fans can become influencers given time and dedication on the network. Potentiam takes real-life scenarios and expertly translates it into the digital world.

Good question and the answer is yes, we do need the Potentiam network to be supported with its own unique cryptocurrency. One of Potentiam's core function is the rewarding of participants on the platform for value brought to the platform(incentive) which we believe is needed for growing a strong community(loyalty system). This in turn, can transform participants into an army of evangelists who provide free marketing because they are excited about the venture and because its adoption will increase the value of the project. (e.g Bounty marketing). To crowdfund a digital asset in form of a token is proven in the blockchain stratosphere.

The system operates a form of meritocracy, meaning how much you participate on the network will determine how much you get in return. We have created several tools that aid in this, we have what we call the I-am, Ptm(token) and potent vault.  The more active you are on the network eg introducing people to the network, reviewing, moderating, amassing a huge following leading to brands advertising on your feed etc will increase your I-am score on the network which increases your potential earnings on the network.  You can equally lock Ptm tokens in the potent vault and increase your rewards but this is dependent on the services tied to the smart contract like moderating on the platform. This is based on proof of stake concept. There are other more direct ways of earning a reward in the form of ptm tokens; performing direct services to other members of the network.  It's paramount you perform a service to earn a reward on the network accordingly.  If you need more clarification do not hesitate to contact us.",False

The aforementioned company is not a competitor, though we are both in the same music industry space. As you probably know their main function is connecting music artists to venues. We empower those in the act of music creation, promotion, and listening. Creating music is an expensive proposition; imagine a network with all the variables that make the music industry tick. Such as finance, expertise (music producers, songwriters, promoters, reviewers, influencers etc.) Being on the Potentiam network will categorically lower the cost of making music and give recognition to all those involved in that process. Eventually, one's presence on the Potentiam network will open tons of possibilities we can't even foresee at this stage.  I hope this answers your question, if you still require any more information please do not hesitate to ask.",False
