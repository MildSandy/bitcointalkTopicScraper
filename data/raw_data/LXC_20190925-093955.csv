Official announcement: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6d3E7-rzd8&feature=youtu.be  Hi everyone!  In 2016 we started creating a project, which has been presented on iOS and Android platforms since 2017, already has real users and is monetized.  For more than a year we have been working on the idea of improving it, applying it to reality with the help of blockchain and smart contract technology, full automation and scalability.  To date, some companies represented on the market offer similar services associated with the luxury segment.  However, our project and the ideas and technologies embedded in it are fundamentally different from all of them by another approach to implementation designed to solve many of the industry’s problems.  It is exactly these ideas that we planned to implement after the successful ICO and vault to the top of the luxury market.  However, after the public pre sale we realized that in difficult conditions on the cryptocurrency market we won’t be able to make it to the declared softcap of $1.8 million.  Dear friends, partners and community members who believed in us and our project, we have to admit that we were not able to collect the necessary amount of funds to jointly implement all our projected plans.  We took an extremely difficult decision for us to suspend the ICO campaign. We are very grateful to you all for your support and trust!  Our reputation is important to us and we will be bearing all the costs. All funds invested by each contributor will be refunded in full.  Now it is hard to say how the product will be further developed, in connection with the suspension of the ICO.  We are firmly convinced that our project is functioning and its business model is viable. We believe in its success! Either way, we, for our part, made every effort to do this.  But it’s not the end of life. As the Great Sir Winston Churchill said: «Success is the ability to go from failure to failure without losing your enthusiasm».  We have gained tremendous experience by conducting this ICO and have drawn the appropriate conclusions from this.  Our team is always open to you, we are ready for dialogue, so if you have questions, ideas and proposals for cooperation or financing, we are ready to consider them!  Once again, thank you all.",False
