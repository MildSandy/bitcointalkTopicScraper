Once an applicant gets hired, they go thru the following stages in their employment. 1. Training period. This is the period where they are though of by their immediate supervisor to learn what he/she needs to do in the job. This may take from 2 weeks to 1 month time. 2. Probationary Period. This is the period where you will be evaluated after to see if you are fit to stay in the company as a regular employee. This usually takes 6 months here in my country since its mandatory for an employee to get regularized after the 6th month. This is where most job agencies take advantage of their employees particularly in the security and janitorial services. They will end the contract just after 5 months, give you a months rest and renew your contract for another 5 months. Although some measures are being done by the Government, I believe that it is still rampant today. 3. Regularization Period. As I have said, after you end the 6 month probationary period it is mandated that an employee become a regular employee and enjoy benefits of a regular employee. Regularization does not necessarily follow this 6 month period, sometime it can be given to the employee even just after 3 months if they satisfy company requirements. 4. Evaluation Period. After regularization you are expected to be evaluated annually for your job performance as well as how well you work with your co-workers. This will determine if you'll get an increase in salary or even a job promotion.  This is the regular course of an employed life in a company. There are many stages where the company can evaluate you and some corporate companies do have policies that can even remove you from your position if you fail to satisfy their requirements. An example will be tardiness. Most company will have a limit on how many times an employee can be late and absent. If you reach the limit, you will get a verbal warming, a written warning, suspension and even termination of your contract. Even if you are good in doing your job if you are not on time in going to your job, you will surely get fired.",True

Well, I am just sharing some inputs.  What is the difference between unemployment and underemployment?  Unemployment is a situation when a person seeking a job is unable to find one. Underemployment is a situation when a person is working but isn't working at his full capability. For example- working part time, working for less pay, doing a job which requires less skills than the person is capable of doing etc are cases of underemployment.  In Philippines, there are always a job-mismatched. Job-mismatched is under in underemployment where the worker's job is not suitable to his skills and ability. Due to the fact that the difficulty of finding a job is too much high, Filipinos are looking for the substitution or part time work in order to fill his time and earn an income.

Usually, countries that are developing and under develop experienced the same scenario.  I define unemployment as an economic situation where an individual is jobless, suitable for a job and cannot find a work under his field. While underemployment refers to the number of hours that a certain employee works for. Usually, an employee works 8 hours a day, so if you are working less than the normal work hours, I consider that you belongs in underemployed people. Job mismatch is commonly in every field due to the fact that there are many applicants and there is a limited job vacancies. There are people who want switch to other field than just to stay at their house.",True

A one on one interview can tell us more about the applicant, his behavior, mannerism, command on his language proficiency, confidence and many more. This step can not be eliminated in the hiring process. Going into training and having a medical check up for your record is also an important part in the hiring process. This will check how fit you are to the work and will set you ready for the job. Similarly, providing a copy of your documents like birth certificate, diploma, police clearance and other required documents is also a standard procedure in the job hiring process.

Because a validated profile works best with validated companies.

A good candidate doesn’t always search for job vacancies on their laptops or PCs. Smartphone is the new device for that purpose, especially in the developing countries since smart phones are now much affordable.  The job portals/companies should create and optimize job ads for mobile phones, as candidates search for job vacancies on their phones on the go. This will not only attract better candidates but will also provide the firm a diverse pool of candidates across geographies.  I agree, not all job candidates have a personal computer or laptop that they can use to search job vacancies, but most of the people nowadays do have celphones which more affordable than pc/laptop and are more easy to carry around wherever they go. This is why optimizing job ads for mobile devices is important, more people would access to job searches and Trustlogic would be able to reach and help more people with mobile devices.",True

The MoU revolves around the idea of integrating Republic of Guinea’s workforce on to TrustLogics’ global platform for employment and hiring considerations. During the next few months, TrustLogics and the Guinean government will be working closely to create a long-term sustainable plan for the country’s youth to compete with its global rivals on an equal footing. This objective is being pursued by establishing an effective framework and implementing fundamental principles.  According to 2016 World Bank estimates, Guinea is home to a population of 12.6 million, and an unemployment rate of 6.85% (down from an all-time high of 6.98% in 2013). The country is gradually rebuilding itself from the twin shocks of Ebola and a drastic fall in commodity prices.  With the signing of the MoU, the TrustLogics platform facilities Guinea’s government, by pooling up the resources of its various ministries, to improve the quality and quantity of its employment data with respect to most industry sectors. This is achieved by pursuing required analytics and the establishment of superior communication channels.  By shining the spotlight on various shortfalls and deficiencies of its recruitment industry, Guinea and TrustLogics will be perfectly placed to implement effective solutions. Through this strategic partnership, the Republic of Guinea will become the first African country to embrace cutting-edge blockchain technology to streamline its hiring and staffing processes.

Disability should not be a basis of not giving the person a chance to work on a decent job. Though it is a fact that people with disability have limited skills. We should give them a chance to those jobs that they can possibly do. I think Trustlogics will base their discretion on the existing laws about this. Actually, there are data that show that unemployment for disabled people is very high. Hopefully, Trustlogics will have a solution for this.

Employees always face the issues on working for a company despite worst conditions simply because one can't afford to loose the job. Trustlogics is a jobsite similar to other existing job website. It is not for Trustlogics to impose policies and salary, however they can include your desired salary in your profile or when applying for a job. Job offers are made at the end of an interview with consideration to ones's educational background, experience and other qualification. I think its a good option for jobseekers if they are able to rate a company, on blacklisting companies, I think this could be applied for those companies who are found guilty of breaking the law and abusing its employees. Trustlogics cannot just blacklist a company without good reason.",True

It would be too much for us to expect TrustLogics to interfere with Labor cases as such.  Let us be reminded that TrustLogics is on a global scale and dealing with local labor laws or each country would be too much of a complexity.  Though, i agree that it would be great if somehow TrustLogics could beef up protection not only for the jobseekers but for the employers too, as such, the blacklisting of the employer might be an option here.  Yet, let us consider that most employer-employee issues are of a case to case basis.  The good thing is that TrustLogics, while an avenue for employment, is also a reputation building platform where the major players are both the jobseekers and the employers.  So should anyone of us ran into employment troubles, it is our rightful duty to inform the community and make the proper review for a jobseeker or an employer .",True

The article is really a great insight on how AI could drive the hiring industry.  And this part did caught my attention:  Quote According to various industry experts, recruitment automation will augment and enhance human recruit abilities, rather than replace them completely.

Indeed true, validators will play a substantial role for TrustLogics as this is the key for reputation building.  As for the payment, it was mentioned in the whitepaper that who ever was the service requestor will be the one charged for the validation needed, so it means that any validation expenses can be addressed to either the jobseeker or the employer.  Yet again, the beauty of TrustLogics lie in the eradication o repetitive validation and submissiotns of credentials, information and the likes.  If a jobseeker already has his professional data validated and is up-to-date, then there is no more need for a recruiter to revalidate them nor to request for background checks.  As per the cost, i am betting hard that TrustLogics will be cheaper than companies performing background check themselves since TrustLogics will be operating on a global scale eliminating the need to contract two or more validators to complete a series of veriication.",True

People would be coming from different parts of the world, would they have representatives or offices in different countries to verify and make sure that the papers are legit and the applicant is qualified?   That's also some of the questions that come into my mind. how they can verify that the data provided by each applicant is correct. what if the data were incorrectly given to them to truslogic app? What if all countries placed in the trustlogic app will participate in them, are they all able to give them the right job? which suits them professional data and personal information.  Trustlogic have partnered with validators. They will be the one to verify information submitted by the user. It is similar to background checking. I believe that validators may vary from country to country.  they need to be specific and accurate about the credentials and information of the job seeker and also employers. they will be the one who will shoulder the fake information if they will not have that. trustlogic is the one to be sued by both parties if they will let fake info passed.  Trustlogic aims to provide quality database for both applicants and recruiters alike. I believe that as much as Trustlogic want to be as perfect as it want, their will always be a user who will put a wrong information just to test and try Trustlogics' accuracy. Trustlogic will not be liable to recruiters and applicants as the applicant and recruiters need also do their homework.  I agree with you. Please don't expect that TRUSTLOGICS System has to be a perfect system when they launched. Nothing is perfect. That is why research and development are there to enhance whatever was created. But the system mentioned in the Whitepaper is a great one. They also created this forum thread for them to know our thoughts so they will know the areas to develop the system.

First, the less cost hiring materials for the employers and the company itself. As an Industrial Engineer we used to minimize the cost and maximize the profit. Why hiring is so much to cost? First because of the materials using to hire someone like flyers and tarpaulin that must be given on people to hire. Second, the budget you must to pay to held the Job Fair or Job Hunt, sometimes it was held on malls and other commercial establishments.  Second, the honest applicants versus the dishonest applicant. I love the way you guys focuses on this problem because it is usually happening in the real life. Some of the people nowadays uses fake diplomas, papers and certificate just to say they graduated or attended on that prestige or high profile colleges and seminars. Sometime rather every time it is so unfair for the real ones who graduates and attended into colleges and seminars. I like the endorsement paper thing that you were proposing.

Anyone can claim they are good at anything with not being backed by data.  This is the differentiating factor of TrustLogics.  With genuine users getting their Background information, Education and past Employment details verified by certified validators, these fraud users easily get left out and eventually end up in lime light.  They will be more like junk profiles! So the profile will be of no use.  Since Recruiters will be in search of users whose profiles are 'verified by our BGC partners' there are good chances for deserving and genuine candidates.  On a side note, all the data is being saved on Private permission based blockchain, which will act like a ledger, where all the change requests will be tracked as transactions and our Algorithms can flag such users and take necessary action to maintain sanity of the platform.

We believe lot of dots needs to be connected to hit right spots and at right time. We believe we fall in the said category. Sure, since you asked how verification process happens -  Unlike other platforms where users can ask other users to endorse their skills, which in itself is a circle; We partnered with Certified Validator agencies who are legally eligible to perform background checks, at the consent of the user. Imagine this user endorsing another user. We believe the roots/starting point is sensible.  We extrapolated this and brought in RBS - Reputation Building System; where users can make use of this to have more trusted profile.  I hope you got a gist of the approach.  If you have any specific questions pertaining to the approach, head to our telegram group https://t.me/trustlogics and ask any questions. We have our founders and technology team in the group.

'How Blockchain technology integrating to the project' is a very broad question.  Nevertheless, considering the forum we are in, let me answer in a generic way so that all readers can understand -  Considering the number of users (current and future prospects), we decided to go with Hybrid approach where private blockchain, Hyperledger in our case, to store & retrieve data and public Blockchain, Ethereum, to record token state changes. This will help us in two ways -  1. This solution can be scaled to millions of users 2. Reducing transactions fee  Hyperledger, which will be hosted on cloud (in our case, we picked Amazon AWS) with necessary libraries and a REST API wrapper will be implemented with Read-Write API end points  Ethereum Blockchain will be used to deploy smart contracts, record token state changes (during transactions)  But, if you have any specific question to implementation, we can answer right on that. Please feel free to ask.  Being part of this project is so much fun, we have been on this for the past year.

To sum up its all about trustworthiness of the information provided by the prospective applicant right? This is by verifying the information we provide.  I do have an Idea on the hiring process particularly in my country. You go for an exam, initial interview, sometimes another exam, 2nd interview, then the final interview. And with all that hustle and bustle of the hiring process it does not guarantee you'll get the job even when your on the final interview. I see trustlogics platform is relevant to Professionals, ISPs and the Companies who wants to hire us. Please do note relevant information is important but actual performance or productivity of the employee is still the basis for his/her regularization, continuity and promotion.  In our country, employers can have access to your record to verify past employments, any issues with your previous employers, tardiness and other behaviors recorded on file are also being viewed. I think at this point, information provided to trustlogics platform is limited to what we will give you and traditional screening of prospective employees is still a must. I.D.'s, Deplomas and other credentials can also be faked. This is a real challenge for trustlogics platform to support your claim on reducing the cost and time of hiring for companies.",True
