Root blockchain is a blockchain as a service(BaaS). In simple word, RBC hides blockchain complexity from business and provides simple API to interact with blockchain.  VISION  Today everyone using HTTPS for secure communication between client and server. Although most of us do not know how HTTPS communication is secure and what are the complexity behind HTTPS, but we use it. RBC vision is to make problem-solving distributed blockchain accessible as simple as normal HTTPS for business. So that business can focus on their business, not on the complexity of distributed blockchain.  WHY RBC? WHY NOT ETHEREUM?  Ethereum is first programmable blockchain in which we can write our own smart contract which is fantastic! But for running a complete business on Ethereum network is not practical yet. Few reasons are: a) Slow transaction — Ethereum is too loo slow to run complete business over ethereum blockchain, business need very fast consensus. b) High mining fee — Ethereum is designed in such a way that GAS will increase if transaction data size is increased. Usually business needs a huge amount of data in the transaction. c) No privacy — Ethereum have no privacy, its problem for a business.  Solution with RBC:  a) RBC would be capable of solving above-mentioned problems.  b) RBC guarantees that transaction cost and time will never increase with transaction data size. c) RBC would provide privacy/ role-based access so that it can help business to solve the real problem      Benefits:  a) Middleman is removed from the business b)The cost to the customer is reduced (now customer need to pay only $105) c)Entry to the business is now almost free which means businesses will have fair competition. d)Transparent system for all the parties. e)Even small bus operator can easily go online. e)Even small bus operator can easily go online.  BUS TICKET BOOKING BUSINESS IN INDIA  a) The bus travel industry in India is unorganized and highly fragmented.

With a score of 4,7 out of 5 on ICObench it outperforms other coins such as ICON, Substratum, Fusion and other coins one must have in his portfolio. Rootblockchain wants to accomplish 2 things: they want to increase transaction speed and they want to decrease transaction costs. First I was not impressed with this idea because Root Blockchain would have lots of competitors, but recently I understood that Root Blockchain is going to distinguish themselves from their competitors by giving consumers the choice between different blockchains. Apart from the public blockchain, they will offer a private blockchain (where users have their own dedicated blockchain) and a consortium blockchain (where more parties can be linked). Imagine what this could mean for retailers! For this reason, I am very bullish on Root blockchain. Another reason is that they want to become fully operational in Q3 or Q4 of 2018. If they meet their deadlines, Root Blockchain could become a top 20 coin real soon!  Kind regards, Axel",False

Then all the transnational details with hash value and original files will be stored in the block. Suppose the file size you uploaded is of 100Gb. Now you can assume the blocksize. It will be huge. Which will results in high transnational fee and high block chain size, and low speed.  And this three are the top flaws of block chain technology.

We are only storing the hash value generated for your file in the block chain.' > Results in better privacy:  your uploaded file will be in the centralized  server and only the hash value corresponding to your file is in decentralized. > Results in low transaction fee: Since only the hash value will be stored in the blockchain, so file is not a key at all. > High speed: Lighter the blockchain size, higher the speed.",False

The major causes of anxiety are:  1.  Complexity – Blockchain technology involves an enrely new vocabulary. It has made cryptography more mainstream, but the highly specialized industry is chock-full of jargon. 2.  The Blockchain size – The size of the blockchain is a problem because the full node will have to store all the transactions that ever happened on the blockchain. This directly aﬀects the speed of operations on the blockchain. 3.  Transactional  data  size – This  will  add  to  the  blockchain  size  as  well  as  increase transaction costs. 4.  Prohibitive cost – Everyone wants to adopt blockchain technologies, but its cost prohibits many of us from doing this. 5.  Confusion of beginning – The major drawback of blockchain is Confusion regarding where  to  begin,  primarily  how  to  integrate  blockchain  into  an  exiting  IT infrastructure.  SOLUTIONS ______________  Root Blockchain aims to solve these problems with a unique offering - Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) - the first hybrid blockchain with multiple flexible options.  It is a known fact that the cost of transactions on BitCoin are rapidly increasing to a point when they will ultimately become economically unviable. At the same time, the time taken for a transaction to get confirmed has also increased. This is just one example of what ails the current blockchain solutions in the market.  Root Blockchain makes it easy for businesses to get started with blockchain. Flexible business models, coupled with a well-documented API and low costs enable businesses to easily plug the Root Blockchain into their existing setup and start reaping the benefits of blockchain technology. In addition, Root Blockchain offers multiple layers of data security and privacy that a customer may opt for.  Root Blockchain unique oﬀering:  1.  Resolve complexity via Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) – Root Blockchain oﬀers the ﬁrst  hybrid  blockchain  with  ﬂexible  opons  for  both  enterprise  and  retail customers. This segregaon will make it quite easy. 2.  Resolve the blockchain size – Root keeps the blockchain size small by using a unique mechanism - only cryptographic hashes of the transaction data are stored in the blockchain. 3.  Low transaction cost – Storing the actual data is optional. Since a transaction cost is directly proportional to the volume of data, by not storing data, a user can keep their transaction cost low. 4.  Keep data conﬁdenal – This is also useful if the data is conﬁdenal in nature and the user does not want it to be publicly available. 5.  Resolve transaction data size – Root Blockchain is completely API driven, which means that businesses can reap the beneﬁts of blockchain technology without the accompanying  complexity  and  costs  involved.  Simply  connect  your  exisng business to the Root API and get going. 6.  Secure vault – If the user requires to upload data along with the transaction, the Root Blockchain is integrated with a secure vault for the encrypted storage of digital assets. 7.  Low costs enable businesses – Root Blockchain makes it easy for businesses to get started with blockchain. It easily plugs into exiting setup and start reaping the beneﬁts of blockchain technology. 8.  Eﬃciency – Root Blockchain employs a unique mechanism to increase the speed of transaction conﬁrmaon on the blockchain, while at the same me keeping the costs low. 9.  Storage facility – Only digital ﬁngerprints of the actual transactional data are stored in the blockchain. Storage of the actual data itself is optional. If data storage is opted for, Root Blockchain provides a separate secure digital vault for encrypted data storage.  HOW IT WORKS ______________  Root Blockchain employs a unique mechanism to increase the speed of transaction confirmation on the blockchain, while at the same time keeping the costs low. Only digital fingerprints of the actual transaction data are stored in the blockchain. Storage of the actual data itself is optional. If data storage is opted for, Root Blockchain provides a separate secure digital vault for encrypted data storage.  Introduction Video:   MUTIPLE BENEFITS ______________  1.   Because only small digital fingerprints are actually stored in the Root Blockchain, the overall size will be much smaller compared to other blockchains and consequently, speed of operations on the Root Blockchain will be much faster. This in turn means that businesses can take advantage of a faster feedback loop for their transaction confirmation.  2.   Since ultimately the users of a blockchain pay for storage, by making storage optional, Root Blockchain provides its users with a way to reduce their overall costs. This has an added benefit that a business may choose to keep confidential data within its physical boundaries while at the same time taking advantage of the provenance and veracity of data that a blockchain has to offer.  BUSINESS MODELS ______________  1.  Private Blockchain - Customers may choose to have their own dedicated blockchain, where only their transactions will reside. 2.  Consortium Blockchain - A private blockchain for two or more parties. Consortiums are ideal for linking customers and vendors.  Secure, encrypted data storage is provided as an optional feature. This is linked to, but physically decoupled from the actual blockchain. The entire Root Blockchain offering is wrapped in an API layer which ensure that businesses can easily be up and running in a minimal time frame.  ROADMAP ______________  ROOT team is dedicated to keep the promises made and that is why we have started our development work even before ICO started.   TOKEN DETAILS ______________  .
