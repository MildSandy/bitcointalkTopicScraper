Smart Contract  A smart contract is similar to any other contract, a voluntary and mutual agreement between two or more parties stating certain conditions the parties agree to apply between them. Let’s take for example a sales agreement: Bob agrees to give Alice $100 and Alice agrees to give Bob a nice watch in return. In this contract, the applying conditions agreed upon are conditional and similar to any IFTTT (If This Then That) statement. When both conditions are met, the transfer will be executed. But, what if one out of two parties disagrees to fulfill the agreement? This is where a smart contract differs from a conventional contract. A smart contract exists on blockchain as a coded application which allows it not only to state negotiated conditions but also self-execution, verification, immutability and inherited enforcement.  Problem  At the current stage of blockchain technology, only tech literates can deploy blockchain based smart contracts. The mainstream platform for deploying blockchain based smart contracts on the Ethereum platform (ERC20) is using a new programming language called Solidity. Being a new language, Solidity’s smart contracts adoption level is not as wide as expected, as there are only a handful of programmers mastering the language so far. Users who are unfamiliar with programming or blockchain technology in general are also limited with scarce alternatives, leaving the potential of smart contracts concealed.  Solution  The iOlite Foundation has developed the Fast Adaptation Engine (FAE™) to make smart contracts easy and accessible for everyone. The FAE™ receives as input any text in any programming or natural language, then migrates it to any designated machine programming language. For example; you can type a text in English or any other language and the FAE™ will convert it into a coding language of your choice. Various plugins and APIs supporting Natural Language Programming (NLP) will enable writing smart contracts using free text.  Use Cases  The first beneficiaries of FAE™ will be R&D oriented communities publishing products which utilize smart contract benefits without in-depth knowledge of Solidity or ERC20 framework, thanks to iOlite’s plugins for Microsoft’s Visual Studio, Linux’s Apache, and other Integrated Development Environments.  Other non-technological- industries will follow in joining the platform. This includes legal and insurance companies, trade and finance establishments, banks, and many others.  The Future  iOlite’s end goal is to increase interaction with blockchain technologies and smart contracts through eliminating the need for a specific programing language to create a smart contract. We want to bridge the gap that exists between the blockchain space and the rest of the world. It’s an exciting challenge to make mass adoption of blockchain technologies possible, and that’s exactly what iOlite stands for.",False

In a world filled with emerging technologies, the blockchain technology is arguably one of the most exciting, being labeled as ‘disruptive’ and ‘innovative’ by many. Despite often being associated abundantly with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the underlying technology, this distributed ledger, the ‘blockchain’ has been receiving attention from a variety of industries. The concept of recording transactions in a secure, stable and chronological way, has led to possible applications in many areas.  Whilst we have to admit that blockchain is still in its infancy. Many issues like unwanted centralization, slow transaction verification times and low throughput aren’t easy to solve. We have to try and find the balance between security and speed.  To help you make sense of this complicated landscape we applied a simple SWOT analysis to the blockchain and integrated our iOlite’s solutions in this analysis.  Strengths  Save time and money — Blockchain is an amazing tool when it comes to operational efficiency. Assets can be transparently stored on the blockchain, and easily shared across organizations. Inefficient processes are timely and especially costly. Blockchain cuts these time-intensive bureaucratic processes.  Transparency — Blockchain provides us with tamper-proof data storage, not giving fraud any opportunity. No blockchain transaction can be tampered or deleted post-execution. All changes to public blockchains can be publicly viewable.  Advanced Durability — When there’s no central regulator, there’s no central point of failure as well. A central regulator. an admin, has the power to change all information as desired. Avoiding this is preferable, because it often leads to fraud. Aside from that, blockchain is more resistant to different types of malicious attacks trying to alter data or get in control.  User empowerment — Every usage party is directly in control of all their information and transaction history. Users can take back control over their data and decide who gets access to which part of your personal information. If LinkedIn decides to close your account, you lose all the data, connections, reputation, preferences, and interactions you’ve generated over the years. At the moment, big companies like Google and Facebook own your data. You’ve probably created a Google profile, put in all your information, and trusted them with all your personal data. If you request to remove your account, how can you be sure that they will wipe everything they know about you?  Opportunities  iOlite helps to create new opportunities by enabling blockchain for everyone. Mass adoption of blockchain technologies will take a couple of years because the concept of a blockchain isn’t easy to fully grasp. iOlite understands that smart contracts have the power to enable new business models. However, there is a shortage of smart contract developers, and in addition, developing smart contracts is very costly.  To give both businesses and users the power to easily create smart contracts and Decentralized Apps on blockchains, iOlite is developing an engine where developers can create smart contracts by just using their existing programming language. This will extend to natural language (e.g. English, Russian) inputs.   Together with its community, the iOlite system continually learns how to build and optimize smart contract modules and building blocks, for subsequent re-use.  The result is an environment where smart contracts are available to all, being efficiently created and deployed, and giving major cost savings for partners.  Threats  Scalability issues — Blockchains do have limitations in term of the number of transactions it can handle. This problem has again been exposed by the mass adoption of Crypto Kitties on the Ethereum blockchain.  Unwanted centralization — Large mining pools and mining farms unwillingly centralize the power of the blockchain. Aside of that, these pools of centralization trash the blockchain environment as conflicting visions appear between miners and platform users.  Quantum Computers — There is a possibility that quantum computers become powerful enough to decipher data, which is a real threat for a blockchain.  Hype — Blockchain is still in the phase of being a hype. Not many blockchain products that do solve real-world problems are actively in use.  Fast-changing environment — Blockchain is well-known as a fast-changing and very volatile environment. This fast-paced environment is not ideal for existing business models that mostly rely on stability.  Mass adoption — Mass adoption is the largest obstacle to overcome. Proper education is required to give new users a good understanding of the space and usage. Again, iOlite is playing a role in this mass adoption by offering a so-called ‘Bridge Product’.  The iOlite engine is capable of translating code and even natural language to smart contracts. In this way, iOlite helps to bridge this huge blockchain gap.  Weaknesses  Business rules change over time, but a blockchain is not fit to adapt to change. In addition, blockchains are mostly not modular. What if we want to replace an outdated encryption module? Or what if we want to export our data to a new blockchain? A blockchain does not provide an out-of-the-box exit strategy.  The environmental impact of blockchains is something to bear in mind. Algorithms like proof-of-work are resource-intensive. A lot of energy is used / wasted by this algorithm.  At last, most blockchains are potentially in conflict with existing approaches to regulatory compliance, for example, GDPR regulations. Summary  iOlite has spotted some critical weaknesses like mass adoption of blockchain technologies and easy creation of smart contracts. We experience a huge shortage on blockchain developers. iOlite provides a tool which benefits both developers as non-tech persons. This tool — also referred as engine — enables you to create smart contracts in any preferred programming language or even with natural language (e.g. English or Russian).

An article published on the 14th of February by TechCrunch states there is a huge shortage of blockchain engineers. At the moment, there are 14 job offerings for every one blockchain developer. Although, the “$/knowledge” ratio increased even further this year in the blockchain space, where capital by far outpaces talent.  Disclaimer: I do not guarantee you will get rich.  “Requests for on-demand blockchain talent are skyrocketing. Last year, freelance talent marketplace Upwork saw blockchain rise to the fastest-growing skill out of more than 5,000 skills in terms of freelancer billings — a year-over-year increase of more than 35,000 percent. These requests span smart contract development, blockchain engineering projects, and overall blockchain consultancy.“  This is the top three most wanted skills:      Hyperledger Fabric: an enterprise blockchain framework focused on modularity and scalability to support the often changed business rules.     Ripple development: a payment protocol used for distributed processes for remittances, payments and exchanges.     Solidity smart contract development on the Ethereum network.  The blockchain ‘niche’ has the most high-paying jobs as even classic companies of the financial sector, like Bank of America, Visa, and others are seeking to explore blockchain technology.    Blockchain developers in the US earn up to $130k a year, by estimates of Computerworld. At the same time, software developers earn up to $105k a year. Such data was published by Matt Siegelman, the CEO of the data analysis campaign of the Burning Glass Technologies company performance.    What can we do?  First of all, iOlite is a project that helps to fill up this shortage. They are developing a product that is capable of understanding natural language and translating this to executable smart contract code. This seems to be the ideal solution, although we still need knowledgeable smart contract developers to define structures in combination with Solidity code so normal users can use this library of structures to create smart contracts based on their needs. To give developers the possibility to as well create smart contracts more easily, we offer developer plugins to translate mass programming languages to smart contract code.    Massive open online course (MOOC) platforms try to catch up with blockchain technology by providing blockchain related coding courses. This gives normal developers the possibility to jump in this new and exciting world of blockchain development. The high “$/knowledge” ration is another incentive for developers to become a blockchain developer.  Although, we have noticed that these courses do not provide in-depth knowledge on the matter. We don’t expect a MOOC graduate to develop a perfectly fine smart contract which can be used by an ICO, and they shouldn’t do as we are talking about millions of dollars.    At last, private talent networks like Toptal offer top quality blockchain engineering talent to be consulted by companies. This makes it easier for companies to find blockchain talent.  Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, thinks blockchain developers should be employed by multiple companies to democratize the knowledge they gather so more developers can discover and explore the possibilities of the blockchain. It’s easier to get started with blockchain development when you have a ‘buddy’ who can guide you on this quest.  Source: techcrunch.com",False

Below, you see the sequence of the Fast Adaptation Engine (FAE).  Different Elements     Author (~ requester for solution): Person who is trying to write a smart contract for a specific use.    Contributor: Smart contract developer who is taking the unknown expressions and defines the structures for it.    iOlite Parser: Grammar lexical engine from Stanford.    iOlite Blockchain: Place we store information about transactions and structures. We will first start using Ethereum. However, as Ethereum is overloaded and not adapted for our specific use case, we will build our own iOlite blockchain. Why? We try to make the most effective nodes for our use case which have to hold mostly dictionary info instead of historical info about transactions. That’s the reason we want to start with a clean blockchain and make it more suitable for languages.    iOlite smart contract: This can be an Ethereum smart contract in the beginning, but we want to move to iOlite smart contracts which are optimized for natural language processing (NLP).    iOlite Miner: very similar to Ethereum miner which gives iOlite tokens (iLT) as a reward.  Use Cases  Use case 1: We start writing an expression that gets picked up by the iOlite parser. The parser immediately finds a translation in its expressions pool. In this case, the parser returns the created smart contract code. This is the most ideal and fastest possible solution.  Use case 2: We submit an expression to the parser, but the parser isn’t able to find a solution for this request. However, although he couldn’t find the correct structures in the main domain, there is a solution available in the staging domain created which is not yet approved by the iOlite team. The requester can decide whether he wants to use this solution.  Use case 3: Parsing failed, and there are no options available from staging. Now, contributors will get a notification there is an unsolved expression. If a contributor finds a solution, he can submit the structures which make part of this solution to the iOlite blockchain to be stored. The blockchain request a signature for the new block containing the solution from the iOlite miner. If the contributor used other contributors’ work, they will receive iOlite tokens as a reward because of this reuse.  At this point, the solution is added to the staging phase. After approval from the iOlite team, the requester can actually deploy the created smart contract on the iOlite blockchain. The contributor will get a fee for his work from the miner who processes the deployment of the smart contract. In this way, the author of the expression doesn’t have to pay for the whole process.",False
