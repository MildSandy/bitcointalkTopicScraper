First of all this faucet is not like The Bitcoin Faucet from ye olden days which gave out 5 Bitcoin. Can you believe it? 5 real Bitcoin for free!  The Dusk testnet faucet can be compared to the Ethereum Ropsten testnet faucet and the Bitcoin testnet faucets: these coins are meant for development only and have no value.  Specifically, every day you can get 10 tDusk by tweeting your public address, which you get after creating a wallet through the Dusk node command line interface. You then have to copy paste the URL of the Tweet into the faucet. After a few seconds the 10 tDusk is added to your wallet. You can use the tDusk to test transactions, to stake or to bid.

Dusk's consensus mechanism has built in resistence (on the protocol level) against the attack vectors commonly talked about in literature on (d)PoS, namely:  1) nothing-at-stake attack - in summary it is the problem with (d)PoS systems where nodes don't lose anything from behaving badly, they lose nothing by forking the chain as they will receive both coins on both chains if a fork happens. Note: this problem does not exist with Proof-of-Work (PoW) as the miner gets the most reward from being on the correct chain as that is where their hashing power lies, and;  2) long-range-attacks -  because of its voting system that is built into the Dusk blockchain and is being engineered to avoid chain divergence.  As for the nodes: Network nodes - transactional network clients. They compete with each other by locking an arbitrary amount for the generating and proposing of new blocks. Block generation is a computationally light task and therefore running a node does not require neither specialised equipment nor storage. The intention is for normal mobile devices to be able to run as a node within the network. The non-deterministic nature of the bidding process makes it so that even nodes bidding the minimum amount of DUSK have a fair chance to win the block generation sortition lottery.  Provisioners - These are nodes that have committed a certain minimum stake to the Dusk Network and take care of more network intensive tasks such as block verification, voting, and notarization (VVN operations). These types of nodes are non-transactional  The intention is to create an economy where nodes compete for block rewards, while Provisioners earn a steady ROI.",False

Click the title to read the full announcement!   (Full privacy in account-based cryptocurrencies!)  A novel Zero-knowledge Account-Based design by Dusk Network to address the issues of enhancing UTXO and Account-Based designs with privacy.  In this post we release details on our design for a novel fully private account-based model for layer 2 tokens and Zero-Knowledge smart contracts. Until now, there were only 2 models. UTXO and account-based. We introduce a 3rd: Zero-Knowledge Account-Based.  What can we do with this? This is the basis for zero-knowledge smart contracts within Dusk Network. Removes the need for ring signatures. Power on-chain governance features based on Bulletproofs to provide auditability and compliance prerequisites in Confidential Security Contracts (XSC). With Bulletproofs, there is no need for a trusted setup, thus enabling fully trust-less privacy. Create proofs of correctness. Create policy proofs.  Why we are excited Without this: cryptocurrencies are stuck in the smart contract middle ages with no support for layer 2 privacy tokens, have to rely on trusted setups, have to deal with centralized transaction restrictions and off-chain processing. With this: Dusk inaugurates the era of natively private and compliant layer 2 (security) tokens.

This means that all the ERC-20 tokens now also start their vesting at July 1st, until Nov 30th.  On the one hand it is fortunate that they have agreed to reset the starting date to July 1st. Not doing so would have meant over half the private sale supply would immediately be available on the market.  On the other hand, the original vesting period was one year, now it is reduced to less than half a year. Effectively the token release rate has more than doubled.

(Dusk Network Integrates Binance Chain)  All of us at Dusk Network are very excited to announce that Dusk Network has committed to integrating our privacy-oriented blockchain with the Binance Chain, a new blockchain system developed by world-leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance and the community. As part of the effort, we will be migrating a part of our token ecosystem to Binance Chain.  Binance DEX application & welcoming contribution Mels Dees, on behalf of Dusk Network has submitted a proposal to list DUSK on Binance DEX  We believe our integration with Binance Chain and application to the Binance DEX should not come empty-handed, but bear proof of our ability to contribute. Therefore, we are excited to announce two Binance Chain Evolution Proposals (BEPs). 1. BEP-AF: preventing Powerful Adversary Front-running 2. EP-PoPoS: Proof of Proof of Stake  Integration details The integration will consist of the launch of a new BEP-2 token called DUSK, symbol (DUSK-45E).

They are connected through a websocket stream to a centralized server that pushes ZK proofs that the browser node verifies. The idea is to stage the nodes and keep them running for a period of time before turning them either into fully functional blindbidders (block generator nodes) or zero-knowledge proof validators. This means not only that the browser nodes will be connected to the network in a decentralized way, but rather that they WILL be an active part of the decentralized network",False

It lends processing power to the Dusk network to verify ZK proofs, not dissimilarly from the process envisioned by the truebit protocol. It is NOT proof of work (where miners uselessly compute the pre-image of a sha256 hash) since the consensus does not depend on it in the slightest. It is rather helping the network with verification of various zero-knowledge proofs in order to lighten the CPU load of the full nodes. The aim is to expand these browser nodes into full fledge block generators (which will participate to the consensus and get the rewards when they produce an accepted block) or verifiers (who can verify a zero-knowledge computation on behalf of the network). The malicious mode simulates a node acting maliciously on the network (i.e. telling the server that the proof is valid when it is not or that it is invalid when it actually is valid). It is a way for us to test the slashing algorithm in case a node acts against the protocol.",False

Compared to competitor hash functions, such as Pedersen Hash, Poseidon uses up to 8x fewer constraints per message bit, which means that it is significantly faster.  Dusk uses zero-knowledge cryptography to preserve privacy.  For example to prove that a user is part of a whitelist, a coin is unspent, proving the knowledge of a hash pre-image and much more. To do that effectively, we organize a so-called Merkle tree (not for every above-mentioned use case) that is used to prove that the transactor knows the opening of an element. The complexity of a proof depends on how large the circuit is, that is required to compute the path of the Merkle tree. Regular cryptographic hash functions such as SHA-256 or SHA-3 require large circuits as they are not tailored to finite fields used in ZK proof systems. Poseidon is a hash function designed to minimize the size of the circuits and thus to minimize the prover and verifier complexities.  We have created the first Poseidon implementation in Rust.

With excitement we present our first of many public code releases.  The Corretto curve is an elliptic curve developed by Dusk Network based on the Ristretto scalar field. Originally designed to abstract non-prime-order curves into prime-order scalar fields, the Ristretto abstraction would have been far too inefficient to implement for Bulletproofs. Fortunately, our team had designed a brand new curve that enables Dusk Network to utilize the power of the Ristretto scalar field while not indulging in the complex and Bulletproof-unfriendly abstractions that are associated with Ristretto.  Corretto opens up new opportunities for the use cases of zero-knowledge proofs inside the Dusk Network protocol as well as making our Bulletproof-integrated ring signature substitute possible.

This basically forces issuers to avail of off-chain solutions which is very expensive and defeats the purpose of 1) decentralization 2) common task automation 3) streamline legal process 4) performances (as trading restriction needs to be arbitrated all the time through third party smart contracts, rather than being embedded at protocol level). So, to be able to meet the requirements of STOs, Ethereum needs third party platforms (like Polymath, Harbor, etc etc) which are basically application-level smart contracts, which resort mostly to off-chain processing, with no exception.  This is also because these platforms have absolutely no say at the protocol level and must adapt to what it is available to them. In that respect, they have a very limited control on the confidentiality level (and in fact they resort almost always to suboptimal off-chain solutions - see for example Harbor, Polymath or even Securitize) and are bound to biblical release time for anything that revolves around NFRs (Non Functional Requirements, such as, for instance, scalability, security, resource management, network configurations, SLAs, etc etc) since Ethereum must scale GLOBALLY all the propositions (meaning smart contracts or set of smart contracts).  Dusk is NOT a general purpose smart contract platform. It is extremely focused on the use cases it intends to unlock and as a result it can be very specific in the strategies it adopts to scale and satisfy the NFRs of the use cases at hand.  It basically focuses on providing the right confidentiality in the 3 different scenario that render the platform a true network: 1 - Unidirectional atomic transfer of value (basically, payments) 2 - Bidirectional atomic exchange of value (transfer of asset ownership - securities fall in this category) 3 - Time unbound exchange of value (transmission of data stream - such as audiovisual conferencing, content streaming, etc)  We are gonna rollout sequentially the three layers of the network, which will each unlock one of these 3 parts However we believe that 2 is the most critical as it taps into a market which potential is in the Trillions of Euros Since we are heavily partial for this particular use case, it is very logical that we adjust the protocol to satisfy all the regulations (and not, like in the cases above, adjust the application layer to workaround the protocol limitations)  To give you an example of what we can do on Dusk which would be unthinkable in Ethereum please consider the following feature.  Dusk decouples the (centralized) KYC/AML vendor process from the (decentralized) security issuance and transaction arbitration with the aid of time-locked accumulators. Cryptographic accumulators are ideal for implementing zero-knowledge white/black listing accreditation of (un-)compliant investors and automated accreditation. Also, expiry mechanism can be added for forcing rechecks. It roughly works in the following way: as soon as the KYC/AML process completes, the transactor identifier (basically his registered wallet address, but it can also be something else, i.e. biometric data, etc) is committed to the accumulator, which remains opaque and discloses nothing of its set. A witness (called compliance witness) is thus generated and returned to the applicant. Such witness is the proof of set inclusion. From that point on, all transactions related to that particular asset class (token) must include the compliance witness. Since the info is directly added as payload of our own (improved) version of bulletproof transactions, the need for open data inspection on transaction clearance is therefore removed. The accumulator is stored on-chain (as it basically is just a number) and recheck forcing can happen through a removal operation which activation can be coded trustlessly and can be as simple as a periodic expiry or by encoding more sophisticated rules through a (zk-)smart contract. Dusk will host the accumulators directly ON CHAIN, since it is line with our strategy to handle scenario nr. 2 of the above list  Ethereum would never do such a thing considering that it would not make sense to store a data structure on chain that is specific for a tiny fraction of its applications (i.e. Polymath and Harbor) and would be completely useless for, say, propositions such as Omisego, Kyber, Basic Attention Token, Bancor, Status, Civic, Aragon, etc etc.  This means that the applications would have to battle against the Ethereum protocol (i.e. move an eventual accumulator off-chain to the detriment of decentralization).  This would have nefarious consequences for scalability as well, considering that these proposition must resort to  continuously calling smart contracts in order to arbitrate the transaction operations (to the detriment of both performance and privacy), while Dusk is in the liberty of enriching the transaction directly with zero knowledge data from the transactors (the compliance witness), leaving absolute liberty over which vendor the issuer wants to rely upon and keeping the centralized compliance-related operations (like for instance KYC/AML) separated from the transaction stream.",False

Check this FAQ:  Dusk Foundation wants to work with regulators, yet it's building a privacy platform. These two cannot be reconciled - why would a regulator work with a platform that removes government surveillance power? This is a misconception. In democratic societies, privacy is very well accepted and even enforced at legislative levels by policy makers. An example is the GDPR. Another is the SEC enforcing secrecy to trading bodies in the stock market to prevent price manipulation. The Dusk Network provides the same level of privacy enforced by regulators. Only, it eliminates the “trusted third party” and returns the power of disclosure directly to the user.  For instance, in the case of payment, it is the responsibility of the wallet holder to show the details of the transactions on request of the auditors (by providing a view-key). In the use case of security, compliant confidentiality is achieved with KYC built in the protocol and the use of zero knowledge accumulators to keep the whitelist confidential.",False

It is extremely focused on the use cases it intends to unlock and as a result it can be very specific in the strategies it adopts to scale and satisfy the NFRs of the use cases at hand.  It basically focuses on providing the right confidentiality in the 3 different scenario that render the platform a true network: 1 - Unidirectional atomic transfer of value (basically, payments) 2 - Bidirectional atomic exchange of value (transfer of asset ownership - securities fall in this category) 3 - Time unbound exchange of value (transmission of data stream - such as audiovisual conferencing, content streaming, etc)  We are gonna rollout sequentially the three layers of the network, which will each unlock one of these 3 parts However we believe that 2 is the most critical as it taps into a market which potential is in the Trillions of Euros Since we are heavily partial for this particular use case, it is very logical that we adjust the protocol to satisfy all the regulations (and not, like in the cases above, adjust the application layer to workaround the protocol limitations)  To give you an example of what we can do on Dusk which would be unthinkable in Ethereum please consider the following feature.  Dusk decouples the (centralized) KYC/AML vendor process from the (decentralized) security issuance and transaction arbitration with the aid of time-locked accumulators. Cryptographic accumulators are ideal for implementing zero-knowledge white/black listing accreditation of (un-)compliant investors and automated accreditation. Also, expiry mechanism can be added for forcing rechecks. It roughly works in the following way: as soon as the KYC/AML process completes, the transactor identifier (basically his registered wallet address, but it can also be something else, i.e. biometric data, etc) is committed to the accumulator, which remains opaque and discloses nothing of its set. A witness (called compliance witness) is thus generated and returned to the applicant. Such witness is the proof of set inclusion. From that point on, all transactions related to that particular asset class (token) must include the compliance witness. Since the info is directly added as payload of our own (improved) version of bulletproof transactions, the need for open data inspection on transaction clearance is therefore removed. The accumulator is stored on-chain (as it basically is just a number) and recheck forcing can happen through a removal operation which activation can be coded trustlessly and can be as simple as a periodic expiry or by encoding more sophisticated rules through a (zk-)smart contract. Dusk will host the accumulators directly ON CHAIN, since it is line with our strategy to handle scenario nr. 2 of the above list  Ethereum would never do such a thing considering that it would not make sense to store a data structure on chain that is specific for a tiny fraction of its applications (i.e. Polymath and Harbor) and would be completely useless for, say, propositions such as Omisego, Kyber, Basic Attention Token, Bancor, Status, Civic, Aragon, etc etc.  This means that the applications would have to battle against the Ethereum protocol (i.e. move an eventual accumulator off-chain to the detriment of decentralization).  This would have nefarious consequences for scalability as well, considering that these proposition must resort to  continuously calling smart contracts in order to arbitrate the transaction operations (to the detriment of both performance and privacy), while Dusk is in the liberty of enriching the transaction directly with zero knowledge data from the transactors (the compliance witness), leaving absolute liberty over which vendor the issuer wants to rely upon and keeping the centralized compliance-related operations (like for instance KYC/AML) separated from the transaction stream.",False

Development An eventful month for the development team at Dusk! With the core cryptography module almost done and dusted, we are slowly starting to ramp up our work on the most unique module of Dusk Network - the consensus module. Our cryptography module consists of Ristretto curve, Bulletproof, MLSAG and Pedersen Commitment implementations alongside helper cryptographic functions. Parallelly, our developers have been working on a wiring module - the artery of the platform. The wiring module, otherwise known as a networking layer, includes Secure Tunnel Switching (STS) and Garlic Routing.  We are on track to launch the devnet in December 2018, which will enable the community to see the project’s core modules in action and allow the team to assess the performance metrics on a live network. More details about the launch will be revealed later.    Research The addition of Dmitry Khovratovich, the co-creator of Equihash, Argon2 and Guru algorithms is crucial in our mission to innovate. With his help, the team is researching alternative mechanisms to non-interactive verifiable secret sharing, which can potentially increase the throughput of the consensus while continuing to conceal the blind bids. Apart from the aforementioned research, Dmitry is helping the team to improve our cryptography library.  Our team is in the process of reworking the Dusk Network technical documentation. Having improved on a few major technical aspects of the original whitepaper, we think that it is the right time to update the outdated documentation. We are scheduling the release of the updated whitepaper and a brand new SBA⋆ technical paper alongside the devnet launch in December 2018.    Community With the announcement of our partnership with iFinex, Dusk Network has secured a dual free listing on both Bitfinex and Ethfinex, as well as becoming the first token to be offered through the Ethfinex Token Sale platform.  After a successful conclusion of the Telegram AMA with Richard Sanders, the co-founder of CipherBlade and Dusk Foundation Advisor, the team is working hard to plan similar events with other team members and advisors.  How to learn more about Dusk Network The Dusk Network is a project coordinated by the Dusk Foundation. We are a decentralized ecosystem entirely focused on providing the perfect trade-off between privacy and transparency.

Dusk Network is proud to announce that Dmitry Khovratovich, the inventor of Equihash joins Dusk Network as Lead Cryptographer.  As a cryptographer, Dmitry is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Luxembourg, and author for the International Association for Cryptologic Research. He developed the Equihash Proof-of-work algorithm which is currently being used as consensus mechanism for the ZCash cryptocurrency, and the Argon2 key derivation function, which won the Password Hashing Competition in July 2015.    He is the publisher of several Cryptanalysis papers for a number of mainstream cyphers, such as the first cryptanalytic attack on full-round AES-192 and AES-256 which is faster than a brute-force attack, an attack on the Radio Gatún cryptographic primitive, and also the current best cryptanalysis on Skein, a candidate for the SHA-3 competition.  In 2014, he published research about the deanonymisation of clients in the Bitcoin P2P network.  Dmitry has broken a number of ciphers and hash functions and is quoted: “Give me a system and I will find a weakness”. He is also the author of the Guru reputation system that Dusk Network will employ to ensure convergence of voting in the shortest amount of time.  “Dmitry is one of the leading figures in the world of cryptographic research, and the studies he published during the past years show the passion he has for his work.

Dusk decouples the (centralized) KYC/AML vendor process from the (decentralized) security issuance and transaction arbitration with the aid of time-locked accumulators. Cryptographic accumulators are ideal for implementing zero-knowledge white/black listing accreditation of (un-)compliant investors and automated accreditation. Also, expiry mechanism can be added for forcing rechecks. It roughly works in the following way: as soon as the KYC/AML process completes, the transactor identifier (basically his registered wallet address, but it can also be something else, i.e. biometric data, etc) is committed to the accumulator, which remains opaque and discloses nothing of its set. A witness (called compliance witness) is thus generated and returned to the applicant. Such witness is the proof of set inclusion. From that point on, all transactions related to that particular asset class (token) must include the compliance witness. Since the info is directly added as payload of our own (improved) version of bulletproof transactions, the need for open data inspection on transaction clearance is therefore removed. The accumulator is stored on-chain (as it basically is just a number) and recheck forcing can happen through a removal operation which activation can be coded trustlessly and can be as simple as a periodic expiry or by encoding more sophisticated rules through a (zk-)smart contract. Dusk will host the accumulators directly ON CHAIN, since it is line with our strategy to handle scenario nr. 2 of the above list",False

Partnering with iFinex, provides Dusk Network with an undisputable strategic advantage. Not only have the leaders of iFinex provided valuable advice on liquidity, tokenomics, lock-up and vesting but have also helped leverage their financial services network. For iFinex, the objective is to present the world’s best tokens to their customers. With that in mind they are providing a free dual listing for DUSK on both the Bitfinex and Ethfinex exchanges. In return, iFinex will receive a period of exclusivity for the listing, thus giving their members a unique opportunity to obtain and trade DUSK tokens before other exchanges gain access. This is the first token sale to be made available to Ethfinex users via its newly released token sale platform.  Furthermore, iFinex have themselves taken a $1m allocation in the current private sale, part of which they will offer to their platform users. This level of support by a world leading exchange is unprecedented, and this allocation, free dual listing and support pays testament to the calibre of Dusk Network.  There are very strong marketing synergies, with mutual benefit in promoting the other via physical and digital events. Dusk Network and iFinex both have strong European bases and will help to reinforce Europe as a leading jurisdiction for excellent projects to build, grow, establish and list.  DUSK Sale on Ethfinex DUSK is launching in December as an ERC-20 voucher. To help spread liquidity and create a larger base of DUSK owners we are helping iFinex host a DUSK sale on the Ethfinex platform. This sale will be great in aligning all of our fans and early adopters with the exchange where DUSK will trade first.  The exact details of the DUSK Ethfinex sale can be found below: $5000 allocation per user available for 200 users Allocation is granted through random selection Users need to perform KYC on Ethfinex, to be compliant with Dusk Network’s KYC/AML requirements  You can apply for allocation here!

What this means in practice is that at any point a token investor wanted to release their tokens, they can make a call on the smart contract and then will have access to the total number of tokens that will have vested at that second.  As an example: after the lockup, tokens will be vested over 31,536,000 seconds (365 days x 24 hours x 60 minutes x 60 seconds). If they did it at exactly 6 months, they would receive half. If they did it at 1 day, then 10 days, then 57 days, and then every 3 weeks; they would receive the relevant whole tokens (rounded down) at each specific second.  So imagine you purchased 1,000,000 tokens and want to withdraw the first second; 1,000,000 (total allocation) / 31,536,000 (total seconds in a year) * 1 = 0.032 DUSK  So imagine you purchased 1,000,000 tokens and want to withdraw after a week; 1,000,000 (total allocation) / 31,536,000 (total seconds in a year) * 604,800 (total seconds in a week) = 19,178.08 DUSK  So imagine you purchased 1,000,000 tokens and want to withdraw after a month; 1,000,000 (total allocation) / 31,536,000 (total seconds in a year) * 2,628,000 (total seconds in a month) = 83,333.33 DUSK  So imagine you purchased 1,000,000 tokens and want to withdraw after 9 months; 1,000,000 (total allocation) / 31,536,000 (total seconds in a year) * 23,652,000 (total seconds in 9 months) = 750,000 DUSK  I hope this clearifies it!

Ethereum is very poorly suited for both privacy and security which is exactly what's required by regulators when talking about STO's. Take for instance Polymath; You can't launch an STO on their platform without going through them (getting their approval), which indicates centralization. Using their platform is also done OFF-chain. All they are is a centralised enitity with some aspects related to blockchain. Most of the other projects don't focus on anonymity and privacy which is what is needed to launch an STO. Securities come paired with high KYC standards. If a project want to be fully regulatory compliant they'll need to have the KYC part figured out, it's the most important thing when it comes to securities. It's great to see that Dusk knows what is needed for a network suitable for launching STO's. Hence I don't think they need to rush because of the competition. To be completely honest; there's barely any competition. The other projects trying to accomplish such a platform will not get around regulatory standards, they're doomed to fail.  Anyways, I'm really excited to see how Dusk will tackle the trading of STO's. Perhaps some kind of DEX? you're building a private chain after all. Also can't wait for the exchange announcement this week, if it's a big exchange that's investing in Dusk then I'm sure you guys will deliver!",False

We are proud to announce our partnership with BlockVenture Coalition (BVC).  About BlockVenture Coalition (BVC) The BlockVenture Coalition is the largest alliance of university blockchain groups and venture money in the world (41 university/research groups, 44 blockchain specific VCs). Their mission is to connect high potential blockchain companies with the resources they need to excel, while spurring inter-university collaboration. They have deep media connections, exchange relationships, and currently come across 5–6 blockchain startups a day (which will bolster the STO Incubator project flow). The Dusk Network has a very strong academic component — our whitepaper is a formalized academic proof, and many of our other research compendia and partners are following the highest level of academic R&D standards. It’s important to stay on top of the latest research coming out of universities — Dusk will do this through the BVC.    The BVC provides connections with solid public research and can kickstart adoption through user groups, node-running communities, public developers, and many more academically relevant avenues. They will be the key player to connect Dusk Network to the top Universities in the USA and the rest of the Americas, to ensure a healthy talent pipeline for Dusk Network.  Another key element the BVC is bringing to the table is their great connections to major exchanges in the USA. Dusk Network has a solid network in Europe, and wants to operate at the same level on all continents. For us the BVC is the partner that will enable DUSK to trade on the best US exchanges.  Finally, the BVC will help Dusk Network get a foot on the ground in the USA’s regulatory space. Dusk Network’s STO Incubator will initially focus on well understood local jurisdictions, but will inevitably tackle the USA’s securities space. A local partner will be a requirement to prevent a difficult process becoming impossible.  Words from BVC ‘Dusk Network immediately sprang out as a unique project to us. Their approach to deal with regulatory compliance and privacy on-chain makes me think of a private, scalable version of Ethereum’ - Philip Forte, Partner at BlockVenture Coalition.  ‘We are extremely excited to start creating awareness around Dusk Network in our University Alliance. There is a lot of talent here and I want to make sure it ends up working for the right projects.’ - Tyler Wellener, Partner at BlockVenture Coalition.  How to learn more about Dusk Network The Dusk Network is a project coordinated by the Dusk Foundation. We are a decentralized ecosystem entirely focused on providing the perfect trade-off between privacy and transparency. Dusk protects privacy and fits regulations in payments, communications and asset transfers.

To be implicitly compliant with EU regulators (important for our intention of implementing a confidential security token framework) under the premise that the whole development (so not only the currency) will be led according to strict EU compliant project management framework.

As for the competition, most of the other projects build on top of Ethereum which offers no ledger privacy apart from zk-SNARKS (which is reliant on a trusted setup which needs to run at any configuration change). This basically forces issuers to avail of off-chain solutions which is very expensive and defeats the purpose of 1) decentralization 2) common task automation 3) streamline legal process 4) performances (as trading restriction needs to be arbitrated all the time through third party smart contracts, rather than being embedded at protocol level). So, to be able to meet the requirements of STOs, Ethereum needs third party platforms (like Polymath, Harbor, etc etc) which are basically application-level smart contracts, which resort mostly to off-chain processing, with no exception.  This is also because these platforms have absolutely no say at the protocol level and must adapt to what it is available to them. In that respect, they have a very limited control on the confidentiality level (and in fact they resort almost always to suboptimal off-chain solutions - see for example Harbor, Polymath or even Securitize) and are bound to biblical release time for anything that revolves around NFRs (Non Functional Requirements, such as, for instance, scalability, security, resource management, network configurations, SLAs, etc etc) since Ethereum must scale GLOBALLY all the propositions (meaning smart contracts or set of smart contracts)  Dusk is NOT a general purpose smart contract platform. It is extremely focused on the use cases it intends to unlock and as a result it can be very specific in the strategies it adopts to scale and satisfy the NFRs of the use cases at hand.  It basically focuses on providing the right confidentiality in the 3 different scenario that render the platform a true network: 1 - Unidirectional atomic transfer of value (basically, payments) 2 - Bidirectional atomic exchange of value (transfer of asset ownership - securities fall in this category) 3 - Time unbound exchange of value (transmission of data stream - such as audiovisual conferencing, content streaming, etc)",False

Verdict Below is a breakdown of the risks and growth potential of Dusk Network.  Risks     No working product. (-1.5)     No public GitHub. (-1)  Growth Potential     Team members are highly experienced in blockchain development. (+3.5)     If the transition from ICOs to STOs actually occurs, the Dusk Network will be one of the first projects to lead the charge. (+2)     Advanced technical features. (+3)  Disposition Dusk Network is a decentralized infrastructure aiming to provide privacy while staying legally complaint. Thanks to its highly advanced technical features, the infrastructure will have low-latency services, enabling its users to have almost real-time operations. The sky is the limit for possibilities, whether it is anonymous storage or security token offerings. If a transition from the classic model of fundraising for blockchain projects, namely initial coin offerings or ICOs, to STOs, actually happens, the Dusk Network would be one of the first platforms for such a use case. The team is highly experienced in blockchain development as they have served Fortune 500 companies in their own blockchain development projects. However, as their GitHub is not public, it is hard to validate the actual progress of the project for now. Dusk Network receives a 7/10.

SbS works as follows; We will deploy a smart contract which will vest allocations second by second. What this means in practice is that at any point a token investor wanted to release their tokens, they can make a call on the smart contract and then will have access to the total number of tokens that will have vested at that second.  As an example: after the lockup, tokens will be vested over 31,536,000 seconds (365 days x 24 hours x 60 minutes x 60 seconds). If they did it at exactly 6 months, they would receive half.

In the sensitive case of securities, we are also developing a Confidential Security Token Standard that allows third parties to issue security tokens on top of the Dusk Network (the XST standard). Security tokens implementing the XST will have both privacy (i.e. investment and market positions are not openly broadcasted on the ledger) and Regulatory Compliance data (transfer of these tokens can happen only if purchasers add to the transaction KYC data satisfying regulatory requirements) embedded directly in the transaction protocol.  Dusk decouples the (centralized) KYC/AML vendor process from the (decentralized) security issuance and transaction arbitration with the aid of time-locked accumulators. Cryptographic accumulators are ideal for implementing zero-knowledge white/black listing accreditation of (un-)compliant investors and automated accreditation. Also, expiry mechanism can be added for forcing rechecks. It roughly works in the following way: as soon as the KYC/AML process completes, the transactor identifier (basically his/her registered wallet address, but it can also be something else, i.e. biometric data, etc) is committed to the accumulator, which remains opaque and discloses nothing of its set. A witness (called compliance witness) is thus generated and returned to the applicant. Such witness is the proof of set inclusion. From that point on, all transactions related to that particular asset class (token) must include the compliance witness.  I hope this answers your question",False

In fact the very question about “showing code and progress” is very valid and we see it asked often in the cryptocommunity.

In that regard inspecting the code base is a way to understand the legitimacy of the development efforts and its “progress”. Dusk research paper is exactly the opposite and way more advanced. It goes to a great extent to describe accurately the technology used and the algorithm. You won’t find details of business development or even use cases. This because it is intended as a development manifesto (a proof of concept - similar to what an aforementioned prototype or MPV would prove) of a complete system with all components laid out and specified quite formally.

We have been discussing this point ourselves and there are pros and cons to both options; issue erc20 / delay.  The opportunity presented itself to work with a leading exchange and private sale contributors were vocal that they prefer to get tokens, or an erc20-voucher sooner than later. However, everyone agreed that a longer vesting schedule is preferred to reflect time till mainnet. Therefore we have decied to implement a state-of-the-art 12 month vesting system that we name; Second-by-Second (SbS) vesting.  It works as follows: The smart contract will vest allocations second by second. What this means in practice is that,  at any point a token investor wanted to release their tokens, they can make a call on the smart contract and then will have access to the total number of tokens that will have vested at that second. For example. After the lockup, tokens will be vested over (365 days x 24 hours x 60 minutes x 60 seconds) 31,536,000 seconds. If someone wanted their tokens at the 1,234 second of the 12 month period, and they had purchased 31,536,000 tokens, they would receive 1,234 tokens at that point. If they did it at 6 months, they would receive half. If they did it at 1 day, 10 days, 57 days, and then every 3 weeks; they would receive the relevant whole tokens (rounded down) at each specific second.",False

It will not only ensure a top notch technical system, but also the best talent in Europe working on improving Dusk Network. This research branch will feed directly into the two development teams and create a top-down adoption effect due to its academic and formalized validity.  There are three top notch research partner collaborations explored and/or confirmed and we will announce these as soon as we are able.  Dusk Core Dusk Core is the development team directly led by Dusk’s own technical leads Emanuele Francioni, Fulvio Venturelli and others to be announced. They are responsible for the implementation of all the core aspects of the Dusk Network, such as our unique SBA* consensus mechanism, and our Secure Tunnel Switching methodology. They are complemented by our strategic partner, and award winning blockchain development team, Kryha.  Dawn Public Development A community-driven development group. Dawn will concentrate on the user experience of Dusk Network, different language libraries, standardization, improvement proposals, Dusk wallet implementations, Dusk block explorer, and many more things.

Here's an example of why STO's need privacy; Publicly opening a position in a security, heavily manipulates the price of that security. If Blackrock wishes to open a, say, $10M long position on a tokenized stock, they would raise the price of that asset if they would do it publicly. This is why it is illegal in regulated markets to openly advertise positions and why the buy/sell wall tricks so often seen on token exchanges would lead to indictments on regulated security exchanges. This is also the reasons why financial institutions resort to let brokers open positions on different exchanges on their behalf and most often resort to darkpools to execute their purchases or sales. If you wanna get rid of the broker middlemen and cebtralization, while enjoying the same benefits of darkpools in a decentralized fashion without prohibitive mediator fees you need (regulator friendly) confidentiality.",False

This basically forces issuers to avail of off-chain solutions which is very expensive and defeats the purpose of 1) decentralization 2) common task automation 3) streamline legal process 4) performances (as trading restriction needs to be arbitrated all the time through third party smart contracts, rather than being embedded at protocol level). So, to be able to meet the requirements of STOs, Ethereum needs third party platforms (like Polymath, Harbor, etc etc) which are basically application-level smart contracts, which resort mostly to off-chain processing, with no exception.  This is also because these platforms have absolutely no say at the protocol level and must adapt to what it is available to them. In that respect, they have a very limited control on the confidentiality level (and in fact they resort almost always to suboptimal off-chain solutions - see for example Harbor, Polymath or even Securitize) and are bound to biblical release time for anything that revolves around NFRs (Non Functional Requirements, such as, for instance, scalability, security, resource management, network configurations, SLAs, etc etc) since Ethereum must scale GLOBALLY all the propositions (meaning smart contracts or set of smart contracts).  Dusk is NOT a general purpose smart contract platform. It is extremely focused on the use cases it intends to unlock and as a result it can be very specific in the strategies it adopts to scale and satisfy the NFRs of the use cases at hand.  It basically focuses on providing the right confidentiality in the 3 different scenario that render the platform a true network: 1 - Unidirectional atomic transfer of value (basically, payments) 2 - Bidirectional atomic exchange of value (transfer of asset ownership - securities fall in this category) 3 - Time unbound exchange of value (transmission of data stream - such as audiovisual conferencing, content streaming, etc)  We are gonna rollout sequentially the three layers of the network, which will each unlock one of these 3 parts However we believe that 2 is the most critical as it taps into a market which potential is in the Trillions of Euros Since we are heavily partial for this particular use case, it is very logical that we adjust the protocol to satisfy all the regulations (and not, like in the cases above, adjust the application layer to workaround the protocol limitations)  To give you an example of what we can do on Dusk which would be unthinkable in Ethereum please consider the following feature.  Dusk decouples the (centralized) KYC/AML vendor process from the (decentralized) security issuance and transaction arbitration with the aid of time-locked accumulators. Cryptographic accumulators are ideal for implementing zero-knowledge white/black listing accreditation of (un-)compliant investors and automated accreditation. Also, expiry mechanism can be added for forcing rechecks. It roughly works in the following way: as soon as the KYC/AML process completes, the transactor identifier (basically his registered wallet address, but it can also be something else, i.e. biometric data, etc) is committed to the accumulator, which remains opaque and discloses nothing of its set. A witness (called compliance witness) is thus generated and returned to the applicant. Such witness is the proof of set inclusion. From that point on, all transactions related to that particular asset class (token) must include the compliance witness. Since the info is directly added as payload of our own (improved) version of bulletproof transactions, the need for open data inspection on transaction clearance is therefore removed. The accumulator is stored on-chain (as it basically is just a number) and recheck forcing can happen through a removal operation which activation can be coded trustlessly and can be as simple as a periodic expiry or by encoding more sophisticated rules through a (zk-)smart contract. Dusk will host the accumulators directly ON CHAIN, since it is line with our strategy to handle scenario nr. 2 of the above list  Ethereum would never do such a thing considering that it would not make sense to store a data structure on chain that is specific for a tiny fraction of its applications (i.e. Polymath and Harbor) and would be completely useless for, say, propositions such as Omisego, Kyber, Basic Attention Token, Bancor, Status, Civic, Aragon, etc etc.  This means that the applications would have to battle against the Ethereum protocol (i.e. move an eventual accumulator off-chain to the detriment of decentralization).  This would have nefarious consequences for scalability as well, considering that these proposition must resort to  continuously calling smart contracts in order to arbitrate the transaction operations (to the detriment of both performance and privacy), while Dusk is in the liberty of enriching the transaction directly with zero knowledge data from the transactors (the compliance witness), leaving absolute liberty over which vendor the issuer wants to rely upon and keeping the centralized compliance-related operations (like for instance KYC/AML) separated from the transaction stream.",False

Early experimentation shows that we can achieve extreme throughput by propagating block and block hashes separately (and worry about consistency later, as reconciliation would be indeed a separate matter). In this case it would not be excluded a throughput roughly 10^2 that of Bitcoin.

Currently the most used mechanisms for consensus are either PoW (proof-of-work, mining) and PoS (proof-of-stake, staking).  SBA⋆ uses existing ideas like Cryptographic Sortition(lottery), and combines it with concepts like stealth time-locked transactions to implement simple but secure communication that can be audited. SBA* makes use of a few different types of actors in the network to reach consensus: (super)Nodes. These are points in the network that facilitate transactions. They compete with each other for the generating and proposing blocks. These are computationally very light tasks, and a node will not require high computational power, or a big stake. Provisioners. These are nodes that have committed a certain minimum stake to the Dusk Network and take care of more intensive tasks such as block verification, voting, and notarization (VVN operations). These types of nodes are non-transactional.  By splitting tasks based on intensity and relaying them to transaction and non-transactional nodes the network’s speed greatly increases, whilst decreasing the chance of a partitioned network, and guaranteeing a higher availability of the network. Using SBA* there is no chance of an unintended fork of the blockchain, meaning there will be no doubt about what the main branch is. This translates into the appealing property of achieving transaction “finality” as soon as consensus is reached for a block.",False

Development Time to kickstart the development! September has been an interesting month as the team transitioned from theoretical research to standardizing and programming the core sections of the eventual platform. Our goal is to construct a modular implementation which will enable the developers to plug-and-play experimental features with ease. Golang is the programming language of choice for the reference implementation. The tipping point in favour of Golang has been its native support for concurrency, the bloodline of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks.  We have spent the month working on the basic wallet implementation, designing the transaction structures and building the networking layer. A lot of progress has been made in establishing the core documentation of the features and will help the team concentrate on the actual programming instead of worrying about undocumented features.  The code will be made public in sections after going through a rigorous formal verification and security audit process. The team is aiming to fulfil the original goal of launching the testnet in Q1.    Research While the initial structure and the technical features of the platform had been finalized, our team is on a constant lookout for advancements in the fields of mathematics and computing science which could improve the efficiency and the security of the platform. One of the most exciting domain improvements that have been under our radar for some time are the advancements in cryptography. Specifically, the team has been exploring the possibility of using a Ristretto curve instead of a twisted Edwards birational equivalent of Curve25519 planned to be used in the genesis implementation. The Ristretto curves are related to bulletproofs, which have been the focal point of our research for a prolonged period. Additionally, we are exploring the possibility of using threshold signatures to implement a stealthy and a flexible alternative to multisignature addresses.  Aside from the cryptography, we are examining numerous approach vectors to employing zero-knowledge smart contracts on the platform, which will expand the feature set of the platform dramatically.  Finally, the team has been probing different fee structures and the crypto-economic effects of each of the proposed structures. Our eventual goal is to implement the structure least vulnerable to spam attacks while also retaining the affordable fees.    Community A Discord server has been launched! Everybody is invited to join the discussions on our new medium of communication where the core team members will be present to answer your questions and guide you through the intricate features of the platform.  While there are no plans to involve the public in development until the devnet launch in December, we are working hard to establish Dawn public community after the launch to involve each and every one of you who is interested in helping our platform grow and prosper. More information will be revealed later.  How to learn more about Dusk Network The Dusk Network is a project coordinated by the Dusk Foundation.

Block generation is a computationally light task and therefore running a node does not require neither specialised equipment nor storage. The intention is for normal mobile devices to be able to run as a node within the network. The non-deterministic nature of the bidding process makes it so that even nodes bidding the minimum amount of DUSK have a fair chance to win the block generation sortition lottery  Provisioners - These are nodes that have committed a certain minimum stake to the Dusk Network and take care of more network intensive tasks such as block verification, voting, and notarization (VVN operations).

To help us process hundreds of conversations, we recently announced our fundraising partner The Reserve.  We have received some constructive feedback from our advisors on our current lockup configuration. This configuration could lead to a suboptimal situation in which progressive batches of unlocked tokens potentially lead to unwanted sale pressure. To mitigate this possibility and promote a broader holding horizon, we have decided to remove all bonuses. That way every participant in the private sale will be treated equally, which makes the fundraiser fairer. This also warrants that there will be no inside deals. Confirming our standpoint on this, the exchanges we are in talks with also consider large bonuses as a red flag.  Our commitment to be best-in-class means we will not use bonuses just to “bribe” big names to hop on board. Being fair, transparent, and offering all buyers the same terms is key in today’s blockchain space — and rightly so. This preserves the integrity of the project and ensures that those who purchase DUSK 1) believe in the fundamental value of the project and 2) are with us for the long-haul.  To complement to the points above we, as the Dusk team, truly believe in the project and its long-term vision. To show our commitment, we will extend our lockup period to a 12 month lock up and a 12 month vesting period thereafter.  We have always believed in raising an appropriate amount of capital. We want to be able to optimally build Dusk Network, but also bring a fair proposition to the market. Due to this extreme demand for Dusk and the current configuration with a limited availability of funds, this would lead to a situation in which many value-adding sale participants would be left out while potentially concentrating stakes of Dusk tokens in the hands of few holders, hampering decentralization.  After careful consideration and thorough discussions with our current contributors and advisors, we decided to increase the current hard cap to $14.4M. With this increase we will be able to get more value-adding contributors onboard, have more liquidity, which is more resilient to unforeseen events, and use these additional funds to add more value to the project and its goals. We mean to do this in the following ways:  Hire more of the world’s leading developers, thus speeding up our present timeline and securing our competitive foothold. Further build out our rapidly growing community and increase our capacity to engage with them. Design and implement a robust go-to-market strategy using our increased marketing and PR budget. Expand our roadmap to include zero knowledge smart contracts. Ace the Restricted DevNet launch of Dusk Network at the Next Web on the 14th of December and establish our strong and fair market presence for years to come. Accommodate the overwhelming interest and value-add that prospective partners have been bringing to the table. Conclude agreements with one of the world’s leading exchanges, who we will now be able to accommodate as a private sale contributor and partner as well as secure a free listing. Onboard corporate partnerships that will contribute directly to the utility of DUSK, for example Telcos and financial institutions.  Not only do we believe that raising the cap is the right course of action, but our advisors have also strongly recommended it. Private sale participants that have already contributed capital all voted unanimously in favour of this change. This means that every contributor, individual and entity in the Dusk camp has given full support to this decision.    TL;DR No bonuses. Everyone has the same terms. Team lock-up period increased. Hard cap has been increased to $14.4m for 50% of tokens. The Reserve is managing the entire allocation. Email pledge@dusk.network  We would like to take the opportunity now to thank our existing partners and everyone that has expressed an interest in supporting Dusk. The increase in the hard cap will allow more of you to join us on this journey.  Introducing Dusk Network to the public is an important and exciting step in our journey to create the world’s preferred decentralized protocol for payments, communications and value transfer. We are not here to make a quick buck. We are not here to create hype without valid cause. We are here to do things properly. We are here to lead the market into the new dawn of privacy and compliance, of unstoppable value and asset transfer at negligible cost. We are here to stay.  This is why we have been focusing on building our ground-breaking new tech stack over the past 12 months and have only recently opened up the project to outside contributors. Our goal remains the same: to make Dusk the most utilised and beneficial decentralized protocol in existence.

However, before this series starts it would be useful to spend a few posts on what exactly the driving forces are behind the Dusk Network, and how we envision the Dusk Network coming to life.  The Dusk Foundation To oversee the inception of the Dusk Network the Dusk Foundation has been incorporated. The goal of the foundation is the creation and adoption of Dusk Network, rather than a typical profit maximalism approach. The Dusk Foundation coordinates the two main development arms of Dusk Network; business and technical. The Foundation is used to apply for several types of grants and subsidies to help fund the creation of Dusk. There are several interesting European Funding Calls available to further our regulatory compliant approach to privacy, combined with the potential for information pluralism, retention of cultural heritage, and the general censorship resistance offered by Dusk Network, combined with its commercial validity.  Dusk Foundation ; Technical Development The Technical Development arm of Dusk consists of three elements;  Dusk R&D Dusk Core Dawn Public    Dusk R&D Dusk R&D is a research consortium where the primary goal is to iterate and improve on the Dusk Network white paper, and various research compendia. It will not only ensure a top notch technical system, but also the best talent in Europe working on improving Dusk Network. This research branch will feed directly into the two development teams and create a top-down adoption effect due to its academic and formalized validity.  There are three top notch research partner collaborations explored and/or confirmed and we will announce these as soon as we are able.  Dusk Core Dusk Core is the development team directly led by Dusk’s own technical leads Emanuele Francioni, Fulvio Venturelli and others to be announced. They are responsible for the implementation of all the core aspects of the Dusk Network, such as our unique SBA* consensus mechanism, and our Secure Tunnel Switching methodology. They are complemented by our strategic partner, and award winning blockchain development team, Kryha.  Dawn Public Development A community-driven development group. Dawn will concentrate on the user experience of Dusk Network, different language libraries, standardization, improvement proposals, Dusk wallet implementations, Dusk block explorer, and many more things. We look forward to announcing our Dawn community leads soon. They have extensive experience in blockchain and leading public development communities, and we are glad to have them onboard.  Dusk Foundation ; Business Development The Business Development arm of Dusk currently consists of two elements;  Business Development Team Tokenized Securities Consortium  Business Development Team The Business Development Team is a working group consisting of Dusk core team members strengthened by relevant advisors and partners, that focuses on building relevant groups around the three initial use cases for Dusk Network; payments, digital asset transfer, and p2p communication. For each use case we have onboarded a specific set of advisors that are highly relevant for the use case.  These advisors are uniquely positioned to attract the businesses required to adopt Dusk Network. Because Dusk is uniquely suited to interoperate with other systems, there is much less pain with adoption than with the older blockchains, secondly, the privacy aspect makes it a much more likely candidate for adoption because many businesses have hard privacy requirements for anything beyond a menial process.  The Business Development Team is likely to spin out relevant sub-teams and potentially business consortia to work on specific implementations and endorsements of the Dusk Network. The first of such consortia is the Tokenized Securities Consortium.  Tokenized Securities Consortium Our first consortium has a laser focus on the most prominent use case Dusk Network aims to solve in the short to medium term; the tokenization of securities, and offering and trading them. The consortium focuses on SME’s, consumers, and platforms, rather than multinationals. Security tokens, tokenized securities, and/or other digital assets are quickly becoming the next big thing in the space, and rightly so. Tokenizing and decentralizing shares in a company, building in governance, a dividend mechanism, and other basics are already hugely interesting to companies. Especially if their new offering mechanisms, for example a Security Token Offering, provide much less legal drag than an IPO counterpart, therefore significantly lowering the barrier of entry for SME’s.  However, to complement IPO’s you need to look at their legislation for a likely ecosystem that needs to be mirrored in order to be compliant. This means privacy on the one hand, because there is trade secrecy, market manipulation, and a few other things to be considered in order for traders to adopt and a fair market to establish. On the other hand, there is a level of regulatory transparency required so things can be audited and a marketplace can be built, this means kyc integration on the token level to allow for a truly decentralized marketplace. Imagine your wallet to have passed certain KYC, where nobody knows it’s you, what your holdings or history are, but you are allowed to deal in all types of securities or other digital assets (deed of a house, etc) because your wallet is whitelisted. For example it proves you as being over 18 and KYC compliant to a certain standard. We are developing the XST (anonymous security token) standard that companies can use to launch security token offerings.  We will not only be leveraging our KYC and Security Experts to build a great standard (XST), but we will also leverage our consortium partners to set up the beginnings of what could become an STO incubator, where we will help the first centralized companies to decentralize just this part of their company. They will create their security tokens on top of Dusk, thus digitizing their shares, and in the future some of their governance and dividend structures. Not only does this create a new market for adoption, i.e. centralized SME’s, it also creates a marketplace much riper for adoption, since people tend to move to where they can make money. Investing in a healthy SME in a way that is familiar to the cryptocurrency crowd should be a strong match.  In Sum Dusk Foundation leads two development arms; technical and business. Technical will leverage two development communities (Core, Dawn) and strengthen them with top notch research (R&D Consortium). Business is led by a team of core team & advisors who will create working groups / consortia on the use case level (securities). Everything will be done according to the roadmap, and use cases will prioritize the most interesting markets. We will be revealing the members of all of the abovementioned units over the coming weeks and months, and slowly unveil more of Dusk Foundation’s strategy to successfully build Dusk Network and have it adopted.  How to learn more about Dusk Network The Dusk Network is a project coordinated by the Dusk Foundation. We are a decentralized ecosystem entirely focused on providing the perfect trade-off between privacy and transparency. Dusk protects privacy and fits regulations in payments, communications and asset transfers.

But it's important to understand that it comes from the fact that nowadays blockchain whitepapers are nothing more than a business plan full of technical claims that are not substantiated by a carefully laid out analysis or by formal descriptions of the envisioned algorithms. In that regard inspecting the code base is a way to understand the legitimacy of the development efforts and its “progress”. Dusk research paper is exactly the opposite and way more advanced. It goes to a great extent to describe accurately the technology used and the algorithm. You won’t find details of business development or even use cases. This because it is intended as a development manifesto (a proof of concept - similar to what an aforementioned prototype or MPV would prove) of a complete system with all components laid out and specified quite formally. In that sense, by inspecting code you would learn nothing more than what is already laid out quite accurately in the research.",False

In democratic societies, privacy is very well accepted and even enforced at legislative levels by policy makers. An example is the GDPR. Another is the SEC enforcing secrecy to trading bodies in the stock market to prevent price manipulation. The Dusk Network provides the same level of privacy enforced by regulators. Only, it eliminates the “trusted third party” and returns the power of disclosure directly to the user.  For instance, in the case of payment, it is the responsibility of the wallet holder to show the details of the transactions on request of the auditors (by providing a view-key). In the use case of security, compliant confidentiality is achieved with KYC built in the protocol and the use of zero knowledge accumulators to keep the whitelist confidential.",False

We are very excited to announce our new fundraising partner, The Reserve, and with it their CEO, James Roy Poulter, as our latest addition to a great advisory board.  The Reserve is a token issuance advisory firm, offering complete support through the entire process of raising contributions, whilst spreading knowledge, ethics and governance in the sector. Over the last few weeks the demand for DUSK has exploded and it was necessary to onboard a strong partner that matched our values. The Reserve is professional, ethical and best-in-class, and we are confident that they are the right partner for us. We have therefore given them authority to handle them fundraise and the remaining allocation. Their CEO James will lead this process, as well as function as an advisor on the compliance side.  The Reserve The Reserve has a strong mission to help companies, and the humans they consist of, raise their required funds and achieve their goals. The Reserve has strong roots in consultancy, banking, accounting, law and compliance, but uses these skills as a knowledge base, instead of simply walking predefined paths. Their commitment to giving back speaks for itself:  ● 51% of the company is pledged to charity. This is a legally binding pledge that cannot be reversed, and is run by Founders Pledge.  ● We endeavor to spend at least 1% of time on charitable initiatives. We’d do more, but we feel the best way we can make an impact on the world is through our work at The Reserve.  ● We do not work with projects unless they clearly are positively impacting the world. This is a subjective, but serious commitment for us.  James Roy Poulter James started his career in finance at EY, going on to become their international tax advisor, a position he held for over three years. Later, he joined Playfair Capital, an early stage venture capital firm, as Developer in Residence, during which time he was recognised in the 35 Chartered Accountants under 35 and the prestigious Forbes 30 Under 30. After more than 10 years in a career covering finance, law, accountancy and technology, James is well placed to help drive innovation in early stage fundraising and capital allocation.    We are committed to bringing together the best minds from various fields and from different parts of the world to advise us on our journey of creating a world-class platform. We are proud to have James joining us and want to welcome him to the team.  We look forward to a fruitful and professional partnership with both James Roy Poulter and The Reserve.

That comes from the fact that nowadays blockchain whitepapers are nothing more than a business plan full of technical claims that are not substantiated by a carefully laid out analysis or by formal descriptions of the envisioned algorithms. In that regard inspecting the code base, or MPV, is a way to understand the legitimacy of the development efforts and its “progress”. Dusk research paper is exactly the opposite and way more advanced. It goes to a great extent to describe accurately the technology used and the algorithm. You won’t find details of business development or even use cases. This because it is intended as a development manifesto (a proof of concept - similar to what an aforementioned prototype or MPV would prove) of a complete system with all components laid out and specified quite formally. In that sense, by inspecting code you would learn nothing more than what is already laid out quite accurately in the research.",False

The non-deterministic nature of the bidding process makes it so that even nodes bidding the minimum amount of DUSK have a fair chance to win the block generation sortition lottery.  Provisioners - These are nodes that have committed a certain minimum stake to the Dusk Network and take care of more network intensive tasks such as block verification, voting, and notarization (VVN operations).

Stealth addresses, Ring CT layer technology, Algorand and even Cryptonote are all used for inspiration. These technologies are all tested and used.  However, dismissing the technological breakthrough of SBA* (Dusk's consensus algorithm) as a simple combination of Algorand with Cryptonote (stealth addresses, Ring CT, etc), is the equivalent of dismissing Bitcoin because it combines Hashcash with digital timestamping services .  SBA* provides several novelties that are not in Algorand and certainly not in Cryptonote. The latter uses proof-of-work that 1) sooner or later will face severe restriction by states because of excessive consumption of energy 2) requires specialized equipment and 3) promotes pool centralization. Algorand on the other hand is completely open, oriented to permissioned networks and does not even foresees reward incentives. Simply combining the 2 technologies also is not possible since they are incompatible (Algorand works only if the stake of any single node is completely open which goes completely against the philosophy of Cryptonote). SBA* is INSPIRED by these technologies and we mainly refer to them to explain how parts of the system work and how some of the technology is taken from the field and is thus tested, it however evolves toward completely different directions and presents novelties that IMHO qualify SBA* as a breakthrough: 1 - Blind bidding solves staking with anonymity 2 - The segregation of operations makes it possible to create the first ever economy being centralized pool averse 3 - It solves elegantly also the nothing-at-stake problem through its voting system",False

When he was 17 years old, Richard joined the US Army where he served as a forward observer at the 10th Mountain Division for four years. During his work in the Army he pushed himself into a Spartan lifestyle, making the most out of each day with a main focus on self-development. This allowed him to nearly finish his undergraduate degree at the end of his fourth year military discharge. Later he finished his Bachelor’s Degree in Homeland Security at the American Military University. Richard holds a Harvard Business School CORe certification.  His volunteer work at an animal shelter made him realize the importance of giving back to the community and he has since been an avid philanthropist. He has raised over 100,000 USD for various non-profit organizations on a yearly basis for seven years consecutively.  Richard is an active member in the blockchain investigative community. In 2018 Richard co-founded Blockchain Investigation Agency CipherBlade where he is the Chief Security Officer (CSO). CipherBlade focuses on helping new aspiring blockchain projects to stay safe in this highly dynamic industry that unfortunately attracts some ill-intended malicious actors.  Richard already participated in the investigation of various high-profile blockchain industry related hacks like the EtherDelta hack late last year and a more recent hack, involving blockchain and cryptocurrency investor Ian Balina, where he is the lead investigator. Leveraging his connections within government and law enforcement, Rich’s efforts have led to arrest, prosecution, and asset recovery for several cases; an impressive accomplishment on a brief timeline.  As a decentralized ecosystem focused on privacy and transparency in payments, communication and asset ownership transfer Dusk Network values safety very highly. Richard will be a great asset to Dusk as he is a professional in the cybersecurity, intelligence and government space and we believe we can greatly benefit from his expertise.  We at Dusk Network are very excited to have Richard on board as an advisor!  How to learn more about Dusk Network The Dusk Network is a project coordinated by the Dusk Foundation.

They compete with each other by locking an arbitrary amount for the generating and proposing of new blocks. Block generation is a computationally light task and therefore running a node does not require neither specialised equipment nor storage. The intention is for normal mobile devices to be able to run as a node within the network. The non-deterministic nature of the bidding process makes it so that even nodes bidding the minimum amount of DUSK have a fair chance to win the block generation sortition lottery  Provisioners - These are nodes that have committed a certain minimum stake to the Dusk Network and take care of more network intensive tasks such as block verification, voting, and notarization (VVN operations). These types of nodes are non-transactional The intention is to create an economy where nodes compete for block rewards, while Provisioners earn a steady ROI.  The rewards paid to Provisioners are inversely proportional to their staked amount (i.e. bigger stakes get proportionally rewarded lesser, in respect to smaller stakes) and are earned regardless of Provisioners' participation in the VVN operations . This measure is not a viable option outside of the Dusk Blockchain, where the probability to win the sortition lottery and therefore take an active part to the SBA⋆ algorithm is not associated with a reward, except the sole payment of the transaction fees. This kind of economy not only prevents the rich get richer problem affecting Proof-of-stake, but it also incentivises users to decentralise their stakes into multiple Provisioners in order to obtain maximum financial gain. This latter point would lead to scalability problems in other consensus algorithms, while it does not have any significant impact on SBA⋆ due to its ""Player Replaceability"" property",False

Gary Quin is a 25-year veteran of the telecommunications and media space with knowledge of the European, the Middle Eastern, African and even Latin American market. Gary’s expertise is in the building, financing, and acquisition of profitable businesses that operate in the sector, and draws heavily from his four years spent at Conolly Corporate Finance as a Managing Director in Ireland and his time with MNO Digicel in the Caribbean. At CCF Gary oversaw the provision of financial advisory services to telecommunications and media clients for mergers and acquisitions, private equity leveraged buyouts and so on.  After leaving CCF in 2005, Gary joined Blackrock Communications as CEO. In keeping with the theme of Gary’s career, Blackrock is a consulting firm that focuses on private equity and debt financing mostly in the telecoms and media space.  In 2010 Credit Suisse EMEA called on Gary to become a Senior Advisor and lead their investment banking and capital markets division in Ireland. Since signing on Gary has led Credit Suisse to Euromoney’s 2011 award for Best Investment Bank in Ireland and has raised over €12bn for Irish corporates since 2013 including 5 IPOs and the largest REIT IPO in EMEA since 2010 and largest Irish IPO since 2007. He continues to serve in this capacity at present.  Gary received his MBA from Trinity College Dublin, Ireland and his BA (Honours) from University College Cork, Ireland. He has also studied at the Harvard Business School, IESE and the University of Oxford. His thesis was on the development of the European High Yield and Leveraged Finance market.  The Dusk Foundation benefits significantly from his senior management experience in both telecommunications and investment banking. Gary also comes to the project with plenty of experience sitting on corporate boards as a non-executive director. This gives us the added advantage of having guided foresight, independent and impartial critique, access to third-party consultants, and strategic direction for the commercial attractiveness of the project as a whole.

The Dusk Network is a decentralized infrastructure focused on providing the sweet-spot between privacy and transparency in payments, communication and asset ownership transfers. It departs from consensus mechanisms like PoW/PoS, which are poorly suited for privacy, to introduce a new privacy-oriented consensus mechanism called Segregated Byzantine Agreement. Dusk is a new blockchain that provides true privacy and a fast and a secure streaming mechanism called Secure Tunnel Switching (STS), all powered by a privacy-oriented cryptocurrency: DUSK.  In this introductory series we aim to take a look at specific aspects of the Dusk Network and explain them in a nutshell. In this article we will look at Dusk’s Secure Tunnel Switching (STS) mechanism, a circuit switching technique allowing for safe p2p transfer.  For a detailed description of Dusk’s STS please refer to the whitepaper.  What is Secure Tunnel Switching? As explained in our previous article Dusk Network uses an advanced version of Garlic Routing. The obfuscation of someone’s identity and IP address becomes highly relevant when we are not simply transacting, but also communicating. The Anonymous Network Layer can be viewed as an entry point to the Dusk Network, after which a user could decide to communicate directly with a peer, thus progressing to the Secure Tunnel Switching layer for a voice or video call. Put simply, Secure Tunnel Switching is a circuit switching technique inspired by the payphone, allowing decentralized pay-as-you-go, as well as increased security. You can use STS for all types of high data rate communications, such as streaming (unidirectional) or voice/video calls (bidirectional).  Before we delve deeper into how tunnel switching improves privacy, one practical implication that immediately comes to mind is: ‘how are transaction costs regulated? Because if the value of the Dusk token can fluctuate, how do I know how much I am going to spend on a certain real-time audio, video or data transfer?’. In order to answer this question, let’s use the following example: node A (Alice) wants to establish a secure data stream with node B (Bob), for which it knows the relevant Dusk address. Before establishing any connection attempt, Alice will commit a payment using an off-chain transaction towards a so-called State Channel Access Point (SCAP), for a dynamic value that will be auto-regulated by the Dusk core. This is done to keep the transmission cost stable, and also independent from token fluctuations.  How does it work? When two parties, Alice and Bob, want to communicate directly they can use STS to do so. Alice commits a payment to a SCAP, hereby freezing her status on the blockchain until communication closes. A communication circuit is then opened towards Bob, through a various number of gateway nodes that can support the required data stream. Bob starts to receive said data stream and Alice and Bob are now communicating. Assuming Alice wants to continue communication for a reasonable amount of time, say longer than a minute, she will be opening a new circuit (tunnel) towards Bob in parallel to the first one. Bob will receive both data streams simultaneously and uses a technique called bitmatching, simply put Bob will correlate both streams until they are perfectly synchronized. When this happens then Bob will drop the old stream, and continue communication purely through the new one. This process repeats itself as Alice and Bob continue communications. This procedure will repeat for as long as Alice renews the transactions costs with the SCAS to keep streaming data.    Whilst this process brings along some time lag in the VoIP call (solved by bitmatching) it dramatically improves security and anonymity over a conventional Garlic Tunnel connection. By switching the data tunnel at regular intervals, a malicious attacker would be unable to predict compromised nodes, perform DDoS attacks, and in general exploit vulnerabilities on the network. Assuming an interval of 1 minute per tunnel a malicious node would never hold more than a minute of highly encrypted information sent between peers that he does not know and has no way of identifying.  Additionally, Dusk Network will offer the capability to transfer files, both online and offline, over its network in an decentralized, anonymous and secure fashion. To implement this on the network, Dusk combines the capabilities of the anonymous peer discovery and gossip mechanism previously described with those of a third party decentralized and anonymous storage service (for example the Orc Object Storage). In case the receiving user is offline, the file will remain, for example, downloadable for 30 days after the day of sending the file.  Payphone analogy As alluded to earlier the Secure Tunnel Switching mechanism is highly inspired by the traditional payphone. Alice performs a state channel payment in a similar fashion as you would enter a token or coin into a payphone to open a connection. The payphone also uses circuiting to connect you to the correct recipient, and as soon as your connection has been made your timer starts running down. If you wanted to continue talking, you would simply enter another coin or token and you could keep calling using the payphone. STS is very similar, except that rather than a single payphone you could imagine an endless corridor filled with payphones, and every time your minute almost runs out you put your next coin into a different payphone, that uses a different circuit, to reach a different payphone on the receiving side.    Conclusion Dusk Network uses STS as a mechanism to allow for high data rate, secure transmission and communication between peers, using state channels, and a cryptographically secure pay as you go mechanism.

TNO stands for Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research and is the most prominent applied research thinktank in the Netherlands. We will share more on this story later!  - We are shaping the public development effort for Dusk Network. This means interviewing developers who will join the public developer group and carving out the processes to make it a succes.  - We have been interviewed by various newsoutlets. Below is a small excerpt of a question we are most exciting about covered by Base.info Read the full article here! Q: Describe your project in 3 years? Will it change something in the world? A: Tokenization of security is the first step toward the automation of organization governance. This is in par with the vision surrounding the so called Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. Tokenizing equity leads to automating cashflow stream, which in turns leads to autonomous governance, and finally business automation and autonomous organization  Security tokens are a necessary initial step and we want to contribute by adding the missing attribute of confidentiality in order to ignite an ecosystem which will hopefully evolve toward the implementation of autonomous decentralized companies. We want to achieve that by letting such organizations avail of an efficient and secure communication infrastructure together with access to many different blockchains in the spirit of interoperation.

The paper presented the first use case for the technology — a digital currency.  Since then many developers have thought up other use cases and have pitched for funding to bring their ideas to fruition. According to an article published in April, cryptocurrency startups have raised over USD 6 Billion in 2018 alone by selling their crypto coins to early backers; similar to how shares of a company get sold to investors. These are called Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).  However, a report produced by Fabric Ventures in collaboration with Token Data reviewed 2017 statistics and found that only 48% of ICO funded crypto startups were successful. Compound this with the scarcity of projects bringing in-demand, functional value, and the marketplace’s exposure to fraudulent ICO campaigns on a regular basis. Your average business owner will no doubt take a ‘wait and see’ approach before putting their business functions or applications onto a blockchain.  At present, the majority of enterprise blockchain solutions are for the financial technology sector. It is understandably so because the cryptocurrency market acts as proof of concept. In implementing the solution, the industry tends to opt for ‘private’ (permissioned) blockchains, where they run their blockchain in a sort of private Intranet and restrict connectivity to outside networks. That’s fine for now, but if we want to exploit the full benefits of this technology, then we must accept that private (permissioned) blockchains are a suboptimal solution.  For mass adoption to take place, there are specific assurances that the user must have. Perhaps the most important of them all is the assurance that their data is fungible.  Fungibility Matters Fungibility is a legacy of the trade practices of the Roman Empire. We can trace it back to the Latin verb ‘fungere’ which means ‘to perform’. It is the idea that when trading perishable goods we must assure that one portion of its weight is of equal value to any other portion if they are of the same weight. So one bale of wheat performs the same function as any other bale of wheat when traded in the same marketplace.  When we began to use paper currency, this idea was carried over. If a buyer had a 50 Euro note that was either lost or destroyed, it was in the best interest of the marketplace to allow the buyer to replace it with an equivalent 50 Euro note. Regardless of the source. So the idea of fungibility exists because it promotes ease and efficiency of trade. It is a requirement for basic addition, and interchangeability of said good or currency.    Fungibility in Blockchain Networks Since the first use case for the blockchain was a digital currency Satoshi Nakamoto carried over the idea of fungibility to promote ease and efficiency of information exchange; just like in the marketplace.  However, in the case of Bitcoin true fungibility has not been achieved, and many subsequent tokens or cryptocurrencies are not fungible. Although it is true that 1 BTC + 1 BTC = 2 BTC, we are starting to see this potentially changing in the future. Due to the complete open and transparent nature of the bitcoin blockchain there is a full record of all transaction ever done. Some of these might have been done with malicious intent or for fraudulent activities. Because of the nature of the blockchain we know exactly which bitcoins were used for ‘bad things’. Now a company might not want to associate itself with these types of activities and therefore only want ‘clean’ bitcoins. This means that one bitcoin suddenly isn’t the same anymore as another bitcoin, and could lead to a premium being paid for a clean bitcoin, as opposed to one with a negative history, regardless of them being technically identical. There are some counter movements such as ‘Washing’ or ‘Mixing’ bitcoin that effectively try to reduce your exposure to ‘bad’ bitcoins but it is easy to see how this aspect of the bitcoin blockchain might prove troublesome in the future.  With the assurance of real fungibility the widespread adoption of blockchain technology is more likely, not just in the financial tech space. If it is possible for the origin of a crypto coin to be invisible from the rest of the network, then the same is possible for other forms of data as well. The knowledge that data is protected, at the deepest possible encryption levels, will give individual users, businesses and institutions the confidence to use applications built on top of it.  It Matters to the Dusk Foundation The Dusk Foundation is created to advance the research and development of the unrestricted, un-surveilled and fully distributed blockchain-based cryptosystem called Dusk Network.  The Foundation believes in promoting an ecosystem of bi-directional peer-to-peer data transmission networks that are private, immutable, scalable and decentralized. This belief is why the Dusk Network is designed to offer these features to businesses and developers who have applications that require high bandwidth and low latency while remaining secure and private.  The network protocol is optimized for speed — completion times to show proofs or achieve consensus have been reduced, and data packets are bundled to use bandwidth efficiently. The network is built to scale — the Dusk team have developed a Segregated Byzantine Consensus algorithm that guides the growth of the blockchain while maintaining its integrity.  The Scope is laser focused, but the possibilities are endless At the Dusk Foundation we focus on one thing; privacy, in all its flavors. Of course there are many relevant technical aspects to the network to empower this, such as the all important fungibility. However providing various degrees of privacy, whether for a file streaming service, financial transaction, security token, or video game interaction.  We encourage everyone who believes in personal freedom, economic liberty, information pluralism, and the right to privacy, to follow the development of the project at our Telegram channel.

Introduction 2017 seemed like the dream year for startups and entrepreneurs. With funding becoming ever more difficult, startups seemed to have found the answer to the funding conundrum in Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).  In 2017, ICOs raised around $3.88 billion over a total of 210 different ICOs.  The amount raised reached up to $258 million raised by a single ICO is 2017.  This huge amount of money raised allowed for startups to find their way to life. In 2018, the floodgates were truly opened as the year showed a significant jump in the amount of money raised.  As of July 2018, ICOs raised a total of more than $12 billion with 5 months left to go. That is more than a 200% percent increase in about half the time.  A total of 546 ICOs have been run so far with the largest ICO raising $1.7 billion.  The Growth of Ethereum and The Need for Regulations The increased number of ICOs resulted in a huge demand for Ethereum which ended up being the main platform to fund ICOs. Being a relatively stable network combined with the relative ease of deploying Ethereum smart contracts helped crown Ethereum as the main platform to launch ICOs and fund upcoming promising projects. ERC20 tokens were issued by projects and sold over Ethereum smart contracts in return for funding the startups. This naturally increased the demand for Ethereum as more investors looked to invest into ICOs in hopes for high returns on investment. Eventually, the price of Ether rose from around 31 cents during its crowdsale to an all-time high price of more than $1400. At the time of writing this article, Ethereum is floating in the range of $300 which is still around 1000x the initial price of Ether. Clearly, the ICO use case of Ether drove high adoption rates and high demand.  With the increased attention ICOs seem to be getting, regulatory requirements are getting more real every day. Considering that most the tokens that are being sold claim to be utility tokens, the chances for exit scams or failed investments increase significantly. Despite the jump in funding between 2017 and 2018, ICOs are becoming harder to participate in. Most of today’s ICOs are struggling to stay within the regulatory requirements and are trying to be safe by limiting the public access to ICOs and making the ICOs available to private accredited investors only. However, that seems to be a temporary solution to the problem as the regulations get tighter. Eventually, chances are that ICOs will inevitably make room for a more regulated landscape. With adoption comes regulations and such regulations may be satisfied with Security Token Offering (STOs).  Security Tokens vs Utility Tokens Most of today’s ICOs claim to be giving Utility Tokens to their investors. Those tokens hold practically no value but they are more like future vouchers to use the company’s services once they are in live, assuming that the company does deliver a working project. This means that if the company fails or a product is never launched, the tokens that the investor bought hold ZERO value to the investor. This also means that the value of the token (or the voucher) that investors get will depend on the adoption of the project’s services. With such huge risks for investors, Security Tokens will come into play. Unlike Utility tokens, Security Tokens can be backed by company assets such as shares or voting power or any other right to a real asset.This clearly provides a much more solid and safe investment for the investor who believes in the company’s future.  The Need for Regulations With that in mind, STOs now seem to be the answer to the problems raised by ICOs. They will provide safer investments for investors and reduce the chance of scams or manipulated projects. However, STOs will need some sort of regulation to run properly and not run into legal issues. As of now, we can more or less assume that such regulation would be similar to those assigned to Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). This is a more or less safe assumption until the actual ICO/STO regulations are announced and put into action. If that is the case, then the ERC20 tokens currently used for ICOs cannot satisfy those regulations in their present state.    For instance, trade secrecy and privacy of the ecosystem will be essential for STOs in order to prevent illegal activities such as market manipulation and insider trading. That is one of the major problems with having funding processes happen the way they do today over public chains. For example, if company X who happens to be a hugely successful investment fund moves $5 million into an STO on a public chain, the resulting buying and investing hype would be unheard of. In a regulated market, that is illegal and with regulations reaching the crypto space, one can assume that the future will hold similar regulations for cryptocurrencies. Not only is market manipulation illegal, it generally deters institutional investors such as Company X from investing in such projects as their total investment will be easily visible to the public eye over the public chains. The same works vice versa when a firm wants to close or diminish a position, currently often using what’s called a Dark Pool.  Dusk Network This is where Dusk Network comes in. Dusk Network is a complete ecosystem that provides privacy measures that are practically impossible to breach. A key part of the Dusk ecosystem will revolve around compliant digital asset transfer. Not only will it provide the privacy required for the market, but it will also provide the auditability required by regulators. KYC requirements can be built directly into the token, thus satisfying a wide array of use cases.  Dusk Network is aiming to be the platform to run STOs the way Ethereum is for ICOs. The nature of the platform with the aim at true privacy will make it uniquely suited for hosting STOs. In other words, the platform has the potential to innately satisfy all the likely requirements and regulations that will be assigned to future STOs. The privacy provided over Dusk Network will prevent any sort of market manipulation or insider trading since all the actions that are taken by investors are hidden from the rest of the world. The encryptions provided are the solution for the future of crowdfunding methods that allow startups to continue funding their upcoming projects while also abiding by all the governmental regulations. This will ensure the security for both the investors as well as the STOs in question.    To summarize the solutions Dusk Network provides for the future of STOs: A Platform to run STOs fully. Dusk Network will be the home for XST (Anonymous Security Tokens) tokens the way Ethereum is for ERC20 tokens Dusk Network will provide complete on-chain privacy for the investors and hence completely abide by the anticipated regulations for funding future projects, whilst also satisfying regulators. The privacy provided by Dusk Network will be the catalyst needed to attract institutional investors for future STOs as investors can’t legally have their investments made public  Conclusion  Dusk Network is laser focused on delivering three key use cases: payments, digital asset transfer, and p2p communication. It will provide an ecosystem that allows for the best tradeoff between privacy and transparency. The market shifting towards the Security Token space will be a great fit with an innately suitable architecture like the Dusk Network.

However, before cryptocurrencies were a thing, ‘crypto’ used to mean ‘cryptography’ — the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of, potentially malicious, third parties[1]. Cryptography in this sense has existed since mankind sought a way to communicate between allies without a potential third party being able to decipher what was being communicated.  Up until the invention of the internet, this was the main use case of cryptography. However, since the early days of the internet, people have started thinking of ways to decentralize ‘money’ and how to create a financial system which is beyond control of governments or central banks. But in order to convince the masses that such a radical system could be trusted and that it was in fact secure, this needed to be proved first. Thus, a cryptographic solution was sought. Because even though what would be communicated would not be a message in the strictest definition of the word, the communication, or transfer of value in this case, needs to be as secure as possible.  Multiple different ‘solutions’ were proposed: such as hashcash, which was developed by Adam Back; b-money, which was developed by Wei Dai; and Bit Gold, developed by Nick Szabo. These proposals had one or two things in common; they were based around a proof-of-work consensus mechanism and they had a limited supply. Especially the latter part was deemed to be important in order to gain widespread trust, and potentially adoption. Because how many people would trust a radical financial system invented by a random person, who, at any point in time, could inflate this monetary system to infinity? Many iterations were created, but it wasn’t until Satoshi Nakamoto came along that this idea started to grow some legs.  On the 31st of October, 2008, a link to a paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” was posted to a cryptography mailing list. This (white)paper discussed and proposed how to create a peer-to-peer network and generate a trust-less electronic cash system. On the 3rd of January, 2009, the Bitcoin network came into existence with Satoshi Nakamoto mining the so-called genesis block of the Bitcoin blockchain. [Contrary to what many people think, Satoshi Nakamoto did not coin the term ‘blockchain’ to refer to this system; Satoshi Nakamoto referred to this system as a ‘proof-of-work chain’, as it was secured by a proof-of-work consensus mechanism.] Satoshi Nakamoto realized early on that a central point of authority (or failure in this case) would hinder the progress and adoption of such a radical new system. This is why Satoshi Nakamoto left the Bitcoin [project] in 2011, and the name ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ itself is just a pseudonym.  So whilst Satoshi Nakamoto is shrouded in mystery, blockchain technology is not. On the contrary, a blockchain is “an [immutable] digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value”[2]. These transactions are put into ‘blocks’, where new blocks are linked to previous blocks thereby forming what we call a ‘block-chain’. Transactions that take place on the Bitcoin blockchain are fully transparent and can be viewed by anyone who wish to do so.    Challenges & Advancements in Cryptography Blockchains ‘solve’ the cryptographic ‘problem’ of communication without possible third-party intervention and removes the need for intermediaries. Set up in a decentralized fashion, a blockchain allows you to: buy and sell without a bank, bet without a bookie, get a loan without an underwriter, create an identity without a government and verify records without a notary.  It is important to make a distinction here between centralized and decentralized blockchains. Blockchains, especially private (and often centralized) blockchains, continue to gain significant interest from corporations across the world. However, despite this growing interest in private blockchains, we are not convinced that these are all that they are promised to be. A centralized (private) blockchain is often just a slow, impractical, inefficient database. In our opinion true innovation lies with blockchains which are not only decentralized (like the Bitcoin blockchain) but also open-source, permission-less, trust-less, and featuring a fungible currency.  However, whilst blockchains are extremely secure, there is another challenge that comes with it: transparency, which is both a blessing and a curse. Blockchains, like the Bitcoin blockchain for example, are fully transparent where anyone can see all the details of the transactions which are being made. Sending addresses, receiving addresses and amounts are all publicly available. Which is why in the past some Bitcoin have been blacklisted due to their less than dubious origins in the eyes of authorities. This is also a reason why freshly minted Bitcoin, with little transaction history, have a higher asking price on the black market compared to ‘regular’ Bitcoin. In our eyes this is a deficiency, as it proves that Bitcoins themselves are not fungible, i.e. they are not interchangeable between one another, the way (fiat) cash is.  In order to mitigate this challenge, the Dusk blockchain will make use of various anonymity and privacy features in order to provide a private, yet fully auditable, blockchain. We believe that transparency and privacy are a trade-off, and that there should be flexibility. With the Dusk Network we aim to provide the best trade-off between transparency and privacy.  Dusk Network will make use of a whole stack of different technologies and mechanisms to boost privacy on both the application and networking layer. For a full, technical, explanation of these various mechanisms we invite you to consult our whitepaper.  Stealth addresses Inspired by the CryptoNote white paper, stealth addresses are the basis of Dusk recipient hiding technique. It is the proven choice for concealing the true recipient address of a transaction while keeping uniqueness within the context of the ledger. This means that no other address can be linked to a stealth address. Additionally, the creation of an unbound number of receiving addresses is also possible without any of them allowing traceability back to the recipient’s address. Effectively, stealth addresses are as secure as using a creating a different wallet for every single receiving transactions so that it becomes impossible to link the transactions to each other.  Ring Signature Confidential Transactions (RingCTs) and Bulletproof Transactions Ring Signatures are an efficient, established way to obfuscate the input of a transaction by making use of a sender’s account keys and a number of decoy keys (called outputs) taken directly from the blockchain. The procedure allows one of the members of the ring to sign messages on behalf of the whole group, and by doing so it renders it infeasible to know exactly which member signed.  Blockchains such as Monero (XMR) use a particular breed of ring signatures called Ring Signatures Confidential Transactions (RingCT). In this setup, privacy is taken one step further by not only giving anonymity at the sender level, but also on the amount spent and destination. RingCT technology makes transactions thus virtually unlinkable to the original sender.  However, in the future, Dusk aims to move away to RingCTs to Bulletproof Transactions once this technology is fully ready to be used. At the time of writing, first tests show a tenfold reduction in transaction size and verification times compared to RingCTs. Given the “pluggable” nature of Dusk core, the underlying software for transaction generation will be kept flexible through an architecture that facilitates the adoption of a future implementation of Bulletproof Transactions.  Cryptographic accumulator Finally, a cryptographic accumulator will be used. A cryptographic accumulator is a cryptographic construction that allows for efficient insertions and proofs of membership, without revealing the identity of the sender[3]. An accumulator takes a set of values and turns them into a single number of constant size[4]. Different technologies exist that implement accumulators with different level of computational efficiency and security requirements. In order to guarantee the anonymity of the transactions passing through the accumulator, Dusk is evaluating various technologies, such as: RSA accumulators, Expressive Bilinear Accumulators, and Elliptic Curve Multiset Hash (ECMH). ECMH is looking as an appealing alternative to the other known algorithms to construct Accumulators, especially since the method is unencumbered with the necessity of a trusted setup.  Conclusion Dusk Features untraceability through the use of RingCT, unlikability through the use of stealth addresses and protection from double spending or blockchain forks through the novel consensus mechanism called SBA. It takes the latest lessons learned in cryptography and prepares for the future through an adaptable core ready for bulletproof transactions.

The Chairman, Emanuele Francioni will be discussing the Dusk project with us in this interview.    1 ) Please tell us your name and about yourself? My name is Emanuele Francioni, and I am an engineer with 20 years of experience in software development as a manager and lead architect. I have delivered multi-million dollar technology projects for top corporate organizations, such as TomTom, Commerzbank and Vitrociset. I am also a successful entrepreneur with a proven capital raising track-record and several patents published in the realm of distributed sensor networks, connected vehicles and blockchain technology. Currently, I lead an international, multidisciplinary team within the Dusk Foundation with a view to research and develop the Dusk Network.  2 ) What is Dusk Network? The Dusk Network is a decentralized infrastructure focused on providing the sweet-spot between privacy and transparency in payment, communication and asset ownership transfers.  We believe that granting the appropriate confidentiality can encourage the adoption of decentralized systems over centralized ones. Taking the financial market as an example, leakage of market positions and trade history offers unfair advantages to competitors. That’s why trading firms are going to operate on decentralized markets if and only if their privacy is protected. At the same time, regulators will reject platforms with unsatisfactory auditing and KYC procedures. Dusk Network was conceived to solve this and other use case scenarios where privacy is an important enabler for the advancement of a truly decentralized economy. Other notable examples are the issuance of confidential security tokens, compliant with regulatory frameworks or the provision of channels for secure audiovisual conferencing and file transfer. Dusk Network uses its own digital currency, DUSK, for incentivizing permission-less participation to the network and transfer value securely among peers.  3 ) Tell us more about anonymous data sharing among peers and why Dusk is focused on this area of communication. When the internet was originally created, many important components, like a customizable privacy layer, were intentionally kept out of the foundational protocols to avoid over-complicating the initial infrastructure. Throughout the years, third parties saw the business opportunity to offer such functionalities for a premium, contributing to the creation of the lucrative cybersecurity market. These companies understood very well that privacy is an absolute prerequisite for widespread adoption of any technological innovation both in the public and private sectors.  In this era of easily accessible mutually distributed ledgers, confidentiality is even more important. The lack of privacy in many blockchains practically translates to broadcasting transactions on open ledgers that may very well be the settlement of medical or legal bills, auction bids, wages or indeed, trade secrecy around supplier sources and pay rates.  With Dusk, we aim to enable privacy-oriented communications and data transfer in a safe and decentralized environment where content providers and network enablers are compensated for their contribution.  4 ) What is the current problem facing the confidentiality and compliance requirements for launching Securitized Token Offerings? Current solutions are based on protocols and frameworks which were not intended to handle the strict KYC and privacy requirements connected to security trading.  With Dusk, we will develop a new token standard, with configurable privacy, which we intend to use to allow the issuance of confidential security tokens. The idea is to separate the confidentiality of the currency transactions (thus preserving the fungibility of DUSK) from that of asset ownership transfers, where the purchaser of an asset/security needs to satisfy KYC requirements at protocol level to complete an ownership transfer. The KYC procedure/provider is left to the token issuer and the asset purchaser has the capability of disclosing the transfer details to the authorities upon request.  5 ) What are the major features and services provided by Dusk Network? The Dusk Network solves the problem of private and secure data transfer, low-latency transmissions and paying for time-unbound communications with cryptocurrencies. This enables the anonymization and decentralization of media-on-demand services, audiovisual conferencing, confidential file transfer, compliance of security tokens, and much more.  6 ) Do you have any current opportunities for investors? There is an ongoing private placement and we are highly selective in picking the right partners to help us on our journey. Potential investors can e-mail pledge@dusk.network and include their desired investment amount and a brief pitch explaining their perceived value add.  7 ) Would you like to share your Token Economy with us, why is your cryptocurrency relevant for this project? Power and financial gain are inversely correlated in the Dusk Network, which uses a novel consensus mechanism called SBA*. The system roughly knows two types of players; provisioners and nodes. Provisioners earn a steady ROI, and nodes compete for block rewards.  SBA* uses existing ideas such as Cryptographic Sortition, combined with concepts like stealth time-locked transactions in order to implement simple but secure communication that can be audited.  By splitting tasks based on intensity and relaying them to transaction and non-transactional nodes the network’s speed greatly increases, whilst decreasing the chance of a partitioned network, and guaranteeing a higher availability of the entire network. Using SBA* there is zero chance of an unintended fork of the blockchain, meaning there will be no doubt about what the main branch is. This translates into the appealing property of achieving transaction “finality” as soon as consensus is reached for a new block.  In addition to finalizing a new block onto the chain, Notaries are also responsible for a secondary procedure which generates the block rewards through a set of coin-base transactions, essentially minting new DUSK. This new DUSK will be sent to the address of the Block Generator – the successful lottery candidate. Provisioners do not gain their reward by winning sortition, rather they gain a fixed ROI at the end of a block. This ROI is also a coin-base transaction and is awarded to all provisioners, not just those who took part in this specific block committee.  Counterintuitively, the rewards paid are inversely proportional to the staked amount, where bigger stakes get proportionally less rewarded, with respect to smaller stakes.  This measure is novel and to our knowledge, not a viable option outside of the Dusk Blockchain. The motivation is twofold. Together with preventing the ‘’rich get richer’’ scheme, the intention here is to create a counter position between power acquisition, intended as the capability to influence block generation by being selected as part of the Block Committee, and currency, intended as the financial benefit acquired from running Provisioners.  Considering that SBA* is already protected from Sybil attack by making it probabilistically disadvantageous to dilute a stack into several balances, similarly, by reversing the proportion between rewards and stake, the system prevents financially motivated participants benefiting from organizing themselves into a few Provisioner pools at the expense of decentralization.  The block rewards, together with the provisioner’s ROI, will form the DUSK network’s inflation rate. You can read more on the DUSK network’s economy in upcoming articles focused specifically on how the whole network will operate economically, however, I can say that incentives will align with decentralization and early adoption.  8 ) The cryptocurrency market still remains volatile and currently experiencing downward trends, what will be the benefits for your crypto holders?

It departs from consensus mechanisms like PoW/PoS, which are poorly suited for privacy, to introduce a new privacy-oriented consensus mechanism called Segregated Byzantine Agreement. Dusk is a new blockchain that provides true privacy and a fast and a secure streaming mechanism called Secure Tunnel Switching (STS), all powered by a privacy-oriented cryptocurrency: DUSK.  This means that we are building the first blockchain enabled platform that allows for streaming, file transfer and storage, and video/audio conferencing, all paid in crypto and fully decentralized, unsurveilled, and uncensorable. Our roadmap focuses on three main use cases; payments, digital asset transfer, and p2p communication. Especially in the asset transfer area Dusk aims to be the first platform to reconcile the requirements set out by both businesses and individuals with regulatory auditability requirements. This means that our confidentiality and privacy ecosystem will become the perfect, compliant, launching pad for Security Token Offerings (STO’s).  Besides technical innovations Dusk Network is a project that will deliver according to a strict project schedule, combining decades of IT delivery experience. The Dusk Network’s research and development is coordinated through the Dusk Foundation, a non-profit foundation that focuses exclusively on delivering the Dusk Network, and the academic, humanitarian, and commercial benefits it brings. Read our whitepaper Here.  The Dusk Network consists of three layers:  1 — DUSK Anonymous Network Layer  A gossip oriented communication tier inspired by I2P.  2 — Segregated Byzantine Agreement  A novel privacy-oriented consensus algorithm vastly more efficient than PoW or PoS. Powered by Proof of Blind Bid.  3 — Secure Tunnel Switching  A protocol allowing cryptocurrency payments for time-unbound and fast data transmission.    (Dusk Network’s three layers.)  We conceived the Dusk Network to be the first unrestricted and fully distributed communication network that does not compromise high data-rate transmission capabilities with the security and anonymity of its peers.  The system features a new consensus algorithm vastly more efficient than proof-of-work or proof-of-stake called Segregated Byzantine Agreement, and built on top of a low-latency gossip network which utilizes non-repliable datagram and garlic routing in order to prevent IP Address propagation.  Finally, the Dusk Network is complemented with an off-online file transfer mechanism and with realtime Dusk payment channel to enable undetectable and fast peer-to-peer data communication through a technique we call Secure Tunnel Switching.  Why Dusk? The very existence of freedom of expression, access to cultural heritage, information pluralism and economic liberty depends on the availability of a mean of communication capable of guaranteeing uncontrolled exchange of information and messages.  The Dusk Network was conceived for this purpose: to provide its peers with an unsurveilled and unstoppable network infrastructure that grants them the possibility to communicate freely while safeguarding their identities.  Everything within Dusk Network is skewed toward decentralization, privacy and communication efficiency: from the anonymous transport layer which solves IP tracking to the Secure Tunnel Switching protocol which allows efficient data transmission paid for through a blockchain-based digital cash called DUSK.    Use Cases The Dusk Network solves the problem of secure data transfer, low-latency transmissions and paying for time-unbound communications with cryptocurrencies. This enables a sweet spot between transparency and privacy, and enables the decentralization of:  Payments Digital Asset Transfer (STO’s) P2P Communication (Confidential Streaming) This means that the Dusk Platform can function as an infrastructure for a decentralized service like Netflix, WhatsApp, YouTube, or a communication protocol for a drone fleet, a service where whistleblowers can safely communicate, a platform where cultural or political censorship is impossible, or the place where a business seeks to tokenize its equity without having to go through an arduous IPO process where the costs outweigh the benefits.  Conclusion The Dusk Foundation is leading the R&D and delivery of the Dusk Network, a new blockchain that uses several technical advancements to deliver an ecosystem laser focused on providing the best trade off between privacy and transparency per use case.

The Dusk Network is a decentralized infrastructure focused on providing the sweet-spot between privacy and transparency in payments, communication and asset ownership transfers. It departs from consensus mechanisms like PoW/PoS, which are poorly suited for privacy, to introduce a new privacy-oriented consensus mechanism called Segregated Byzantine Agreement. Dusk is a new blockchain that provides true privacy and a fast and a secure streaming mechanism called Secure Tunnel Switching (STS), all powered by a privacy-oriented cryptocurrency: DUSK.  In this introductory series we aim to take a look at specific aspects of the Dusk Network and explain them in a nutshell. In this article we will look at Dusk’s Anonymous Network Layer, a gossip oriented communication tier inspired by I2P. The Dusk ANL serves to enable full privacy for its decentralized network, and we will explain some of its components in this article.  For a detailed description of The Dusk ANL please refer to the whitepaper.  What is the Dusk Anonymous Network Layer for? In the vast majority of blockchain implementations, network communication protocols limit themselves to just embracing the privacy standards we have in place today for our daily internet needs: TCP/IP, UDP, SSL for encrypting communication channels to name a few. These protocols are necessary to interconnect network devices on the internet, or as a communications protocol in a private network.  While this can be considered acceptable for centralized environments or platforms where user privacy is not the main proposition, the privacy requirements established with the Dusk network impose the adoption of technology offering a much higher level of privacy protection. To achieve this goal, Dusk is enabling full anonymity over its decentralized network by integrating an advanced, custom bi-directional routing, fully compatible with I2P’s Garlic-Routing technology for all its networking communications, but extending the underlying protocol not only for the deployment of additional functionality (such as fully anonymous file transfer) but also for allowing the default anonymous gossip protocol which powers the entire Dusk network.  The proposed architecture has been designed to make it computationally infeasible for an eavesdropper to tell apart Dusk related traffic from other network activities. Additionally, it should be very hard for any network node to associate a transaction with the IP address of the original initiator.  How does it work? Dusk’s ANL is inspired by and compatible with I2P’s Garlic Routing technology. Garlic routing generally refers to two things; Layered encryption, and the bundling of messages together. Garlic routing was in turn inspired by ‘Onion Routing’ (TOR). It is relevant to briefly start at the beginning to explain the decision made for the Dusk Network. Onion Routing is a technique that builds paths (tunnels) through a series of peers. Messages are encrypted a number of times, sent through the tunnel, and each peer in the tunnel strips away a layer of encryption and finds just the information it needs to send it onwards. The message and its routing instructions are only fully exposed at the end of the tunnel, once all the (onion) layers have been peeled back. Garlic routing is conceptually similar, but bundles messages together, which makes it more efficient, and makes it more difficult to track a single message if you are insistent on exposing a communication’s intended endpoint.  The Dusk Network uses a more advanced version which roughly works as follows: 1. Alice and Bob want to transact/communicate. 2. Alice and Bob are a node or connect to a node. 3. The node connects to a Voucher Seeder, and obtains a signed list of active nodes. 4. The node chooses a node from the list to act as an entry tunnel to the Dusk Network, thus bootstrapping Alice’s connection.   1. Alice’s Entry Tunnel forwards non-repliable packets to the Dusk Address of other nodes. 2. These nodes gossip the data further to other nodes until the message is propagated far enough through the network to reach Bob’s Exit Tunnel. 3. Bob receives the transaction/communication.   The Dusk Approach Compared to similar solutions, the Dusk approach offers the following benefits: 1. Makes use of packet routing, instead of circuit routing. This means transparent load balancing of all networking message across peers, instead of a single tunnel. 2. Multiple packets are joined together in inconspicuous messages, making it exponentially difficult for an attacker to expose network communications. 3. True decentralization: it uses a distributed directory to have an overview of the network, as opposed to relying on a centralized bulletin board. 4. Uni-directional tunnels guarantee that incoming and outgoing traffic is kept decoupled; a measure engineered to enhance transmission unlinkability through data stream separation.   Conclusion The ANL’s chief concern is to hide the identities of our transactors, most notably their IP Addresses. Many current privacy blockchains don’t have an IP obfuscation feature, and the implementation of Garlic Routing together with a gossip protocol ensures that a sender’s IP address will never be reconstructed.

The Dusk Network is a decentralized infrastructure focused on providing the sweet-spot between privacy and transparency in payments, communication and asset ownership transfers. It departs from consensus mechanisms like PoW/PoS, which are poorly suited for privacy, to introduce a new privacy-oriented consensus mechanism called Segregated Byzantine Agreement. Dusk is a new blockchain that provides true privacy and a fast and a secure streaming mechanism called Secure Tunnel Switching (STS), all powered by a privacy-oriented cryptocurrency: DUSK.  In this introductory series we aim to take a look at specific aspects of the Dusk Network and explain them in a nutshell. In this article we will look at Dusk’s consensus mechanism, called Segregated Byzantine Agreement, or SBA*. SBA* is a new consensus algorithm vastly more efficient than proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, and it was engineered to provide the best possible trade-off between security, efficiency and flexibility.  For a detailed description of SBA* please refer to the whitepaper.  The mechanics behind SBA* SBA* uses existing ideas like Cryptographic Sortition(lottery), and combines it with concepts like stealth time-locked transactions to implement simple but secure communication that can be audited. SBA* makes use of a few different types of actors in the network to reach consensus: 1. (super)Nodes. These are points in the network that facilitate transactions. They compete with each other for the generating and proposing blocks. These are computationally very light tasks, and a node will not require high computational power, or a big stake. 2. Provisioners. These are nodes that have committed a certain minimum stake to the Dusk Network and take care of more intensive tasks such as block verification, voting, and notarization (VVN operations). These types of nodes are non-transactional.  By splitting tasks based on intensity and relaying them to transaction and non-transactional nodes the network’s speed greatly increases, whilst decreasing the chance of a partitioned network, and guaranteeing a higher availability of the network. Using SBA* there is no chance of an unintended fork of the blockchain, meaning there will be no doubt about what the main branch is. This translates into the appealing property of achieving transaction “finality” as soon as consensus is reached for a block.  Phases of the consensus mechanism SBA* foresees different subsequent cyclic phases: 1. Block Generation Sortition — nodes participate in sortition(lottery) to acquire the right to broadcast a block proposal. 2. Default Block Generation Sortition — run by Provisioners in parallel to the Block Generation Sortition. They will propose a default empty block, in case consensus is not reached on the proposed block. 3. Validation — run by a subset of Provisioners called Verifiers. Verifiers confirm the legitimacy of the block proposal and its proposing candidate. If everything was done correctly they will sign the proposed block, otherwise they will sign the default block proposed by the provisioners. 4. Voting — a number of rounds each of which run by a different subset of Provisioners called Voters. Once consensus is reached on the block it can be notarised and added to the chain. If consensus is not reached they will vote to add an empty block. 5. Notarisation — the Voters which reached voting consensus on the pre-block are called Notaries. Their public key is added to the pre-block and they play the role of Verifiers in the next block’s Validation phase. The pre-block is then turned into an official block by the Notaries.   Sortition VVN Operations are conceptually easy to grasp, and relatively self-explanatory. They merely explain how a proposed block is tested and potentially added to the blockchain. The sortition mechanism that plays a big part in the first stages of SBA* however is worth spending a bit more time on.  A node that wishes to participate in the sortition (and become a Block Generation candidate)is first required to lock an arbitrary amount of DUSK. A time-locked transaction is a special transaction where the output is un-spendable for a predetermined period of time. In order to participate to the Sortition lottery for proposing a block, the candidate performs a time-locked transaction toward a Stealth Address. Such a transaction is indistinguishable from the normal others. After completing this transaction the candidate receives a lottery outcome, think along the lines of a lotto number, and gossips this to the rest of the network.  After all participating nodes (candidates) have gossiped their lottery outcomes to the provisioners, a winner is selected that can propose a pre-block. In case no nodes participate in a certain round the default block generated by the provisioners will be used. The big benefit of how SBA* combines sortition with gossip is that nothing needs to be known about the stakes, identity, or balances of the candidates, whilst still allowing for an audit of candidate’s honesty. The likelihood of a winning sortition outcome depends on a weight correlated to the amount of DUSK committed by a node. Proof of blind bid (SBA*) renders it statistically and economically disadvantageous for an actor to attempt bad behaviour, since he would risk losing his stake.  Rewards In addition to finalizing a block onto the chain, Notaries are also responsible for a secondary procedure which generates the block rewards through a set of coin-base transactions, essentially minting new DUSK. This new DUSK will be sent to the address of the Block Generator(the successful lottery candidate). Provisioners do not gain their reward by winning sortition, but rather gain a fixed ROI at the end of a block. This ROI is also a coin-base transaction and is awarded to all provisioners, not just those who took part in this specific block committee(those performing VVN operations).  Counterintuitively, the rewards paid are inversely proportional to the staked amount (i.e. bigger stakes get proportionally less rewarded, in respect to smaller stakes). This measure is novel and to our knowledge not a viable option outside of the Dusk Blockchain. The motivation is twofold. Together with preventing the ‘’rich get richer’’ scheme, the intention is to create a counter position between power (intended as the capability to influence block generation by being selected as part of the Block Committee) and money (intended as the financial benefit acquired from running Provisioners). Considering that SBA* is already protected from Sybil attack by making it probabilistically disadvantageous to dilute a stack into several balances, similarly, by reversing the proportion between rewards and stake, the system prevents financially motivated participants to benefit from organizing themselves into few Provisioner pools at the expense of decentralization. Centralized pools are in our opinion a highly undesirable property of a good network.  The block rewards, together with the provisioner’s ROI, will form the DUSK network’s inflation rate. You can read more on the DUSK network’s economy in upcoming articles focused specifically on how the whole network will operate economically. However, incentives will align with decentralization and early adoption.  How to learn more about Dusk Network The Dusk Network is a project coordinated by the Dusk Foundation.
