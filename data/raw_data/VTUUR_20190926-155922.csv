About VTUUR  We, here at VTUUR, believe that both VR and Augmented Reality (AR) provide new dimensions of media consumption which weren’t possible in the past. The combination of VR, AR, AI and Cryptocurrency technologies makes VTUUR a one-of-a-kind platform for both content consumers and creators. Whether we talk about exotic locations across the globe, or just a neighbour’s party down the road, traveling just isn’t possible for everyone because some people do not have the:  - Right state of health - Financial means - Time - Travel documents  With VTUUR, sold-out concerts and festivals, closed museums, unreachable fairs, overcrowded public announcements and even far-away friends’ weddings once again become accessible. You’ll not only be able to witness and participate, but the information will be presented in a way that you’ll really be a part of the environment.    How VTUUR Platform Works  VTUUR’s platform enables people across the globe to stream free and paid unique 360° Videos in the form of Virtual Reality. As far as user types, VTUUR recognizes three main groups:  (1) Tourists, using the VTUUR app, are able to experience places around the world from the comfort of their homes. All experiences will come in the form of 360° Virtual Reality videos which can be live or recorded in advance. VR Tourists may also order a new experience by booking a Guide using VR Requests. In order to watch paid content, Tourists will have to purchase VTUUR tokens and will be charged in VTUUR tokens while streaming. (2) Guides can stream 360° VR videos to all interested Tourists through the VTUUR platform by connecting a 360° camera with their mobile device. A Guide can predefine a price for their stream and has the ability to earn bonus VTUUR tokens (amount determined by the system) whenever an ad is displayed in the Guide’s video, no matter if live or recorded, free or paid. The Guide will have the possibility to exchange tokens on the VTUUR exchange for other supported cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies. (3) Advertisers’ role is not directly related to VR content but rather, they exist as a separate group of users. They can submit ads for Tourists and set preferred goals of daily views, but their content will not be presented instantly. Once the AI detects an active user who will find that ad appealing, the ad will get rendered into the stream.
