All stacks will be counted and the table will be saved.                                     GRAZ Blockchain Betting Platform                  PRE-ICO [19 Mar, 2018 - 02 Apr, 2018] Soft cap: 3 000 000 GRZ Hard cap: 10 000 000 GRZ             ICO [01 May, 2018 - 31 May, 2018] Soft cap: 7 000 000 GRZ Hard cap: 82 000 000 GRZ  To have an opportunity to take part in the private Presale with bonuses from 80% you must Get whitelisted.    Product description  Graz is a unique platform that makes it possible for people all around the globe to make wagers without worrying about getting their winnings. The platform offers users a set of various events in different domains including betting lines, politics, economics, science, film industry etc., within which users can make bets and win money. At the same time the coefficient is proposed by the one who initiates the bet, and that makes the platform more advantageous and interesting than placing bets in betting stores on predefined coefficients. Therefore, users can propose either their own wagers or choose appropriate wagers proposed by other users.  Graz will change usual conception of bets taking it to a new level. Many people dreamed of such a platform, and now thanks to blockchain and smart contract technologies it can be qualitatively implemented. Graz has a number of advantages over competitors:      â€¢ Clear and simple scheme of operations â€¢ Completely decentralized structure. Direct interaction between users making bets with each other. â€¢ No risk of non-payment due to smart contracts â€¢ Low fees (1% of winnings) â€¢ Broad range of events within which you can propose any bet with higher coefficients  With Graz you can make any bet within a broad range of events proposed by the platform. For instance, you find your favorite teamâ€™s tomorrowâ€™s game and propose a bet to other users with the following conditions: 1:5 coefficient that your team wins with an initial amount of 100 GRZ coins. Accordingly, the other bet participant must have at least 500 GRZ coins to make bet with you. You can also propose an unusual bet that a player from your favorite team will do a flip when celebrating a goal. In short, there are no limits to imagination when proposing an event. Such unusual events are checked and approved by moderators. At the moment, users make bets in betting stores that set coefficients in a special way adding a margin of 5-20% to always make a profit. That is why the long term winning in betting stores is almost an impossible task. Graz gives you an opportunity to be in bookmakerâ€™s shoes and make bets with people like you around the world.  â€¢ Opportunity to make up the betâ€™s subject yourself. â€¢ Opportunity to bet unlimited amount of money. â€¢ Opportunity to set any coefficient. â€¢ No actions are taken against users who always win.  Advantages over booking stores are quite obvious. The future has come through the development of blockchain technology. It is smart contracts that let users be assured in getting their winnings.       Interface and functionality      For creating a bet you have to: 1. Find an event you are interested in; 2. Choose a subject of the bet (e.g. Manchester United win) 3. Choose the most suitable offer for you by the amount and the coefficient. If you have not found an interesting offer for you, you can easily create your own bet.   WHY INVEST?      â€¢ All bets in Graz are made only in grazcoins (GRZ) â€¢ The amount of tokens is limited, therefore their price rises along with the increase in demand â€¢ Most of the collected funds will be spent on marketing and involvement of new users, so the demand for GRZ will only increase â€¢ We are planning to attract up to 4 million active users by the end of 2020.
