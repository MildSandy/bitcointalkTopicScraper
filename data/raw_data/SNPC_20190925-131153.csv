ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comments. This is an official protocol for proposing improvements to the Ethereum network, while ‚Äô20‚Äô is the unique proposal ID number. ERC20 defines a set of rules which need to be met in order for a token to be accepted and called as 'ERC20 Token'. The standard rules apply to all ERC20 Tokens since these rules are required to interact with each other on the Ethereum network. These tokens are blockchain assets that have value and can be sent and received, like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, or any other cryptocurrency. The difference between these tokens and a standalone currency such as Bitcoin or Litecoin is that ERC20 tokens piggyback on the Ethereum network, using Ethereum addresses and are sent through Ethereum transactions. Based on the Ethereum blockchain, the SnapCoin token implementation corresponds to a widely distributed standard and allows token holders to easily store and manage their tokens using existing Ethereum wallets.",False

During the first phase, Snapparazzi will be checking the work of the moderators like a probation period. Afterwards, moderators will be continuing their work following their guidelines without being checked every single time.  From their whitepaper:  Moderator Revenue Distribution Each video uploaded on the Snapparazzi platform will need to be moderated by 5  users  to  validate  that  its  content  complies  with  the  regulations.    For  this purpose 2% of all revenue generated will go to the Moderator fund. When a user successfully moderates a video they will be guaranteed to receive a pro rata share of revenue when the content is first uploaded.  Furthermore, every time  the  video  qualifies  under  the  paid  advertisement  option,  they  will  be entitled  to  a  further  share  of  revenue,  this  entitlement  will  remain  in  place  for the life cycle that the video is on the Snapparazzi platform, providing that the Moderator  remains  an  active  member,  with  no  dormant  periods  exceeding  90 days.  If the Moderators account does fall dormant they permanently forfeit the right to receiving any more revenue from the content they have moderated. When a ‚Äòbreaking news‚Äô video is uploaded, this content also requires moderating in the same way.  These videos attract 2% of the revenue from the auction sale to the media.  As such the reward will be substantially higher per video than the rewards received from the advertisers, to keep a level playing field Snapparazzi puts 2% of all revenue, both sale of breaking news content and the advertising revenue into one fund that is to be distributed fairly.",False
