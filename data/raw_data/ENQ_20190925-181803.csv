Jevgenijs Vainshetins: Before joining Canonical Ltd., a software development company based in London, as a director, Vainshetins was an employee at Huawei Technologies, Cogent Communications, Mobotix AG and Verint. Maxin Motin: Motin has worked as the head of business communication at MegaFon, a Russian telecommunication service provider, and as the vice president of business development at Football Club Moscow. Jason Yee: Yee was a regional manager at National Australia Bank and the head of finance at BNP Paribas Wealth Management Hong Kong. Adrian Guye: Guye has worked as a director at UBS, a financial services company located in Zurich, as a consultant at Societe Generale and Barclays Investment Bank and as a senior associate lawyer at Gide Loyrette Nouel.

Sergey Bezzateev: Bezzateev is the head of the department of IT Security at the Saint Petersburg State University of Aerospace Instrumentation. Alexander Granin: Granin has worked as a research developer at Kaspersky Lab.

Shelly Hod Moyal: Before co-founding iAngels, an angel investment firm, Moyal worked at companies such as Goldman Sachs, Avenue Capital Group and UBS. Verdict Below is a breakdown of the risks and growth potential of Enecuum.  Risks Independent code reviewers think the code in their GitHub does not reflect most of the claims made in the whitepaper so far. (-2.5) Although the team is highly experienced in software development, the absence of actual blockchain development is a worry. (-1.5) Although the team claims that they have already reached a speed of 9,000 transactions per second, there are not much to back it as the test-net has not been made public yet. (-2)  Growth Potential Great team and advisors experienced in software development, management, and (+3.5) SHARNELL Smart Contracts provides higher security as they make automatic reliable testing possible and this can attract interest from projects aiming to launch ICOs. (+2) PoA mining will be conducted by smartphones and 70% of mining rewards will be allocated to their owners. A more democratic mining with ASIC resistance should have the interest of the mining community eventually. (+1.5) HyperDAG is a more advanced form of DAG which is used in Nano and Iota. (+2.5)  Disposition Enecuum is a blockchain project with superior technical features. SHARNELL Smart Contracts, invented by the Enecuum team, enables automatic reliable testing and ensures higher security. Mining is conducted in three different stages, thanks to an algorithm called Trinity which is a combination of proof of work, proof of activity and proof of stake. As by default, 70% of mining rewards are allocated for PoA miners, or people using their smartphones for mining, a fair mining environment has already been established. A more advanced form of DAG, HyperDAG is used to obtain a higher transaction speed. Although the team claims that they have already reached 9,000 TPS on the test-net, it is better to be wary for now since it is not possible to verify this publicly. Although many team members are highly experienced in software development, management, and finance, the absence of blockchain development for such an ambitious project is a worry. Enecuum receives a 4.5/10.

HyperDAG is Hyper Directed Acyclic Graph. Its major difference from an ordinary DAG is that a new transaction added to the system can have an edge with not just one, but a whole group of previously added transactions that were published in a microblock. As a result, HyperDAG successfully combines advantages of both traditional blockchain and DAG paradigms, at the same time remedying their shortcomings. HyperDAG is designed to be able to process millions of transactions per second and be well-secured against attacks.",False

A great question! Indeed, many want to be the next solution adopted worldwide.

Knowing how to use a hybrid consensus algorithm, that is, Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Activity, and Proof-of-Stake design a capable network of mobile devices reach high data security and implement sharding, make smart contracts cheaper and more fault-resistant, we simply cannot stay away.

Along with the development of already well-known ideas, he also introduces a whole range of completely new technologies, which in sum significantly changes the situation in the industry. Enecuum is initially optimized for building real business applications, focused on solving practical problems, including from the real sector of the economy. An API is also available for rapid integration with existing business processes. A number of ambitious projects from the sphere of trade and services are already based on this detachment!  To date, there are two main approaches to the storage of transactions in distributed registries:  in the form of blocks (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many others), and also in the form of Directed Acyclic Graph (IOTA, Byteball, Universa).  Enecuum harmoniously combined these two approaches into one and created a completely new method of recording transactions, which he called HyperDAG. Its main difference from DAG is that transactions entering the system can refer not only to one of the previous transactions but also to their group (which is included in the block). As a result, HyperDAG successfully combines the advantages of both methods and simultaneously covers their shortcomings - it processes thousands of transactions per second and has a high degree of protection against attacks.  By using HyperDAG to record and store transactions, Enecuum is ideally suited for the implementation of shading, which makes it possible to divide the blockchain into several smaller parts represented by separate branches (or parts thereof) and processed in parallel. Thus, in combination with the variable block size, Enecuum can efficiently process tens and hundreds of thousands of transactions per second without compromising the security of the system, as a result of which transactions commissions will in most cases be zero or have minimal values.  The combination, f three types of mining (PoW, PoS and PoA) organically combined in Enecuum allows to achieve maximum decentralization of the system at once in two planes: not only geographically, but also among different types of devices, that is, in the context of social layers of the population. Thus, not declared, but algorithmically guaranteed decentralization becomes the most important cornerstone of the Enecuum blockchain. Significant security improvements are also available at the level of smart contracts that are implemented on the basis of linear logic, which almost eliminates errors.",False

Here is more information on this topic.  Hybrid Consensus Algorithm In Enecuum, the consensus is achieved through interaction between the following three mining algorithms: Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Activity (PoA) and Proof of Stake (PoS). This combination makes it possible to achieve the maximum degree of network decentralization, while significantly increasing both the network security level and its speed.  The transaction confirmation process implemented in Enecuum can roughly be divided into 3 stages corresponding the algorithms mentioned above. There are two approaches to the first stage. The regular one is where miners connected to the PoW network calculate the hash for blocks of varied size, each for its own block, in parallel. After a hash satisfying current requirements for its complexity is found, a miner fills the block with transactions and translates it to the network for the second stage involving transaction verification by PoA miners. The second approach is for a PoW miner to calculate the hash, create a macroblock and hold it open for a team of PoA miners to fill it with microblocks containing transactions.  Hybrid consensus algorithm During the second stage, PoA miners, divided into teams act correspondingly to the chosen PoW scenario. In case of the first PoW scenario described above, they check the hash in the translated block’s header and verify the transactions in the block. In case of the second PoW scenario, they check the hash in translated block’s header, create a microblock, fill it with transactions, and send it to the macroblock of the PoW miner. In total, a team sent to the macroblock 62 microblocks each containing 40 transactions. Then, depending on the transactions included in the block, attach PoA miners attach it to one of the system’s branches. Checking the block hash for correctness does not require large computational capability, and this operation can be performed even by most simple devices, including a mobile phone. The same applies to microblock creation, filling it with transactions and transaction verification. The process of a PoA team formation involves calculating a hash to enter the team. Each team can have max 64 participants and is organized based on analysis of several parameters, including the node’s geographic location and other parameters, in order to achieve the highest consensus security level.  During the third stage, PoS miners continuously re-check balances of all the wallets in the system. For this activity, PoS miners receive a portion of the mining reward, in the form of an interest. The interest depends on the miner’s balance in two ways: First, the system defines the minimum and maximum balance thresholds outside of which a miners is not able to gain any interest whatsoever, and second, the interest grows as the PoS miner’s balance grows from the minimum to maximum threshold. In contrast to existing reward methods, where the network generates new coins immediately upon discovering a valid block, Enecuum, at this stage, issues marks that are added to the wallet balance, whereas the real mining payment is performed, on average, once a day. This way the system is protected against possible attacks on the mining algorithm as well as attempts to gain control over the majority of the computational capacities (e.g. through ASICS).",False
