In simple words, it is a utility token integrated to use on the platform in exchange of services. How? With benefits, discounts and generous rewards, the platform encourages the users to adopt tokens,  the network grows the value of token increases with the increase in demand, given the limited number of supply of the tokens.  So, the token value is based on real services exchanged by real people in 2 Trillion dollars worth economy. Additionally, the liquidity is ensured as 9coin is convertible to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, LTC and even fiat! The good news for contributors is this would lead to a huge price increase of a token resulting in a profit for early token holders. The thing every investor should look for is a strong reason why token demand should increase over time.

Of course, there are some points there that are similar to other freelance platforms.  What truly makes GIG9 stand out: - The fact that we focus on local service providers. We have the whole ""empowering local communities"" and ""focusing on the heart of the economy"" thing going on. - That bring us to our GEO-mapping technology which kinda makes us like the Uber of freelance services. You can track the location of your providers on a map. - We are heavy in our CSR. Equal opportunities for everyone irrespective of age, gender, background or physical ability. Which sure, is present in other platforms, but we actually speak about them - women empowerment, older skilled workers, young business leaders and workers with disabilities. - We also have Women in Blockchain UK which we will use as a partner for GIG9 to help encourage and empower women.  Also, another thing is the GIG9 token - 9Coin whose value will increase according to the number of jobs completed. So, the liquidity is there due to the fact that it is backed by real services.",False

Current freelancing platforms such as Upwork, Freelance and Fiverr focus on businesses and independent professionals connecting and collaborating remotely. What GIG9 does is provide a personal touch and allow users to get the job done locally with over 150 different types of service providers within their vicinity be it plumbers, electricians, handymen, photographers, nannies, lawyers and so much more.  Similar to Uber, we operate on a “Provider Navigation System” where users have the ability to actively track the location of their service provider on a map due to our enhanced GPS-mapping technology. This eliminates problems of unwanted delays and irritable time schedules allowing both users and providers to track and plan their schedules accordingly.  Additionally, our users can enjoy the benefits of not having to pay any advertising costs, sign up costs or membership fees. They can simply download our easy-to-use app and sign up to an advantageous experience of real reviews, secure transactions and fair pricing since GIG9 is a decentralised peer-to-peer marketplace built on blockchain technology.

Of course, there are some points there that are similar to other freelance platforms.  What truly makes GIG9 stand out: - The fact that we focus on local service providers. We have the whole ""empowering local communities"" and ""focusing on the heart of the economy"" thing going on. - That bring us to our GEO-mapping technology which kinda makes us like the Uber of freelance services. You can track the location of your providers on a map. - We are heavy in our CSR. Equal opportunities for everyone irrespective of age, gender, background or physical ability. Which sure, is present in other platforms, but we actually speak about them - women empowerment, older skilled workers, young business leaders and workers with disabilities. - We also have Women in Blockchain UK which we will use as a partner for GIG9 to help encourage and empower women.  Also, another thing is the GIG9 token - 9Coin whose value will increase according to the number of jobs completed. So, the liquidity is there due to the fact that it is backed by real services.

Of course, there are some points there that are similar to other freelance platforms.  What truly makes GIG9 stand out: - The fact that we focus on local service providers. We have the whole ""empowering local communities"" and ""focusing on the heart of the economy"" thing going on. - That bring us to our GEO-mapping technology which kinda makes us like the Uber of freelance services. You can track the location of your providers on a map. - We are heavy in our CSR. Equal opportunities for everyone irrespective of age, gender, background or physical ability. Which sure, is present in other platforms, but we actually speak about them - women empowerment, older skilled workers, young business leaders and workers with disabilities. - We also have Women in Blockchain UK which we will use as a partner for GIG9 to help encourage and empower women.  Also, another thing is the GIG9 token - 9Coin whose value will increase according to the number of jobs completed. So, the liquidity is there due to the fact that it is backed by real services.

Here's a link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98IK1qFleWQ - it's a video so you can have some visual aids as well.  Of course, there are some points there that are similar to other freelance platforms.  What truly makes GIG9 stand out: - The fact that we focus on local service providers. We have the whole ""empowering local communities"" and ""focusing on the heart of the economy"" thing going on. - That bring us to our GEO-mapping technology which kinda makes us like the Uber of freelance services. You can track the location of your providers on a map. - We are heavy in our CSR. Equal opportunities for everyone irrespective of age, gender, background or physical ability. Which sure, is present in other platforms, but we actually speak about them - women empowerment, older skilled workers, young business leaders and workers with disabilities. - We also have Women in Blockchain UK which we will use as a partner for GIG9 to help encourage and empower women.  Also, another thing is the GIG9 token - 9Coin whose value will increase according to the number of jobs completed. So, the liquidity is there due to the fact that it is backed by real services.

In simple words, it is a utility token integrated to use on the platform in exchange for services. How? With benefits, discounts and generous rewards, the platform encourages the users to adopt tokens,  the network grows the value of token increases with the increase in demand, given the limited number of supply of the tokens.  So, the token value is based on real services exchanged by real people in 2 Trillion dollars worth economy. Additionally, the liquidity is ensured as 9coin is convertible to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, LTC and even fiat! The good news for contributors is this would lead to a huge price increase of a token resulting in a profit for early token holders. The thing every investor should look for is a strong reason why token demand should increase over time.

In simple words, it is a utility token integrated to use on the platform in exchange of services. How? With benefits, discounts and generous rewards, the platform encourages the users to adopt tokens,  the network grows the value of token increases with the increase in demand, given the limited number of supply of the tokens.  So, the token value is based on real services exchanged by real people in 2 Trillion dollars worth economy. Additionally, the liquidity is ensured as 9coin is convertible to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, LTC and even fiat! The good news for contributors is this would lead to a huge price increase of a token resulting in a profit for early token holders. The thing every investor should look for is a strong reason why token demand should increase over time.
