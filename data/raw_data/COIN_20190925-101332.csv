While exchanges are Coinvest closest competition, no one is executing investment trades in a completely decentralized process as Coinvest does... so it doesn’t have anyone to compare with directly... yet.  Coinvest is a trading platform (and market maker) where you make investment transactions and redeem profit from your trades through a process that is completely decentralized and handled by smart contracts.  Platform is an all-in-one investment platform, wallet, and exchange (future).  Coinvest aims to be a one-stop solution that enables anyone to easily buy, invest in hundreds of different cryptonized assets, and spend cryptocurrencies using only one wallet and one coin.  Coinvest main advantage is that it is decentralized. Investment process is managed by smart contracts including user investment data and funds. User funds are held in escrow (and not by a centralized third-party) by the smart contract until they are withdrawn by the user. Coinvest has no ability to touch or manage those funds including the liquidity pool that collateralize and back the investments. Once funds are withdrawn from a user’s portfolio, they can be stored in the wallet or spent directly from your wallet using the built-in debit account.  To make this more real, let’s apply this to a potential real-life scenario. Imagine if you want to invest in 12 different coins. With today’s solutions, you would have to:  -  Search and find all of the exchanges that support the coins you want -  Go through KYC checks for each exchange -  Place 12 individual trades and incur % fees for each trade -  Worry about having multiple wallets to support multiple protocols -  Manage different private keys -  Sell and convert your assets back to fiat currency before being about to spend them  On Coinvest, you could execute all of the above in one trade, for one fee ($4.99), and only have to manage one wallet. From there, you can spend your COIN directly from your wallet without having to convert it back to fiat (using our built-in debit card support).  Today, current solutions in the market are just too complicated. Coinvest is democratizing cryptocurrencies by creating a single destination that empowers anyone to easily buy, invest, and spend cryptocurrencies through a decentralized process using only a single online account and COIN.",False

DALLAS, TX - Coinvest, an emerging blockchain startup comprised of Microsoft alumni, is announcing the details of their hardware wallet that offers consumers a secure end-to-end solution to complement the Coinvest decentralized investment trading market for cryptocurrencies.  The Coinvest hardware wallet offers state-of-the art design and architecture featuring: -  A cryptographic coprocessor with secure hardware-based key storage and asymmetric and symmetric cipher support -  Linux operating system using a SAMA5D2 pre-PCI certified processor -  4.3” LED backlit full touchscreen display with 480x272 resolution -  FIDO/U2F support to use COIN wallet as a security token for two-factor authentication -  A single USB-C connection with support for authenticating desktop and mobile devices -  A dedicated screen and authentication chip to protect consumers even if the host computer is infected with a virus or malware -  Support for Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, ERC20 tokens, and more  Unlike current solutions on the market that leverage pure MCU-based solutions such as the Ledger and Trezor, Coinvest has chosen a pre-PCI certified processor to mitigate the security risks that competing platforms possess, while maximizing graphics capabilities for an experience that is second to-none. The wallet also has a single USB-C connection with support for authenticating desktop and mobile devices. With premium materials and a size equivalent to a credit card, the Coinvest wallet provides consumers an all-in-one portable personal security solution in a strikingly beautiful design.  The Coinvest hardware wallet integrates with the Coinvest investment trading platform to offer an end-to-end solution to securely invest and store cryptonized assets. In addition to the storage of popular cryptocurrency protocols such as Bitcoin and Ethereum ERC20 tokens, the wallet will have an integrated password management application and FIDO/U2F support to use the wallet as a security token for two-factor authentication. The Coinvest wallet development API will empower developers to build secure apps to use with the wallet as well as offer compatibility with other leading wallet solutions such as MyEtherWallet, MyCrypto, and more.  Alongside the hardware wallet, Coinvest will be offering a case for device protection. The hardware wallet case features three slots to hold credit cards with one slot as an option for the modular money clip. Two fitted magnetic slots secure the hardware wallet and travel cable in place. The case features a variety of premium textures and colors to fit all personal styles. The combination of the Coinvest hardware wallet and case offers a single solution to carry cash, credit cards, and cryptocurrency together in a package slightly larger than the size of a credit card.  Coinvest is partnering with leading hardware and security firms, Cardinal Peak and Cryptotronix, to bring the wallet to market by early 2019. The Coinvest wallet will retail for $249 and only be available for purchase using the Coinvest COIN token direct from the Coinvest website. COIN is currently available for purchase during Coinvest’s token sale through Friday, April 6th at 9:30 CST. For more information, visit https://wallet.coinve.st.

These changes include an upgrade with standard ERC865 and ERC 191 while downgrading our token from ERC223 to ERC20.  (Unfortunately, being on the bleeding edge of technology has not favored us as some exchanges have yet to upgrade from the ERC20 standard and can not support COIN)  COIN V2 includes improvements with security, privacy, performance, and efficiency.  For example,  anonymous investing with only your wallet address as your identity, direct transfers that leverage COIN instead of ETH for transfers using gas, and more. In addition to these improvements, COIN would have full compatibility and support with current exchanges on the market today.  These upgrades require a fork of our existing COIN token.  As a business, we have decided that a fork is most beneficial now as opposed to the future for the following reasons: -  Seamless distribution using a smart contract with no user interaction.  New COIN V2 would automatically be sent to the wallet addresses of those that invested (rending current COIN with no value).  Forking in the future would require a token swap and token holders to be manually involved in the swap . -  The improved changes reduce complexity and increase the time to bring the platform to market  This means that current COIN would have no value and new COIN would be distributed in a month after a token audit and distribution via a new smart contract.  Please note that this decision was made in favor of improving our technology for the benefit of users and overall business.  We are extremely excited about these upgrades as they provide for a better end-user experience.  We strongly believe that this short-term impact has favorable long-term implications that will help with Coinvest adoption and growth.   Full documentation including a demo of the COIN V2 transfer functionality will be published tomorrow.",False

Many exchanges (including decentralized exchanges) relies on other parties (exchanges / users) or API's to operate its network to assist with key functions such as order book matching, finding trading pairs, collateralization.  As a result, this impacts speed, introduces security risks, requires another counterparty, and results in a chicken before the egg problem before the network becomes valuable. (A company can claim their platform is decentralized which may be true... but if you require API, plugins, nodes, or other third-parties to execute a function on your platform, you've introduced centralization into your decentralized process.)  At Coinvest, we don't have the chicken before the egg problem as we are decentralized in our technology AND the dependency of others to operate.  As mentioned previously, Coinvest is a trading platform that empowers investors to make virtual investment transactions (like derivatives) and redeem profit from your trades through a process that is completely decentralized and handled by smart contracts.  We aim to be a one-stop solution that enables anyone to easily invest in hundreds of different cryptonized assets and spend cryptocurrencies using only one wallet and one coin.  Here are a few other differences from exchanges: -  Decentralization (our smart contracts control the network - See our article published today about Coinbase halting trades here:  https://goo.gl/54YNWX) -  Flexible investment trading options (limit orders, shorting, etc.) -  Convenience (Users no longer have to worry about dealing with multiple protocols, transferring assets, managing multiple wallets and private keys) -  Coin support (Many exchanges only supports a small number of coins):  At Coinvest, we plan to support 50-150 in 2018 alone.  We can do this and onboard coins very easy as we are virtualizing trades. -  Simplicity (Through Coinvest, you never have to worry about more than one wallet or one coin) -  Debit Card Account Support:  Instead of having to convert your coins back to fiat on current exchanges, you can spend directly from your Coinvest account through our Debit card. -  Future expansion to include virtual trading options such as ETF's, Alt Coin Futures, etc.  Here's an image that helps explain our advantages:",False

Our min cap is $1M and we’be raised nearly a total of $5M. According to our analytics and our industry data, our results have been impacted by the two corrections in February and the latest market correction in March. We saw a decline in registrations since these events. We also see other peers in the industry holding token sales being impacted as well. We've written an article on this based upon our analysis:  https://medium.com/@CoinvestHQ/coinvest-token-sale-waterfall-analysis-f1553135c22c  We will continue to execute to increase our overall raise; however, please note a $5–10M raise is still enough runway to support our overall mission and roadmap. (Please keep in mind that in the VC world of Silicon Valley, a $5–10M raise is typically a Series A round)  A full raise of $30M would have allocated $15M into our reserves, allow the company to take business risks, and deploy a number of initiatives to broaden the Coinvest brand. A raise of only $5–10M increases our reserve size to $20–25M (as unsold tokens are moved to the reserves) and still accomplishes our goals; however, puts us in an environment in which we are focused on a core set of products, take little risks, and ensure full diligence in our operating expenses.  Please note that unsold tokens will be moved to the reserve to collateralize the network.  The smart contract will manage them and they will only be distributed if a user has profited them in a trade.  That means they will not be in the available in market circulation (such as exchanges) until a user makes profit on trades.  In our current environment, we still feel very confident with our roadmap, team, and ability to execute our mission. We ask for your support in continuing to believe in Coinvest for the same reasons that sparked your interest in our company from the beginning. We are fully committed in this journey together and won’t let you down.",False

Probably the low price of the ETH is not helping either.Is the price of the ETH pegged now or calculated on the fly?  Hi everyone.  You are correct.  This is very low and has surprised our team as well.  We've been reviewing our analytics and will be publishing an update on this soon.  According to our analytics and our industry data, our results have been impacted by a number of things:  -  Overall Market:  The two corrections in February and the latest marketer correct in March. We saw a decline in registrations since these events. We also see other peers in the industry holding token sales being impacted by the latest market corrections as well. -  Scam Attempts:  The morning of our token sale, hackers and scammers flooded our servers and communications channels with DDOS attacks (traffic) that overloaded our servers which crippled our ability to proceed with our site loading, email sign-ups, email verification, etc.   They also created imposter accounts and channels and directly reached out to our investors and misguided them with false wallet addresses.  Investors that experience FOMO and did not take our instructions over the past month were impacted. -  Lack of Marketing:  Given the strong demand velocity in the registrations we received, we scaled back or delayed specific marketing activities and announcements.  We have now discovered that the recent market weaknesses eliminated a lot of that original interest.  Therefore, we will be kicking up our marketing efforts and resuming planned marketing activities.  We hope to turn things around; however, if we only raise $5 - 10M, it will still be enough runway to support our overall mission and roadmap.  (Please keep in mind that in the VC and world of Silicon Valley, a $5 - 10M raise is typically a Seed A round)  A full raise of $30M would have allowed us to take business risks and deploy a number of initiatives that could help broaden the Coinvest brand.  A raise of $5 - 10M still accomplishes our goals; however, puts us in an environment in which we are focused on one path, take no risks, and ensure full diligence in our operating expenses.  We still feel very confident with our roadmap, team, and ability to execute our mission with this raise.  We ask for your support in continuing to believe in Coinvest for the same reasons that sparked your interest in our company from the beginning.  ",False

As for KYC, in 2018 we will introduce our trading market and investment trading platform to trade hundreds of cryptocurrencies using COIN. You will have to acquire COIN through our crowdsale or an exchange such as Bittrex to do so.  Even before we officially become an exchange, users will be able to obtain value and make profit through investment trades using COIN.  KYC is not required in this scenario.  In 2019 (or earlier), we become a licensed exchange (by obtaining our money transmitter license) and you will be able to buy COIN direct from our website using Fiat currency. In that way, we become a one stop shop for buying, investing and spending cryptocurrencies using only one COIN.  This convenience for our users is the primary reason for becoming an exchange.  In order to buy COIN directly from us, KYC would be required as we are accepting fiat.",False

This seems to me like a bit of a mealy-mouthed distraction where none is needed here for basic transparency. It's just a white paper. For better or worse, I'm now thinking, ""if there is nothing to hide, why act as if you're trying to hide something"".  I'd like to think that potential investors that actually read white papers are intelligent enough not to be bamboozled by ""multiple versions"" of any document. I don't know what it's like now, but in the olden days, some people liked to put dates and version numbers in their documents so others could tell new from old. Alternatively, I like to do this thing called ""asking the company directly for information"".  I'd be interested to know more about the ""potential fraud"" angle since I've never before seen that in relation to any ICO white papers. On the ""copying"" front, some potential investors like to do plagiarism checks on white papers, which means they are out of luck with yours being so locked down. Although I'm sure there are ""workarounds"" out there for the determined.",False

Our response was really nothing more but to help explain that we want to minimize confusion as much as possible.  For example, when we originally created our whitepaper, our token economics were pegged to ETH.  In December, we updated this so that COIN was pegged to the USD in communicated here:  https://medium.com/@CoinvestHQ/coinvest-token-value-3083c010503f  Have one point of distribution for our whitepaper allowed us to update this information in one location... all within our control.  We found that many articles and reviews written about Coinvest prior to this change reflected older token economics which could potentially create confusion.  (These articles and reviews are still out on the Internet and have yet to be updated by those authors)  To prevent a situation like this, we determined it was appropriate to lock down the permissions of the whitepaper.  Especially in the event where we may need to make adjustments.  To the other points, we've seen examples where companies like Tron have fraudulently copied verbiage from other companies.  Again, we want to remove this risk from any other company whether they are competition or not.  Lastly, while there are savvy investors out there that can decipher between multiple versions of a document, we would rather not make that assumption for all of the investors across the board.  With that goal of providing accuracy and minimizing confusion, we believe that this is the best approach.  We hope that you understand our position on this rather than infer that we are attempting to hide something.",False

This will be the long one.    Quote can you explain what the coin reserve 25% and 50% secondary reserve is?  COIN reserve is held inside of the smart contract.  25% of token supply is immediately deposited into this reserve for instant liquidity to the network.  Losses from user trades are also deposited in the COIN reserve.  The COIN reserve can accept deposited funds but does not support withdrawals from any third-party including Coinvest.  It is located inside of, and managed solely by, the smart contract. The secondary reserve backs up the COIN reserve to provide contingency.  50% of the funds raised from tokensale go into the second reserve.  Assume Coinvest hits full raise of $33M, that would mean $16.5M goes into the secondary reserve.  Suppose Coinvest doesn't hit full raise, any unsold tokens go into the COIN reserve.  The secondary reserve contains cryptonized assets that mirror 1:1 or outpace cryptocurrencies being traded on platform.  Coinvest is hiring asset managers in order to manage risk/reserve, help reduce risk, and grow the business. However, based upon forecasts, the network should never have to utilize the secondary reserve.  Even, in the event of worst case scenario, where every trader has profited and decides to liquidate at the same time.  If that were to happen, and the amount happens to exceed the first reserve, then the second reserve would be deployed.  Even in that case, the second reserve would have had the same, or similar, holdings to those in the user portfolios...ensuring that the system is still liquid and Coinvest could replenish the first reserve again.  Quote what is the token issue date ?  Tokensale will last from March, 9th to April, 6th. Tokens will be sent to respective wallets immediately after contribution by smart contract.  Quote What is the exact mechanism for the team token lockup?  Coinvest treats tokens options for its employees and advisors similar to stock options. They carry a 5 year vesting schedule with annual distributions for every award.",False

It's the latter.  However, Coinvest collateralizes the investment using our reserves so you no longer have to worry about storing or transferring the assets themselves.  Similar to the stock market, when you purchase Apple stock you do not receive the physical stock certificate... however, the value is retained in contract.  Coinvest employs two reserves.  Our COIN reserve is held inside of the smart contract.  25% of our token supply is immediately deposited into this reserve for instant liquidity to the network.  Losses from user trades are also deposited in the COIN reserve.  The COIN reserve can accept deposited funds but does not support withdrawals from any third-party including Coinvest.  It is located inside of and managed solely by the smart contract.  The secondary reserve backs up the COIN reserve to provide contingency.  50% of the funds raised from our tokensale goes into the second reserve.  The secondary reserve contains the actual cryptonized assets that mirror 1:1 or outpace cryptocurrencies being traded on our platform.  We will purchase assets through our relationships with exchanges and brokers and store the assets securely in cold hardware wallets.  In our public quarterly earnings report, we will list the wallet addresses and amounts of our reserves for complete transparency.   ",False

Depending on the speed of these audits and any fixes associated with this, it could impact the release date.  In the meantime, our full Beta is planned to be launched before our crowdsale.

We expect to complete our end-to-end BETA before the crowdsale which includes our web front-end so that users can test the product through our user-friendly interface instead of having to use an ABI / JSON interface.

This eventually led to a Bachelor of Mathematics while studying at the University of Waterloo. It was at that point he launched his professional career as a Software Developer working for companies such as IBM, Credit 1, QuoteMedia, and most recently Shopify. Always fascinated with patterns, numbers and games naturally caused him to explore how to play in the equity markets. Mike owned and operated a proprietary trading firm that used a mix of fully automated and hybrid algorithmic trading systems to take advantage of opportunities upon the introduction of decimalization, dark pools and ECNs into the equity markets.  He is now excited to help create a decentralized exchange, making it easier for the masses to take advantage of the cryptocurrency market. Keeping him equally busy and happy are his two children, spending time at the cottage, preferably with a good non-fiction and a dusty scotch.

Rachel is excited to join the rapidly evolving Coinvest team, bringing her passion for developing brands and connecting companies to their audience through creative marketing campaigns, media relations, social media growth, compelling content, events and more.

Her deep love for process was first piqued in university, where she pursued a degree in Public Relations.

These led her to a role at Adobe, working as a community manager within the IT organization. Over the course of four years, Varija worked in varying capacities across Adobe — most recently in a project management position on an experience strategy team. This role launched her excitement for crafting a seamless, agile experience for customers and employees. She brings this excitement to Coinvest and is thrilled to join and support the team.

Actually, when you make a trade on our platform, your COIN value is held in the underlying assets in your investment portfolio.  However, that investment data and the contract value is held in our smart contract, platform, and blockchain.  In your example, you would use $500 in COIN to trade and make your investment portfolio.  That value and your positions are held in the smart contract.  Once you are ready to sell, the smart contract returns the investment value back to your wallet using the equivalent value in COIN.  (For example, if your investment portfolio increased to $1000, you would receive $1000 in equivalent value in COIN depending on the market price)    When COIN sits on your Coinvest wallet or another wallet, it is not in an investment portfolio and would be treated as a normal currency for you to use or spend.  (If it is on your Coinvest wallet, then you can easily spend your COIN using the Coinvest debit card)  Does this help?",False

Bisq is a P2P exchange where you can exchange crypto-to-crypto or crypto-to-fiat with another trading pair.  While Bisq is a nice platform, we would comment that they are still very different from our business.  While decentralized, Bisq require a trading pair in order to operate it's network to execute it's key exchange function.  If a trading pair is not found or matched, the trade doesn't occur.  As a result, this impacts speed, requires another counterparty, and results in a chicken before the egg problem before the network becomes valuable.   At Conivest, we are a investment trading platform that executes trades through virtualization (like derivatives).  We are a full decentalized platform that relies solely on smart contracts to execute all of the necessary functions to execute our mission. Since we are virtualizing trades, Coinvest doesn't rely on any trading pair dependancies as Bisq does.  Therefore, orders are executed immediately by the smart contract once conditions are hit.  That reason alone, should provide for an experience that is much more efficient than what the market offers today.  A few other differences from Bisq: -  Decentralization: Coinvest’ order execution, fund management, and distributions are managed and executed by smart contracts (so there is no third-party involvement) - Speed: Order execution is instant on Coinvest vs. waiting for trading pair matching - Security:  Our smart contract is the custodian of your investment funds. - Convenience:  Invest in multiple cryptonized assets without having to worry about storage, multiple wallets, multiple private keys, and transferring / supporting all coin protocols. Through Coinvest, you never have to worry about more than one wallet or one coin. - Functionality:  Coinvest enables flexible trading options to help you obtain the best value with buy, buy limit, short orders - Cost:  Since Coinvest is automated and controlled by smart contracts, third-parties and overhead are removed which leads to lower cost transactions fees - Diversification:  Coinvest enables you to curate your own custom personal index fund (In the future, we will allow users to invest into other user's personal index funds.) - Support:  (Coinbase only supports 3 coins, other exchanges support X number):  At Coinvest, we plan to support 50-250 in 2018 alone.  We can do this and onboard coins very easy as we are virtualizing trades like derivatives. -  Liquidity:  Instead of having to convert your coins back to fiat on current exchanges, you can spend directly from your Coinvest account through our Debit card. -  Innovaton:  Future expansion to include virtual trading options such as ETF's, Alt Coin Futures, Commodities such as Oil, Corn, etc. -  Experience and Credibility: Our team has decades of corporate experience ranging from companies such as Microsoft, IBM, etc. Our advisors are leaders and have played significant roles in their respective industries.

With the Coinvest platform and protocol, investors are empowered to create virtual investment portfolios to invest in multiple cryptocurrencies through only one COIN. Similar to derivatives, users trade the value of the underlying asset without requiring the need to hold the assets themselves. Meanwhile, investment portfolios are fully collateralized by Coinvest reserves. Users are no longer required to manage multiple exchanges, wallets, private keys, and can spend COIN directly from their Coinvest wallet using our built-in debit card support.  We are democratizing cryptocurrencies by creating a single destination that empowers anyone to easily invest and spend cryptocurrencies using a decentralized process through only one COIN.  Consider us the e-trade of cryptocurrencies with debit card account support.  We want to make it so easy that even grandma can participate in this revolution!   ",False

There is nothing in the backend that actually connects to an exchange, buys and holds those coins. They'll effectively get some price feed from somewhere that will provide pricing for you index fund that can be used to value your portfolio and importantly how much profit or loss you make when you liquidate.

There is nothing in the backend that actually connects to an exchange, buys and holds those coins. They'll effectively get some price feed from somewhere that will provide pricing for you index fund that can be used to value your portfolio and importantly how much profit or loss you make when you liquidate.

Coinvest is a trading platform (and market maker) where you make virtual investment transactions (like derivatives trading on the stock market) and redeem profit from your trades through a process that is completely decentralized and handled by smart contracts.  Our platform is an all-in-one investment platform, wallet, and exchange (future).  We aim to be a one-stop solution that enables anyone to easily buy, invest in hundreds of different cryptonized assets, and spend cryptocurrencies using only one wallet and one coin.  To make this more real, let’s apply this to a potential real-life scenario. Imagine if you want to invest in 12 different coins. With today’s solutions, you would have to: -  Search and find all of the exchanges that support the coins you want -  Go through KYC checks for each exchange -  Place 12 individual trades and incur % fees for each trade -  Worry about having multiple wallets to support multiple protocols -  Manage different private keys -  Sell and convert your assets back to fiat currency before being about to spend them  On Coinvest, you could execute all of the above in one trade, for one fee ($4.99), and only have to manage one wallet. From there, you can spend your COIN directly from your wallet without having to convert it back to fiat (using our built-in debit card support).  Today's solutions in the market are just too complicated. Coinvest is democratizing cryptocurrencies by bringing it to the masses.  We want to make this so easy that even Grandma can use it and participate in this new revolution.  🙂",False

But quite frankly, no one is executing investment trades in a completely decentralized process as we are... and exchanges do not have a mechanism to spend directly from your account... So we don’t have anyone to compare with directly... yet.  First, Coinvest is a trading platform (and market maker) where you make investment transactions and redeem profit from your trades through a process that is completely decentralized and handled by smart contracts.  We aim to be a one-stop solution that enables anyone to easily buy, invest in hundreds of different cryptonized assets, and spend cryptocurrencies using only one wallet and one coin.  Our difference and main advantage is that we are decentralized.  Our investment process is managed by smart contracts including user investment data and funds. User funds are held in escrow (and not by a centralized third-party) by the smart contract until they are withdrawn by the user.  No third-party (including Coinvest) has the ability to touch or manage those funds including the liquidity pool that collateralize and back the investments. Once funds are withdrawn from a user’s portfolio, they can be stored in the wallet or spent using the built-in debit account.  Additionally the following: - Security:  Our smart contract is the custodian of your investment funds. - Convenience:  Invest in multiple cryptonized assets without having to worry about storage, multiple wallets, multiple private keys, and transferring / supporting all coin protocols. Through Coinvest, you never have to worry about more than one wallet or one coin. - Functionality:  Coinvest enables flexible trading options to help you obtain the best value with buy, buy limit, short orders - Cost:  Since Coinvest is automated and controlled by smart contracts, third-parties and overhead are removed which leads to lower cost transactions fees - Diversification:  Coinvest enables you to curate your own custom personal index fund (In the future, we will allow users to invest into other user's personal index funds.) - Support:  (Coinbase only supports 3 coins, other exchanges support X number):  At Coinvest, we plan to support 50-250 in 2018 alone.  We can do this and onboard coins very easy as we are virtualizing trades like derivatives. -  Liquidity:  Instead of having to convert your coins back to fiat on current exchanges, you can spend directly from your Coinvest account through our Debit card. -  Innovaton:  Future expansion to include virtual trading options such as ETF's, Alt Coin Futures, Commodities such as Oil, Corn, etc.  For a complete and detailed comparison, we recommend you view pages 7 and 8 of our whitepaper at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ePI50Vd9MGdkPnH0KdVuhTOOSiqmnE7WteGDtG10GuE/edit?usp=sharing",False

As you find in our whitepaper, we have two reserves.  The first reserve is our COIN reserve and houses all of the COIN that will be distributed as profit for the network.  The Second reserve will be actual cryptonized assets mapped to what users are trading on the platform.  The business has been architected to never even deploy the use of the second reserve.  Only unless in the event of worst case scenario.  Suppose every trader has profited and decides to liquidate at the same time.  If that amount happens to exceed the first reserve, then would the second reserve be deployed.  Even in that case, the second reserve would have had the same or similar holdings to those in the user portfolios that the system is still liquid and we could replenish the first reserve again.  Here are six reasons why we forecast we would never even hit ""worst case scenario"": 1)  Please also note that COIN losses from unprofitable trades go to the COIN reserve 2)  We will implement trading pairs and match buy / sell orders (Which derisks the platform because orders then wash each other) 3)  Trading markets usually have probability (odds) that are around 50%.  So that naturally creates a balanced profit / loss market to always ensure that the reserve is liquid. 4)  We will have a secondary reserve in place to backup the COIN reserve that can mirror or outpace trades on the platform 5)  We will have trading limits to protect the network in the case of large swing orders 6)  Our profit model enables us to buyback and replenish the COIN reserve as needed  Unlike many other startups that use a large percentage of raised funds for who knows what... 25% of our total token supply (15M COINS) is immediately put in the COIN reserve in the smart contract.  ADDITIONALLY, 50% of the funds being raised are used for the reserves as well.  Assume we hit our full raise of $33M, that would be 16.5M.  Suppose we don't hit our full raise, any unsold tokens go into the COIN reserve.  With our buybacks (that also go into the reserve) and investor trading losses going into the reserves.  On day one of opening our doors, that's quite of bit of liquidity.  We will also scale the platform alongside its growth.  As previously mentioned, we will deploy user and trading limits to ensure the network is operating correctly before opening it to the world or putting any liquidity pools at risk.",False

Exchanges are the closest competition at this time.  But quite frankly, no one is executing investment trades in a completely decentralized process as we are... and exchanges do not have a mechanism to spend directly from your account... So we don’t have anyone to compare with directly... yet.  Coinvest is a trading platform (and market maker) where you make investment transactions and redeem profit from your trades through a process that is completely decentralized and handled by smart contracts.  Our difference and main advantage is that we are decentralized. Our investment process is managed by smart contracts including user investment data and funds. User funds are held in escrow (and not by a centralized third-party) by the smart contract until they are withdrawn by the user. Coinvest has no ability to touch or manage those funds including the liquidity pool that collateralize and back the investments. Once funds are withdrawn from a user’s portfolio, they can be stored in the wallet or spent using the built-in debit account.  Additionally the following: - Simplicity and Speed: No KYC requirements and validation as investments are virtual and we don't deal with Fiat currency - Convenience: Invest in multiple cryptonized assets without having to worry about storage, multiple wallets, multiple private keys, and transferring / supporting all coin protocols - Functionality: Coinvest enables flexible trading options to help you obtain the best value with buy, buy limit, short orders - Cost: Since Coinvest is automated and controlled by smart contracts, third-parties and overhead are removed which leads to lower cost transactions fees - Diversification: Coinvest enables you to curate your own personal index fund (In the future, we will allow users to invest into other user's personal index funds.)  For a complete and detailed comparison, we recommend you view pages 7 and 8 of our whitepaper at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ePI50Vd9MGdkPnH0KdVuhTOOSiqmnE7WteGDtG10GuE/edit?usp=sharing  If there are specific companies that you would like us to compare to, please let us know.

The bounty will run through our crowdsale in February.  As noted in our bounty thread, full bounty payments (token distribution) will be issued no more than two weeks after the end of crowdsale. Bounty will be divided among the participants proportionally to the amount of their stakes. Users must have an ETH ERC20 compatible wallet address to be eligible and accept COIN tokens.  Receiving Rewards: The total bounty pool is 300.000 COIN tokens to be distributed. If the Coinvest crowdsale does not reach the minimum goal of 1M USD (3.333 ETH) raised, all COIN tokens are automatically burned by a smart contract and the bounty will be considered void.  Following the crowdsale, stake data will be calculated and distributed in accordance to the following schedule:  First quarter after end of crowdsale - 25% Second quarter after end of crowdsale - 25% Third quarter after end of crowdsale - 25% Fourth quarter after end of crowdsale - 25%  This payout system has been devised to help protect the value of COIN by preventing mass selling once COIN is listed on exchanges.  This also ensures bounty participants have ample opportunity to observe the execution and performance of the company during the first year.

Our closest competition at this stage of the market are both centralized and decentralized exchanges.   First, Coinvest is a trading platform (and market maker) where you make investment transactions and redeem profit from your trades through a process that is completely decentralized and handled by smart contracts.  Our difference and main advantage is that we are decentralized. Our investment process is managed by smart contracts including user investment data and funds. User funds are held in escrow (and not by a centralized third-party) by the smart contract until they are withdrawn by the user. Coinvest has no ability to touch or manage those funds including the liquidity pool that collateralize and back the investments. Once funds are withdrawn from a user’s portfolio, they can be stored in the wallet or spent using the built-in debit account.  Additionally the following: - Simplicity and Speed: No KYC requirements and validation as investments are virtual and we don't deal with Fiat currency - Convenience: Invest in multiple cryptonized assets without having to worry about storage, multiple wallets, multiple private keys, and transferring / supporting all coin protocols - Functionality: Coinvest enables flexible trading options to help you obtain the best value with buy, buy limit, short orders - Cost: Since Coinvest is automated and controlled by smart contracts, third-parties and overhead are removed which leads to lower cost transactions fees - Diversification: Coinvest enables you to curate your own personal index fund (In the future, we will allow users to invest into other user's personal index funds.)  For a complete and detailed comparison, we recommend you view pages 7 and 8 of our whitepaper at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ePI50Vd9MGdkPnH0KdVuhTOOSiqmnE7WteGDtG10GuE/edit?usp=sharing",False

This Summer, we began our journey to execute the following mission:  “Creating decentralized tools for the world to seamlessly, securely, and safely invest and use cryptocurrencies.”  Since then, we built a team of experienced industry professionals to lead to the development of the COIN protocol and Coinvest smart contracts. Meanwhile, ensured legal compliance for all aspects of our company. Lastly, developed and executed our marketing and operation strategies to maximize our potential for both short and long-term success. As a result, we confidently released our website, whitepaper, protocol source code, and crowdsale in November.  Since publicly announcing three weeks ago, we have received a warm welcome from the community. This includes, but is not limited to, publicity, strong community development, partnership inquiries, and favorable demand in our private whitelist offering. As a data driven company, I’d like to share a few metrics from our community driven traction to-date:  900+ members on our Telegram channel 500+ Messages and 29,000+ Views on our BitcoinTalk ANN Thread 196 Facebook bounty campaign participants 216 Twitter bounty campaign participants 66 articles written by community members about Coinvest Over 100+ private whitelist registrations Favorable crowdsale ratings from sites such as ICOBench and TrackICO  These results are indicative of the hard work our team is incurring to support our mission. Additionally, aligns with the strong interest that we have received in our private whitelist offering. (Thus, leading us to believe that we will have no tokens available for the planned public pre-sale in January based upon current demand velocity). While positive, we recognize that this is merely just the beginning of our journey. We still have plenty of work ahead of us to execute and earn the world’s trust to participate in the industry.  Over the next month, you can expect the following from our team:  MVP release of the Coinvest APP (as an example of the frontend solutions developers can build to leverage the COIN protocol) Code audits of the COIN token and smart contracts by professional auditing firms Additional partnership announcements Begin recruitment engine to acquire additional engineering talent Increased community activity and involvement  We are still on target with our roadmap schedule and public launch in Q1 2018. As we move forward, we commit to continue providing updates on our progress. On behalf of our team, we’d like to thank you for your support thus far. For those that believe in our team, execution, and mission, we ask you to continue helping us spread the word. For those that would like to learn more about Coinvest and our team, please feel free to reach out to our team at hi@coinve.st and we’ll be more than happy to assist. We hope to earn your trust, support, and business in the future.  Much respect, D. Nam and the Coinvest team   This article is also located on our blog at:  https://goo.gl/ht3LEw",False

Hi Appraiser!  To ensure liquidity and collateral for the Coinvest ecosystem, we implement two reserves.  One is called the COIN reserve which is held and managed inside of the smart contract.  This reserve collects COINS from losses and distributes COINS for profits.  We've also created a secondary reserve to back up the COIN reserve for contigency and redundancy purposes.  In order to launch an exchange in the US, we'll have to acquire a license and ensure that we comply with all legal regulation.  Since our focus is on the platform, we want to spend 2018 ensuring that it is operating as expecting and then launch the exchange in 2019.    This is a very good idea! It is a pity that this will have to wait so long, but I understand that in order to do everything competently and qualitatively, it will take a lot of time and effort  Thanks carnitastaco!  Our smart contracts are available for test on GitHub and TestNet right now.  Our full MVP with the graphical user interface will be out in December for public beta.  We expect a full public release for Q1 of 2018.",False

First, Coinvest is a trading platform (and market maker) where you make investment transactions and redeem profit from your trades through a process that is completely decentralized and handled by smart contracts.  Our difference and main advantage is that we are decentralized. Our investment process is managed by smart contracts including user investment data and funds. User funds are held in escrow (and not by a centralized third-party) by the smart contract until they are withdrawn by the user. Coinvest has no ability to touch or manage those funds including the liquidity pool that collateralize and back the investments. Once funds are withdrawn from a user’s portfolio, they can be stored in the wallet or spent using the built-in debit account.  Additionally the following: - Simplicity and Speed: No KYC requirements and validation as investments are virtual and we don't deal with Fiat currency - Convenience: Invest in multiple cryptonized assets without having to worry about storage, multiple wallets, multiple private keys, and transferring / supporting all coin protocols - Functionality: Coinvest enables flexible trading options to help you obtain the best value with buy, buy limit, short orders - Cost: Since Coinvest is automated and controlled by smart contracts, third-parties and overhead are removed which leads to lower cost transactions fees - Diversification: Coinvest enables you to curate your own personal index fund (In the future, we will allow users to invest into other user's personal index funds.)  For a complete and detailed comparison, we recommend you view pages 7 and 8 of our whitepaper at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ePI50Vd9MGdkPnH0KdVuhTOOSiqmnE7WteGDtG10GuE/edit?usp=sharing   COSS As for COSS, they claim to be a one-stop shop for everything related to cryptocurrencies (with focus on businesses and developers).  This includes the ability to exchange, create smart contracts, act a payment gateway, enable commerce solutions, etc.  This is grand vision to operate in every aspect of cryptocurrencies under the COSS token ecosystem.  This is great, but variably different from Coinvest as we are solely focused on enabling users to buy, invest, and use cryptocurrencies.  Our platform doesn't assist with smart contract creation, merchant tools, etc.  While we aim to be a one-stop shop for cryptocurrencies, we are focused on users and retail investors.  Therefore our largest differences between Coinvest and COSS are: -  Audience and Mission:  They are focused on developers and businesses while we are focused on consumers and retail investors -  Decentralization:  Our order execution, fund management, and distributions are managed and executed by smart contracts (so there is no third-party involvement) -  Growth Potential:  In order for COSS to reach it's full potential, they have to create partnerships and engage in deals with developers and businesses to gain traction.  The sales cycles for this is much longer and more difficult.  For Coinvest to succeed, the company needs to acquire users which has less of a sales cycle, lower customer acquisition costs, and can gain traction through virality, referrals, etc. -  Experience and Credibility:  We have years of corporate experience with our team and advisors ranging from companies such as Microsoft, IBM, etc.    Ethos (Bitquence) Ethos is leveraging an API to settle trades with exchanges and acts as an intemediary (third-party) for handling your trades.  This is not prefered as now you have have to manage a portfolio with Ethos and trust Ethos and an exchange for a simple trade order.  Ethos has also not provided any technical specifications in their whitepaper as we have so we assume that they are still architecting their solution.  Therefore our largest differences between Coinvest and Ethos are: -  Decentralization:  Our order execution, fund management, and distributions are managed and executed by smart contracts (so there is no third-party involvement) -  Speed:  Order execution is instant on Coinvest vs. having to wait for settlement on an exchange through Ethos API's -  Experience and Credibility:  We have years of corporate experience with our team and advisors ranging from companies such as Microsoft, IBM, etc.  -  Transparency and Execution:  We've already documented our architecture and created our smart contracts (available for testing on GitHub) in just a few months time.  Ethos has not done any of this.  Execution > Ideas and slick marketing videos  To build on the execution argument, our full MVP will be released in the coming weeks. So we’ll be ahead of any players that are looking to get into this space.  Hopefully this helps clarify differences. If it doesn’t and you still have questions, please let us now.",False

In order to launch an exchange in the US, we'll have to acquire a license and ensure that we comply with all legal regulation.

What are your advantages over other of exchanges? will you have to pay a percentage of the transaction?  Most importantly, they have a very low percentage of the cost of translations. Also they have interesting bonus programs.  Hi Seidr, demaroz, and morgan4140!  Please note that we are not an exchange.  Coinvest is a trading platform (and market maker) where you make investment transactions and redeem profit from your trades through a process that is completely decentralized and handled by smart contracts.  Our difference and main advantage is that we are decentralized. Our investment process is managed by smart contracts including user investment data and funds. User funds are held in escrow (and not by a centralized third-party) by the smart contract until they are withdrawn by the user. Coinvest has no ability to touch or manage those funds including the liquidity pool that collateralize and back the investments. Once funds are withdrawn from a user’s portfolio, they can be stored in the wallet or spent using the built-in debit account.  Additionally the following: - Simplicity and Speed: No KYC requirements and validation as investments are virtual and we don't deal with Fiat currency - Convenience: Invest in multiple cryptonized assets without having to worry about storage, multiple wallets, multiple private keys, and transferring / supporting all coin protocols - Functionality: Coinvest enables flexible trading options to help you obtain the best value with buy, buy limit, short orders - Cost: Since Coinvest is automated and controlled by smart contracts, third-parties and overhead are removed which leads to lower cost transactions fees - Diversification: Coinvest enables you to curate your own personal index fund (In the future, we will allow users to invest into other user's personal index funds.)  For a complete and detailed comparison, we recommend you view pages 7 and 8 of our whitepaper at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ePI50Vd9MGdkPnH0KdVuhTOOSiqmnE7WteGDtG10GuE/edit?usp=sharing  Thanks!",False

Coinvest earns a $4.99 flat rate trading revenue fee for each trade.  While it may seem low, please note the potential of growth based upon transaction volume and every buy / sell order.  For example, E-trade has trading revenues of over $400M annually.  While we don't expect to be e-trade anytime soon, we believe that we can slowly scale the Coinvest businesses to significant revenue as the popularity of cryptocurrency increases.  Additionally, we plan to introduce other methods for additional revenue streams including margin accounts, etc.  Please note that our overhead is significantly lower than traditional companies in this space as many responsibilities are handled by autonomous computer code and smart contracts.  Advancement in technology is replacing jobs that were once handled by people and we are one example of that.  ",False

I'm just trying to fantasize a bit on this subject, than Coinvest may be useful to me.  So, let's say I'm a portfolio investor. I determined, for example, ten coins, which are interesting to me and determined the specific weight of each of them in my investment portfolio. Conditionally I decided that each of the coins I should have 10% of the volume calculated in dollars. But we know how crazy volatility is in the market. Therefore, the specific weight of coins relative to the dollar will change daily. Each of the selected coins may become cheaper or vice versa may rise in price to the USD.  And how can I be if I'm not ready to track these currency races everyday? (If I'm ready it is, then I'm not a portfolio investor, but rather a trader at an exchange  .) Here smart contracts come to the rescue.  By means of smart contracts on your platform, you can specify an algorithm in which the specific weight to the dollar will be constantly reduced to the set parameters of 10 coins of 10% with respect to USD. So, such an algorithm will allow you to fix a profit in a currency that showed growth and reallocate the asset into currencies that look oversold.",False

Therefore, open-source is the best way to achieve this.   Our protocol and tools will always be open source so that developers can use and build on top of them.

Please note that we are not an exchange.  Coinvest is a trading platform (and market maker) where you make investment transactions and redeem profit from your trades through a process that is completely decentralized and handled by smart contracts.  Our difference and main advantage is that we are decentralized. Our investment process is managed by smart contracts including user investment data and funds. User funds are held in escrow (and not by a centralized third-party) by the smart contract until they are withdrawn by the user. Coinvest has no ability to touch or manage those funds including the liquidity pool that collateralize and back the investments. Once funds are withdrawn from a user’s portfolio, they can be stored in the wallet or spent using the built-in debit account.  Additionally the following: - Simplicity and Speed: No KYC requirements and validation as investments are virtual and we don't deal with Fiat currency - Convenience: Invest in multiple cryptonized assets without having to worry about storage, multiple wallets, multiple private keys, and transferring / supporting all coin protocols - Functionality: Coinvest enables flexible trading options to help you obtain the best value with buy, buy limit, short orders - Cost: Since Coinvest is automated and controlled by smart contracts, third-parties and overhead are removed which leads to lower cost transactions fees - Diversification: Coinvest enables you to curate your own personal index fund (In the future, we will allow users to invest into other user's personal index funds.)  For a complete and detailed comparison, we recommend you view pages 7 and 8 of our whitepaper at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ePI50Vd9MGdkPnH0KdVuhTOOSiqmnE7WteGDtG10GuE/edit?usp=sharing  Thanks!",False

Please view:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2381017.msg24772974#msg24772974  Smart contracts are extremely valuble for the financial industry in our business.  For example, they can help us: -  Streamline and improve financing efficiencies for buyers, suppliers and institutions -  Streamline post-trade processes, removing duplicative processes executed by each counterparty for verifying trades and conducting appropriate trade events -  Provide accurate, transparent financial data recording to improvide data integrity  As a result provide reduced costs, faster / greater liquidity of financial assets and increased market stability.  Other industries are leveraging smart contracts to eliminate third-parties, reduce costs and increase efficiency as well.  Unfortunately there are few good examples in the blockchain space today as it is still early... We hope to break that mold.  Thanks!",False

Once funds are withdrawn from a user’s portfolio, they can be stored in the wallet or spent using the built-in debit account.

We are a trading platform run and managed by smart contracts.  Consider us a decentralized E-Trade for cryptocurrencies.  Our difference and main advantage is that we are decentralized. Our investment process is managed by smart contracts including user investment data and funds.  User funds are held in escrow by the smart contract until they are withdrawn by the user. Coinvest has no ability to touch or manage those funds including the liquidity pool that collateralize and back the investments. Once funds are withdrawn from a user’s portfolio, they can be stored in the wallet or spent using the built-in debit account.  Additionally the following: -  Diversification:  Coinvest enables you to curate your own personal index fund (In the future, we will allow users to invest into other user's personal index funds.) -  Simplicity and Speed:  No KYC requirements and validation as we don't deal with Fiat currency -  Convenience:   Invest in multiple cryptonized assets without having to worry about storage, multiple wallets, multiple private keys, and transferring / supporting all coin protocols -  Functionality:  Coinvest enables flexible trading options to help you obtain the best value with buy, buy limit, short orders -  Cost:  Since Coinvest is automated and controlled by smart contracts, third-parties and overhead are removed which leads to lower cost transactions fees  For a complete and detailed comparison, we recommend you view pages 7 and 8 of our whitepaper at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ePI50Vd9MGdkPnH0KdVuhTOOSiqmnE7WteGDtG10GuE/edit?usp=sharing  Thanks!",False

Investors benefit from value appreciation in the COIN itself.  Unfortunately we are not a security and do not offer profit sharing, dividends, or returns for investors.  However, 50% of company net profit will be leveraged to replenish the COIN reserve in the smart contract and for buybacks of COIN in order to ensure price stability and token asset holder value.  As more participants join the ecosystem, the community rapidly increases in size through network effects. As the overall ecosystem grows, transaction volumes increase requiring the need for COIN token purchases to fund smart contract execution. In turn, the value of the COIN token will appreciate organically through demand. But most importantly, community transactions increase and become perpetual.",False

As previously noted, we vary greatly with our competition. More specifically, no other platform enables you to curate your own personal index fund. (In the future, we will allow users to invest into other user's personal index funds as well)  Our largest advantage is that we are decentralized. Our investment process is managed by smart contracts including user investment data and funds.  User funds are held in escrow by the smart contract until they are withdrawn by the user. Coinvest has no ability to touch or manage those funds including the liquidity pool that collateralize and back the investments. Once funds are withdrawn from a user’s portfolio, they can be stored in the wallet or spent using the built-in debit account.  For a complete and detailed comparison, we recommend you view pages 7 and 8 of our whitepaper at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ePI50Vd9MGdkPnH0KdVuhTOOSiqmnE7WteGDtG10GuE/edit?usp=sharing",False

Our fee schedule is $4.99 upon any trade order within an investment portfolio. This is significantly lower and more predictable than the fees incurred with competing exchanges.  For example, popular exchanges charge anywhere from .25 - 3% on all transactions regardless of amount or volume.  As a result, a $5,000 order and 1% fee can result in an expense of $50.  Since eveything is autonomous and controlled by smart contracts, we have considerably less overhead than our competition and can offer significantly less fees to support the platform.  Company profits enable us to purchase additional COIN in order to help provide price stability in the market as well.  As for security, our source code will be open-sourced and available for the community to validate and review.  We are using the support of the community (with bug bounties) and will engage two professional security firms to audit our code to ensure the security of the platform.  From a technical perspective, we've partnered with Civic for authentication and will also offer 2FA as an option.  We'll also employ SSL across all public facing channels, etc.  We use AWS but also deploy firewalls to protect databases, etc.  There a more technical things we are doing, but these are just a few examples.",False

So we vary greatly with our competition. More specifically, no other platform enables you to curate your own personal index fund. (In the future, we will allow users to invest into the personal index funds)  Our largest advantage is that we are decentralized. Our investment process is managed by smart contracts including user investment data and funds.  User funds are held in escrow by the smart contract until they are withdrawn by the user. Coinvest has no ability to touch or manage those funds including the liquidity pool that collateralize and back the investments. Once funds are withdrawn from a user’s portfolio, they can be stored in the wallet or spent using the built-in debit account.  For a complete and detailed comparison, we recommend you view pages 7 and 8 of our whitepaper at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ePI50Vd9MGdkPnH0KdVuhTOOSiqmnE7WteGDtG10GuE/edit?usp=sharing  Thanks!",False

We are determined to democratize cryptocurrencies by creating tools to provide mechanisms for consumers to seamlessly, securely, and safely invest and use cryptocurrencies.   Coinvest is creating a future where users have one platform, one wallet, and one token (COIN), that enables anyone to create a digital investment portfolio to invest in multiple cryptocurrencies. Thereby reducing the cost, risk, and complexity associated with investing in cryptocurrencies on centralized exchanges or investment funds. Centralized third parties that are often needed in traditional investment use cases are replaced with smart contracts that act as autonomous agents and programmatically compensate all users, investors, and owners within the entire Coinvest ecosystem.  Please visit https://coinve.st for information regarding Coinvest and our upcoming crowdsale.  Today’s announcement represents the beginning of a much larger and broader vision.  We are excited to work with the community to create the default platform that will help users seamlessly invest and use cryptocurrencies.
