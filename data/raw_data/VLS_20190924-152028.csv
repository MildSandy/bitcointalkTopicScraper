VLS tokens will not be issued. Be aware of fake accounts and websites!       WHAT IS VALUS? ▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂  VALUS is a blockchain platform which will be based on Ethereum platform. VALUS will allow customers to verify items through QR code and they will get basic information about scanned items (VALUS Verify). In a case of buying an item, they can register ownership of that item and for that customers will be rewarded with VLS tokens (VALUS Ownership). If they are often buying items online, they can check if the website where they make a purchase is trustworthy. Previous customers can give their experience and also trademarks can verify that website (VALUS Websites). Customers can also help trademarks to reduce the number of manufacturers and stores that sell not genuine items. For such actions, customers are rewarded with VLS tokens (VALUS Stores). VALUS allows trademarks to add items into a blockchain. With that they make items more secure, and also customers can verify these items. Trademarks can create a safer purchase for customers by verifying the websites or retailers that sell their genuine items. Retailers will know if the items they sell are genuine and the trademark can verify retailers that sell genuine items.   VALUS VIDEO ▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂     PROBLEM ON THE MARKET ▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂  The biggest problem on the market is that there is a lot of fake items on the market. These items can be fakes such as luxury watches, luxury handbags, jewellery and many items we daily use in our lives such as sports items. Also, some websites pretend that they are selling genuine items but they are not. Other websites scam people in a way that they get customers’ money but never deliver an item to the customers.   VISION ▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂  Our vision is that we become a platform for verifying items, websites and stores. We want to disable everyone who sells fake items and also those who scam customers with fake websites.   HOW DOES IT WORK? ▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂            CUSTOMERS ▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂      The core of VALUS will be, that customers can check items through QR code. Customers get basic information such as an image of this item, name, who made this item, when the item was created, serial number, origin, previous owners (if applicable), if the item is stolen or not and other history of this item (VALUS Verify).  When they buy an item, customers have a chance to register ownership of the item that really belongs to them. In case a registered item is stolen, a customer can report the item and mark it as stolen. That means that if someone wants to check the status of such item, it will be seen on VALUS platform that this item is stolen (VALUS Ownership).  Customers will have an option to check if the website where they make a purchase is trustworthy or not. Trademarks can verify the websites that sell genuine items and also previous customers can give reviews/experiences about the websites (VALUS Websites).  Trademarks can also verify stores that sell genuine items. If customers know where the fake items are being sold they can report such store and for that, they are rewarded (VALUS Stores).   TRADEMARKS ▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂     Trademarks will add items into a blockchain. In such way they make items more secure and also customer can verify these items. Trademarks help customers to make safer and better purchase by verifying websites and stores which sell genuine items. Trademarks also get reports from customers about suspicious websites and stores. If trademarks establish that reported websites or store are hurting customers, these websites or stores can be shutdown.   RETAILERS ▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂     A retailer can get a reputation on the market from the trademark based on verification. Customers are more secure when they make their purchase because they know that a verified retailer sells genuine items.   REWARDING SYSTEM FOR CUSTOMERS ▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂  Customers can get VLS tokens for registering items (VALUS Ownership), for reporting suspicious websites (VALUS Websites) and for reporting brick and mortar shops (VALUS Stores).   ROADMAP ▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂  The VALUS platform will be realised in Q1 2018. It will allow customers to scan items through iOS an Android application. A customer will be able to just scan the items from trademarks that use our platform. The VALUS Ownership will be available in Q3 2018. After ownership, we will start with VALUS Website. The first function of VALUS Website (in Q4 2018) will be that a customer can verify whether the website is trustworthy. Reviewing and rating of websites will be available in Q1 2019, while the last function for Blacklisting websites will be available in the end of Q1 2019. After that, we will start developing functions for verifying and reporting brick and mortar stores.          CROWDSALE ▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂  Crowdsale STARTS 13. October 2017 12.00 UTC; ENDS 10. November 2017 20.00 UTC*. *Date depends on ethereum blocks   Token Distribution and Fund Distribution ▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂          The amount of VLS tokens will be based on invested funds from contributors.
