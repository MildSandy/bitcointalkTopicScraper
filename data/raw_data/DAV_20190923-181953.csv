Presale Early 2018,"   DAV has restricted US purchasers from the token sale to work to avoid being subject to the uncertain regulatory environment in the US. We are working closely with the Swiss regulators (FINMA) to set DAV up for long-term success. In fact, our cooperation with FINMA is why we delayed the token sale to June 11; a move which we believe will help DAV operate in a more stable environment and help to avoid this kind of unforeseen future complication. We expect to follow FINMA guidelines and continue with the token sale subject to FINMA.  Whitelisting does not guarantee an allocation in the sale. It guarantees you'll be on the list of people who can participate. The sale is still on a first come first serve basis and will be closed as soon as the hard cap is met. We do however set individual caps and a gas price limit to ensure as many people as possible will be able to participate.

DAV takes the P2P information transfer capabilities of the internet and the P2P value transfer made possible by the blockchain (in this case, via the DAV token) and brings them to their next logical conclusion, enabling P2P transfer of physical goods. Consider this scenario: a package needs to be delivered using a drone. The parties involved include a sender, recipient, drone operator, goods insurer, and arbitrator. The blockchain, and specifically smart contracts, enable us to conduct these kinds of transactions P2P, directly between these parties, without needing an intermediary, thus reducing costs to all parties while providing them with the assurance they need to conduct business without necessarily trusting each other beforehand.  https://dav.network/",False

Presale Early 2018,"Hello DAV Community!  We are pleased to announce that our presale is proceeding nicely. We have closed and collected 24,000 ETH in presale contracts so far, with several offers outstanding. The markets have shifted to a generally positive trend, which is decidedly helpful. Overall everything is looking up!  We also wanted to give you an important legal regulatory update.  During the time that DAV has been making exciting public announcements about the technology and our expanding alliances, DAV’s legal team has been quietly and diligently working in the background with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (the Swiss regulators known as FINMA) concerning the DAV token. At this point, while our discussions are required to be confidential, we feel hopeful.  Based on an expected review time, we hope to receive a formal letter from FINMA within the next couple of weeks.  Such a letter will provide DAV with improved regulatory certainty for its public token sale, something we feel could make the DAV project stand out in the current environment. The letter represents a significant opportunity to have a formal assessment of the token and thus we have decided to push back the start date for our token sale to June 11, 2018.  We know how excited you are about contributing to DAV and we share that excitement! The DAV team is committed to executing the best project possible, and we feel this change will help us and our community realize that goal.  Notably, many projects have cancelled their public sales in favour of presales that involve 100% of the token allotment. The DAV Foundation remains committed to offering a significant portion of the token sale to the public, despite the considerable legal overhead that public sales introduce. We feel this is the best approach towards launching a truly open, public, decentralized network, and thus we still intend to halt the presale upon reaching our internal ceiling, regardless of the timing of the public token sale.  We are very grateful for your support, and will keep you apprised along the way.  With much respect,  The DAV Team",False

Presale Early 2018,"The first professional digital rating agency DigRate has assigned A2 investment attractiveness score to DAV Network – medium-to-high probability of long-term investment return, the level of project development potential is above average.  The DAV Network project aims to create a platform that will allow anyone to buy or sell services in the decentralized market of unmanned vehicles. The DAV platform will integrate into any autonomous vehicles, allowing them to exchange information and carry out transactions with each other using the DAV digital currency.  Modules created by Dav Network already have working prototypes and will allow to estimate the pace of the project development in real time, as well as testing some of the functionality. The project team presented a detailed road map, an analysis of the competitive landscape and current market trends, as well as a well thought out business model. The project developers themselves and the advisory board members are representatives of large, universally recognized world companies (NASA, UPS, Bancor, Google) of various fields and leave no doubt about their serious intentions and possibilities to implement such goals.  Despite the undoubted competence of developers, some aspects raise questions. For example, the mechanism for protecting the token price from possible devaluation is not thought out sufficiently. The legal side of the ICO is not thought out, including the regulation of investments made during the ICO and the risks of conducting ICO. There are no main legal documents. Gaps in the legal part of the project may jeopardize its implementation. However, the project team claims that the legal side of the project is being worked out by well-known law firms and will be published closer to the ICO start date.  Despite the above mentioned disadvantages, the project is one of the most popular and expected among the global crypto community. DigRate analysts believe that the success of the project and the speed of its development will directly depend on the pace of technology development in the autonomous vehicles sector, as well as the regulatory rules of this sector of some states and the ability of project developers to adapt to these rules. It is important for investors to understand that it takes several years to implement a project of this scale and the business model of the project is designed for long-term investments.  DAV Network is a very relevant and in-demand solution in the field of transport, supported by the platform prototype. Most likely that the platform’s services will be highly in demand, and the project will be scaled rapidly.  Pros and cons of the project, as well as our recommendations, can be found in our report. https://digrate.com/en/ico/dav-network",False

Presale Early 2018,"ICO Analysis: DAV (Decentralized Autonomous Vehicles)  Verdict The DAV network will connect self-driving vehicles (trucks, cars, rovers, drones) to everyone on that network, enabling discovery, communication and token transactions. Consumers can purchase services (taxi, package pick up/delivery) with DAV tokens. Vehicles owners and charging stations on the network will receive DAV tokens for the services they provide. An entire network of autonomous vehicles will be available for consumers to deliver items or transport people anywhere through the use of the DAV token. There is no doubt that autonomous vehicles will be part of our future and DAV is positioning itself to become a major player in the industry.  Risks     The $38 million ICO market cap can be seen as slightly on the high side. Fair or not, many investors look for an ICO to fall within the $10 million to $35 million range when viewing token metrics due to perceived profit and growth potential. -1.25     Mass adoption and implementation will take time, which can lead to impatience for many of the new and inexperienced investors flooding into the crypto market. -1     Solutions are currently underway for scalability issues on the Ethereum platform, but not yet complete. This could result in DAV needing to look at other platforms for use if not resolved in time. -1.5  Growth Potential     An ICO with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is obviously a much surer bet than investing in an ICO without one. DAV has a fully functioning testnet and identity generation already in use. Also, the Missions app is available for use and can be viewed at missions.io. +2.75     In comparison to many ICOs currently in development, DAV has a large team experienced in leadership, development and marketing. Having advisers to help an ICO become successful is currently the norm and DAV is awash with all-star advisers that come with experience, influence, and expertise in their respected fields. +4     Companies that seek out and obtain partners within their industry can instantly receive a leg up on the competition. DAV has not only established selective partnerships but has created an alliance with members of the autonomous vehicle industry. +3     Being first to market while having success is a huge advantage over the potential competition. While competitors may learn from their successes and failures, DAV will have the advantage of already having established valuable relationships within the industry and having created brand recognition. +1.5  Disposition DAV will enable consumers, service and maintenance providers, third-party developers and investors to be a part of a new economy by monetizing the transportation system of tomorrow. The question isn’t if this technology will be implemented in transportation/delivery services, but how soon will mass adoption occur? The DAV team, advisers, alliance and partners are ahead of the curve and looking to cash in when it does. DAV receives a rating of 7.50 out of 10.

Presale Early 2018,"DAV is a framework of open-source software, open-source hardware, and a free decentralized marketplace where anyone can buy and sell autonomous transportation services using the DAV token. Our technology consists of three major components:  Decentralized Discovery  DAV allows autonomous vehicles to discover each other, as well as service providers, and clients around them. DAV implements decentralized node discovery using a peer-to-peer protocol that does not rely on a central server. Instead, nodes are listed in a distributed hash table which can be accessed in an extremely efficient way.  Communication Protocol  DAV defines a library of standardized communication protocols for various transportation scenarios. This communication is divided into two groups:      on-blockchain communication done directly by calling smart contracts and through events emitted by those smart contracts      off-blockchain communication done peer-to-peer using DAV’s protocols   Trustless Cooperation Tools  Trustless cooperation between buyers and sellers of transportation services is achieved using a series of specialized smart contracts. These smart contracts enable multi-party contracts between buyer, seller, and when needed, between arbitrator, insurer, and others. These contracts are tied in directly to the DAV token, guaranteeing financial resolution for transactions between multiple parties without requiring any pre-established trust.",False
