Last year was a time of record-setting discoveries and sales for diamonds.  In January, Gem Diamonds (LSE: GEMD) unearthed its largest diamond to date: a 910-carat rough stone in Lesotho.  The spectacular stone then sold at auction in March for US$40 million.  In February, Sotheby‚Äôs (NYSE: BID) brought a rare 102.34-carat white diamond to auction, and the gigantic gem sold for more than US$30 million.  Mid-year, Russian miner Alrosa (MCX: ALRS) sold its most expensive stone, the 51-carat Dynasty diamond.  As mined colored gems become more valuable and more scarce, investors will see the emergence of more lab-grown diamonds.  While synthetic diamonds have been around for a while, 2018 was a catalyst year for the sector, with the launch of the first fashion jewelry line comprised entirely of lab-grown diamonds.

The diamond is more than just aesthetically beautiful‚Äîit‚Äôs an enduring symbol of love, romance, and commitment. Besides, there are also financial advantages in buying diamonds for investment purposes based on the fact that diamonds are physical commodities.

Amid uncertainties of the world financial market investors often fail to make the right choice but it is evident that control over one‚Äôs own assets is the baseline for keeping and augmenting capital.  What kind of investments can meet this demand and remain sufficiently reliable and profitable?  The majority of investors have their eyes fixed on eternal commodities such as gemstones and to be more precise ‚Äì diamonds.  Our ICO is protected by diamonds and when investing in Reger Diamond you invest in diamonds but the question remains why you should invest in ICO and not directly in diamonds kept in a bank safe and we have simple answers.  INNOVATION. A few years ago it seemed virtually impossible to become a diamond investor as diamond business is a very closed one, as they say, ‚ÄúMembers Only‚Äù. But today through innovative blockchain technology and Reger Diamond this opportunity is presented to you even when you stay in the comfort of your home or lazily sipping your cappuccino in a caf√©.  AVOIDING RISKS. Some investors may run into risks of purchasing uncertified diamonds either through indecent vendors or just through ignorance and may end up losing money or facing a lawsuit. It is not very common that each investor is aware of legal details such as standards for certification of precious stones. Reger Diamond has a team of professionals in diamond business and therefore all stones have a trustworthy and high-quality international certification (GIA, HRD for instance) which protects you from possible risks of diamond business.  EXTRA EXPENDITURE. An investor needs to take care about the safety of purchased stones. It is recommended that you insure the stones and keep them in special bank cells or safes. By investing into our ICO you do not need that kind of expenditure and on top of it acquire extra bonus points from investing in diamonds.  HIGH threshold for entry into the market. Diamond business has a very high threshold for market entry reaching billions of dollars because of its restrictiveness, high cost of equipment and raw material, high wages for qualified professionals.  In Reger Diamond you can be a diamond investor by putting in up from 100 dollars and enter a hitherto restricted and unattainable business which opens up for you through blockchain technology.

The whole concept of investing is all about turning an existing amount of money into a bigger pile over time. If this can be done in the shortest amount of time possible, all the better.

Cryptocurrency is a method of payment created and used with the help of crypto protocols. Cryptocurrency has at its core the technology of blockchain - a chain of blocks with data which cannot be forged or tampered with. Database on all the transactions and wallets is decentralized and accessible by all the network participants. It has to be underlined that there is no single centralized server.  Token is a cryptocurrency issued by a company in a centralized way with no mining involved. Before launching an ICO, a startup issues a certain number of tokens to cover its needs. Investors interested in the project can use their funds for buying tokens. Information on investment in the project will be recorded in the blockchain and protected by a crypto protocol. In that sense coins and tokens have the same roots.  There are two types of tokens.  Utility token (useful token) is a domestic digital coin which provides certain advantages while using products of a given company. Investment is a must in order to simplify use of services or otherwise you must accept conditions for using this product. The simplest example provided NOT by the world of blockchain is an internal game token.  Utility tokens are purchased exclusively for internal payments, exchanges between users, fees for services and the like. Therefore, users do not try to reap benefits from selling these tokens.  Security token (investment token) is a digital asset purchased with a purpose to make a profit in future.  Our company, Reger Diamond, has issued the RDS (security) token. Your benefits:  Those who invested in this token expect to make a profit. The main function of RDS token is a gainful investment. Token holder makes the profit on behalf of the third party.

HPHT technology and diamonds made on its basis  Based on the results of previously conducted works, we have improved and introduced into production the technology of processing of diamonds using high temperatures and high pressure (HRHT) to change the color, gentrification of ""low quality"" (brown) diamonds, thereby significantly increasing their market value.  During this treatment, the crystal is heated to temperatures above 2,100¬∞C. In order to prevent the diamond from turning into graphite, it is exposed a very high stabilizing pressure.  The brown hue of certain types of diamond is determined by the presence of plastic deformations or defects of the crystal lattice. HPHT processing technology can influence the lattice defects and thus discolor the crystal, without altering its general natural crystalline nature. Usually, this process takes a few minutes. Subsequently, the crystal must be cut again in order to remove the matte (damaged) surface and make it brilliant again.  The final result of such treatment largely depends on the initial characteristics and the type of the processed crystal. Currently, starting the processing of the crystal brown, it is possible to achieve any shade in the range of bright yellow and yellow-gray to pink and blue, as well as colorless. HPHT diamonds are natural diamonds that have undergone a unique irreversible process that improves their color.  We'll tell you more about the HPHT process in the next posts.

However, it is rare that diamond owners are aware of what precisely makes one diamond better than any other. When it comes time to sell a diamond, it is important to understand these differences so that you get a fair deal. A diamond‚Äôs worth is based on a number of various factors. One of the most important among them is Diamond Certificate. It is the diamond grade assigned to a particular stone after a thorough evaluation, a professionally unbiased examination which authenticates the attributes of a diamond. The Diamond Certificate provides a careful validation of the color, carat weight, clarity, along with the exact measurements of the diamond. GIA (Gemological Institute of America) and AGS (American Gemological Society) are the gold standards for the diamond industry. The qualities listed in the certificate - the 4 C‚Äôs: Colour, Carat, Clarity, and Cut - are the most famous criteria when we speak about diamonds, so you might have already heard of them. Apart from the 4 C‚Äôs, you have to pay attention to the culet - the bottom point of a diamond. Usually slightly flat or faceted, the culet affects the light performance of a diamond. The culet size and angle are two main factors, which can have a significant effect on the value of a diamond. The ideal culet should be positioned in the exact center of the bottom of the diamond and should be of a small size. Angle deviation and increase in size both adversely affect the diamond. At Reger Diamond, we sell diamond jewelry of high quality with wide range of products, of different size and shape. You can check them out on our website https://bit.ly/2qlHC8j",False

Therefore, today we decided to answer this question in more detail and explain how diamonds can protect ICO and what advantages a protected ICO can have in comparison with an ordinary one.  Before buying our token you should bear in mind that RDS Token has actually two rates: nominal (listed) value with an added value received through smart ‚Äì contracts, and a market value.  1. the nominal value is the value guaranteed by available assets and financial means generated by active business. 2. the market value is the value determined by market demand for RDS Token on crypto exchanges, which may drastically differ from the nominal value with a tendency to value gain.  All the investments into the project will be used in the production of diamonds and jewelry items. Having said this, it is to be noted that your money is stocked in diamonds thus providing serious protection for your funds, because diamond value over the last 70 years dropped only twice- in 1945 and 2008, in contrast to fluctuations in currency rates. This asset firmly keeps its head above water never sinking to the bottom even at times of financial storms.  Therefore, when buying RDS Token you invest your money in diamonds and by doing so you acquire a steady and reliable business which will bring you a solid profit. It is in this way that diamonds protect our ICO and your investment with their inherent reliability and nominal value which keeps on growing.  The reason why it is more profitable to invest in ICO and not directly in diamonds kept in a bank, will be dealt with in a coming post.  üíéIf interested in diamond business visit our media  https://bit.ly/2qlHC8j https://twitter.com/CoinReger https://www.instagram.com/reger_diamond/ https://www.facebook.com/regerdiamondico/ https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2129125 #regerdiamond #regerdiamondico  Your Reger Diamond‚Äôs Team",False

The company has been on the market since 2009.  To increase the capacity and reach new markets in January 2018 in the Czech Republic the company was established planning to produce diamonds and jewelry and take them to the mass market. The company came out on ICO. The main task of the ICO project of the company Reger Diamond was a token that is understandable in all respects for the investor. Immediately after announcing the creation of Reger Diamond Security Token, it was an increased interest of investors.  Developers of RDS Token promise stability and gradual predictable growth. Therefore, according to the smart-contract, the investor receives 20% of the profit at the end of the year after investment of funds. In the next year there will be another 20% and so on.  The rest growth is possible after the coin release at the crypto currency exchange, and it will be an additional income for the investor, and only the investor decides whether to sell tokens on the stock exchange, or receive further stable income.

One of the primary reasons why people invest in cryptocurrency ICO is to make a healthy profit. That is only understandable, as the whole concept of investing is all about turning an existing amount of money into a bigger pile of money over time. If this can be done in the shortest amount of time possible, all the better. As we have seen in the past, a lot of cryptocurrency ICO tokens appreciate in value after the sale is over, which makes them quite attractive to investors all over the world. Most projects raise the amount of money needed in a few hours or days. Missing out of these opportunities would result in missing out on massive profits ‚Äì or losses ‚Äì in most cases. Missing out on losses is not a bad thing, but the potential for profits is certainly there where cryptocurrency ICOs are concerned. Quite a few of these recent cryptocurrency ICOs have been overly successful. For instance: Play2Live, Travala.com, Sharpay.

As well as being a financing method, ICOs obviously pose risks with uncertainty about their regulation.  However, there are countries which set an example in overcoming legal and regulatory issues. In Belarus, President Alexander Lukashenko, signed a decree which legalizes cryptocurrencies and ICOs.  The United States government has treated cryptocurrencies with a rather slow approach in comparison with some of the world‚Äôs other major powers ‚ÄìChina, for example, set off a sweeping set of bans on cryptocurrency last September.  Switzerland emerges as a global hub for initial coin offerings. The flourishing ICO industry is improving Switzerland‚Äôs business-friendly reputation.  Japan, in spite of a recent digital currency theft, has not been deterred from planning to widely use cryptocurrencies as legal tender.  The biggest benefit to come out of the unprecedented rise in cryptocurrency is the coming introduction of better cryptocurrency regulations.  ‚ÄùSuch regulation will help calm the fears of potential investors and provide a stronger foundation for future investment growth‚Äù, says Alexei Lebedev, co-founder of Reger Diamond, a company that has joined the ranks of ICOs with its unique RDS token.

As with any investment, you need to keep focused on the long-term viability and do the following:  1) Start small and dream big. Investing is a hot topic that many people talk about but very few do. More than saving money, you should learn to invest. Getting started is more simple than it sounds. 2) Return on investment. You will not be bored, as this space moves at light speed and keeps growing every day. The cryptocurrency space has boomed and has convinced even the most skeptical actors to join in. 3) Have a vision. This might sound patronizing but have you developed a financial plan? Have you set a financial goal for yourself? It‚Äôs never too late to start. 4) Always diversify. One last secret to consider: diversify your investment portfolio. Spread your investment across multiple assets such as a piggy bank, stocks, commodities, real estate, bank deposits, and cryptocurrency. Digital currencies are a volatile investment, but with more experience, you might find it compelling to research and invest in other reputable cryptocurrencies as well.

And for ""wealthy"" people there is a chance to buy tokens and use them to get a discount in terms of purchasing diamonds.  I quoted ""wealthy"" not by chance. I don't really think that diamonds are affordable only for rich people like those who own millions. Just look around, so many women wearing diamonds: tiny, middle sized and huge.

HPHT technology and diamonds made on its basis  Based on the results of previously conducted works, we have improved and introduced into production the technology of processing of diamonds using high temperatures and high pressure (HRHT) to change the color, gentrification of ""low quality"" (brown) diamonds, thereby significantly increasing their market value.  During this treatment, the crystal is heated to temperatures above 2,100¬∞C. In order to prevent the diamond from turning into graphite, it is exposed a very high stabilizing pressure.  The brown hue of certain types of diamond is determined by the presence of plastic deformations or defects of the crystal lattice. HPHT processing technology can influence the lattice defects and thus discolor the crystal, without altering its general natural crystalline nature. Usually, this process takes a few minutes. Subsequently, the crystal must be cut again in order to remove the matte (damaged) surface and make it brilliant again.  The final result of such treatment largely depends on the initial characteristics and the type of the processed crystal. Currently, starting the processing of the crystal brown, it is possible to achieve any shade in the range of bright yellow and yellow-gray to pink and blue, as well as colorless. HPHT diamonds are natural diamonds that have undergone a unique irreversible process that improves their color.  We'll tell you more about the HPHT process in the next posts.

Today we‚Äôd like to tell you more about prospects of jewelry with diamonds.  Prospects for the market of jewelry with diamonds are associated, first of all, with the overall economic development.  - According to the current macroeconomic forecast of the IMF, in 2017‚Äì2018, the world economy is expected to accelerate in relation to 2016 (3.16% in 2016, 3.4% in 2017, and 3.6% in 2018). The forecast for the main countries consuming diamond jewelry is generally favorable: despite the fact that China is predicting a slowdown in the economic growth rate, the US and India are expected to accelerate their pace of economic development.  - Given that the United States is one of the main consumers of diamond jewelry, it is expected that consumer activity in this country will continue in the next two years. Regarding other countries ‚Äî large consumers of jewelry with diamonds: according to the forecast of the IMF, the forecast of real GDP growth of the UAE will be 2.5% in 2017; Hong Kong -3.7% of European countries -0.7‚Äì1.5%. Accordingly, there is every reason to assume that the demand for jewelry with diamonds in the coming years will remain stable.  - The foundation for the success of the diamond industry, in the long run, is the extent to which the consumers will give preference to diamonds in comparison with the constantly increasing number of other luxury goods competing with them in the market.  Diamond is the rarest and the most expensive of all precious stones and time is the only a factor that increases its value. Throughout the whole world‚Äôs history, they continue to attract people with their truly magical beauty and appeal remaining a symbol of beauty and wealth, and success.  Investments in the real business sector ‚Äî diamonds and diamond jewelry ‚Äî are ensured by a high level of their safety, liquidity, and sustainability.  You can find more details about RDC plans and prospects in the Business plan on the official website: https://regerdiamond.com/  We are going to start our main token sale very soon.

The diamond industry is global, but there are different regions historically strong in different segments of the diamond price chain.  Russia is considered to be the largest country for diamond production in terms of value with a rate of 35%, followed by Botswana with 22%, Canada ‚Äî 14%, Angola ‚Äî 7%, South Africa ‚Äî 7%, Namibia ‚Äî 5% and Australia ‚Äî 3%.  India continues to accumulate a stake as a global cutting and polishing bastion. The US and China are likely to remain the largest diamond jewelry consumption markets, and India is expected to be one of the fastest growing markets.  The long-term prospects for the diamond market remain positive. It is expected that the supply of rough diamonds will maintain a close balance with demand within the next three years.  According to Bain & Company forecasts, the demand for rough diamonds will recover from the recent recession and return to the long-term growth pattern from 2% to 5% per year on average, relying on strong fundamentals in the US and the continued growth of the middle class in China and India. It is expected that the volume of rough diamond deliveries will decrease by 1% to 2% in value terms annually until 2030.[1]  According to the forecasts of IDEX Corporation and Kimberley Process, as well as of the veteran observer of the jewelry industry, Chaim Ewen-Zohar, the global supply of diamonds will exceed demand until 2019, and then, due to the aging of diamond deposits and the transition to gem mining in hard-to-reach deposits, will grow by 1.5‚Äì2% to 2024, and the demand ‚Äî by 2‚Äì4%. In this regard, the profitability of diamonds as objects for investment will increase, the cost of stones will also increase after 2019.  According to Paul Zimniski‚Äôs forecast, the world production of diamonds extracted in 2017 is 142.3 million carats worth $ 15.6 billion, which is 11.5% more than the volume in carats in 2016 and 9.9% more than the total cost of the diamonds mined.

You can always go to our website and sell it at the price we have fixed (it will be slightly more than 1 usd for 1 RDC). 2.

Some people even would be investing there in something they can barely understand.  - Unlike stocks, which reflect ownership rights, tokens represent the utility or assets that are valuable within a particular network. Tokens do not represent an ownership, they constitute a value created by the network itself. The success of a project increases the utility of the token, causing its value to rise.  In these conditions, RDC Project is unique because it's backed by real assets - diamonds and diamond jewelry. Here are 3 reasons to invest in diamonds.  1. Sustainability.  Diamond is the rarest and expensive of all precious stones and time is the only a factor that increases its value.  2. Liquidity.  The diamonds have high liquidity and make the guaranteed added value in its market segment.  3. Tendencies and prospects.  The review of the global diamond market dynamics makes it possible to identify a number of factors affecting supply and demand. According to the latest industry forecast, in the next 15 years, all segments of the global diamond industry will moderately grow on average 9-15% per year.  - Join the first ICO backed by diamonds on the start of Pre-Sale, on June 20.
