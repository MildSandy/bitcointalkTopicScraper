I guess listing process takes a long time and imusify will be finally listed on a small exchange. This is the best thing I can expect for a project that has no development and progress. In my opinion, the best they can do is forget about listing for a while, work on the project, release something and then try to list the token. However delaying the listing won't have a good effect, but it's better than listing of the token which the project haven't has any progress on a small exchange. Any way, keeping the toke's price high has become very difficult. They should do something or the tokens will be dumped in a bad way.",False

Planned integration with regulators and other institutions for transparency and regional/global acceptance. 2. Proof of Stake, rather than Proof of Work, quantum proof consensus algorithm for both security and significantly higher transactional throughput. 3. Broad international acceptance with, to date, no evidence of fraud. 4. Core Accountability and Transparency features with several chain-based digital ID solutions already in progress. 5. NEO smart contracts are very expensive to deploy, which means that there is much less likelihood of the ecosystem being polluted with scams and other distractions common to other ICO capable blockchains. 6. NEO has a strong development community and currently supports C# and Python for Smart Contracts as well as integrations using C#, Python and JavaScript libraries.

We are currently moving full throttle towards an ITO in order to raise funds for our development roadmap. Our first main focus is on the smart contract ‚Äúincentify‚Äù. Besides ‚Äúincentify‚Äù and standard social networking features such as following, search, browse, playlists and exploring we plan to make imusify a platform where users can make a decent source of income. We plan to achieve this by developing the following additional features features:  Webapp, Desktop and Mobile apps For better collaboration and music discovery experience  Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning By implementing AI we will be able to understand user preferences better which enables us to curate and deliver a very unique user experience. AI will also help us determine rewards and loyalty points when integrated into our smart contract ‚Äúincentify‚Äù.  Tools for copyright management By utilizing NEO¬¥s ‚ÄúDigital Assets‚Äù, which are programmable assets, the digitization of assets can be decentralized, trustful, traceable, highly transparent, and free of intermediaries. On the imusify platform users will be able to register their assets, such as music recordings or midi files, thus obtaining immutable proof of copyright. Proving the connection between digital and physical assets is possible through ‚ÄùSmart ID‚Äù. Assets, in this case music, registered through a validated digital identity are protected by law.  Smart ID Users will have the option to verify their identification. This will happen via NEO Smart ID which enables trustful verification:  - Facial features - Fingerprints - Voice - SMS - Other multi-factor methods  Marketplace Copyright holders will be able to sell their digital goods, such as music, as single or album. We have plans for enabling copyright holders to sell 1-click commercial use and sync-licenses for audio-visuals such as movies, corporate image videos or online videos like youtube etc. We will provide the opportunity for the following licensing cases:  - Film / TV Shows - Music production - Documentary / Indie / Student Film - Corporate / Commercial Film - Internet Video - Websites - Audiobooks - Advertising - Music on hold - Games & Software - Live Events - Podcasts - Non Profit  Collecting Income from the marketplace will no longer be the responsibility of copyright collecting societies (PRO) such as BMI, ASCAP or GEMA. As of now, the amount of royalties collected and paid out is only a fraction of what the artists actually earn. A good amount of money, again, remains with an intermediary, the PROs. With imusify the income will be transferred directly to the users wallets. No more collecting from collecting societies or searching and waiting years on royalties!  Distributed Storage Utilizing Distributed Hash Table technology imusify will provide distributed storage for audio hosting at a fraction of normal hosting costs. Thanks to NeoFS, data is indexed through file content (Hash) rather than file path (URI). Large files are divided into fixed-size data blocks that are distributed and stored in many different nodes. This enables super fast p2p transactions while increasing security.  dApps launching tools Developers creating music related dApps will be able to launch their products on the imusify platform. We plan to educate and support upcoming content creators, artists and entrepreneurs which plan to disrupt the music industry by providing both virtual and real world workshops. Long term vision is to form incubator and accelerator programs for all imusify members.  Multiple payment methods imusify will generally accept fiat, bank-transfer and most cryptos as payment method for all of its services.  ITO / Crowdfunding for artists and bands imusify will develop tools to launch crowdfunding events. We will accept $IMU, cash, bank-transfer and all cryptos worth mentioning.  Tools for collaboration Users will be able to upload recordings, stems and stem packages with which users will be able to jam in realtime on a global basis while producing the next track.",False

The rapid digitalization of music has led to a wide range of avenues for monetizing content. The problem however, is that the music industry was built as a centralized system for physical distribution. This was more practical in the 1970s when there was no internet and record labels were distributing actual records. This centralized system was not designed for today‚Äôs digital world and its outdated structure creates multiple inefficiencies in the music value chain. Fortunately, we now have the technology to begin to decentralize the music industry, providing increased value to artists, consumers and other industry players.  imusify is one of the pioneers of music‚Äôs decentralization movement. Other blockchain music projects also show leadership in tackling certain inefficiencies such as event booking and copyright management. However, what sets imusify apart is that it aims to serve different shareholders and players across the entire music value chain, including crowdsourcing, collaboration, production, distribution, promotion, curation, live events and more. While existing blockchain music projects address several current pitfalls of the music industry, imusify is designing for the future. We are building a scalable and adaptable technology framework for artists, music lovers, entrepreneurs and developers to use our platform to connect with the imusify community, create collaborative content and build new use cases. While blockchain poses myriad opportunities to increase quality of life for virtually anyone in some way, operating as a decentralized organization presents inherent risk. With the birth of cryptocurrencies and exchanges, the barrier for investment decreased dramatically. The subsequent flood of currencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) entering the market has led to several economic boom and bust episodes. A boom and bust episode occurs when a company experiences a significant rise and fall in asset prices that do not directly relate to the firm‚Äôs value or profits.1 With blockchain still in its infancy, very few currencies are mature enough to be traded based on their use case‚Äôs delivery of value or return of profits. Although a cryptocurrency exchange exists similarly to a stock exchange, until now cryptocurrencies have been traded solely on speculative basis, with little consideration for the actual value or potential profitability of the company.  imusify considers it a responsibility to present a cohesive document that allows us to escape the ‚Äúwhitepaper era‚Äù of blockchain and currency trading and into the era of real use and real value. While most whitepapers do not discuss the greater context of the blockchain economy, this analysis can be valuable to our readers by clarifying the inevitable uncertainty of an innovative venture like imusify, and by providing the necessary information for shareholders and early adopters to make informed decisions.  https://imusify.com/",False

The rapid digitalization of music has led to a wide range of avenues for monetizing content. The problem however, is that the music industry was built as a centralized system for physical distribution. This was more practical in the 1970s when there was no internet and record labels were distributing actual records. This centralized system was not designed for today‚Äôs digital world and its outdated structure creates multiple inefficiencies in the music value chain. Fortunately, we now have the technology to begin to decentralize the music industry, providing adding value to artists, consumers and other industry players.  imusify is one of the pioneers of music‚Äôs decentralization movement. Other blockchain music projects also show leadership in tackling certain inefficiencies such as event booking and copyright management. However, what sets imusify apart is that it aims to serve different stakeholders and players across the entire music value chain, including crowdsourcing, collaboration, production, distribution, promotion, curation, live events and more. While existing blockchain music projects address some current pitfalls of the music industry, imusify is designed for the future. We are building a scalable and adaptable technology framework for artists, music lovers, entrepreneurs and developers to use our platform to connect with the imusify community, create collaborative content and build new use cases.",False

Put short: People who make music and people who love music. Any user can use imusify.com. Any user can benefit from imusify. Also, any user can get rewarded for contributions to the platform.  Users benefit in four main ways:  1. From having a new social music sharing and discovery platform, which takes the best features from phase-out models, improves them and combines them into a Smart music platform 2.0.  2. Thanks to the integrated imusify token artists can immediately monetize their content through the smart contract ‚Äúincentify‚Äù and spend their $IMU to further boost their reach and distribute to fans, friends and family for more exposure.  3. imusify harnesses the security and immutability features of blockchain to improve copyright protection for content owners and to securely transact and keep track of content licenses.This gives artists control over their content and disrupts the big record companies ironclad control over artist‚Äôs revenue streams.  4. imusify provides a Network-Market effect for all aspiring entrepreneurs and industry professionals to connect, communicate, share and do business.  Further users include:  Content Creators: Music Producers, Beatmakers, DJs, Turntablists, Curators, Singers, Rappers, Vocalists, Speakers, Beatboxers, Composers, Songwriters, Instrumentalists and Bands  Executives: A&Rs, Labels, Publishers, Managers, Bookers, Distributors, Recording Studios, Film Producers, Advertising Agencies, Music Supervisors, Film Cutters, Lawyers, Event Managers and Game Developers  Fans: Music nerds, ‚Äúmixtape‚Äù makers, Indie music lovers, Music discovery gurus, Playlist curators  Use case example: DJ/Producer: Online music platforms have been an integral part of any DJ/producer‚Äôs rise to fame. There have previously been problems with rightful owners of music getting their content taken down by their own record labels, which will be solved with imusify‚Äôs blockchain powered rights management system.  Another benefit is for DJ mixes. The rights situation for mixes is fairly complicated, where the rights to play a song in front of a live audience, does not necessarily imply the right to share it online. With music detection software a DJ can instantly pay the appropriate licenses for the tracks in the mix. Moreover, with the user curated channels and instant buying options, finding music while preparing sets has never been easier. Currently, many DJs discover music on Soundcloud, Spotify and other channels, and then have to find a way to buy this music in ultrahigh quality digital formats for use on large soundsystems. With imusify this could all be done on one platform.",False

As a platform, imusify.com is a music sharing and discovery platform. In contrast with currently existing platforms, content on imusify is organized in Slack-like channels that can be easily and instantly created by the users.  imusify solves the main problem with Soundcloud and competing platforms, which is that artists currently must pay the platform for the right to use it. √≠musify will take the opposite approach. Uploading, sharing and upvoting (curating) content is rewarded with imusify‚Äôs native currency $IMU, running as a smart contract on the NEO blockchain. Furthermore, over time imusify will become a place where users can buy and sell content using $IMU.  The basic workflow is as follows. When users enter imusify.com, they can currently register, sign up and sign in via email. Soon also via Facebook and Soundcloud. All new users receive an initial reward in $IMU. Users will be able to import all their existing content from Soundcloud to facilitate an easy transition to a next level platform. Once registered, the user can fill out profile relevant information and upload a profile picture. All users will automatically see all content in the public channel #general where they can curate content by up and downvoting or also soon via commenting. Users can upload their own content, such as recordings, given they have all necessary rights to upload to the platform. Users can drag and drop music into the browser thus uploading it to the platform. During the upload, user is asked multiple questions in order to determine relevant Metadata. For every upvote, both the upvoter and uploader receive rewards in $IMU. For every downvote, the uploader loses $IMU. Content can be shared to other users, channels and external platforms. It can be curated by up or downvoting to ensure quality.  Our MVP is the first version of a free voting system to curate the best content. It is very limited in functionality at this point as we developed this in a very short time specifically for the CoZ competition. The magic is hidden in the background, the Smart Contract: Events on the Web user interface (see below) are signaled to the Python middleware designed for this project, which then triggers a return. And indeed, the awarded amount is not determined by imusify but by the contract and the users level alone. Beyond the NEP5 compliant method calls (which always enables users to freely exchange IMU tokens) the main chain of new methods of the imusify contract logic are as follows:  BigInteger LevelUp(byte[] account) BigInteger RewardFunction(BigInteger level) BigInteger Reward(byte[] account) This is accompanied by the query BigInteger LevelOf(byte[] account)  Before the final release, anybody can test the reward trigger and the reward scheme is designed so that the curious developer can test the functionality and quickly witness the effect of a level raise. At a later point, the scheme will be scaled for long term incentification of users.  You can find an in depth explanation video of the imusify incentify smart contract here and further information on our Github repo.",False

Constantly shifting business models affect performers and songwriters, producers and publishers, promoters and live music venues.

Matti Vaininen, Digital Transformation in Music Industry, Aalto University School of Business, (2016).  Returning fair value to the individuals and groups creating music content. Addressing the Value Gap  Artists, songwriters, record labels and other industry players have begun to take action to address music‚Äôs value gap. In June 2016, over 1,000 artists and performers including big names such as Sir Paul McCartney, Coldplay and David Guetta, signed a petition requesting that the European Commission take urgent action to address the value gap in music: Earlier in 2016, Jon Bon Jovi, Katy Perry, and Christina Aguilera were among hundreds of creators to sign a petition to the U.S. Copyright office proposing similar legislative reforms:  ‚ÄúThe value gap undermines the rights and revenues of those who create, invest in and own music, and distorts the marketplace. This is because, while music consumption is at record highs, user upload services are misusing ‚Äòsafe harbour‚Äô exemptions. These protections were put in place two decades ago to help develop nascent digital startups, but today are being misapplied to corporations that distribute and monetise our works. We urge you to take action now to create a fair playing field for artists and rights owners. In doing so, you will be securing the future of music for generations to come2.‚Äù  2. Robert Levine, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a System That Is Rigged Against the Artists‚Äô: The War Against YouTube, Billboard, (2016).  ‚ÄúThis is a pivotal moment for music. Consumption is exploding. Fans are listening to more music than ever before. Consumers have unprecedented opportunities to access the music they love, whenever and wherever they want to do so. But the future is jeopardised by a substantial ‚Äòvalue gap‚Äô caused by user upload services such as Google‚Äôs YouTube that are unfairly siphoning value away from the music community and its artists and songwriters3.‚Äù",False

I have gathered some questions from the community, and your time is very much appreciated. Thanks Tom, it‚Äôs great to have this chance to answer some questions from the community! I come from a musical and business background- performing, writing, producing, and everything in between. A few years ago, I shifted my area of focus towards the business side of music when I realized that I could create a better world for other musicians, rather than struggle to be one myself.

But we share one thing in common: a passion for music, and not just listening to it, but changing the way its experienced around the world, and supporting those who create it for us. We are dedicated to creating a 21st Century platform that will allow for the ultimate patronage of the arts. In each new country that we introduce imusify, we‚Äôre continuously surprised by how many people share this desire with us on some level.  When did you first discover cryptocurrency and blockchain technology? I discovered cryptocurrency first, then blockchain. I was sitting in a college class a few years back and saw someone sitting in front of me on what I thought was a digital stock exchange. Thinking it was pretty cool, I asked him about it. He informed me that he wasn‚Äôt trading stocks, but crypto. ‚ÄúCrypto?‚Äù I asked, stupidly. ‚ÄúCryptocurrency,‚Äù he clarified. I went home after class and began researching and reading everything I could find, but what piqued my interest was blockchain, rather than just cryptocurrencies or trading.  From day one I was fascinated by the implications of blockchain more so than the hype of cryptocurrency. Unfortunately, the excitement and stigma that have arisen from trading cryptocurrency has in some way undermined the potential for the underlying technology to evolve towards widespread adoption. But I believe that this is changing for us right now.  Now I understand imusify is an up and coming ICO on the NEO Blockchain. Before we get into the details around the project, are you able to explain what features drew you to the NEO blockchain, out of all the others you could have chosen from? I always tell people that the community is the most impressive component of NEO, especially City of Zion, NEO‚Äôs open-source developer community. When developing a product in a new tech space, it‚Äôs incredibly important for there to be strong technical support, and collaboration across projects. I don‚Äôt know of any other protocols that have nearly as sophisticated, motivated, or as helpful of developer communities as NEO has with CoZ.  Your project, imusify, is poised to disrupt a massively cut-throat, multi-billion dollar industry. Are you able to give us a breakdown on the imusify project, and also explain the project‚Äôs main goals? Of course! You‚Äôre exactly right- the music industry is a massive, consolidated, and ruthless industry; but it‚Äôs also struggling in a big, big way. Jimmy Iovine, founder of Interscope Records and Beats Music, and former CEO of Apple Music had this to say about the state of the industry:  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just a problem here that needs some sort of solution, and I want to ¬≠contribute to it. Goldman Sachs may think it‚Äôs solved, but I don‚Äôt. We‚Äôre not even close.‚Äù  So in short, we‚Äôre with Jimmy- trying to fix the broken record. In a few more words, we‚Äôre providing solutions to the industry that will allow:  Artists and fans (our users) to more trustfully engage using a unique identity-verification tool Artists to maintain ownership of EVERYTHING they create Seamless digital rights management for the consumption of artist content Delivering the direct value to users of:  Immediate and transparent payments to artists on a per-stream basis, in their preferred currency Enhanced opportunity to engage with your fans as an artist, and your favorite artists as a fan Obviously, these are very high-level points. Our product designer, Marc Aniballi, delves into the core platform components that will deliver value in a little more detail in this article.  I can imagine it is not an easy feat trying to cut out the middle-man in the music industry. Over the past years I have seen a drastic increase in legal issues regarding music ownership and how artists get paid fairly. What benefits does blockchain offer to some of these widely known issues surrounding the music industry? A large part of the reason these issues arise is because in the past fifteen years the technology that people use to consume music has advanced significantly, but the technology used to track how that music is consumed has not kept pace.  Blockchain is exactly the technology that the industry has been waiting for to solve these problems and to efficiently fuel the distribution side of the industry. It‚Äôs exactly what is needed to keep up with the rapidly changing digital consumption. It‚Äôs not rocket science to understand that the music industry is quickly being overtaken by the tech industry, but we want to begin to return to supporting the artists and the fans, first and foremost, by building a community‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänot just the underlying technology‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit has to be a composite blend of both.  Often we read of new projects simply raising funds in an ICO, for a project that doesn‚Äôt necessarily have a real-world use-case. I‚Äôve always believed blockchain adoption will occur when people are able to use blockchain platforms easily, without even realizing. What utility will this token give, and what steps do you have in place to help fuel adoption from people who don‚Äôt necessarily want to be involved in cryptocurrency? We are in a great position to lead blockchain adoption as one of the consumer-facing dApps that doesn‚Äôt necessarily have a blockchain-themed product. If what you‚Äôre ‚Äúselling‚Äù is about blockchain, chances are people who already know what blockchain is , are going to be your main customers. But if what you‚Äôre selling is something universally loved and understood, people won‚Äôt even know they‚Äôre using a decentralized application, until they start earning. ‚ÄúWait, that money went directly to my wallet‚Ä¶ what kind of wallet is this?‚Äù and the education process begins.  New users who might even be consciously against blockchain can still enjoy the technology at a subconscious level by converting their earnings with seamless fiat conversion. The key is to get users excited about the enhanced experience and then reveal glimpses of how a decentralized system actually works. The important point here is though, that you don‚Äôt have to learn anything new if you don‚Äôt want to, and you‚Äôll still be helping artists.  Two things I always consider very important for any start-up ICO. The first is, who are your main competitors? Are any blockchain based?  We‚Äôre operating at an intersection of an ancient industry and extremely new technology. Our industry competitors are the common names of Spotify and Apple Music. These giants are our competitors simply because of their size and reach, but that same size limits them in their flexibility to easily make the shift towards decentralization.  Our competitors in the blockchain space include Ujo Music and Choon. Both are impressive projects, and both have made excellent progress in spreading awareness about blockchain as a solution for music distribution and consumption. Without going into too much detail, projects such as these have major drawbacks to their platforms and their architecture that will create significant challenges if they ever do begin to scale. Our architectural framework puts us at an advantage, in regards to both technical scalability, and ability to be integrated into industry‚Äôs pre-existing distribution systems.  The second question is in regards to partnerships. Have you formed any partnerships to help make Imusify a leading platform in the music industry? We have several partnership agreements in place in different areas of the industry. We are also in the process of closing dozens of distribution deals with independent record labels around the world that will allow their artists to distribute their music on imusify, and give our users an impressive library of content to enjoy from Day 1 of our full product launch.  These partnerships are not being made public at this time, but they‚Äôll be announced in the near future. Stay tuned  Is there any MVP (minimum viable product) or demo‚Äôs that we are able to share for our readers? We have a working prototype up at https://imusify.io/signin. Several features (blind identity verification, fiat payment processing) require additional funds to implement, but the platform runs on the NEO blockchain and allows you to get rewarded as an artist and curator for engaging with content on-platform!  Are you able to break down the token metrics for your ICO? What is the total supply, what percentage will be sold at ICO, and what is the amount you are raising in USD/NEO? I‚Äôd be happy to. The total supply of tokens is 1,000,000,000 IMU, with 65% being sold during the ICO. We are looking to raise $25M to support our development efforts and go-to-market strategy. Our in-depth token metrics can be found here.  Another question I often ask is what will you be using the raised money for? Do you have a plan or breakdown of where the funds will be allocated? This information is displayed in our whitepaper, but I‚Äôm happy to break it down here too.  20% of funds raised go towards product development, 20% go towards sales and marketing, 20% towards supplier development, 20% for legal costs, 15% for business operations, and 5% of funds raised will be reserved for imusify‚Äôs charity program, which will involve supporting other global organizations that seek to educate and empower musicians and artists. So I am aware this project is currently in a private sale period, are investors still able to whitelist for the pre-sale/public ICO? Are there any restrictions in regards to what countries are not allowed to contribute? Perhaps you could share a link for anyone interested in whitelisting for this initial coin offering? Yes, private sale participants are also able to whitelist for later stages of the sale, if they so choose!  The countries prohibited from participating in imusify‚Äôs ICO are: United States, Canada, South Korea, Singapore, and China.  You can join the whitelist and participate in the ICO at https://tokensale.imusify.com/.  Are you able to list the start date and end date for the ICO?  The Public Sale of the ICO begins October 1, 2018.  It ends on November 30, 2018, if the maximum cap has not been met beforehand.  For anyone wanting to find out more information on this project, have you got a website or any other groups you recommend them visiting?  Of course!  You can visit our website at https://imusify.com/  And you can join our telegram at https://t.me/imusifycommunity  In rhythm,  Nate + The imusify team",False

I‚Äôm sure the wider NEO community is very interested in finding out more information about this project! I have gathered some questions from the community, and your time is very much appreciated. Thanks Tom, it‚Äôs great to have this chance to answer some questions from the community! I come from a musical and business background- performing, writing, producing, and everything in between. A few years ago, I shifted my area of focus towards the business side of music when I realized that I could create a better world for other musicians, rather than struggle to be one myself. I happened upon this realization at exactly the same time blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies were beginning to hit the mainstream in early 2017, and thus my commitment to decentralizing the music world began.  Our team comes from very diverse backgrounds- technical, legal, consulting, finance, and marketing to name a few. But we share one thing in common: a passion for music, and not just listening to it, but changing the way its experienced around the world, and supporting those who create it for us. We are dedicated to creating a 21st Century platform that will allow for the ultimate patronage of the arts. In each new country that we introduce imusify, we‚Äôre continuously surprised by how many people share this desire with us on some level.  When did you first discover cryptocurrency and blockchain technology? I discovered cryptocurrency first, then blockchain. I was sitting in a college class a few years back and saw someone sitting in front of me on what I thought was a digital stock exchange. Thinking it was pretty cool, I asked him about it. He informed me that he wasn‚Äôt trading stocks, but crypto. ‚ÄúCrypto?‚Äù I asked, stupidly. ‚ÄúCryptocurrency,‚Äù he clarified. I went home after class and began researching and reading everything I could find, but what piqued my interest was blockchain, rather than just cryptocurrencies or trading.  From day one I was fascinated by the implications of blockchain more so than the hype of cryptocurrency. Unfortunately, the excitement and stigma that have arisen from trading cryptocurrency has in some way undermined the potential for the underlying technology to evolve towards widespread adoption. But I believe that this is changing for us right now.  Now I understand imusify is an up and coming ICO on the NEO Blockchain. Before we get into the details around the project, are you able to explain what features drew you to the NEO blockchain, out of all the others you could have chosen from? I always tell people that the community is the most impressive component of NEO, especially City of Zion, NEO‚Äôs open-source developer community. When developing a product in a new tech space, it‚Äôs incredibly important for there to be strong technical support, and collaboration across projects. I don‚Äôt know of any other protocols that have nearly as sophisticated, motivated, or as helpful of developer communities as NEO has with CoZ.  Your project, imusify, is poised to disrupt a massively cut-throat, multi-billion dollar industry. Are you able to give us a breakdown on the imusify project, and also explain the project‚Äôs main goals?  more on medium : https://medium.com/imusify/the-imusi-why-series-community-q-a-with-imusify-coo-nate-strang-and-tom-chilli-of-chillit-68576c5a0a9",False

So I am aware this project is currently in a private sale period, are investors still able to whitelist for the pre-sale/public ICO? Are there any restrictions in regards to what countries are not allowed to contribute? Perhaps you could share a link for anyone interested in whitelisting for this initial coin offering? Yes, private sale participants are also able to whitelist for later stages of the sale, if they so choose!  The countries prohibited from participating in imusify‚Äôs ICO are: United States, Canada, South Korea, Singapore, and China.  You can join the whitelist and participate in the ICO at https://tokensale.imusify.com/.  Are you able to list the start date and end date for the ICO?  The Public Sale of the ICO begins August 1, 2018.  It ends on September 30, 2018, if the maximum cap has not been met beforehand.  For anyone wanting to find out more information on this project, have you got a website or any other groups you recommend them visiting?  Of course!

NEO SMART ECONOMY  imusify‚Äôs utility token is built on the NEO blockchain, one the most advanced smart contract-enabled blockchains in existence. NEO‚Äôs vision for a ‚ÄúSmart Economy‚Äù includes the interaction between digital identities and digital assets using smart contracts to ensure trustful exchanges  Digital Identity + Digital Assets + Smart Contracts = Smart Economy   Digital Identity Within a smart economy, digital identity refers to the identity information of individuals and groups/organizations in electronic form. These identities offer a secure end-point for individuals to conduct transactions with others. The NEO ‚Äúweb-of-trust‚Äù compliance protocol also presents a key competitive advantage for imusify to differentiate itself over other music blockchain platforms. Using a ‚Äútrust-ful‚Äù, as opposed to a ‚Äútrust-less‚Äù system,  digital identification exists to tie transactions to verified individual identity, conveniently supporting compliance with existing and future government regulations.  Digital Assets Digital assets are programmable physical assets that, when registered through a validated digital identity, are protected by law. By establishing a trustful association between digital assets and identities, users can register, trade, and circulate assets to conduct business. Through technologies such as P2P networking (via TCP and WebSocket), dBFT consensus (to guarantee fault tolerance), digital certificates (NEO smart contracts), superconducting transactions (supporting up to 10,000 tps as opposed to 15 tps on the Ethereum network), and cross-chain interoperability (the NeoX patent), the NEO community is able to organize networks like imusify to manage smart assets in an efficient, safe, and legally binding manner.  Smart Contracts Smart contracts are protocols that facilitate credible transactions between users without the need for a third party or intermediary. imusify leverages NEO smart contracts to create a secure, democratic, censorship-free platform. With the use of smart contracts, artists‚Äô digital assets can be self-managed achieving a music ‚Äúsmart economy‚Äù within the NEO established network.",False

In order to best understand how imusify will utilize blockchain to disrupt the music economy, it is important to first understand the evolution of blockchain technology, and the narratives that have emerged alongside it.  Blockchain was originally designed to instill a provable form of trust when conducting transactions, rendering the ‚Äútrusted intermediary‚Äù unnecessary. In 2009, ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù was born when Bitcoin‚Äôs genesis block was mined2. This meant that the first block of the first blockchain came into existence. ‚ÄúMining‚Äù refers to a process where computers collect a batch of transactions, encrypt them, and then use their computing power to confirm the group of transactions. Each group of transactions mined creates a new ‚Äúblock‚Äù in the blockchain. At this time, blockchain existed solely as the technology behind the Bitcoin cryptocurrency and for the next few years blockchain was only understood by a select group of early crypto enthusiasts.  During this period, ideas as to how bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might deliver value began to emerge. People began paying for random goods and services in bitcoin, the excitement around its potential grew, and soon the speculative value of bitcoin began to rise. As the first blockchain startups emerged and a new network of investors was established, questions arose as to how blockchain infrastructure might play a role in updating aspects of the financial system. By late 2016, several proof of concepts had emerged and were later deemed impossible by the companies that sought to implement them. Despite the lack of success, more and more narratives and ideas emerged, and more cryptocurrencies sparked investment interest.  Today, blockchain‚Äôs network power has been a driving force in many blockchain narratives, including Bitcoin itself. Entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss presented a popular narrative about blockchain regarding how its network power acts to coordinate beliefs behind it4. Using the analogy of the telephone, Tyler explains this particular network power. If one person in the world owns a telephone, it holds no value. If two people own telephones, a value is created as those two people can now communicate with each other. The more people that have telephones, the greater the network value of the telephones become due to the exponential growth of potential communications that can take place amongst telephone owners. Bitcoin, he explains, operates the same way as a digital currency. The more people who hold it, the more value the currency has to serve as a means of exchange and a payment utility. This is an example of one of the primitive narratives that has led to speculative investments into bitcoin, even though the areas of value chains that bitcoin may enhance are still largely unproven.  The problem with narratives in the blockchain space is that the low barrier for creating and investing into new narratives has provided an opportunity for profiteers to take advantage of the supply of opportunistic and less experienced investors in the space. Some of these projects known as ‚Äúscam coins‚Äù produce a narrative, often in the form of a whitepaper, about their coin‚Äôs ‚Äúunique‚Äù value proposition1. They then use this narrative whitepaper to coordinate investor beliefs and raise funds through an ICO, exploiting the ill-informed investor. All they have to do is creatively link a tangible idea to the concept behind Winklevoss‚Äôs network narrative and people interested in that tangible idea will buy in. The problem with scam coins is they don‚Äôt deliver any real value to users, resulting in an inevitable crash, or bust episode, once the community of token holders realize their coin‚Äôs technology holds little real value. Similarly, other blockchain startups have been seen to, either intentionally or unintentionally, overvalue their project and promote a funding round using a similar strategy. While a startup like this may have the goal of creating a real use case, the over-fundraising that comes from their high valuation creates a lack of trust in investors that can also lead them to a similar bust episode to spam coins.  From the examples of scam coins and project overvaluation discussed above, we can see how misleading narratives can create a damaging rise and fall in a startup‚Äôs token value that does not relate to the  project‚Äôs fundamental value but instead to the community‚Äôs perceived value of the project. Because token holders have the buying and selling power to both lift or sink a blockchain project, it is in any startup‚Äôs best interest to circulate narratives around their project that provide realistic and achievable analyses of the potential profitability of their product.  To reduce the risk of negative speculation, a startup should present an easily understood business model that discusses which portions of a value chain are being improved or removed and how such optimizations can deliver value to participants. In order to be effective, a business plan must clearly describe how the business will make money. It also must discuss the specific componentss of the value chain they plan to change and the entire economic ecosystem required to deliver value to the participants and the users. Such a business model will be presented in detail later in this paper, but we will first take a closer look at how the combination of humans, narratives, and blockchain technology can co-exist to create a synergistic result.",False

Today, music creators operate within a complex web of intermediaries when distributing digital content and attempting to recoup payments for their work. Blockchain technology allows artists and creators to retain direct control over their work throughout the distribution process, and facilitates a peer-to-peer exchange of value between creators, consumers and other industry contributors. This paper presents imusify, a decentralized music platform and smart economy, and provides a narrative into how imusify will deliver value to all user types while continually optimizing the music value chain. The first section of this paper discusses the current landscape of the blockchain industry and the benefits and risks that have come to light as a result of blockchain‚Äôs recent economic boom. The second section examines the core components of the imusify project- its business model, architecture, and community. It also explains imusify‚Äôs favorable position to lead a widespread societal adoption of decentralized systems using the universal language of music.  Interesting project",False

Becouse of business model    imusify‚Äôs business model demonstrates how the company uses decentralized protocols to build on the proven business models of other applications including crowdfunding platforms (Kickstarter, Indiegogo, BandCamp, etc.), music streaming services (Spotify, SoundCloud, Itunes), and harnesses the network effect of social networks (Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram) and multimedia sharing platforms (YouTube, Vimeo, Tidal) Harnessing the potential of decentralized technologies, imusify is connecting musicians and their fans, as well as other stakeholders (producers, labels, etc.), by creating a platform for the new music economy. It integrates the best practices of crowdfunding, streaming, media sharing, social networks, and management of the music value chain. The combination enables the musicians to fund the production of their music (Funding & Monetization), track the use of their content (Digital Rights Management), and be paid for plays and downloads via smart contracts (Payment Transparency); and the fans to support and enjoy the music of their favourite artist. Our unique value proposition is the use of blockchain ledgers to track content and smart contracts to automate the fair distribution of royalties.   With the value of the global market for digital music exceeding 12,000,000,000 USD, it is hardly surprising that imusify must compete with some strong global players to acquire a market share. However, be it Spotify in the streaming services market, iTunes in the digital downloads market, or Pledge Music in crowdfunding of music projects market, none of these players are direct competitors of imusify. Our main advantage is in merging all of the services aforementioned on a powerful blockchain platform, thus allowing us to take a new approach towards solving the problems of digital rights management, transparency, and compensation. Furthermore, the incorporation of the elements of a social network and automation of rewards for activity results in unique user experience. Despite being ‚Äúartist-centric‚Äù, the imusify platform positions itself as an ecosystem in which all users are incentivised to play active roles in the ecosystem, rather than simply being recipients of the content. Such engagement will promote the longevity of imusify‚Äôs value to its users and support its relevance long into the future.",False

The token will be listed on several exchanges following the conclusion of the tokensale. The value of the IMU token will float based upon the current traded value.  The token acts as a utility by allowing new or existing users to redeem their IMU tokens for platform fuel. The imusify platform uses fuel as an accounting system for exchanging value between users. Fuel is not a currency, it simply represents the value of IMU in the user‚Äôs preferred currency, and allows users to realize the token‚Äôs value as a utility by conducting transactions with other users on the platform. When users bring their IMU to the platform, they receive an amount of credits equal to the IMU‚Äôs current trading value. Token",False

When an individual signs up to use the platform they receive an mUser identity. The mUser withholds all identity information and serves as the reputation point for personas to be created on top of it. New personas are created either automatically, when a mUser commits a certain action, or by voluntarily creating a new persona to conduct a certain action. Personas and asset classifications are architectural system components used to build an organized and seemless UX for users to conduct different actions.   Consumer Persona When a new mUser goes to listen to music content on the platform, a consumer persona is automatically created to retain the data pertaining to all of that mUser‚Äôs consumer actions. An mUser‚Äôs consumer persona allows them to purchase and stream content, join social communities, support artist campaigns, and earn rewards for curating content.  Artist Persona An mUser can also create an artist persona, which allows them to collaborate with others to produce new content, publish and promote that content on the imusify platform, and receive IMU payments for sales and licensing. The artist persona can also create a group persona of several individuals who work together to produce a certain piece of content.  Collaborator Persona Similar to the artist persona, the collaborator persona allows various types of creators (producers, videographers, instrumentalists) to join groups created by artists. Venue Persona Lastly, mUsers can create personas to represent physical entities. For example, the proprietor of the performance hall may create a venue persona to promote their physical space as one of imusify‚Äôs venues. Artist, collaborator, and venue personas can also list their services offered on the imusify marketplace. Imusify‚Äôs unique marketplace allows various personas from around the world to connect, collaborate, and contribute to each other‚Äôs creative works.  Content Asset User personas produce and interact with various digital assets on the imusify platform. A content asset represents a piece of digital audio content that exists on the imusify platform. An artist or collaborator persona can create a content asset. Each content asset maintains a record of all user interactions with the asset and uses this record to calculate how users are rewarded. The user reward system will be discussed in the next section.  Project asset A project asset encompasses the content assets of an individual or collective group of artist and collaborator personas. When multiple personas collaborate in the writing, recording, and production of content assets, a project asset serves to attribute credits to the contributors of each of the projects songs.",False

When an individual signs up to use the platform they receive an mUser identity. The mUser withholds all identity information and serves as the reputation point for personas to be created on top of it. New personas are created either automatically, when a mUser commits a certain action, or by voluntarily creating a new persona to conduct a certain action. Personas and asset classifications are architectural system components used to build an organized and seemless UX for users to conduct different actions.  Consumer Persona When a new mUser goes to listen to music content on the platform, a consumer persona is automatically created to retain the data pertaining to all of that mUser‚Äôs consumer actions. An mUser‚Äôs consumer persona allows them to purchase and stream content, join social communities, support artist campaigns, and earn rewards for curating content.  Artist Persona An mUser can also create an artist persona, which allows them to collaborate with others to produce new content, publish and promote that content on the imusify platform, and receive IMU payments for sales and licensing. The artist persona can also create a group persona of several individuals who work together to produce a certain piece of content.  Collaborator Persona Similar to the artist persona, the collaborator persona allows various types of creators (producers, videographers, instrumentalists) to join groups created by artists. Venue Persona Lastly, mUsers can create personas to represent physical entities. For example, the proprietor of the performance hall may create a venue persona to promote their physical space as one of imusify‚Äôs venues. Artist, collaborator, and venue personas can also list their services offered on the imusify marketplace. Imusify‚Äôs unique marketplace allows various personas from around the world to connect, collaborate, and contribute to each other‚Äôs creative works.  Content Asset User personas produce and interact with various digital assets on the imusify platform. A content asset represents a piece of digital audio content that exists on the imusify platform. An artist or collaborator persona can create a content asset. Each content asset maintains a record of all user interactions with the asset and uses this record to calculate how users are rewarded. The user reward system will be discussed in the next section.  Project asset A project asset encompasses the content assets of an individual or collective group of artist and collaborator personas. When multiple personas collaborate in the writing, recording, and production of content assets, a project asset serves to attribute credits to the contributors of each of the projects songs.",False

The system‚Äôs streaming platform is also designed to allow artists to offer discounts to a group of fans or during a certain promotional period. Per-stream rewards are monitored by imusify to ensure that compliance standards and regulations for royalty payments are met in relevant jurisdictions.  Marketplace of Music Industry Participants imusify is a place for all aspiring entrepreneurs, artists, and industry members to network and create communities. This marketplace allows participants to execute transactions pertaining to various  business development or creative services and products including videography, production, advertising, content design, promotion and all other media-related or creative content. Product suppliers will also be able to list their products on the imusify marketplace to be sold directly to artists and supporters. An independent musician can now utilize this functionality by taking his earnings directly to the marketplace, and pay producers or engineers directly or update his home recording equipment without ever using a fiat currency.  Reward System In addition to rewarding artists for streaming royalties of their creative content (music), imusify‚Äôs reward system is designed to incentivize quality contribution and curation on the platform by rewarding creators of social content (posts, playlists, comments) for certain actions. To promote the sustainability of imusify‚Äôs ecosystem and motivate quality engagement between users, the reward model has been adapted to eliminate the need for a ‚Äúreward pool‚Äù of tokens by facilitating user-to-user rewards, as opposed to imusify-to-user rewards. For example, curators can be rewarded for high quality contribution by receiving micropayments (similar to the size of artist royalty rewards) each time users subscribe or share the curator‚Äôs playlist. This improved system poses several advantages, from eliminating the need to release new tokens into circulation from imusify, to reducing the possibility for the system‚Äôs manipulation by profiteers and scammers.  Decentralized Exchange In order for artists and various user types to interact intuitively with the platform and conveniently realize their payments and rewards, it is crucial for there to exist a simple and convenient means to exchange IMU tokens to fiat and other currencies. imusify will be  implement the NEON Exchange‚Äôs (NEX) API to offer an in-platform exchange functionality that allows imusify users to exchange their tokens to other forms of currency instantly. While the NEX technology is still being polished, imusify aims for full use of the NEX API to be available to users by Q3 2018. IMU tokens will also be listed on several ‚Äúcentralized‚Äù exchanges to allow holders to trade freely with others.  Co-evolutionary copyright management Harnessing the security and immutability of imusify‚Äôs decentralized data ledger, imusify will implement a multi-layered protocol that allows content creators to manage ownership rights and licensing information. Adaptable tools give artists complete control over their content and each revenue stream it generates. An artist uploading a new song to the platform can for example, recognize the contributions of songwriters, a band, and others involved in the creation of the song by assigning them ownership rights. Once the new song generates revenue (through streaming, synchronization, etc.) it will be distributed accordingly.",False

There have previously been problems with rightful owners of music getting their content taken down by their own record labels, which will be solved with imusify‚Äôs blockchain powered rights management system. The rights situation for mixes is fairly complicated, where the rights to play a song in front of a live audience, does not necessarily imply the right to share it online. N With music detection software a DJ can instantly pay the appropriate licenses for the tracks in the mix. Moreover, with the user curated channels and instant buying options, finding music while preparing sets has never been easier. Currently, many DJs discover music on Soundcloud, Spotify and other channels, and then have to find a way to buy this music in ultrahigh quality digital formats for use on large sound systems. With imusify this could all be done on one platform.  EMERGING RAPPER As the biggest influencer of mainstream commercial music for over 10 years, Hip Hop is inevitably going to be one of the biggest genres on imusify. Artists like Fat Nick, Lil Pump have are now touring the world after gaining fandom on Soundcloud. By using imusify, a talented rapper will earn œë IMU from the first moment his/her content becomes popular. Later, managers, bookers, and other content buyers can purchase the artist‚Äôs music right on the platform without any need for a record company.  CASUAL FILMMAKER The market for synchronization rights, or many different use licenses for music, lacks transparency and is not well developed online. The casual filmmaker can find music on imusify and seamlessly purchase the correct license with œë IMU, secured by the blockchain.  DISCOVERY GURU Everybody knows a person like this. He/she is always in the know of what‚Äôs new and cool. Everyone follows this person‚Äôs spotify and soundcloud accounts to see what is shared. This is an amazing skill that requires an enormous amount of time. This music lover invests gladly though because of the thrill of discovery and the goosebumps when hearing an amazing new track. Now, with imusify, this skill can be monetized for the first time. By becoming a curator on imusify, these gurus can get the recognition they deserve and monetize their efforts just by doing what they love. Along with artists, these users are the driving force behind imusify and they can now get compensated for their time and delivering high quality curated playlists.",False

Point is decentralized solution   A Decentralized Solution The music industry has been facing existential challenges over the past decade and the landscape has been completely restructured due to digitalization and the introduction of digital streaming services. While most industries are only beginning to experiment with the potential uses of blockchain, imusify is using blockchain to tackle the industry‚Äôs challenges and providing a pioneering real-world use case that will not only bring immediate value to the music space, but also educate early adopters to lead an evolution towards societal adoption of other blockchain use cases. We will now examine at a high level the solutions that decentralization can provide to the global music industry.  Digital Rights Management Payment Transparency Licensing and Monetization  The network power of blockchain provides the opportunity to create a comprehensive digital rights management system that eliminates the need for latent payment reconciliation. Instead, with such a system consumption information can be shared automatically, offering universal transparency to artists, distributors and consumers.  Blockchain offers several added values to the transactional procedures that occur throughout the music supply chain. With a comprehensive database of consumption content and verified users, blockchain poses solutions for making automatic and transparent royalty payments, not only to single individuals but distributed to a song‚Äôs respective rights holders. This improved payment process can provide more information to artists about how their work is being consumed and exactly what and how they are being compensated.  With the presence of a decentralized database of content and ownership rights, artists have the opportunity to license and monetize content in exciting ways. Even small relatively unknown artists will have a marketplace where they can sell licenses for their work to be used in commercial videos, films, live events, and podcasts to name a few.  imusify is tackling these challenges from an artist-centric perspective and allowing early supporters to take part in challenging the status quo to create a new global music economy",False

To best answer this question, we examine the three components of the NEO Smart Economy in the context of a music smart economy.  Secure, transparent digital identities allow artists, consumers, producers, managers, venues, record labels, and other music shareholders to establish an electronic identity as a means to interact, collaborate, and conduct transactions with other shareholders. Users with music related digital identities can issue content, experiences, and projects as digital assets in order to protect their ownership of their creative work, and track its life cycle within the music economy. Smart contracts allow for music digital identities to trustfully conduct transactions. For example, an artist registered digital identity who distributes an album as a digital asset can use a smart contract to sell the asset to consumers and automatically receive payment from the transaction.  Now that we understand how digital assets, digital identities, and smart contracts make up the foundation of a music smart economy, let us take a look at how imusify is building upon this foundation to engage and deliver value to its users. imusify is focused on building a platform to serve the immediate needs of current shareholders in the music industry, while providing an open innovation space for developing new means of interaction and value exchange to serve the music economy in the near and distant future. To further the conceptual vision of its music smart economy, imusify gives value to its platform, its network, and its utility token which serves as a means of exchange for users within the imusify network on the imusify platform. Firstly, imusify exists as a platform (web and mobile applications) that allows its users to connect, collaborate, and share experiences with other imusify users. Equally as important, the imusify network leverages the flexibility of decentralized systems to connect users in exciting ways. Imusify‚Äôs tokenized structure provides the IMU utility token to allow users to conduct transactions within the music smart economy.",False

NEO is ready for the future of technology because it has a quantum computer proof feature that makes it secure from future of quantum computers.  As technology advances, quantum computers are close to being operational and means that nearly all cryptocurrency will be vulnerable because a quantum computer is able to break the cryptography easily.

Key Components & Features  The engine for supporters and artists to create and engage in crowdfunds Artists can launch crowdfunding campaigns, allowing them to fund music products like albums, videos, and tours using reward or donation-based campaigns. Artists can leverage their supporting network further by providing affiliate licenses, allowing supporters to profit directly by promoting and selling the campaign‚Äôs content product.  Transparent and fair artist reward payments By decentralizing rights management for artists, imusify is able to capitalize on a paid subscription service for artists while also maintaining transparency between transactions. With our platform, a new standard for ‚Äúroyalty‚Äù payment is created, where there is no need for rights organizations or collecting services. Ownership and use of content are monitored and stored on the blockchain and rewards are paid to artists using smart contracts, eventually eliminating the need for oversight by third-party entities.  The marketplace of Music Industry Participants imusify is a place for all aspiring entrepreneurs, artists, and industry members to network and create communities. Product suppliers and service providers cat list their products on the imusify marketplace of business development services and products including videography, production, advertising, content design, promotion and all other media-related or creative content. All transactions conducted within the marketplace use the IMU token for exchanging value.  Open innovation space The imusify platform offers an innovation space to launch new products, features, tools, and services across the value chain of the music industry and beyond. How the app and platform is used is entirely up to the user: as a news app, as a messenger as a networking space, an incubator, a music curator, a place for trading goods and services, a discussion forum, or a unique combination of all of these functions that provide the most enjoyment for each user.  Co-evolutionary copyright management Harnessing the security and immutability of imusify‚Äôs decentralized data ledger by using the NeoVM, imusify will provide adaptable tools that give artists complete control over their content and each revenue stream it generates. Artists can assign ownership rights to their content that can be divisible. An artist uploading a new song to the platform can recognize the contributions of songwriters, a band and others involved in the creation of a song by assigning them ownership rights. Once the new song generates revenue (as listeners stream it, film producers purchase the license to use it in their film), it will be distributed accordingly to the rights holders.  œë IMU Reward System imusify‚Äôs reward system distributes funds from the IMU Reward Pool using a structure that builds quality engagement among users. The system rewards users for their current behaviors (as opposed to cumulative or historic contribution) to promote sustained activity to the platform and network. Artists, collaborators, and curators are rewarded for certain actions that promote user growth, base growth, and engagement with high-quality content. Consumers are rewarded for high-quality social interactions that improve/enhance the community. A detailed architecture of this reward system can be found in imusify‚Äôs whitepaper.

Built on NEO‚Äôs blockchain, imusify will leverage smart contract technology and Initial Token Offering (ITO) infrastructure to help artists succeed in the music industry in multiple aspects. By using NEO‚Äôs cutting edge smart economy technology, imusify is revolutionizing the global music economy in a way that will create transparency and deliver increased value to all music shareholders. While the goals and ambitions of imusify‚Äôs open-source team of artists, entrepreneurs, and developers are far-reaching, the following features will exist in their smart music platform‚Äôs launch this summer:  ITO Crowdfunding for Artists ITOs (similar to ICOs) have been one of the most successful use cases of blockchain technology to date. They allow for a very low barrier to entry for supporters and fans that want to help fund a project they believe in and receive equity. Imusify leverages this technology to help artists crowdfund for projects like albums, music videos, and tours.  In addition, these tokens can also be programmed as what are called ‚Äúprivate access tokens‚Äù. These token allow holders to access exclusive content provided by the artist, which can be anything ranging from discounted ticket prices to private chat access with the artist. These tokens can also be traded on an exchange within the imusify platform for other artists‚Äô tokens, or the platform‚Äôs utility token, IMU.  This feature will greatly benefit up-and-coming artists that have a lot of talent but lack the funds and resources they need to develop and get started on what they need to become successful.  Transparent and Fair Artist Royalty Payments Imusify compensates artists with IMU tokens based on the usage of their music through smart contracts. Smart contracts allow for artists to see exactly how they are being paid, allows the transaction to be executed immediately and autonomously and cuts out the middlemen in the transaction process that take profits from the artist.  In addition, the way that imusify is constructed, users can use the platform for free, as the artists are rewarded IMU tokens from a pool of IMU reserved to reward platform users.  Marketplace of Music Industry Participants Imusify aims to create an ecosystem where a multitude of different types of industry contributors can interact with each other. An international music marketplace of business development services and products such as videography, production, advertising, promotion and graphic design will provide artists, creators and entrepreneurs with immediate access to quality development resources.  For example, an advertiser in Germany could buy a commercial license to an artist‚Äôs song from Canada through a smart contract. The artist would receive the IMU payment immediately and could then use the tokens to buy new recording equipment from an American supplier or schedule a recording session with a producer, all without converting their IMU to fiat currency.  Incentivized Content Curation When a user creates an imusify account, a NEO wallet is automatically created with a starting balance of IMU tokens. Any user can earn IMU tokens by interacting with the platform and curating content by sharing it throughout their unique network. This not only allows users to get paid for listening to and discovering music, but also creates an immense value to artists with their fans and network becoming unofficial promoters of their work.  Co-evolutionary Copyright Management Adaptable tools on the platform now give artists total control over their content ownership and rights and the revenue stream they will generate. They can now assign their IP rights as they see fit, whether they make business deals, want to credit the songwriter or want to assign a portion to each token in a crowdfunding ITO. This allows for a much more transparent system in situations where artists sample other songs or remix songs. They will no longer have to worry about copyright issues as they can just encode the appropriate royalties into their smart contract. When the song starts to generate revenue on the platform, the smart contract will immediately distribute the earnings accordingly.  https://medium.com/imusify/imu-a-coin-for-the-starving-artist-e47c0a44b5c8",False

The team toured with Switcheo, NEO‚Äôs first decentralized exchange, and O3 Labs, one of NEO‚Äôs leading wallets from June 23rd to July 3rd and spoke at events in Tokyo, Osaka and Fukuoka. The events promoted NEO across the country and also introduced new developers to the ecosystem.  The first major event for the NEO teams was the Japan Blockchain Conference Tokyo 2018 that was held on June 26th. The conference was the first of its kind in Japan and featured over 100 cryptocurrency experts and blockchain companies with over 5,000 attendees. It also had support from Japan‚Äôs Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  The NEO projects spoke alongside industry leaders at the event, including Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com, Keith Teare of TechCrunch, Charles Hoskins, former CEO of Ethereum, and Toni Lane Casserly, CoinTelegraph co-founder, among many others.  At the conference, Imusify outlined the issues of the music industry today and how its platform can bring new life into the music economy. The team also shared its story of how it started on the NEO ecosystem, and that it‚Äôs proud to be part of an open and friendly development community that values quality projects and long-term sustainability.  After the Japan Blockchain Conference Tokyo 2018, Imusify had an interview with CoinTokyo, a prominent cryptocurrency web media agency with a large readership of blockchain and cryptocurrency enthusiasts in Japan. Next, the team left for Fukuoka on Kyushu Island; also known as the ‚ÄòSilicon Valley of Japan.‚Äô There, the teams spent the night attending the Growth Next Event co-organized by the Fukuoka Engineer Lab. It‚Äôs claimed that the event was a success, as it was yet another opportunity to connect with developers and blockchain enthusiasts about NEO and spread awareness to a wider audience.  Next, the group went back to Tokyo for the Block Co+ Asia event held at the Hilton Tokyo Odaiba. After the event, the team had a number of discussions with professors from Keio University and representatives of Japanese companies. Imusify discussed various blockchain solutions like the ‚ÄòCrowd Cloud‚Äô and P2P micropayments and how they can be used to improve the operations of local businesses.  The Block Co+ Asia event also featured a performance by Imusify‚Äôs CEO and founder David Walters. David gave a freestyle rap and it was recorded and posted on the platform‚Äôs YouTube channel.  After the Block Co+ Asia event, Imusify, Switcheo, O3 and NEO Japan were invited to address the audience at Keio University, an institution known for excellence in technology and innovation. There, the teams explained and demonstrated how blockchain technologies can be used to improve the education system.  Finally, the event was followed by a radio interview and presentation of NEO Shanghai and Switcheo at the Yahoo! Japan headquarters in Osaka. It‚Äôs claimed that the feedback received at the event was overwhelmingly positive for its UI/UX solutions.  Imusify is grateful to NEO Japan for inviting the team to its roadshow and meeting so many leaders and influencers in Japan. They‚Äôd also like to thank both Switcheo and O3 labs for their support comradeship along the way.  More information about the team‚Äôs Japan visit can be found on Imusify‚Äôs YouTube channel where they‚Äôve shared videos and highlights from the event.",False

NEO has had a monumental rise to fame and most know NEO for its explosive growth. However, when you look under the hood there is a lot to discuss.  Called the ‚ÄúChinese Ethereum‚Äù NEO has a lot of hype but, does it live up to it?  Law as code First, let‚Äôs discuss smart contracts. According to Black‚Äôs law dictionary, a contract is: ‚ÄúAn agreement, upon sufficient consideration, to do or not to do a particular thing.‚Äù Sounds simple right? Contract law is a deep rabbit hole that spans a myriad of offshoots which many dedicate their lives to but there is one key shift in this digital age, the law is now programmed code.  In the US, the ESIGN act passed federally in 2000 which legalized the use of digital signatures as a legally binding construct. In China, a similar contract law and legal use of digital signatures were put on the books in 2007. This means the legal system now has a bridge with the digital realm and opens a plethora of new opportunities for digital contracts.  Meet Smart Contracts ‚Äì a digital, borderless and trust-less new way for two or more parties to interface. Contracts govern an agreement between two (or more) individuals and/or parties. If X occurs then Y is provided. If X does not occur, here is Z recourse. This ties in quite nicely with the conditional programming structure in computer science where ‚Äúif-then-else‚Äù expressions can easily be built around traditional contract law in effect making law into code.    If-Then-Else Diagram  Digital keys and signatures are the new pens inking their presence on digital (used to be paper) contracts. Contracts that have now been coded and re-imagined in a new way for the digital age through platforms like NEO.  The NEO system includes: Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (DBFT) algorithm ‚Äì This is a consensus mechanism (instead of the traditional proof of work/stake) that allows the system to resist the Byzantine Generals problem and maintains consensus even if some nodes bare malicious intentions NeoX ‚Äì This system will create the ability to execute and operate across various Blockchains NEO Contract ‚Äì Is the mechanism for creating smart contracts seamlessly in scalable, high performance environments that integrates pre-existing codebases (e.g. C#, VB.Net, F#, Java, Kotlin) NeoFS ‚Äì This is a service which allows decentralized storage (like a peer to peer Dropbox) NeoQ ‚Äì A lattice-based cryptographic mechanism which creates problems that cannot be solved by quantum computers and ensuring being quantum-proof  more: https://coincentral.com/what-is-neo-cryptocurrency/",False

Really impressive how you are updating the whitepaper ! Way to go.   While blockchain poses myriad opportunities to increase quality of life for virtually anyone in one way or another, operating as a decentralized organization presents inherent risk. With the birth of cryptocurrencies and exchanges, the barrier for investment decreased dramatically. The subsequent flood of currencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) entering the market has led to several economic boom and bust episodes.  A boom and bust episode occurs when a company experiences a significant rise and fall in asset prices that do not directly relate to the firm‚Äôs value or period1. With blockchain still in its infancy, very few currencies are mature enough to be traded based on their use case‚Äôs delivery of value or return of profits. Although a cryptocurrency exchange exists similarly to a stock exchange, until now cryptocurrencies have been traded solely on speculative basis, with little consideration for the actual value or potential profitability of the company.  imusify considers it a responsibility to present a cohesive document that allows us to escape the ‚Äúwhitepaper era‚Äù of blockchain and currency trading and into the era of real use and real value. While most whitepapers do not discuss the greater context of the blockchain economy, this analysis can be valuable to our readers by clarifying the inevitable uncertainty of an innovative venture like imusify, and by providing the necessary information for stakeholders and early adopters to make informed decisions.",False

The system‚Äôs streaming platform is also designed to allow artists to offer discounts to a group of fans or during a certain promotional period. Per-stream rewards are monitored by imusify to ensure that compliance standards and regulations for royalty payments are met in relevant jurisdictions.  Marketplace of Music Industry Participants imusify is a place for all aspiring entrepreneurs, artists, and industry members to network and create communities. This marketplace allows participants to execute transactions pertaining to various  business development or creative services and products including videography, production, advertising, content design, promotion and all other media-related or creative content. Product suppliers will also be able to list their products on the imusify marketplace to be sold directly to artists and supporters. An independent musician can now utilize this functionality by taking his earnings directly to the marketplace, and pay producers or engineers directly or update his home recording equipment without ever using a fiat currency.  Reward System In addition to rewarding artists for streaming royalties of their creative content (music), imusify‚Äôs reward system is designed to incentivize quality contribution and curation on the platform by rewarding creators of social content (posts, playlists, comments) for certain actions. To promote the sustainability of imusify‚Äôs ecosystem and motivate quality engagement between users, the reward model has been adapted to eliminate the need for a ‚Äúreward pool‚Äù of tokens by facilitating user-to-user rewards, as opposed to imusify-to-user rewards. For example, curators can be rewarded for high quality contribution by receiving micropayments (similar to the size of artist royalty rewards) each time users subscribe or share the curator‚Äôs playlist. This improved system poses several advantages, from eliminating the need to release new tokens into circulation from imusify, to reducing the possibility for the system‚Äôs manipulation by profiteers and scammers.  Decentralized Exchange In order for artists and various user types to interact intuitively with the platform and conveniently realize their payments and rewards, it is crucial for there to exist a simple and convenient means to exchange IMU tokens to fiat and other currencies. imusify will be  implement the NEON Exchange‚Äôs (NEX) API to offer an in-platform exchange functionality that allows imusify users to exchange their tokens to other forms of currency instantly.

It integrates the best practices of crowdfunding, streaming, media sharing, social networks, and management of the music value chain. The combination enables the musicians to fund the production of their music (Funding & Monetization), track the use of their content (Digital Rights Management), and be paid for plays and downloads via smart contracts (Payment Transparency); and the fans to support and enjoy the music of their favourite artist. Our unique value proposition is the use of blockchain ledgers to track content and smart contracts to automate the fair distribution of royalties. With the value of the global market for digital music exceeding 12,000,000,000 USD, it is hardly surprising that imusify must compete with some strong global players to acquire a market share. However, be it Spotify in the streaming services market, iTunes in the digital downloads market, or Pledge Music in crowdfunding of music projects market, none of these players are direct competitors of imusify. Our main advantage is in merging all of the services aforementioned on a powerful blockchain platform, thus allowing us to take a new approach towards solving the problems of digital rights management, transparency, and compensation. Furthermore, the incorporation of the elements of a social network and automation of rewards for activity results in unique user experience. Despite being ‚Äúartist-centric‚Äù, the imusify platform positions itself as an ecosystem in which all users are incentivised to play active roles in the ecosystem, rather than simply being recipients of the content. Such engagement will promote the longevity of imusify‚Äôs value to its users and support its relevance long into the future.  interesting business model",False

Social reality entails the collective beliefs and opinions of a group that result from interactions between individuals of the group. Existing in various forms, a narrative contains some form of plot that organizes certain characters and events, allowing the audience to come to a certain conclusion about the events and characters within the given narrative1. According to French philosopher Paul Ricoeur‚Äôs well-known Narrative Theory, narratives can configure our social reality because narratives configure narrative plots that refigure social events and thereby refigure our social reality2. From this perspective, we can begin to understand how narratives play a mediating role in configuring individual understanding and therefore defining a collective social reality. When humans interact with certain technologies, that interaction plays a role in an individual‚Äôs narrative understanding. For example, the presence of a technology such as an automobile shapes our understanding of how we travel from place to place. The car in this example plays a role in defining our experiences. The concept of the traditional narrative in text language can thus be extended to include technology as part of the narrative, a non-human character that leaves the reader (or interactor) with a different understanding of a certain reality after engaging with it. The car, using the previous example, can be defined as a fixed technological character, because it is a tool that plays the same role for various people within various narratives.  We can also perceive blockchain as a technological character within a narrative. However, blockchain technology differentiates itself from most previous technological innovations (with the exception of the internet and a few others) because it can exist as a fluid, rather than fixed character. We can not say that like a car, blockchain technology will take us from A to B, however, blockchain can uniquely serve many diverse roles for groups of human and non-human actors of different narratives. For example, imusify will use blockchain to serve as an interface and means of exchange between various narratives in the music industry. Other blockchain products use blockchain‚Äôs potential as a fluid character within a narrative  to align beliefs aroundenhancements to various other social realities, industries and governance sectors. With this in mind, we must begin viewing blockchain as not simply a piece of technology that shapes a single aspect of human experience, but rather as an important tool in defining the greater social reality that will emerge from human engagement with such technologies.  Given the potential of fluid technological characters  to shape human experiences, it is the moral responsibility of blockchain projects and use cases to engage in narratives that imagine a more favorable reality for their users. In imusify‚Äôs case, we imagine a world of music that is not limited by barriers to entry, geographic or cultural boundaries, or intermediary parties that strip control from artists and entrepreneurs in the space. This paper attempts to begin a narrative into how imusify will use blockchain as a fluid narrative technology to positively impact the future of music, both as an industry and a global voice. Imusify‚Äôs narrative begins in this paper, but its story will continue to grow through the evolution of the imusify platform and within the ecosystem that emerges alongside it. ",False

Artists can leverage their supporting network further by by providing affiliate licenses, allowing supporters to profit directly by promoting and selling the campaign‚Äôs content product.  Transparent and fair artist reward payments: By decentralizing rights management for artists, imusify is able to capitalize on a paid subscription service for artists while also maintaining transparency between transactions. With our platform, a new standard for ‚Äúroyalty‚Äù payment is created, where there is no need for rights organizations or collecting services. Ownership and use of content are monitored and stored on the blockchain and rewards are paid to artists using smart contracts, eventually eliminating the need for oversight by third party entities.  The marketplace of Music Industry Participants: imusify is a place for all aspiring entrepreneurs, artists, and industry members to network and create communities. Product suppliers and service providers can list list their products on the imusify marketplace of business development services and products including videography, production, advertising, content design, promotion and all other media-related or creative content. All transactions conducted within the marketplace use the IMU token for exchanging value.  Open innovation space: The imusify platform offers an innovation space to launch new products, features, tools, and services across the value chain of the music industry and beyond. How the app and platform is used is entirely up to the user: as a news app, as a messenger as a networking space, an incubator, a music curator, a place for trading goods and services, a discussion forum, or a unique combination of all of these functions that provide the most enjoyment for each user.  Co-evolutionary copyright management: Harnessing the security and immutability of imusify‚Äôs decentralised data ledger by using the NeoVM, imusify will provide adaptable tools that give artists complete control over their content and each revenue stream it generates. Artists can assign ownership rights to their content that can be divisible. An artist uploading a new song to the platform can recognize the contributions of songwriters, a band and others involved in the creation of a song by assigning them ownership rights. Once the new song generates revenue (as listeners stream it, film producers purchase the license to use it in their film), it will be distributed accordingly to the rights holders.  IMU Reward System: imusify‚Äôs reward system distributes funds from the IMU Reward Pool using a structure that builds quality engagement among users. The system rewards users for their current behaviors (as opposed to cumulative or historic contribution) to promote sustained activity to the platform and network. Artists, collaborators, and curators are rewarded for certain actions that promote user growth, base growth, and engagement with high quality content. Consumers are rewarded for high quality social interactions that improve/enhance the community. A detailed architecture of this reward system can be found in imusify‚Äôs whitepaper.",False

Let imusify help you find your creative voice, build a loyal following, discover great music, and reward your contribution.

If you are interested in the purchase of IMU tokens and need assistance, please first fill out the whitelist application form and reach out to us on this channel.  imusify has been built on NEO blockchain and development has been open-sourced until now, however recent multi-layered prototyping is being explored. Being a blockchain music company is not what differentiates imusify‚Äôs value, but rather its openness to constantly adapt and evolve with new technology and new ideas.  The imusify platform integrates the best practices of crowdfunding, streaming, media sharing, and social networks; creating an ecosystem, in which the artist, fans, and other stakeholders can directly interact with one another within a decentralized marketplace, governed by smart contracts. Blockchain ledgers allow for tracking the flow of content and smart contracts automate the fair distribution of pay-per-play/downloaded payouts.  imusify‚Äôs mission, is to provide an open-source innovation space for developing new means of music distribution, consumption, and engagement.

With annual streaming revenues increasing by 60.4% in 2016, music streaming now accounts for more than half of gloabl recorded music revenue1 . Unfortunately, through music‚Äôs rapid digitalization and growth of streaming services, certain corporations have manipulated certain legislations and leveraged the centralized nature of the industry to avoid paying artists fairly for their work. For example, analysis of global data from MiDIA Research showed that it takes 1,000 YouTube streams (an average of 58 streaming hours) to return $1 to the artist2 . With the average music video costing between $10,000-50,000, videos need to earn several millions of views to even begin to a profit. $1.7B in subscription and only $493M digital radio.",False

When engaging with a smart contract, an individual agrees to the function declaration of that contract. A function declaration simply defines a particular action that can occur within a set of parameterized limits. For example, when an imusify user purchases a song, they are agreeing with the function declaration to exchange a certain amount of cryptocurrency in exchange for a digital asset in the form of a song. Even in this basic example, the presence of a smart contract eliminates the need for a human intermediary or ‚Äúverifier‚Äù of the transaction. This smart contract therefore creates a new digital reality between users and artists where they can directly engage in a trustful fashion using smart contracts as mediators between such engagements.",False

In order to best understand how imusify will utilize blockchain to disrupt the music economy, it is important to first understand the evolution of blockchain technology, and the narratives that have emerged alongside it.  Blockchain was originally designed to instill a provable form of trust when conducting transactions, rendering the ‚Äútrusted intermediary‚Äù unnecessary. In 2009, ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù was born when Bitcoin‚Äôs genesis block was mined2. This meant that the first block of the first blockchain came into existence. ‚ÄúMining‚Äù refers to a process where computers collect a batch of transactions, encrypt them, and then use their computing power to confirm the group of transactions. Each group of transactions mined creates a new ‚Äúblock‚Äù in the blockchain. At this time, blockchain existed solely as the technology behind the Bitcoin cryptocurrency and for the next few years blockchain was only understood by a select group of early crypto enthusiasts. During this period, ideas as to how bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might deliver value began to emerge. People began paying for random goods and services in bitcoin, the excitement around its potential grew, and soon the speculative value of bitcoin began to rise. As the first blockchain startups emerged and a new network of investors was established, questions arose as to how blockchain infrastructure might play a role in updating aspects of the financial system. By late 2016, several proof of concepts had emerged and were later deemed impossible by the companies that sought to implement them. Despite the lack of success, more and more narratives and ideas emerged, and more cryptocurrencies sparked investment interest.  Today, blockchain‚Äôs network power has been a driving force in many blockchain narratives, including Bitcoin itself. Entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss presented a popular narrative about blockchain regarding how its network power acts to coordinate beliefs behind it4. Using the analogy of the telephone, Tyler explains this particular network power. If one person in the world owns a telephone, it holds no value. If two people own telephones, a value is created as those two people can now communicate with each other. The more people that have telephones, the greater the network value of the telephones become due to the exponential growth of potential communications that can take place amongst telephone owners. Bitcoin, he explains, operates the same way as a digital currency. The more people who hold it, the more value the currency has to serve as a means of exchange and a payment utility. This is an example of one of the primitive narratives that has led to speculative investments into bitcoin, even though the areas of value chains that bitcoin may enhance are still largely unproven.  1.

We will now examine at a high level the solutions that decentralization can provide to the global music industry.  Digital Rights Management Payment Transparency Licensing and Monetization  The network power of blockchain provides the opportunity to create a comprehensive digital rights management system that eliminates the need for latent payment reconciliation. Instead, with such a system consumption information can be shared automatically, offering universal transparency to artists, distributors and consumers.  Blockchain offers several added values to the transactional procedures that occur throughout the music supply chain. With a comprehensive database of consumption content and verified users, blockchain poses solutions for making automatic and transparent royalty payments, not only to single individuals but distributed to a song‚Äôs respective rights holders. This improved payment process can provide more information to artists about how their work is being consumed and exactly what and how they are being compensated.  With the presence of a decentralized database of content and ownership rights, artists have the opportunity to license and monetize content in exciting ways. Even small relatively unknown artists will have a marketplace where they can sell licenses for their work to be used in commercial videos, films, live events, and podcasts to name a few.   future in music industry is here!",False

From the perspective of platform architecture and product design, though, there is one overarching vision that encompasses all of the missions:  ‚ÄúAnything and anyone who adds value to the economy should be compensated by the economy, equitably, immediately and frictionlessly‚Äù Let‚Äôs explore that a bit from the perspective of two of the more common participants in the music industry.  The Artist As a generator of new art, be it musical, visual or lyrical, the Artist needs to have a way to profit from the sale of their art. This may sound crass to some of the more idealistic Artists and artisans out there, but it‚Äôs better to make your living doing what you love, that doing something you hate to put beer in the fridge and strings on your guitar. Following our vision, an artist publishing their work on our platform should be compensated for any use of their work equitably, immediately and without having to jump through any institutional hoops. If someone streams their song, the revenue (paid by the listener) should immediately show up in the artist‚Äôs wallet. This is just one of many ways our vision applies to the Artist, but hopefully you can extrapolate the others easily enough, or wait for the coming articles.  The Consumer Without the fans, listeners and audiophiles, there is no industry. Prior to our current Golden Age of Mankind, the average Musician was someone who had only one way to publish their art; live performance. (We‚Äôre talking pre-industrial era, here). Back in ye olde days, if you stopped to listen to a busker and were entertained, you dropped a farthing in the hat and moved on. A good musician generally fared better than a lousy one (they often were louse ridden too!), and the Consumer was always in control of where they bestowed their hard-earned shillings. With the advent of recording, radio, MTV, and finally digital distribution, the economic models changed, usually radically; we at imusify are hoping to change them one more time‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääby going BACK. We won‚Äôt go into why subscription models are unfair to both consumers and artists, nor any of the other injustices currently being perpetrated within the industry (not in this article, anyway).   when will be some update of progress - platform?  thank you very much for all informations i am serious investors and very interested in project",False

That said, most major exchanges allow the free exchange of any major cryptocurrency, which is why we settled on a single platform for our ICO, rather than multiple.  Since we are a dApp originally built on NEO, we chose this blockchain for very specific reasons that include the open-source international community of developers that make up the City of Zion. CoZ is not a corporation, or a consulting firm, but rather a community that shares knowledge and contributes to emerging projects. We at imusify, modeled our value proposition after this concept as we share both CoZ‚Äôs and NEO‚Äôs long-term vision.  Why NEO beats other ICO platforms: -- NEO is focussed on Smart Economy, not just Smart Contracts, with several key differentiators including; Planned integration with regulators and other institutions for transparency and regional/global acceptance. Proof of Stake, rather than Proof of Work, quantum proof consensus algorithm for both security and significantly higher transactional throughput. Broad international acceptance with, to date, no evidence of fraud. Core Accountability and Transparency features with several chain-based digital ID solutions already in progress. NEO smart contracts are very expensive to deploy, which means that there is much less likelihood of the ecosystem being polluted with scams and other distractions common to other ICO capable blockchains. NEO has a strong development community and currently supports C# and Python for Smart Contracts as well as integrations using C#, Python and JavaScript libraries.",False

The base asset of the NEO blockchain is the non-divisible NEO token which generates GAS tokens that can be used to pay for transaction fees generated by applications on the network.‚Äù (NEO (cryptocurrency)‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäWikipedia)  On the surface, it seems fundamentally identical to other dApp focussed blockchain platforms like Ethereum. It has, however, several differences that make it very attractive:  Why NEO beats other ICO platforms: NEO is focussed on Smart Economy, not just Smart Contracts, with several key differentiators including;  Planned integration with regulators and other institutions for transparency and regional/global acceptance. Proof of Stake, rather than Proof of Work, quantum proof consensus algorithm for both security and significantly higher transactional throughput. Broad international acceptance with, to date, no evidence of fraud. Core Accountability and Transparency features with several chain-based digital ID solutions already in progress. NEO smart contracts are very expensive to deploy, which means that there is much less likelihood of the ecosystem being polluted with scams and other distractions common to other ICO capable blockchains. NEO has a strong development community and currently supports C# and Python for Smart Contracts as well as integrations using C#, Python and JavaScript libraries.",False

The users IMU token balance, as well as their reputation level, is stored in the context of the smart contract on the immutable NEO blockchain. User actions on the web platform raise the users reputation level and this level, in turn, determines their IMU reward.  In more details, events on the web user interface (see below) are signaled to the Python middleware designed for this project, which then triggers a return. And indeed, the awarded amount is not determined by imusify but by the contract and the users level alone.  Beyond the NEP5 compliant method calls (like levelOf or transfer, which always enables users to freely exchange IMU tokens) the main chain of new methods of the imusify contract logic are as follows:  BigInteger LevelUp(byte[] account)  BigInteger RewardFunction(BigInteger level)  BigInteger Reward(byte[] account)  This is accompanied by the query  BigInteger LevelOf(byte[] account)  Simply call levelOf followed by any NEO address. Before the final release, anybody can test the reward trigger. To this end, similar to levelOf and balanceOf, call reward followed by a NEO address. In the source code above, the reward scheme is designed so that the curious developer can test the functionality and quickly witness the effect of a level raise. At a later point, the scheme will be scaled for long term incentification of users.

Since we are a dApp originally built on NEO, we chose this blockchain for very specific reasons that include the open-source international community of developers that make up the City of Zion. CoZ is not a corporation, or a consulting firm, but rather a community that shares knowledge and contributes to emerging projects.

Why NEO beats other ICO platforms: -- NEO is focussed on Smart Economy, not just Smart Contracts, with several key differentiators including; Planned integration with regulators and other institutions for transparency and regional/global acceptance. Proof of Stake, rather than Proof of Work, quantum proof consensus algorithm for both security and significantly higher transactional throughput. Broad international acceptance with, to date, no evidence of fraud. Core Accountability and Transparency features with several chain-based digital ID solutions already in progress. NEO smart contracts are very expensive to deploy, which means that there is much less likelihood of the ecosystem being polluted with scams and other distractions common to other ICO capable blockchains.

DJ/PRODUCER Online music platforms have been an integral part of any DJ/producer‚Äôs rise to fame. There have previously been problems with rightful owners of music getting their content taken down by their own record labels, which will be solved with imusify‚Äôs blockchain powered rights management system. The rights situation for mixes is fairly complicated, where the rights to play a song in front of a live audience, does not necessarily imply the right to share it online. N With music detection software a DJ can instantly pay the appropriate licenses for the tracks in the mix. Moreover, with the user curated channels and instant buying options, finding music while preparing sets has never been easier. Currently, many DJs discover music on Soundcloud, Spotify and other channels, and then have to find a way to buy this music in ultrahigh quality digital formats for use on large sound systems. With imusify this could all be done on one platform.  EMERGING RAPPER As the biggest influencer of mainstream commercial music for over 10 years, Hip Hop is inevitably going to be one of the biggest genres on imusify. Artists like Fat Nick, Lil Pump have are now touring the world after gaining fandom on Soundcloud. By using imusify, a talented rapper will earn œë IMU from the first moment his/her content becomes popular. Later, managers, bookers, and other content buyers can purchase the artist‚Äôs music right on the platform without any need for a record company.  CASUAL FILMMAKER The market for synchronization rights, or many different use licenses for music, lacks transparency and is not well developed online. The casual filmmaker can find music on imusify and seamlessly purchase the correct license with œë IMU, secured by the blockchain.  DISCOVERY GURU Everybody knows a person like this. He/she is always in the know of what‚Äôs new and cool. Everyone follows this person‚Äôs spotify and soundcloud accounts to see what is shared. This is an amazing skill that requires an enormous amount of time. This music lover invests gladly though because of the thrill of discovery and the goosebumps when hearing an amazing new track. Now, with imusify, this skill can be monetized for the first time. By becoming a curator on imusify, these gurus can get the recognition they deserve and monetize their efforts just by doing what they love. Along with artists, these users are the driving force behind imusify and they can now get compensated for their time and delivering high quality curated playlists.",False

We feel that NEO will be able to handle these transactions pretty handsomely.  We chose NEO for many reasons, EOS was not a viable option at the time, and ETH doesn't serve our long term needs. That said, most major exchanges allow the free exchange of any major cryptocurrency, which is why we settled on a single platform for our ICO, rather than multiple.  Since we are a dApp originally built on NEO, we chose this blockchain for very specific reasons that include the open-source international community of developers that make up the City of Zion. CoZ is not a corporation, or a consulting firm, but rather a community that shares knowledge and contributes to emerging projects. We at imusify, modeled our value proposition after this concept as we share both CoZ‚Äôs and NEO‚Äôs long-term vision.  Why NEO beats other ICO platforms: -- NEO is focussed on Smart Economy, not just Smart Contracts, with several key differentiators including; Planned integration with regulators and other institutions for transparency and regional/global acceptance. Proof of Stake, rather than Proof of Work, quantum proof consensus algorithm for both security and significantly higher transactional throughput. Broad international acceptance with, to date, no evidence of fraud. Core Accountability and Transparency features with several chain-based digital ID solutions already in progress. NEO smart contracts are very expensive to deploy, which means that there is much less likelihood of the ecosystem being polluted with scams and other distractions common to other ICO capable blockchains.

In order to best understand how imusify will utilize blockchain to disrupt the music economy, it is important to first understand the evolution of blockchain technology, and the narratives that have emerged alongside it. Blockchain was originally designed to instill a provable form of trust when conducting transactions, rendering the ‚Äútrusted intermediary‚Äù unnecessary. In 2009, ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù was born when Bitcoin‚Äôs genesis block was mined2 . This meant that the first block of the first blockchain came into existence. ‚ÄúMining‚Äù refers to a process where computers collect a batch of transactions, encrypt them, and then use their computing power to confirm the group of transactions. Each group of transactions mined creates a new ‚Äúblock‚Äù in the blockchain. At this time, blockchain existed solely as the technology behind the Bitcoin cryptocurrency and for the next few years blockchain was only understood by a select group of early crypto enthusiasts. During this period, ideas as to how bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might deliver value began to emerge. People began paying for random goods and services in bitcoin, the excitement around its potential grew, and soon the speculative value of bitcoin began to rise. As the first blockchain startups emerged and a new network of investors was established, questions arose as to how blockchain infrastructure might play a role in updating aspects of the financial system. By late 2016, several proof of concepts had emerged and were later deemed impossible by the companies that sought to implement them. Despite the lack of success, more and more narratives and ideas emerged, and more cryptocurrencies sparked investment interest3 . Today, blockchain‚Äôs network power has been a driving force in many blockchain narratives, including Bitcoin itself. Entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss presented a popular narrative about blockchain regarding how its network power acts to coordinate beliefs behind it4 . Using the analogy of the telephone, Tyler explains this particular network power. If one person in the world owns a telephone, it holds no value. If two people own telephones, a value is created as those two people can now communicate with each other. The more people that have telephones, the greater the network value of the telephones become due to the exponential growth of potential communications that can take place amongst telephone owners. Bitcoin, he explains, operates the same way as a digital currency. The more people who hold it, the more value the currency has to serve as a means of exchange and a payment utility. This is an example of one of the primitive narratives that has led to speculative investments into bitcoin, even though the areas of value chains that bitcoin may enhance are still largely unproven.  from the whitepaper, good text to read. First we all have to understand blockchain than later other things.",False

Let imusify help you find your creative voice, build a loyal following, discover great music, and reward your contribution. In today‚Äôs music industry, money speaks louder than ever. The rapid digitalization of music has led to a wide range of avenues for monetizing content. The problem, however, is that the music industry was built as a centralized system for physical distribution. This was more practical in the 1970s when there was no internet and record labels were distributing actual records. This centralized system was not designed for today‚Äôs digital world and its outdated structure creates multiple inefficiencies in the music value chain. Fortunately, we now have the technology to begin to decentralize the music industry, providing increased value to artists, consumers, and other industry players.  imusify is one of the pioneers of music‚Äôs decentralization movement. Other blockchain music projects also show leadership in tackling certain inefficiencies such as event booking and copyright management. However, what sets imusify apart is that it aims to serve different shareholders and players across the entire music value chain, including crowdsourcing, collaboration, production, distribution, promotion, curation, live events and more. While existing blockchain music projects address several current pitfalls of the music industry, imusify is designing for the future. We are building a scalable and adaptable technology framework for artists, music lovers, entrepreneurs and developers to use our platform to connect with the imusify community, create collaborative content and build new use cases.

That said, most major exchanges allow the free exchange of any major cryptocurrency, which is why we settled on a single platform for our ICO, rather than multiple.  Since we are a dApp originally built on NEO, we chose this blockchain for very specific reasons that include the open-source international community of developers that make up the City of Zion. CoZ is not a corporation, or a consulting firm, but rather a community that shares knowledge and contributes to emerging projects. We at imusify, modeled our value proposition after this concept as we share both CoZ‚Äôs and NEO‚Äôs long-term vision.  Why NEO beats other ICO platforms: -- NEO is focussed on Smart Economy, not just Smart Contracts, with several key differentiators including; Planned integration with regulators and other institutions for transparency and regional/global acceptance. Proof of Stake, rather than Proof of Work, quantum proof consensus algorithm for both security and significantly higher transactional throughput. Broad international acceptance with, to date, no evidence of fraud. Core Accountability and Transparency features with several chain-based digital ID solutions already in progress. NEO smart contracts are very expensive to deploy, which means that there is much less likelihood of the ecosystem being polluted with scams and other distractions common to other ICO capable blockchains. NEO has a strong development community and currently supports C# and Python for Smart Contracts as well as integrations using C#, Python and JavaScript libraries.
