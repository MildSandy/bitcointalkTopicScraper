Content creators (“CREs”) ... Content publishers (“PUBs”) ... Advertisers (“ADVs”) and Retailers / affiliate remuneration channels (“RETs”) ... The Audience (“AUD”) ... Human Sentient Interactive Verifier (“SIV”) A SIV is a participant that performs a screening service within the IVEP protocol on behalf of PUB, ADV or RET. His role is to verify that content respects the guidelines of a PUB, an ADV or a RET who has hired SIVs for the purpose of filtering offensive or inappropriate content based on a unique protocol consensus model. As his/her Trust Score grows, he may be responsible for more complex tasks such as ensuring the content available for monetization by a PUB is on-brand for an ADV or RET. Video content screening is a massive challenge for online platforms such as YouTube which plans to increase their content screening force to 10,000 by the end of 2018. The SIV consensus model used within IVEP could represent a solution for all video platforms by leveraging AUD members as an alternative or complementary means for content screening, at a fraction of the cost.""  So can we discuss a bit how they actually solved the content management? I like this idea of a Verifier of sorts which adheres to some guidelines. I wish someone from dev could explain a bit more how this will work.",False

In reality no industry is safe from the revolution that blockchain technology is bringing upon us. If your industry deals with data or transactions, you will be affected.  Take a business like digital marketing. Most would assume that blockchain technology would not create a big shift in such an industry right off the bat. However, dive into the details and you’ll see that the rise of blockchain has had an undeniable impact on the marketing world. The main pivotal areas can be summed up through changes in trust, customer experience and branding.  The trust and transparency between brands and their consumers has drastically shifted. On both consumer and company sides, blockchain has begun to transform the way that business is performed. From a company lens, the way that ads are purchased could radically change with the implementation of blockchain technology. Companies may soon be able to buy them directly and only pay once they actually reach their target consumers. Technology is becoming available to create specific tokens to track consumer interaction with an ad. In addition, the charge could be based on the mental effort or quality of attention the customer gives the ad. Using blockchain, companies can mitigate the risk of advertising to fake accounts or bots on various social platforms and target only real consumers. This alone can save companies millions of advertising dollars.  As for customers, the blockchain’s extensive data management capabilities will enable products to be tracked from all stages of the supply chain process. From a customer’s perspective, this creates massive transparency and brand building. Marketers can leverage this transparency to build trust among their target consumers.  All digital transformation is about improving customer experience. If you drill down, it is all about customer targeting, right? Every company should have their target profile of a client. Currently, companies can only get bits and pieces of the profile from various sources. Does this build a true and accurate customer profile? Who knows. With the use of blockchain, there is potential opportunity for companies to get a more accurate profile from a customer in just one simple transaction.  To up the ante, customers could actually charge companies for their information. An example of this could be when a customer signs up for a newsletter. Perhaps they set the rate at which the company can purchase their data, which would then be paid to them through a select cryptocurrency. By being compensated for their data it is a win/win for both parties. This process will enable the company to create a more accurate picture of their target customer and be able to better craft the experience tailored to them. It will also save plenty of money that would have been wasted marketing to those outside of their target.  Everything a company does will affect and create aspects of their brand. Take the use of blockchain to create digitized and agreed-upon goals in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), or perhaps just the acceptance of a company to recognize Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as legal tender for purchases? These actions that leverage the technology create brand trust and paint a picture of a modern, forward-thinking and frankly a friendlier, and trustworthy organization.  Right now, change and advancement go hand-in-hand with blockchain technology. Considering how fast these changes can happen, it is important for digital marketers to become aware of the technology and impacts that it could have on their career. Marketing professionals should consider brainstorming ways that their organization can get ahead of the curve and leverage these tools to increase trust, customer experience, and ultimately their brand as a whole.  https://medium.com/dubtokens/blockchain-changing-the-game-of-digital-marketing-2dc8f3446dde",False

Have you asked the question, “What exactly is an ICO?” recently? If so, you’re not alone. These days it’s hard to keep all the buzzwords like Cryptocurrency, Blockchain, Bitcoin, AI, — the list goes on — flying around Silicon Valley straight. But as hundreds of startups have raised billions in fundraising dollars over the past two years alone, this exciting new crypto world is quickly proving itself as the future of startup fundraising and new shared-prosperity business models.  Before we get to ICOs, let’s quickly review the concept of cryptocurrency. A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured through cryptography, and what makes cryptocurrency special is it’s not issued or influenced by banks or government entities. If cryptocurrency had a motto it might be: ‘Just say no to the middleman’  Okay, back to ICOs. An ICO is a new fundraising method based on cryptocurrency. A few things happen when a company (or very often a non-profit entity promoting open source software) does an ICO:  -A new cryptocurrency (individually referred to as a token or coin) is introduced into the market. Our cryptocurrency is called a dubtoken.  -Cryptocurrencies are distributed to people within a company’s ICO in exchange for currencies like Bitcoin or Ether.  -Holders of cryptocurrency can then use the protocol, apps and services introduced by the ICO project and grow the ecosystem for the benefit of all participants. For example, dubtoken holders become members of the non-profit association overseeing the Interactive Video and Experience Protocol (IVEP) , which gives them the right and limited license to use the IVEP together with the underlying services offered by the community through a newly introduced decentralized application store (dApp Store). Members can then be further incentivized with additional dubtokens if they contribute to the growth of the protocol, its apps and services.  With the introduction of IVEP, we’re on a mission to fix the broken link between advertisers, publishers, and consumers by tapping into the full potential of interactive video content. If you’re new here, check out our IVEP white paper series for detailed background, and keep your eyes peeled for our ICO starting soon!  https://medium.com/dubtokens/what-is-an-initial-coin-offering-ico-10a40c34fd17",False

We are attempting to provide you with details and information from the people who are creating projects, and we are not giving advice. Please do proper due diligence when considering investments.    Today we talk with Fred Dionne from DubDub. As the web becomes increasingly cluttered with out of touch content, invalid traffic and pointless attention based metrics, advertisers, content creators and publishers struggle to find the proper way to reach consumers. Sensory and content overload make it almost impossible to captivate and monetize audiences looking for targeted experiences.  By introducing the Interactive Video and Experience Protocol (IVEP), we look to reimagine the interactions among the participants involved in the digital experience ecosystem. The IVEP introduces digital layers which sit on top of any streamable content on the Internet and overlays hundreds of new interactive smart objects and functions that can be customized in real time to create the next generation of interactive experiences and significantly increase end user engagement. Nine brands out of ten expect to compete primarily on customer experience rather than price and product as the key brand differentiator. Customer experience is the new battlefield.  The IVEP’s economy will be tokenized and centered around dubtokens. A dubtoken is a multi-faceted unit of account offered to members of the IVEP Crypto Association with various utility, consumptive, trust, governance, transfer, growth incentive and loyalty attributes. Its holder has the right and limited license to use the IVEP protocol together with the underlying services offered by the community through a newly introduced decentralized application store (dApp Store).  https://thebitcoinpodcast.com/announcements-dubtoken/",False
