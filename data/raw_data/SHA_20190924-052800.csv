Good passwords are hard to memorize and can not be transferred, not in a legal manner anyway, from you to your relatives. This password can be anything, from Facebook, to Gmail, or any other important account. If you want to be sure that your digital legacy does not die with you, and that your relatives can access those accounts even when you are not there anymore, store them through Safe Haven on the blockchain using one of our Share distribution protocols.  With Safe Haven‚Äôs Vault, you have the possibility to protect any digital asset (cryptokeys/seeds/passwords) on our blockchain. The release of the shares happens by the initiator himself, or he can even add a watchdog mechanism that transfers the shares to another user of our platform in an autonomous way. One example of the conditions that can be set are ""keep-alive"" functions. Smart contracts are triggered once the contracts are overdue and monitoring stops.   What is the Safe Haven Investment Circle?  The Investment Circle is for those willing to create a fund amongst friends, family members or business stakeholders. Let‚Äôs say that 5 friends want to invest in crypto-currencies, and buy each for $1000. What are their options? Creating a multi-sig wallet (with all the flaws that were discovered lately). Even when it‚Äôs completely secure, you will always need trust within the group... Ok, how are we going to manage this? Simple! Through Safe Haven‚Äôs Share Distribution protocol. You encrypt the private key and we split the passphrase into shares, the stakeholders will receive equally the same number of shares. If we consider the formula without a fail-safe mechanism, we have ùëá = (y. n ‚àí 1) + (X. n) , T = (2 -1) + (2.5) = 1 + 10 = 11 shares to distribute where 1 will be stocked on the block chain via the validator (legal entity). The conditions, in order to liberate this share, can be anything from price thresholds, to milestones, to simply having a 100 % consensus to do so. Again, the possibilities are endless.",False

This is deliberately implemented by nefarious developers to cheat their own buyers out of their ETH. Other times it's unintentional, and the issues are actually programming errors. eBTCold is an example where through a programming error, there is accidental infinite printing. eDOGE is another example, which had a centralized locking mechanism that prevented trading, and allowed for manipulation of the market.

Quote Is there any bonus or something of that kind? Really interesting in this project, so need to know more! Our original pre ICO prices were 1 ETH/2000 SHA. The updated prices are as follows: When ETH is above 1,000 USD the ratio will be 2,000 SHA/1,000 USD (Note, when ETH is under 1,000 USD prices remain 1 ETH/2000 SHA).  So say ETH reaches $1,500 by the time the pre-ICO, you will receive 3,000 SHA if you put in 1 ETH, because you will be receiving 2,000 SHA for the 1,000 USD amount and 1,000 SHA for the additional 500 USD.   In ICO the price will be higher by about 35% (1ETH < 1000$ then 1 ETH/1500 SHA; 1ETH >= 1000$ then 1000$/1500SHA). So, you can get a nice bonus by buying tokens at the pre-ICO stage.",False

Please take your time to evalute and reply to them.   - What is the difference between what you offer and printing a paper wallet, cutting it in pieces, and distributing it?  The whitepaper shows no sign of doing anything other than this action. You take a pass/seed/key/..., encrypt it using a non-secure algorithm, cut it up in a bunch of pieces, and then the users must distribute it to family, friends, whatsoever.  Users can do this for free, using online paper wallets.  - What is the purpose of the lawyer?  If, for example, my keys are distributed amongst my brother, sister, mother, and the lawyer. Then what is his purpose in this game? What if my sister and brother have a car accident and 2/4 parts are missing, then what use does your lawyer has, given the fact that you clearly lack redundancy.  How can he help you further if a part of the key is missing, and why do you even need him? What happens when the lawyers vanishes from the planet?   - Redundancy issues  As said before, the encryption algorithm you choose, has 0.0 redundancy build in. One missing piece of the puzzle, and the funds are locked forever.   - Blockchain usage  There is not a single point in your whitepaper that clearly outlines why you need - or use - a blockchain. To store a part of the key. Great story! But, if there's already a legal guy in the game, then is this action really needed? Or is it just a part of your plan to 'integrate blockchain technology' in an attempt to create an elaborate ICO smart contract?  At most complex level, it takes 4 lines of code to store a hash on the blockchain, doesn't sound that complicated, does it?  So then again, why do you even need a blockchain - or given it's low level usage, why do you claim to have a blockchain based product?  It's only an addition, it has no real purpose or value for your services.   Please don't take this as negative comment, i'm clearly outlining everything youput in your whitepaper.    On top of that, i have some remarks regarding your branding and marketing:  Why did you use the same font, colors, design style as DigiPulse project? Is it to surf along on their success?  Why does your comparison chart doesn't make any sense when comparing against a competitor? You seem to be lifting yourself high off the ground, and breaking down other competitors, while you hardly use any technology at all (see above). To be honest, I can't even consider you a competitor in this niche market before you're able to reply my concerns mentioned above.  Your chart talks about having your own blockchain and wallet. Where is it? Can we see it? Why would you even have it? To store 1 hash ?     TL;DR  I hoped to see a healthy competitor for digital inheritance, but you've shown nothing but cutting a piece of paper in parts and distributing them.  Your whitepaper is full with unclear sections that simply don't add up.  I hear you talking about 'alpha version', is that for a smart contract with 4 lines of code to store a simple hash?  Please, use your own style, and stop stealing it from others.  Until now, this ICO has all the red flags for users to do their own due dilligence. Do your own homework but never ignore red flags.

Trust ‚Ä¢If you do this, you give the right to the other people to bypass you, to access your funds the day that they could have bad intentions. If they merge there physical pieces together they can access your assets. ‚Ä¢By using Safe Haven‚Äôs platform, the circle of trust is created by our eco-system that merges the initiator, stakeholders and the legal entities as a whole. No one can act alone, they only can act together. ‚Ä¢it‚Äôs not because you trust your heir today, that will still be the case tomorrow.  Secure ‚Ä¢Our TFC SD Protocol is one of the most secure secret key sharing protocols out there as we use state of the art encryption algorithms/ciphers. ‚Ä¢Blockchain‚Äôs are theoretically not quantum proof, so if the network should be compromised and only the validator share & fail safe share is stored on the blockchain the complete key will never be able to be merged as the other missing shares will be located off-chain. ‚Ä¢The few shares that will be stored on the blockchain will be stored in a decentralized database which will once again reach the security to a higher level. ‚Ä¢The shares given to the heirs/stakeholders are off chain shares stored on a hardware wallet or by a distribution of certificates (this depends on the chose bundle by the parent/initiator.  Service ‚Ä¢The heirs/stakeholders will be guided by SafeHaven in order to be able to merge the shares. Procedures will be written so that everyone will be able to re-establish the Private keys/seeds protected by the parent/initiator. ‚Ä¢Protection plans that SafeHaven in conjunction with the TAN will offer.  - What is the purpose of the lawyer?  If you have read the White Paper like you say you did, you should see there is a TFC SD Fail-safe Protocol: The remaining shares will be used a sort of ""fail-safe"" share. This can be useful in the case that of one of the n (players/children) lost his share, becomes unable to act rightful or dies. Our protocol provides a separate ‚Äúbackup‚Äù smart contract on the blockchain with different conditions written in. The fail-safe shares can‚Äôt be given, under any circumstances, to one of the n (players/children) as this would jeopardize the complete operation setup by the dealer (parent), as in use case 2 (3 children + 1 validator) the children can‚Äôt construct the secret share without the validators share (through blockchain Smart Contract query) but when you give the backup shares, they will be able to do so. The only case where we don‚Äôt have a fail-safe share is when we need a consensus of 100% of the stakeholder, for instance the use case 1 (1 child + 1validator).  What happens when the lawyers vanishes from the planet?  The Back up Validators Share: ‚Ä¢ No one is immortal, neither are the legal entities participating in our Alliance Program. That‚Äôs why we provide the opportunity to establish a network of trust containing more than 1 validator. ‚Ä¢ When you chose several validators to be involved, we push a backup smart contract in the blockchain that holds the necessary shares, n (players/children) -1, that can be used by a second validator. ‚Ä¢ By doing this we offer a system of security which is completely derived from share distribution and validation.  - Redundancy issues  The TFC SD Fail-safe Backup Share and The Back up Validators Share gives all the redundancy you need...  - Blockchain usage  Why not blockchain usage? The use of blockchain technology, smart contracts, decentralization is why we all got into this world of crypto in the first place. Also from their ""SHA Protection Plans"" an EXAMPLE of not using the TAN: The Business Continuity plan is quite similar to the TFC, the main difference is that we speak about stakeholders instead of children and that the validation process is different in terms of share unlocking. In a BCP the notary does not need medical rustication documents to obtain the missing share through our services, but rather notarial acts prepared by himself. The initiator can also choose whether to include our TAN (Trust Alliance Network) or have an entirely automated process.  If you review the SHA Protection Plan ( https://safehaven.io/files/SafeHaven_Protection_Plans.pdf ) you'll realize there are more options then what you think.  Why did you use the same font, colors, design style as DigiPulse project? Is it to surf along on their success?  This is 100% false and anyone can verify that in 10 seconds by going to each website. If you had taken time to actually read the White Paper, you would realize the difference between the two products and the superiority of Safe Haven's project.  Why does your comparison chart doesn't make any sense when comparing against a competitor? You seem to be lifting yourself high off the ground, and breaking down other competitors, while you hardly use any technology at all (see above). To be honest, I can't even consider you a competitor in this niche market before you're able to reply my concerns mentioned above.   If you had read the White Paper like you mentioned in your first line, we would have both saved a lot of time here. Please instead of spreading FUD, do your due diligence and review these answers (taken from the White Paper), then read the White Paper again.  On top of that, the co-founder was working at a pub until recently. http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/e83da2vb  Other than this just being an obvious pity stab at the creators, this statement alone just justifies your lack of attention to detail...I don't read or understand what I'm assuming is Dutch, but I can read the date on top of the article as ""28/07/2011"", now correct me if I am wrong, but in Dutch...that means ""year"" 2011?

I have already sent the email to get the response over the KYC, but just for other users, I will like to hear why not have direct KYC instead of first submitting email process.  As for the bonus, I think it is good to have the price adjusting according to ETH price. It is seen too much previously that many ICOs don‚Äôt have this kind of system in place. Which means they continue giving us same amount even if the value of the purchased option increases, which is just so unfair.
