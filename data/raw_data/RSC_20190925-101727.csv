My sincerest gratitude to you all.  Our life doesn’t even amount to a fraction of an instant compared to the time since Earth was created. My life as a soccer player is even shorter compared to that. What can I do in such a short moment of time?  I lost my father when I was young and experienced despair. However, my brother Assis was like a father figure for me and protected me. I was supported by so many other people too, which brings me to where I am now. This is why I was able to become a soccer player and receive the Ballon D’or. I was able to meet a lot of people through soccer and I live a happy life.  I will now retire as a soccer player.  Ever since I thought of retiring, I started to think about my life after retirement. I also thought of what I can do. Soccer has always been a part of my life. Also, I have a passion for music. Soccer and music crosses borders, language, time and is a common culture across the world.  From now, out of gratitude, I want to deliver dreams, hope and smiles to people around the world through soccer and music.  I want to bring a smile to as many people as possible through this project. I wish as many people as possible will have dream and hope and become happy. I wish to contribute to the world as much as I can during my short life.
