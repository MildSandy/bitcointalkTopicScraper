Currently, transactions don’t settle in real-time on the blockchain and merchants that accept cryptocurrency are limited which cause roadblocks in mass adoption. The STK Token will be used as an utility in the STACK app to enable real-time transactions with cryptocurrency through the use of state channels. State channels are a technique for making off-chain transactions with almost the same security guarantees as an on-chain operation. It provides the speed required for STACK’s point of sale purchase mechanism: at the moment of purchase, the user sends STK Tokens to STACK in exchange for STACK using their liquidity pool to make a fiat purchase through MasterCard.  https://medium.com/stk-token/stk-to-use-chainlink-to-bridge-real-life-data-with-blockchain-e960df06ca3a",True

User experience is extremely important for mass adoption. Our latest development in the smart contracts can dramatically improve the UX by abstracting the wrapping and unwrapping of ETH.  In the blockchain space, the number of users using Decentralized applications are relatively low. There are a number of factors influencing this, including the unfamiliarity of the new type of technology. The flow for everyday applications and Decentralized applications are simply different, as Dapps require signing and authorization of transactions. In many cases, the difference in execution makes the user flow cumbersome and clunky.  It is incredibly important to think about the user experience in all facets of building out technology — from the frontend to the set of smart contracts. Just because ETH and ERC20 Tokens are structurally different, doesn’t mean users need to know about the difference. From our point of view, the end-user should be able to interact with ETH the same way they would any ERC20 token. https://medium.com/stk-token/automated-contract-wrapping-and-unwrapping-of-eth-41499d402f01",True

Benefits like global accessibility, decentralization, autonomy from localized markets make cryptocurrency an attractive alternative, but a lack of liquidity and the volatility of cryptocurrency markets make it difficult to provide the security required to gain traction for everyday use.  STK was created to provide a seamless solution to instant cryptocurrency payments at point of sale through the STACK wallet. Our platform allows instant payments at point of sale so you can use your cryptocurrency as easily as you would your debit card or cash.  Simultaneously, we’ve seen firsthand the need for stability on the blockchain. This is addressed through innovation in stablecoins — created to address the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, independent of the swings of altcoins, BTC or ETH. This makes them a more viable option for consumers looking for a reliable store of value, or medium of ongoing exchange. They share the same advantages as other cryptocurrencies — decentralization and global accessibility without the risk associated with other altcoins.  Maker, a decentralized autonomous organization on the Ethereum blockchain has created a solution to cryptocurrency volatility with the development of the stable token Dai — a stable currency that is pegged against the U.S. Dollar. MakerDAO has created the Dai Stablecoin System, a decentralized platform that runs on the Ethereum blockchain.  Today we’re announcing our partnership with Maker to integrate their Dai Stablecoin into our STK platform, providing the first cryptocurrency payments platform with stablecoin accessibility. STK will allow users to transact with Dai tokens through the STACK wallet at more than 37 million merchants worldwide.  Our mission is to help make cryptocurrency a globally accessible form of payment. Adding the security of a stablecoin to the instant liquidity provided by the STK platform provides a safe and secure range of options to spend your cryptocurrency how and when you want, regardless of changing market conditions.  Until now, the majority of volume in crypto transactions have been for investment or trading purposes. As blockchain technology continues to advance and more DAPPs are launched into the market, we’re working towards mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency so your money is instantly available, globally accepted and always there when you need it.  We’re proud to welcome MakerDAO to our platform as our first additional coin option. We’ll be announcing more tokens and features in the coming months.",True

One of the most frequently asked questions is around our competitive advantage and what differentiates us from others tackling cryptocurrency payments at point of sale. We love this question. It gives us an excuse to talk about what sets us apart, and as our friends and families would be quick to tell you, we’ll take any excuse we can get.  There is good progress being made in the crypto payments space and we’re happy to be part of a growing movement towards enabling real time payments using Ether, BTC, and other cryptocurrencies.  We think we’re pretty unique in the market, but a key differentiator is that while competitors in the space are working towards new technology supporting crypto-to-fiat payments at point of sale, our platform is already built. We have a working prototype, tested in multiple countries around the world, and our partnership with STACK provides immediate access to more than 33 million merchants around the world. Many companies looking to provide similar functionality are working towards solutions which require onboarding individual merchants with new technology, while we’re plugging in to an existing network with a global payment network which requires no merchant buy-in or added infrastructure. This will enable instant access to merchants across the globe as soon as your STACK account is activated.  Our partnership with STACK provides a series of additional benefits, including access to a digital account that you can use for local currency as well as crypto so you can save, spend or share your money straight from your smartphone. STACK is currently in private beta, scheduled to launch a public beta early next month. You can learn more about STACK here.  We could go on (and on, and on) but we’ll keep it short and sweet.

One of the main drivers was the Bitcoin Segwit2x fork which was at the time (prior to its cancellation) compelling most of the accredited/institutional investors who we had verbal commitments from to hold their existing crypto positions.  With the fork out of the way, there is more liquidity now in the market and are now back in the conversation with these potential investors. It's also quite obvious that the ICO market is not the same as it was back in the summer so it's taking us longer than expected to close on presale contributors. This additional time also gives us the ability to continue to go out there and promote our project.  We are in Singapore this week at the Singapore Fintech Festival and are speaking at the North America Blockchain Expo in Silicon Valley at the end of the month.  Additionally, due to current environment, the feedback from the general community was that we had to revisit our terms and scale back our token supply, hard cap and minimum buy-in amount which we have done.   The public sale now begins December 11th.  If we had kept the same duration, the tail end of the sale would've overlapped with Christmas and the holiday season.  We thought it would make sense to extend it 2 weeks past January should there be contributors who were away for the holidays or didn't have access to a computer during the sale period.  I hope this answers your questions/concerns.  Nick",True

The STK token provides access to a payment channel between a crypto wallet and a 3rd party liquidity provider. This liquidity provider holds a reserve of local currency. Initially, the liquidity provider will be STACK. When making a purchase using STK tokens, STK obtains a signed transaction from the customer promising to send cryptocurrency from their wallet to STACK’s wallet. STACK then pays for the purchase from it’s own local currency reserve, using the existing payment rails.  Normally a transfer of say Ethereum is validated by miners, but Stack seems to be saying they will short circuit this process? Is that right?  Otherwise how will it be instantaneous?  On what basis does stack accept the promise?",True
