A transmedia game in Blockchain has tremendous potential and Forever Has Fallen can change our perspective on future video games and media presentations. A blockchain is the basis of almost all crypto currencies. It is a database technology that shares information with accounting and verifying the information. In the case of blockchain gameification, it records transactions and player progress, validates ownership of in-game goods and ownership of collections. Smart contracts written to block chain codes will make it easier to earn revenues within the platform. Forever Token, Forever Has Fallen ecosystem to make it easier to play in the game, will also be the key to the process of playing. Forever Token is likely to be exempt from a number of regulatory mistakes we see in the area of crypto-currency today, because it is created as a service Coini. Using Existing Technologies Forever Has Fallen uses existing technologies to limit the risk. The platform is one of the reasons why it is built on Ethereum, a blockchain established with Dapps and intelligent contracts that are already functioning. Smart contracts will allow interaction between new spouses as they switch users and win prizes. Players will be able to earn Forever Coin by playing games, introducing games, making friends, visiting physical places, or completing tasks. Online / Offline Economy Forever Has Fallen economy will work both online and offline. The online economy will mostly work with the platform Token Forever Coin. Users will be rewarded with Forever Coin when they complete their quests in the game and at the same time will be able to trade Forever Coin with their in-game digital products Forever Coin, or trade Forever Coins on a trading platform or other cryptographic currency. Business Moderated Forever Has Fallen divides the coin allocation into two phases. In stage 1; It allocates 35% of token supply for traditional token buyers. Token sales will increase interest and awareness in the project. In stage 2, it allocates 45% of the token for the community to play the game. This large number of tokens reserved for players; the community and the game grow over time. The founding team will have a locked token allocation for two years, which will encourage the team to deliver the game within 12 months.",False

The overall wild west attitudes still prevail and proceeding with the public token sale would have harmed or even killed the project.   Our world class business model and innovation stands above current ICO offerings. The vast majority of the offerings are catering to people who only want speculation, and not to build anything. The Forever Has Fallen project has always maintained we are community oriented and our strategy is to work with sophisticated/accredited investors to provide the funding and support we require to make this project successful. We owe it to ourselves and to our supporters to take this strategy and move away from the mass of garbage ICOs.   Because our business model does not rely on speculation, we have found this to be at odds with the so-called traditional ‘investor’ community (speculators) and out-of-step with real investors. The Forever Has Fallen concept is a game changer for the game/entertainment industry. Our value proposition to people who buy our tokens requires us to create a market they can sell to. This market we want to create is not one of speculators, but of gamers who want to play our game.    The tokens for our bounty and airdrop campaigns will still be distributed as per previous deadlines and allocations. These campaigns are no longer accepting new participants as from 1 May 2018. Additionally, the tokens will not be listed on exchanges until after the project is launched. While you will have to hold on to them for now, the longer-term perspective ensures the project will continue, prosper and be listed on exchanges in the future. When they are listed, you can count on the price to be quite high and that there will be a market of gamers eager to buy them.   We hope you share the same vision for Forever Has Fallen as we do and that you recognise this decision is in the best interests of the business and for anyone who has ownership of Forever Coin tokens.

This is exactly what nixoid done for Ambisafe organized scam ICO's & is probably the same person - Andrey Zamovsky (aka nixoid, ColorlessK, FintechEU, etc, etc)  Bountyhive is an exact clone of Ambisafe by the same group of scammers - you have been warned.

This is beyond childish. You posted a negative review, which literally anyone can do without it being true whatsoever. 2. You then screenshotted your own review and use it as an argument, I don't even want to start on this. 3. I have absolutely no connection to Ambisafe whatsoever. 4. To date my team has distributed over $15.000.000 in Bounties, what have you done? 5. I have paid participants from my own pocket countless times when ICOs refused to do so. You got it mate. I'm paying people myself because I'm a scam. Too bad there's no clap emoticon on btctalk. 6. I had run Worldcore Bounty more than 3 months ago and did it so at the request of the team. Everyone was paid. And besides, they only worked with Ambisafe for a short amount of time, until they fired them to work with us(just in case you don't see the flaw in your logic here)   Now, leaving all of those things aside, you tried to pull this thing again a few months ago when you gave me a review from one of your other accounts ""IconFirm"" - to which I responded and it is why that account is now red-trusted.  So then you went and created a new account and gave over 200 bad reviews to random people for bogus reasons.  Now you come and accuse me with over 36+ green trust of another bogus invented thing. You are ludicrous mate. Also, since we're making photos anyway.   First, the red trust ratings you have on this account:   Second, the red trust ratings you have on the old account:   Now, besides the fact that you literally positive trusted your own accounts and it is so obvious that even a toddler could realize it.  Let's look at my trust ratings. Let's completely drop the fact that I have a +36 green trust rating and you have -2 red rating on most accounts  In all my history I have received 3 bad reviews. 2 of them are from your accounts(Iconfirm and this) and the third one is from a newbie with literally 0 posts on the forum, received more than 6 months ago.  However, there's quite some people who offered a positive feedback. With risked money and references. From trusted users of the forum. Several times.  As seen here:      Bonus Comparison:    Also, a reference thread, just so everyone can see that you were busted by one of the most trusted legendary members around, several times: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1064824.0   You really should find something better to do. It is just a matter of time until all of your 28 alt accounts will get banned anyway.",False

For what it's worth, working with Tudor has been great, and he seems to be a very trustworthy person to me, which is why we are using bountyhive to manage our bounty.  And saying that this project is a scam because bountyhive are involved in the bounty part of it seems a stretch.

It sound like you are trying hard to stop people from getting scammed, that's good, we hate scams as well.  Regarding the debate as to whether ColorlessK / Tudor is a bad actor or not, is there a more appropriate place for you to have this discussion?  Can I request that you discuss the Forever Has Fallen project in this thread instead? - I know it's a bit blurry because Tudor posted our ANN thread for us and is involved in our bounty program, so if you want to discuss the details of his involvement in those specific areas that is fine. - From my point of view, those areas that Tudor has been involved in have been run without any sign of foul play, and the way the bounty has been structured to me leaves little doubt that the participants will receive all the tokens that they have earned.

I wasn't around for any of the Ambisafe scams or the other projects you pointed out, but it seems to me like the big point of contention is whether ColourlessK (who I know as Tudor Stomff), is the same person as Andrey Zamovsky/nixoid. - Is there a way that we can prove either way if this is the case? One way or the other this single point should resolve all of the problems here.  ""I do recognize some of the fake profiles in your ""team"" on your website though.""  - Can you be more specific? I am here in the office with all of the team and I am happy to post a selfie with them to verify.
