When the fund expires or has been requested for resales, asset management companies can purchase the coin from the exchange market and give it to the investors. This structure can solve the following problems. 1. through the usage of the AIDUS Coin as the single key currency to sign into the fund items, convenient investment is being facilitated at a global level. In other words, there is no need of exchange or foreign transfers. 2. there is no or at least minimum exchange fee because there is no need for money exchange. 3. it is easy to reinvest as fund signing and redemptions are made in AIDUS Coin. 4. once a fund has been subscribed, in spite of the decline in the value of the cryptocurrency at mid-termination and expiration, the current market price will not be applied in the investor’s value. If the value of the cryptocurrency rises, it is up to the investor to decide whether to choose the rising value of the cryptocurrency or the yield rate of the fund.
