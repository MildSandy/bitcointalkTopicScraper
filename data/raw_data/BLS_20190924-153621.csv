We distribute pay-as-you-go solar kit to undeveloped off-grid areas in Latin America, enable them access to electricity and clean water. The solar kit can be only enabled via BLS tokens, which the villagers buy from our local agents using fiat money (covers the cost of the machine). The local agents make sure the utility records are saved onto IPFS and get a commission in BLS. By moving the energy data to blockchain, we are creating credit data for mostly unbanked users. We also license the software and data to banks and micro-lending entity, which using the machine as collateral.   WHY ARE WE DIFFERENT Combination of blockchain and Internet of Things Pilot programs up and running in Guatemala The platform will be licensed to cooperative banks to enable micro-lending solutions BLS token is used to run IoT devices purchased by users to produce electricity and power Bitlumens tokens are used to access our digital platform. Bitlumens allow holders to participate in the success of the company. BLS tokens are used to send remittances. BLS tokens are used to access the data collected from IoT. The BLS supply is limited. BLS is a token supervised by KPMG   TEAM   GREENLIGHT Partners We partnered with Sun kingâ„¢ products to change the lives of the worldâ€²s 2 billion off-grid consumers who use dim, dangerous kerosene lamps for light at night.

Bitlumens brings electricity and water from renewable sources using Internet of Things (IoT) and the blockchain technology to women in rural villages in Latin America. Thanks to solar energy and our technology, people can move away from candles and kerosene lamps and use clean power electricity. They will also gain access to mobile communication and even water their crops! Women acquire our hardware with a microloan which they amortize in monthly installments. This allows them to build a credit score leading to financial inclusion and poverty alleviation. We also quantify carbon mitigation and particle matter reduction allowing each households to become carbon credit issuers.  Where is Bitlumens based? Bitlumens is incorporated in Zug, Switzerland. Most team members are also based in Switzerland. We plan to further expand to other regions proficient in blockchain technology.  How does the BLS token works? BLS tokens are needed for women farmers to run our devices which produce power for electricity or water.  How is Bitlumens decentralizing the carbon and black carbon credit market? Globally, burning kerosene for lighting generated 240 million tons of CO2 equivalent a year, around 0.5% of global emissions. In fact, just kerosene lamps replaced in Africa and Asia with solar panels saved 1.4 million tons of CO2 equivalent in 2014 alone. Bitlumens customers create valuable carbon assets that can be sold to companies and/or carbon markets.  Why undeveloped countries in Latin Americas? Most rural communities have unreliable access to power and water. These communities depend on inefficient and hazardous fuels such as biomass, kerosene, plastic, battery torches and candles. Fuels and its combustion process release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Bitlumens is brining clean technologies to areas where new infrastructure is needed to comply with the 2ÂºC target from the Paris Agreement. There are successful programs with similar ideas in Africa and Asia (such as the Aadhaar system in India).  Bitlumens incorporates blockchain technology on top of that.  Who owns the data from the device sensors? Our clients own their data. These data can be sold to the government or to development banks. The data runs in a private blockchain and is connected to our sensors.

What are off-grid/ on-grid system? - On-grid system: Produces electricity from solar panels which reaches 220V AC/ 50Hz to power the grid - Off-grid system: Storing the power from the solar panels into the AC power to readily convert to 220VAC/ 50Hz power from which provides the power loading when there's no electricity grid --> When starting the system, batteries are always given priority to charging from the sun until full. At this time, the on-grid system is not working. --> When the battery is full, the system will automatically convert DC power from the Solar Panel to 220V AC power to the grid. (Output voltage of the system is frequency, phase matching grid power can be phase 1 or phase 3) --> When power is suddenly lost, the system will automatically takes DC power from AC and Solar to transform into AC 220V power supply for priority loading. You can see the below image for better understanding     2. The advantage & disadvantages of off-grid system  - Advantages: It is very suitable for areas (rural & remote areas) where electricity grid is unstable and not available - Disadvantages:    + Maintenance costs (battery maintenance), battery life is not high, varies from 2-5 years, depending on different types of battery.    + Low conversion efficiency (mainly due to the battery system, between the discharge cycle and the loading cycle)  ...to be updated",False
