Contact centers often pay hourly for representatives who are simply idle while waiting to handle customer interactions. According to Aberdeen, agents spend approximately 25% of their time in an idle state. In a standard 8-hour shift, this results in a loss of 2 hours per work day or 10 hours per 5-day work week simply due to idle time. With an agent pay rate of $10.50 per hour, at a 100-agent contact center, this results in approximately $546,000 lost to idle time per year. As can be seen, this amounts to serious losses that could be better spent creating more value.  •   The second problem solved by the PodOne network is the problem of insufficient staffing for peak seasons. During peak seasons, the volume of interactions spikes and it becomes a hassle for a contact center to procure the necessary staff to handle the increased volume effectively. According to emarketer.com, US retail ecommerce sales increased by 17.8% during the 2016 holiday shopping season.",True

PodOne supports an optional multi-signature escrow system. Using this optional system, an Employer and Agent can enter into an agreement with a neutral third-party Arbitrator. Essentially, under the multi-signature system, an amount to be paid is held in escrow, requiring two signatures in order for the final transfer of funds to occur. If the Employer and Agent agree on the funds to be transferred, they both sign the transaction and the funds are moved out of escrow to the party being paid. Should there be a dispute regarding the payment between the Employer and the Agent, the neutral Arbitrator steps in and makes the decision whether or not to provide his or her signature as the second signature necessary for the transaction to occur. This system allows for mediation of disputes without the need of a regulatory body or any additional overhead.",True

Yes, we believe in the general purpose of decentralization that was pioneered by many technologies before us (P2P, etc) but most recently adopted by blockchain technologies.  By doing so, what’s the benefits compared to centralizes marketplace?  Less likelihood of failure — with centralized systems running enterprises, any failure in the centralized system affects the entire ecosystem. We have a large vision of this project, which will eventually help facilitate employment for potentially hundreds of thousands or millions of people. Such a system has to be designed from the ground up to reduce any likelihood of failure.  Security implications — By decentralizing PodOne’s virtual network of contact center professionals, an attack on one or more nodes will not affect the entire network.  Avoidance of Centralized Power/Collusion — With such a setup, we will not have a single entity, including the creators, that could congregate to collude the actions on the PodOne network.  All the general decentralisation and blockchain advantages (immutability, transparency) are there as well, expectedly.",True

With PodOne, they are embarking on a journey to address the labor issues of the industry by creating a decentralized platform for training, resource sharing, and automatic payment distribution.  The PodOne network solves two significant labor force problems affecting contact centers today. The first problem is the issue of excess capacity in the form of agent idle time. According to Aberdeen, agents spend approximately 25% of their time in an idle state. In a standard 8-­hour shift, this results in a loss of 2 hours per work day or 10 hours per 5-­day work week simply due to idle time. With an agent pay rate of $10.50 per hour, at a 100 ­agent contact center this results in approximately $546,000 lost to idle time per year.  The second problem solved by the PodOne network is the problem of variable staffing. According to emarketer.com, US retail e-commerce sales increased by 17.8% during the 2016 holiday shopping season. An increase in sales typically means an increase in call volumes at contact centers as customers reach support for various purchase ­related issues. This leaves contact centers with the challenge of efficiently hiring and scheduling for busy seasons, while minimizing abandonment rates.",True
