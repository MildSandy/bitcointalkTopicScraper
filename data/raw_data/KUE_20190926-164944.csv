Kuende’s integration with Bancor provides a user-friendly, secure and fast way for cryptocurrency holders to get KUE Tokens using not only BTC or ETH, but more than 140 ERC20 and EOS tokens in the Bancor Network. Furthermore, KUE holders are gaining access to continuous liquidity regardless of trade volume or exchange listings.  The Bancor Network is offering the possibility to easily convert between KUE and more than 8700 token pairs in the network in a single action. The user experience of Bancor resembles that of Coinbase and other popular custodial wallets in that users can manage and convert between tokens on different blockchains in a slick, intuitive app. But behind the scenes, users of Bancor transact directly with smart contracts on the blockchain and remain in full control of their funds and private keys at all times.  Users can perform conversions directly from the Bancor Wallet or any Web3 Wallet, such as MetaMask or Trezor, or using Scatter on EOS. Conversions occur instantly and are processed fully on-chain — from pricing to execution — ensuring maximum transparency and safety. Live tokens on the network include ERC20 tokens like DAI (Maker Dao), BNB (Binance) and BAT (Basic Attention Token), as well as EOS-based tokens like IQ (Everipedia), DICE (BetDice), BLACK (eosBLACK) & many more.   With KUE available in your Kuende Wallet you will be able to engage with the platform by staking your KUE to Create or Vote Challenges in order to win Kuende Points. Starting with the Beta Version of the Challenges you will be able to use both Tokens to purchase exclusive goods or services from our marketplace, the Kuende Shop.

Why Tendermint? Why Cosmos Network?    In the recent past weeks we’ve been receiving a lot of “Why” questions, especially centered around our intersection with blockchain and the decisions around it. All of the questions are covered in our Whitepaper and surely all of them were answered multiple times within our community channels, such as Bitcointalk or Telegram. Nevertheless we’ve concluded that our community needs a central point where all blockchain related questions are gathered and addressed.  This article should act both as a reference point for those who couldn’t read through the entire Whitepaper and as a refresher for those that previously heard the answers. Therefore, in the rest of this article we are going to cover the following question:    - Why do you use/need blockchain?    - Why do you initially use Ethereum and an internal ledger?    - Why Tendermint & Cosmos Network?

Let me tell you something - when we were first mulling over the possibilities of our bounty program (which you can read about here), I realized that we didn’t have a very good way to make sure people knew about it. Yes, there is Telegram, there is Medium, and there are forums. But it’s hard to keep track of all of that. Even worse, it’s hard for bounty hunters to have a centralized place to find the best bounties. Bountyhive changed all of this for us.  Bounty hunters that create hype are one of the most important parts of getting an ICO funded. From social media posts to influencer videos and everything in between, they are an integral marketing piece. Our bounty program was so innovative and out of the ordinary that we weren’t entirely sure of how well it would perform. There are a lot of bounty programs that fall flat on their face because it doesn’t get enough participants.  We’re partnering with Bountyhive because we want ICOs and blockchain-based projects to succeed. I really mean it! Blockchain and crypto businesses need to work together (yes, I will keep on repeating it because is the only way to accelerate the blockchain mass adoption). Kuende is providing a social space for these businesses to thrive, engage their customers, and provide their tokens as rewards. Bountyhive is very much doing the same, providing support for businesses still trying to raise funds.

This week, and to complete the article, I wanted to speak about a topic that I believe is even more pressing — the effects of social media on our minds.  Mental health is a hot topic right now, and it’s been entirely triggered by the intrusion of social media into every facet of our lives. Everywhere, experts are warning against addiction, body image issues, feelings of loneliness, and withdrawal. The truth is, people want to connect, otherwise social media wouldn’t even exist. The problem is that social media is so easy to access and the dopamine hits are so effortless that users have become hooked. In many ways, they are slaves to their online personas, and this addiction separates them from meeting people offline, or, as we used to call it, “real life”.

As part of our partnership, OneQube will provide marketing services for all phases of our ICO (pre and post) as well as hands-on marketing for the blockchain-based platform launch. OneQube is also assisting us in strategy guidance, regarding both the Kuende airdrop, bounty program, and public relation campaigns.  Choosing OneQube as a partner was an easy choice, as our companies are focused on engaging audiences while aiming to revolutionize the way we utilize social media. Using cutting edge technology, OneQube has the unique ability to target the crypto and blockchain audience using it’s custom audiences, behavioral targeting, and modern competitive strategy methodology.  OneQube has previously assisted in marketing ventures for a number of ICO success cases, including Legolas Exchange, XTRD, and CanYa. Additionally, oneQube has added Varanidae and Arianne to it’s portfolio this quarter.  Kuende believes it is exceedingly difficult to find a crypto-based marketing agency that can perform under the pressure of ever changing ad regulation. What sold us was OneQube’s focus on using technology and custom audiences to help propel great ideas forward on social media. This meant to us that they were ready to pivot their strategy with changing market conditions to meet our goals and KPI’s. Along with assisting with Kuende’s ICO marketing and PR, oneQube will also develop long term and sustainable strategies for app user acquisition and large scale platform adoption.  Kuende’s community is growing rapidly, and we are excited to announce our bounty campaign will go live in mid-July. Our public sale is scheduled for late-August.",False
