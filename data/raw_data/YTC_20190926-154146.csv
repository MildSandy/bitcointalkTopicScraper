The ONLY things that the YuTüFoundation won't have privy to is our email list and vitals of our employees (names, addresses, SSN, etc.). The YuTüFoundation will then report back to the crypto and YouTube communities on a regular basis, expressing their findings whether good, bad or indifferent, none of which will be influenced by us. Reiterating, they'll have free reign to investigate and free speech.  There's only hours remaining in becoming Whitelisted so to enjoy up to a 75% discount for the purchase of PAQs or YTC during the remainder of the Pre-ICO and our ICO. It only cost $100 for the purchase of 10 PAQs plus an automatic 10% bonus - thus 11 PAQs in total - to become Whitelisted.  Without the Whitelisted bonus, YTC is currently available at $0.05 each and PAQs are available at only $10 each. When the ICO starts, the prices will start at $0.10 for YTC and $25 per PAQ.

Our ICO start date has been changed to September 15th.   The following was gleaned verbatim from the OP of this thread.  Bonuses  Early Supporter Bonuses:  For every 10 PAQs purchased, one additional PAQ is rewarded. In essence, a 10% premium. For the first ten purchasers, the amount of PAQs obtained will be multiplied by four when purchasing lots of 10 PAQs. Thus, for $100, you’ll receive 40 PAQs. For the next ten subsequent purchasers, the amount of PAQs obtained will be multiplied by three when purchasing lots of 10 PAQs. Thus, for $100, you’ll receive 30 PAQs. For the next ten subsequent purchasers, the amount of PAQs obtained will be multiplied by two if purchasing lots of 10 PAQs. Thus, for $100, you’ll receive 20 PAQs.  The 10% bonus also applies for the first 30 purchasers, thus 44, 33 and 22 PAQs, respectively, for the examples above.  During our forthcoming ICO, there won't be any offerings as lucrative as the ones outlined for the first 30 supporters during this Pre-ICO, with the same most likely true for subsequent PAQ purchasers enjoying just the 10% premium, and definitely for five supporters taking advantage of the following Super Bonus.  Super Bonus  Available to ONLY 5 supporters, for $500 you'll receive 100 PAQs instead of 44 PAQs if one of the first 10 supporters earning four times their purchase as outlined above. PLUS, in lieu of an addition 10% premium, you'll receive your $500 outlay back no later than at the end of our forthcoming ICO, a compensation not available for other supporters.  We'll leave it to you brainiacs to determine the earning potential of deploying 100 PAQs to dowze yAltcoin yaltz, especially of those pegged to popular and renowned YouTube channels.  Super Supporter Bonus:  The Super Supporter Bonus package is for those willing to spend $1,000, with a 100 PAQ rewardment (bonus) to anybody instrumental in recruiting such a prospect, limited to ten (10) Super Supporters. 500 latches with a wet noodle will be administered to anybody caught referring themselves, leaving gaming of the system to the professionals.  What a Super Supporter will receive for their $1,000 are the yaltz generated exactly every two minutes of the first 200 yAltcoins pegged to YouTube channels. A Super Supporter will also receive an additional 100 PAQs to dowze whatever yAltcoin they deem most advantageous. Thus, 300 PAQs in total.  A field has been added to our Pre-ICO signup page: http://yutu.co.in/pre-ico/.  One (1) Super Duper Supporter Bonus:  For $2,500, one supporter will receive 500 PAQs to dowze any yAltcoin yaltz and having mega bumping abilities when getting in queue for the first time to dowze yaltz of any particular yALT.  PLUS you'll receive 25,000 YTC.  PLUS you'll get their $2,500 returned back to you during the onset of our forthcoming ICO once said amount reaches our coffer.  Only one (1) Super Duper Supporter Bonus is available, with this offering ending once taken advantage of or when the Pre-ICO funding round ends.  Again, a 100 PAQ bonus applies to anybody instrumental in recruiting such a candidate.  One-shoot Been Harmed Bonus:  First conceived here - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3365068.msg39598726#msg39598726 - a bonus of 5 free PAQs will be added to the purchase of 5 PAQs for $50 if you've been scammed by rogue crypto entities. Thus for $50, you'll receive 10 PAQs. This offer is over-and-beyond any subsequent purchases in taking advantage of the lucrative bonuses outlined above.        YTC Offering  During our Pre-ICO, the YTC (YuTüCoin) token can be purchased for $0.05 each, of which 100 million (100M) will be available. A minimum order of $100 via BTC, ETH or BCH applies during the Pre-ICO. Any user Whitelisted - purchased at least $100 worth of PAQs - will also be able to enjoy a 75% savings during the limited Pre-ICO offering in conjunction with savings for purchases during the ICO as outlined WITHIN. In the event that any of the 100M YTC remain on account after the Pre-ICO, they will be burned.  Payment:  The following crypto addresses will be used when submitting your payment, then head HERE to fill in the appropriate fields:  Dedicated BTC Wallet Address for Pre-ICO:  13hGh2XsXHySvDyCkzVSGh3bw6xGP18Bq6 Dedicated ETH Wallet Address for Pre-ICO:  0xa3ebE8EBC091DB907c0D9D04d861F0575f158163 Dedicated BCH Wallet Address for Pre-ICO:  qqwcmlxthu8jhm9wmc9ll8nwtc7zc69avsr5mppf8d  YuTü.Co.in et al. nor any of its principals, employees, etc., will own PAQs unless fully declared.

An expanded range of trade pairings may be developed in the future BTC/yAltcoin, ETH/yAltcoin and yAltcoin/yAltcoin pairings. Exchange fees will be kept to a minimum to assure the exchange can break even with its cost of operation. The intent of the exchange is not to generate significant revenue but to facilitate the trading of yAltcoins.

For our users possessing YTC, they'll be able to purchase wares directly from the Lynspinz, along with purchasing PAQs directly off our site once Beta.

We're in the midst of a website upgrade, which when finished will offer a lot more details about our project:  http://www.yutubopolis.com/  On the website we have a Team section, just hover over the pictures for our backgrounds.  As far as LinkedIn is concerned, I personally don't have one because I got sick of all the spam they were sending me, so I deleted my account with them. I have my undergraduate degree in Neuroscience with a graduate focus on Artificial Neural Networks and a strong background in mathematics. I've participated in several ICOs (I was one of the original NEM stakeholders) and have been involved in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies since 2013. For the last two years I've been a full-time writer for CoinClarity.com, and have analyzed dozens, perhaps over 100 ICOs in that time.  To be honest, all ICOs start out as just hope, and while admittedly a bit of faith is required that we can pull off the job, we've had some pretty worthy brains working on the project 24/7 for the last 2 months. Bruno (our CEO) has been formulating the project for over 3 years and has been a member of this forum for far longer! If there's somebody who can be trusted to run an ICO in an above-board manner, it's him.  Hope we can reassure you now that you know a little bit more about us. Of course feel free to ask us if you have any more questions!  Cyrus",True

Will it be a token or if its a coin, it sounds like you're planning on using a Proof of Work-type algorithm?  Originally, YTC was envisioned as a POW coin but soon realized that as an ERC-20 token it'll work just fine for its intended purpose of facilitating funds in and out of our exchange - YTC-Sox - not to mention used as a means to garner initial funding.

BUT, according to you, you got scammed ON YOUR OWN ICO! We stood by you and the project as you rattled on about how surprised you were a lead developer and their girlfriend you met that one time and gave control of your whole project just disappeared with everything and how don't worry you had other investors lining up, complete with a preposterous play by play that if you had a legit investor who saw your posts about them, jesus.  Nobody called you out, nobody gave you shit, nobody called you a scam even though at best you misrepresented the ""team"" you had.  Was actually quite happy to see you were back with a ""plan"" but it sure looks like the same plan as before --which, after it all went down turned out be more of a hail mary and a prayer.  I've seen you needlessly point out your unending and irrefutable transparency 50 times in the short time i've been on here, but you can't answer clear and simple questions about what the ACTUAL, CURRENT agreement with Bacancy is or how much money you need to secure that service. BUT, you're presenting that as a way to legitimize this pre-ICO. But hey, you're gonna just crowdsource your whole team real quick and oh everybody gets a free computer!!  Was this the whole plan?  And how has it not occurred to anyone ""consulting"" you that if nearly every single person who comes across this has to ask a million questions about your super clever wordsmith-ing and glossary you've coined then that's maybe not the best approach to reach the masses?  Bacancy is cool with all that? And you're using the same website? aka one of the 10 least professional looking website on the web? You could literally put up one clean looking page with a summary people who at least speak english can grasp the concept without 10 rounds of explanations and an email address and it would seem more legit.   As someone who still believes you are onto a terrific idea and has to be one of the highest dollar investors in this so far I WANT you to succeed, but I think it's time to show us all a lot more, and stop with the pseudo transparency and tell everyone the actual truth, actual plan and actual details. If it's any good it will help this effort -- which by looking at the addresses in the OP, is not going great. And I WANT it to go great.

I won't highlight each point from the investors post but I do agree with a lot of it.  I asked about pre-ICO funding information and was a little disappointed when it was ignored.  Although it's not required, I thought it might help if folks knew what the funding goal was, what the funds were being used for and how close funding goal was.  These are absolute basic pieces of information required on the big CF sites, because it helps greatly knowing this information when deciding to support.  If I know the funding goal is 6 million dollars and only $200 is pledged, well I am probably not going to support it no matter how good the project is.  If the funding goal is $10,000 and $7500 has been pledged I am MORE likely to support it if I like it.  I can see the funding goal is reasonable and others agree so fuck it I'm in for a couple hundo.

As Marshall Long would say, ""Excellent question!""  Yes ... but I guess you'll want me to elaborate, eh? Quick aside: For some unknown reason, I started pining for muskie fishing up in the Great White North.  Whether obtaining an additional 33 PAQs or 33 PAQs in total [per channel] sans Lynspinz incurring an out-of-pocket expense, the key term is out-of-pocket expense, for there is an outlay but no ""real"" moneys change hand, viz. fiat or crypto. It's ingenious, which I'm sure you'll concur once reading how said feat will be accomplished.  If a Lynspinz desires additional PAQs up to the max 33 PAQs per YouTube channel he maintains, he could procure them at the price point available to everybody else at the [futurely] then time, e.g. U$50, U$200, etc., up to the max U$500 per PAQ.  As you've probably realized by now, it'll become more and more difficult for future YouTubers embracing our platform as Lynspinz to mine/hash up to 33% of their yAltcoin yaltz, mainly because the additional PAQ ID numbers would be too high for queuing for hopefully available slots of their yAltcoin, especially if the YouTube channel is an excellent candidate for having its yaltz' exchange rate reach for the stars (no pun intended; notice I didn't pen 'moon').  Lynspinz, like everybody else, will be able to purchase PAQs beyond how their first 33 PAQs could be obtained by paying for them in like matter, quasi-negating our business model of Lynspinz NEVER having to pay one satoshi to enjoy all the benefits bestowed to them on our platform(s). The line had to be drawn somewhere, with this variant, of course, being an acceptable practice.  Before you ask where do the yaltz go if there'e not a full compliment of 100 PAQs mining/hashing a yAltcoin, I guess now is a good enough time to address that sometimes' reality.  Having them directed to our coffer just wouldn't be fair, would it? Splitting them between the Lynspinz and us is much fairing. But why be greedy bastards? Here's to letting the Lynspinz receive all the yaltz not directed to PAQ owners when under 100 PAQs are mining/hashing yaltz of a lackluster yAltcoin. BTW, the exampled scenario will rarely occur as more and more PAQs are sold to mine/hash yaltz of the maximum 10,000 Lynspinz yAltcoins, driving home the scarcity aspect once again.  And for those playing at home thinking that 10,000 [quality] YouTubers embracing our platform(s) is too low of a figure, there is a plan to remedy such anticipated scenario ... but that's further down the pike, so don't fret it. For now, just have faith that when the 10K mark is within reach, there'll be a fair plan in place to handle the welcomed future YouTubers.   In all seriousness dude I was honestly confused as fuck with a lot of your terminology (I can probably admit much of it was on my end LOL!) but I think I understand now it's not as complicated as I was making it in my head!!@#$%@!#%*  See how easy it was in getting up to speed on the few neologisms unique to YuTü.Co.in? Even a Flying Hellfish could figure it out.     I love the idea man, I think it's unique and you have put a lot of thought into it so I invested a couple bucks as you know and I do hope it works out good for both of us!!  I hope like hell you can get the funds together for the ICO dude I think it would be a really neat platform and I hope like fucking hell my low ID PAQ's mine me some yummy yaltz of the most popular Lynspinz.

Also depicted in the OP is a bonus for those who've been financially hurt by gone-bye-bye crypto entities consisting of only U$50 for 10 PAQs, the offer available only once per BCT account/user.

Those taking advantage of our Pre-ICO will be way ahead of those participating in our forthcoming ICO, earning a better or equal ROI than their counterparts having to dole out way more funds to enjoy the same. Translated: participate now or participate later when it'll cost you more for the pleasure but obtaining higher numbered PAQs. PAQ numbers would still be low in the grand scheme of things but the lower the number, the better chances you have of mining/hashing shares (yaltz) of stocks (yAltcoins) pegged to renown YouTubers whose yaltz may in short order trade for dollars oppose to pennies. Remember, ONLY 100 PAQs are capable of mining/hashing yAltcoin yaltz at a time, and if you can't mine/hash yaltz, you'll have to purchase them off the exchange - YTC-Sox - or directly from the YouTuber (Lynspinz).  Any PAQ will mine/hash 720 yaltz per day. You do the math for when yaltz are trading for U$0.01 or U$1.00 each.  For fence-sitters, simply wait till PAQs sell for U$500 max opposed to being available now for U$10 each unless taking advantage of one of the bonuses outlined in the OP. The choice is yours.

Also feel free to point out if they've been covered and I missed it somewhere.  1)  Is there a hard cap to the PAQ's for sale in the pre-ICO? 2)  What is the pre-ICO funding goal (a lot of the popular crowdfunding sites show this as a method      of giving the supporters more information before participating). 3)  What happens if you are not able to meet the ""funding goal"" in reasonable time? 4)  Follow up to 3 what is a reasonable time frame? 5)  Are you able/willing to show a ""amount funded vs funding goal"" (like a big dopey thermometer      thingy) to let supporters know how close we are?

I also trust he has vetted them with his unique vetting skills!  For me Bruno's writing style is fun, really fun but if I am honest he is confusing AF most of the time so I think it is really smart to bring in the ICO consultant to package up a really nice, concise ICO!  Bruno has been shown exceptional vetting and sleuthing skills over the years but I was not convinced he was the right man to bring this idea anywhere until I saw him bring on the ICO consultant, this showed me he may have also realized this and decided that this would be a good way to bring his baby to life.  I took a gamble, if I am wrong well such is life, nothing really changes for me, if I am lucky then hey YAY ME!

Who We Are  YuTü.Co.in is the brainchild of everybody's favorite anti-scammer and BitcoinTalk forum legend, Bruno Kucisnkas. You may know him better by his forum screen names Phinnaeus Gage, Gleb Gamow and YuTü.Co.in. In 2015, Bruno saw how the process of YouTube monetization could be improved through the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency, giving YouTubers a bit more freedom and control over income generated by their channel content. Through a brand new approach to YouTuber funding called ""crypto-commoditization,"" Bruno developed a system that could not only bring in a new stream of revenue for content creators but give their fans an opportunity to invest in their channel brand as well.  For info about the lesser, more boring members of our team, click here.        ICO Specifics  In order to fund development of the YuTü.Co.in platform, we are offering 80% of the total supply of our own ERC20-compliant token, YuTüCoin (YTC), during the Pre-ICO and ICO funding rounds.

Pre-ICO Specifics  Dedicated BTC Wallet Address for Pre-ICO:  13hGh2XsXHySvDyCkzVSGh3bw6xGP18Bq6 Dedicated ETH Wallet Address for Pre-ICO:  0xa3ebE8EBC091DB907c0D9D04d861F0575f158163 Dedicated BCH Wallet Address for Pre-ICO:  qqwcmlxthu8jhm9wmc9ll8nwtc7zc69avsr5mppf8d  About PAQs  A PAQ is a virtual miner/hasher capable of mining/hashing (dowzing) yAltcoin yaltz exactly every two minutes, with ALL TxIDs viewable on a tamper-resistant public-facing Permissioned Blockchain. ONLY 100 PAQs max will be able to dowze any particular yAltcoin pegged to a YouTuber's channel at a time.  ONLY 10,000 YouTube channels (of YouTubers recognized as Lynspinz on our platform) will be indexed, equating to one million PAQs allocated. During the Pre-ICO, PAQs will be offered at $10 each, never to be sold over $500/per (down the pike), albeit PAQ owners may offer their precious to the tune of thousands each on or off our site, especially for PAQs having lower ID numbers.  FOLLOW THIS LINK if desiring to procure PAQs with low ID numbers at $10/per. Those owning low ID numbered PAQs will have an advantage over owners of high ID numbered PAQs when it comes time to get in queue for the ONLY 100 PAQ positions to dowze each yAltcoin pegged to renowned YouTube channels in ensuring an optimal ROI.  Pricing for PAQs will increase by $25 for every lot of 10K PAQs allocated, eventually peaking at $500 per PAQ.        Bonuses  Early Supporter Bonuses:  For every 10 PAQs purchased, one additional PAQ is rewarded. In essence, a 10% premium. For the first ten purchasers, the amount of PAQs obtained will be multiplied by four when purchasing lots of 10 PAQs. Thus, for $100, you’ll receive 40 PAQs. For the next ten subsequent purchasers, the amount of PAQs obtained will be multiplied by three when purchasing lots of 10 PAQs. Thus, for $100, you’ll receive 30 PAQs. For the next ten subsequent purchasers, the amount of PAQs obtained will be multiplied by two if purchasing lots of 10 PAQs. Thus, for $100, you’ll receive 20 PAQs.  The 10% bonus also applies for the first 30 purchasers, thus 44, 33 and 22 PAQs, respectively, for the examples above.  During our forthcoming ICO, there won't be any offerings as lucrative as the ones outlined for the first 30 supporters during this Pre-ICO, with the same most likely true for subsequent PAQ purchasers enjoying just the 10% premium, and definitely for five supporters taking advantage of the following Super Bonus.  Super Bonus  Available to ONLY 5 supporters, for $500 you'll receive 100 PAQs instead of 44 PAQs if one of the first 10 supporters earning four times their purchase as outlined above. PLUS, in lieu of an addition 10% premium, you'll receive your $500 outlay back no later than at the end of our forthcoming ICO, a compensation not available for other supporters.  We'll leave it to you brainiacs to determine the earning potential of deploying 100 PAQs to dowze yAltcoin yaltz, especially of those pegged to popular and renowned YouTube channels.  Super Supporter Bonus:  The Super Supporter Bonus package is for those willing to spend $1,000, with a 100 PAQ rewardment (bonus) to anybody instrumental in recruiting such a prospect, limited to ten (10) Super Supporters. 500 latches with a wet noodle will be administered to anybody caught referring themselves, leaving gaming of the system to the professionals.  What a Super Supporter will receive for their $1,000 are the yaltz generated exactly every two minutes of the first 200 yAltcoins pegged to YouTube channels. A Super Supporter will also receive an additional 100 PAQs to dowze whatever yAltcoin they deem most advantageous. Thus, 300 PAQs in total.  A field has been added to our Pre-ICO signup page: http://yutu.co.in/pre-ico/.  One (1) Super Duper Supporter Bonus:  For $2,500, one supporter will receive 500 PAQs to dowze any yAltcoin yaltz and having mega bumping abilities when getting in queue for the first time to dowze yaltz of any particular yALT.  PLUS you'll receive 25,000 YTC.  PLUS you'll get their $2,500 returned back to you during the onset of our forthcoming ICO once said amount reaches our coffer.  Only one (1) Super Duper Supporter Bonus is available, with this offering ending once taken advantage of or when the Pre-ICO funding round ends.  Again, a 100 PAQ bonus applies to anybody instrumental in recruiting such a candidate.  One-shoot Been Harmed Bonus:  First conceived here - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3365068.msg39598726#msg39598726 - a bonus of 5 free PAQs will be added to the purchase of 5 PAQs for $50 if you've been scammed by rogue crypto entities. Thus for $50, you'll receive 10 PAQs. This offer is over-and-beyond any subsequent purchases in taking advantage of the lucrative bonuses outlined above.        YTC Offering  During our Pre-ICO, the YTC (YuTüCoin) token can be purchased for $0.05 each, of which 100 million (100M) will be available. A minimum order of $100 via BTC, ETH or BCH applies during the Pre-ICO. Any user Whitelisted - purchased at least $100 worth of PAQs - will also be able to enjoy a 75% savings during the limited Pre-ICO offering in conjunction with savings for purchases during the ICO as outlined WITHIN. In the event that any of the 100M YTC remain on account after the Pre-ICO, they will be burned.  Payment:  The following crypto addresses will be used when submitting your payment, then head HERE to fill in the appropriate fields:  Dedicated BTC Wallet Address for Pre-ICO:  13hGh2XsXHySvDyCkzVSGh3bw6xGP18Bq6 Dedicated ETH Wallet Address for Pre-ICO:  0xa3ebE8EBC091DB907c0D9D04d861F0575f158163 Dedicated BCH Wallet Address for Pre-ICO:  qqwcmlxthu8jhm9wmc9ll8nwtc7zc69avsr5mppf8d  YuTü.Co.in et al. nor any of its principals, employees, etc., will own PAQs unless fully declared.

The native coin, YuTüCoin (YTC), not to be confused with the brand-cum-URL YuTü.Co.in, is not the token that will be monetizing YouTube channels. Apart from being sold during the forthcoming ICO to garner startup funding, its primary purpose will be to facilitate transactions in and off our exchange - YTC-Sox. Its secondary purpose will be for conducting commerce on our site, e.g. purchasing PAQs or YouTubers' merc.  Regarding monetizing YouTube channels, the process is quite simple. Pretend you're starting/registering a new corporation where you state how many shares the corp will have. At first, you own all the shares, but later sell off some shares for some amount to investors seeing value in your corp with hopes of the shares increasing in value, thus earning an ROI (assume the shares are readily tradeable on some exchange for this example).  Expanding on the above, now picture that you're able to buy shares of a YouTuber's brand, namely of their channel (some YouTubers have more than one channel, each being able to crypto-commoditize). Instead of all the shares being created at once, they're created in blocks exactly every two minutes viewable on a permissioned blockchain. The total amount of shares created will be 200,000,000 (200M) equating to 1,562,500 blocks (128 shares per block) over the course of  ~5.945586 years.  The value of the shares will be determined by what they're trading for on the YTC-Sox exchange, none of which will be able to trade lower than the set amount of U$0.01 (1 U$ penny/¢ent). Shares of stocks pegged to lowly YouTube channels will trade for mere pennies while shares of stocks pegged to renown channels will/would/should/could trade for dollars per shares, allowing the free and unmanipulated market in determining their dynamic exchange rates.  I do have a way for a YouTuber to earn more shares per block with no out-of-expense to them. Expanding on the latter, YouTubers will NEVER pay one satoshi in fees et al. for their participation on our platforms.  The YouTuber has a choice of either liquidating the shares for fiat on an ongoing basis or holding onto to them with hopes of increasing in value as he improves his channel/brand in satisfying his fan base and investors, alike, also holding shares of the brand's stock.  Each YouTube channel will have its own ticker symbol (TicSym) on YTC-Sox with no two alike.  Of the 128 shares created every two minutes, 100 shares will go to those having their virtual miners (dubbed PAQs) virtually hashing the token. 100 PAQs maximum are capable of mining/hashing shares of any stock. Think: scarcity. It's the sale of PAQs where YuTü.Co.in will earn a majority of the money for its coffer. Crunching the numbers, it's a mighty huge figure according to the devised schedule. PAQs will not sell for over U$500.  As far as Google/YouTube is concern, given our business model, your concern is moot. The closest entity we could relate to is Patreon, and even that's a stretch.  Here's are some select terms you should familiarize yourself with (more found HERE):  PAQ: A virtual miner/hasher. Lynspinz (plural & singular): A YouTuber embracing our platform. yAltcoin: A YouTuber's channel's stock, abbreviated as yALT (add an 's' to either if plural). yaltz (plural & singular): Share(s). YTC-Sox: Our exchange: YuTü.Co.in-So[/b]cial Exchange. TicSym: Ticker Symbol. TYC: YuTüCoin, the token. YuTü.Co.in: The brand and URL (yutü.co.in). YuTübopolis: Governance and physical HQ of the proposed multi-use campus.  Feel free to ask any questions if still unsure as to what's what.  Bruno   <the following not part of the reply>  That outta the way, who's gonna be the first of ONLY five users to take advantage of the Super Bonus outlined in the OP?  Goodnight, all.

If I am a miner with more than 100 PAQ's can I take all 100 spots for a Lynspinz or is there a limit?    If I understand correctly being able to join a Lynspinz ""pool"" will be determined by PAQ low ID or ""vintage""   ?

Can I bump another higher # out of the ""pool""?  If I can bump what happens to the bumped PAQ, does it go idle until redirected or some type of auto switch/bump to the next most lucrative lynspinz that the PAQ can get into?  If I am a Lynspinz and a PAQ miner can I take all 100 of my own slots if I have low enough vintage PAQ's?  Would I even want to do that?  When the shares are created are they sent directly to the miners and Lynspinz ytc sox accounts?

I'm a tad behind in addressing your post as promised after breakfast but had to address some PMs and phone calls first.  Ready to tackle it in a sec if not interrupted.  Meanwhile, one user has taken advantage of the Super Bonus outlined in the OP after I brought it to his attention that by augmenting his initial purchase, he could take advantage of it. I did inform him that I'm not a hard-sell guy, apologizing for the plug, but he took the bait nonetheless (humor). Seriously, I'm not flagrant in the way I conduct business or life with the exception, of course, as has been witnessed on myriad occasions, sticking it up nefarious actors' asses.  ONLY 4 Super Bonus offers remain.  Bruno",True

Pretty pictures with words for dumb dumbs like me!    I'm looking forward to your's I feel your skills behind the keyboard could lend to some funny and hopefully informative infographics!  FHF Would be my choice!  OK so I become a Lynspinz (btw kindly shove the grammar lessons up your ass!! no offence intended JK!).  I am now creating yaltz (shares) just by becoming a Lynspinz.  I guess there would be an announcement and a time frame in which anyone with PAQ's would have the option to list their desire to ""mine/hash"" at FHF's ""pool"" (it is a shitty term I hope you come up with a better one!)?  This is when the low id PAQ's are advantageous?  What are the shares of FHF's Lynspinz channel called, just yaltz?  How would one differentiate a yalt generated by my uber popular channel vs some lower rated schmoo's channel?  Once the 100 PAQ's are assigned they start to mine/hash and receive yaltz (shares).  The Lynspinz or miner can then sell those yaltz on the YTC-Sox to any potential ""investor""?   Once placed, a PAQ, regardless its ID #, can not be bumped from mining/hashing its directed-to yAltcoin. Owners of PAQs with lower ID numbers will be capable of ONLY jumping queue in front of other PAQs with higher ID numbers when desiring to mine/hash a new yAltcoin or jockeying for position in mining/hashing an existing yAltcoin having a full compliment of PAQs in place, especially if either shows signs of their yaltz enjoying active trading or capable of mooning, for lack of a better term.  I don't fully understand.  A new Lynspinz is signed up and a list is generated for those who want to mine at their pool, lowest Id's given preference?  If a yAltcoin has a full compiment of PAQ's in place how can a miner ""jockey"" for position if he can't bump another miner/PAQ?  I like the idea to limit the number of PAQ's from a single ""miner/hasher"" so the love can be as spread out as possible!  How is the PAQ ownership handled, I assume on one of the platforms there will be a PAQ gui?  How would I sell these ""virtual assets""?   Dude, you spelled YTC-Sox incorrectly.   Are you Leroy Fodor?      Maybe I'm Sonny K        I'll be back with more later dude!  Sorry if the questions are silly or redundant I am just trying to help get the conversation started mate!",True
