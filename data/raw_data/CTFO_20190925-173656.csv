Why is the status of the Foundation Co-founder more profitable than the status of a simple Investor?  Limited number of Co-founders Co-founder tokens (CTFO tokens) are sold only within the ICO stages, unsold tokens will be burned. The number of Co-founder tokens will not increase with time, but can only decrease for natural reasons.  Only 1 million of Co-founder's tokens are released per 2000 ETH The total number of Co-founder tokens is 1 million. Of these, 140,000 tokens were sold through a private subscription to the Club of Venture Investors from St. Petersburg (Russian Federation). The remaining 860,000 Co-founder tokens are on sale.  Co-founders receive 40% of the Fund's profit, in the ETH for their wallets Unlike Investors who purchase Investor's tokens (ITFO) in the second stage, after the completion of ICO, and receive profit by buy back of the Investor's tokens from stock exchanges, the Co-founders earn a profit in ETH directly to their purses, while the number of tokens does not decrease. This allows the Co-founders to receive multiple returns on the investments made once in the purchase of CTFO-tokens.  The Co-founder of the Foundation receives additional privileges The Foundation Co-founders can use the time-sharing service and reside in real estate objects from the Fund's portfolio at no cost (during the period when the facility is free of reservation). Unlike the Co-founder, the investor in the same facilities will have to pay the overhead costs for the maintenance of the facility.

Like in all countries, Venezuela is building real estate, even despite the raging crisis. Consider what is built and how much it costs.  Note: on average, these objects were placed on sale a month ago (with a black exchange rate of 3.4-3.5 million bolivars for 1 USD), so these price tags should be divided into such a rate, rather than the current 4.1-5 million bolivars per dollar (in the reality of the bolivar's approach to the dollar can be seen here). Here's what I found in a half-hour of learning a site with ads.  Facility No. 1: NUEVA BARCELONA, Nueva Barcelona, Barcelona (under construction townhouse),  9,800,000,000 Bolivars. On 70 m2 in the kit includes 2 bedrooms (in Venezuela 2 bedrooms this does not mean ""kopeck piece"", in fact it is an analogue of our three-room apartment, since the common living room is not taken into account), 2 bathrooms, 1 parking space.  Left - what is already built, on the right - visualization. Posted on the site 25 days ago, the price in dollars ... 2882 USD ...  Object number 2: COSTANERA, Nueva Barcelona, Barcelona (townhouse in the final stage of construction), 62 m ², in 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, parking space and price of 6.825.000.000 bolivars (2007 USD ...):  By the way, the concept of a ""Venezuelan townhouse"", apparently, includes in addition to the protected area, and a common pool and a sports ground, which in our region often only have to dream (not to mention the difference in price).  Let me remind you that in the discord we gather a squad of those who believe that in the Russian 90s they missed their chance to participate in the big sale and want to participate in the ""Venezuelan 90s"" right now. We already have 78 people who want to join - write to me on Yandex-mail (before the dog is the same as here in the login).  Object number 3: PUEBLO DE SAN DIEGO, Pueblo de San Diego, Municipality of San Diego (almost completed townhouse already with neighbors).  Translation of the text of the advertisement: Beautiful, comfortable, spacious and cozy townhouse, 119 M2, two floors, located in San Diego, Belmonti Villas, Via la Cumaca. On the ground floor there is a living room, a dining room, a kitchen, a patio and a laundry, has two (2) parking spaces. On the top floor, one (1) main room with wall and ceiling finishings has been reconstructed, a bathroom with reconstructed wooden furniture and porcelain floor, two (2) auxiliary rooms with porcelain floor and one (1) auxiliary bathroom.  The residential complex has green areas, swimming pool, park, power station, underground reservoir, private security.  How much does this pleasure cost? 7.800.000.000 Bolivars (or 2300 dollars ...)  And this is not all the objects that I liked, if you want and time, you can dig up dozens of similar ones with approximately equal prices.  P.S .: Incredible price tags? This - if you look at our relatively prosperous side. In 1997, in the post-Soviet space, this order of prices was not surprising - my family when moving from Kazakhstan to Russia (we have sold a three-room apartment in an average Kazakhstan city for $ 3,000, and this was still considered a good price...)",False

And all these similarities allow us to assume with a high degree of probability that further events will develop according to a similar scenario.

It is time to draw parallels with real estate in Russia in the 90s and the situation with it for today.  In the 90 years I was a schoolboy and the sphere of my interests was on the sidelines of the unfolding ""holiday of life"". But the mother realtor (in those days and even later it was the most common profession after the first and second oldest) often at home was discussing current affairs and one of the price tags for an apartment that I remembered at the turn of the millennium (not exactly the 90's already, but almost , and even in 2000, as will be seen - apartments in the city on the Neva were worth a mere penny, especially when compared with today's realities) was ... 14,000 dollars for a three-room apartment in the center of Leningrad-Petersburg. I do not have details about its location, type of house, floor and condition, but this is not particularly important now.  Let's compare with the average treshka in the center of St. Petersburg (even if not the center itself, say, Pushkinskaya metro station) now:   I went to the most popular Russian site with ads, drove in the search for the above data (three-room apartment, Pushkinskaya metro) and gave a screenshot of the first page of results, selecting not the most major photos. As you can see, the cheapest option from the randomly offered in a long-unrepaired house is six and a half million rubles (approximately 110,000 USD).  Having sorted out the results for ""Cheap on top"", we get our version on the third place:   That is, in this area, the minimum price tag for an apartment is now 5.7 million rubles (about 95,000 dollars at the current rate). Thus, the growth even by 2000 was almost 7 times (700% of profit).  I'll understand, if my opinion on prices 18 years ago on faith will not be accepted, so let's look at the statistics (google on ""the price index for real estate in St. Petersburg from the 90s,"" the third link in the results - one of the oldest real estate sites (Bulletin of Real Estate ), which has data since 1996), the price of a square meter in dollars, the first block - before the default in 1998:   After default 1998 the situation looked like this (the same year 2000):   The most recent data:   And for completeness of the picture - the data before the 2008 mortgage crisis:   That is, even to today's prices, amounting to a peak of about 30% - an increase of more than 5 times. And 15 times (1500%) - the prices of eighteen years ago to ten years (that is - for half the period) ...  You can, of course, argue that Venezuela is not Russia, or ignore the figures.
