What does the ‘One + One’ project do? The key idea of the project is the redistribution of world finance in favour of socially responsible players of the consumer market. The challenge is so tough, and is utopian at first glance. But this is only at first glance.  How is this problem being solved?  There are four main components of the project:  · Charitable foundations are entities that are designed to solve the global problems of contemporary people.  · Socially oriented business (Good Corporate Citizen) are companies that are engaged in charity. In the world, about 70% of large companies are actively involved in charity.  · Loyalty programme is a unique mechanism that motivates businesses to systemically participate in charity.  · Chek token is a connecting element through which businesses display interest in participating in the loyalty programme and thereby contributing to charity.

Many of them do their activity in Excel.  Currently, we have a few foundations (two you can already see https://charityblockchain.ru and more coming) with whom we're working closely on creating an industry standard and protocol for uploading data to the blockchain.  We need to streamline the import of foundations' bookkeeping data into our Public Charity Ledger. Currently, we're doing a lot of manual labor, which is okay for now, but our goal is to have 25000 foundations by 2019, and there is no way we can pull this job manually.  And even if when we provide the foundation with API to import their data automatically, there is still a roadblock: foundations' lack of IT resources and lack of standardized accounting process.  So, instead of developing custom integration processes for each foundation, we decided to create an ERP system for charities and give it away to the world for free. This way we will help the foundations to simplify their work and in the same time get us exactly the data we need. It will be plug'n'play for charities to connect to One+1.  Giving this software away for free most likely will disrupt the accounting software market mostly dominated by corporations and will create a new market for developers and customization specialists.  Since we are not too familiar with how accounting is built in charitable organizations, we partnered up with a trusted expert that know it well. ACC SYSTEMS is company that specializes in the accounting for charitable foundations and manages 30+ foundations.

We use Blockchain technology for the following opportunities:  1) To solve transparency problem for charitable foundations.  Many people don't understand how charity foundations work and don't trust them. When you donate money, I bet you want to be sure the foundation is not doing anything shady and you want to track your donation as well as see the results of your help!  We use Blockchain to make foundations transparent to the public. To do so, the foundations upload their income and expenses into Blockchain, and everyone can see foundations' financials and track your own donations.  We called this collection of data Public Charity Ledger, and it is going to be an industry standard. We're from Russia, so we're starting local, but our goal is to be global and decentralized as much as possible.  While everybody is talking about solving transparency for charity, we're already doing it. Currently, we have two TOP50 foundations from Russia that already uploading their real data to Blockchain (these are the first and only foundations in the world that went blockchain!!) and by 2019 our goal is to have 25 000 foundations worldwide. By then the foundation that will not be uploading their financials to Blockchain will be out of business.  While we create the infrastructure for Charity 2.0, we manage all the processes, but when we finish it, all will become public domain and will be managed by the DAO.  Here are the explorer for Russian foundations: https://charityblockchain.ru  The website for English spoken countries (demo data): https://charityblockchain.info  2) We founded Charity Blockchain Association.  It is a decentralized organization for honest,charitable foundations that wish to go blockchain and increase their public trust and transparency.  Here you can read about the association https://charityblockchain.ru/association Rules & principles: https://charityblockchain.ru/terms  We have many more foundations on our way.  3) Creation of Chek.  We use donations data from Public Charity Ledger to issue Chek, a token of good deeds. We use this mechanism to create a new currency backed by good deeds and secured by the public trust in charitable organizations. After all, value of money is based on trust.  Our goal is to make Chek as popular and widely accepted as bitcoin and fiat money. We believe in decentralized money as an alternative to the old ideology of monopoly centralized money. We will work hard so that Chek takes its worthy niche in a kaleidoscope of different currencies.  At the heart of the check is a unique idea - the issue of a token for donations to foundations. It will spread the Chek among socially responsible citizens.  Our key task is to maximize the infrastructure for acceptance of Chek. It is being achieved through partnerships, a loyalty program, and an own marketplace.  4) Getone Blockchain  We're creating a unique blockchain network based on Proof-of-Authority with charitable foundations and socially responsible companies as the verified nodes (members of the association).  The idea is an industrial blockchain for companies and projects like One⁺¹ (currently we run on Etherium, but we will migrate to Getone) that need an inexpensive way to record a lot of data into Blockchain.  One the differences from other Blockchain such as Bitcoin is Getone’s incentive structure. Instead of having cryptocurrency “miners” compete against one another for the entire crypto-lottery prize, every time a Getone node confirms a block of transactions, the cryptocurrency reward gets dispersed across the network to all nodes, thus, supporting the charities worldwide.  Companies and projects will use Check to buy Getone tokens to pay for data recording.  5) Donations in cryptocurrency  We will use Chek and Loyalty Program's reward points to create a legal way to donate money to charitable foundations in any cryptocurrency.  Let me know if you have any questions. Our problem is that we're a complex infrastructural project, privately funded and we do not talk much about what we are working on. We are trying to fix this and looking forward to building a community of supporters who will help us to polish our ideas and go fully decentralized.  Artem Garashko, CTO of 1+1",True

We're not just planning; we're doing it already  As I wrote in the reply above, to Sergiose, we have launched Charity Blockchain Association and lining up the foundations that wish to upload their financial activities into blockchain.  Another week I laugh when my brother bought batteries that he purchased in a small mom N pop store because he did not need them at all, but the seller was too insistent, and he said the portion of funds from a sale would go to charities. So, I guess, since my brother is also working on One+1, he decides to participate in charity himself  I thought it was BS, but how would I know for sure if it is a legit donation? When we know someone personally we feel a certain level of trust towards a person based on the relationship history that helps us to decide whether to take a deal or not. This is why the personal relationships in the society are so important.  But if we don't know the person, how can we decide? The traditional approach in society for thousands of years is through a middlemen. There has to be an authoritative figure or organization that everyone trust. This what banks, notaries, governments, etc. are for. So, if I wanted to check whether there will be a donation from a battery sale, I could have request agreements or any other proof from the seller. Who would want to bother with this everytime you want to help? And then how would I be certain that the money was actually donated? Only by auditing the accounting books next month. But this is just a time waste and pain in...  So, here is where the [Suspicious link removed]es in. The champion of trust. It brings trust in an enviroment where parties don't trust each other and do not require an expensive intermediary (who often get corrupted when seizing a power ).  Sorry for the lyrical deviation, let's get back to how One+1 solves the trust.  Our technology does similar stuff that others are doing in other industries like tracking individual items (beef imports, goods, cars, parts, etc.) - it allows to track individual donations.  In the same situation with the batteries, the seller would have asked my brother for his Donator ID or offer to register in a One+1 global loyalty program and get one. My brother would see a donation in his account and would have received the status update and reports from the charity foundation.  We're developing various tools to engage donators with the charity via mobile app, chatbots, email, text messages.  On top of that, for each donation, the donator and charitable foundation will get Chek as a reward, which is a good incentive for the loyalty program for the businesses as well as a way to attract more money into charity sphere.  > And with this kind of project, I just really hope that they will not use charity purposes as a front in any kind of self gain. But, I doubt that will happen.  Our long-term aim is to decentralize. We just want to build infrastructure for Charity 2.0, step down and be part of DAO like everyone else. Thanks for your trust!",True

It is a good question and probably our CEO and others should join the conversation, I will ask. Here are my 5 cents from my engineering perspective:  1) We have a brilliant team and founders of One+1 have experience in launching large projects.  I have personally been involved in IT since my childhood because my father is a programmer. I'm a developer in the second generation. We have an IT development firm with a technical team which has been working together for as long as I remember myself.  I am originally from Russia, but for about ten years I was living in the US. I was a founding employee and first developer in CXI (https://ceifx.com, https://ebcfx.com), who is now one of the largest currency exchange companies in North America.  I made a system an ERP system for this business and then managed a large international IT team. We successfully went IPO on TSX and OTC in 2013.  Besides the engineers, the founding team also have members with massive experience in other spheres: business, OPS, marketing, law, accounting, etc. Our people has experience in the creation of various products from a retail bank TOP-100 from scratch to launching the best loyalty programs in the country. So, it is a pretty well-rounded team with a history working together.  You can learn more about us from our website or white-paper. Recently, we received a suggestion that we need to do KYC our team on the listings websites. We'll do it soon, so you can be sure we're real people  2) We have a legit and working business and working products and prototypes.  We achieved the following:  Founded Charity Blockchain Association https://charityblockchain.ru/association Functioning marketplace at https://1p1.io/market (soon will be in English) Signed agreements with 20+ retailers and selling their goods on the marketplace Signed agreements with 20+ charitable foundations and donating proceeds from sales on marketplace Blockchain Explorer at https://charityblockchain.ru/foundations Sales of celebrity lots are carried out in partnership with the largest charity event platform, Share the Good Things. For example, among super-stars was a well-known professional basketball player, Andrei Kirilenko. https://1p1.io/market/product/523 Koshelek (The Wallet), the largest retail aggregator, is the project’s partner. It aggregates many socially oriented businesses. An agreement has been signed with United Way’s representative office in Russia on strategic cooperation and verification of Russian and foreign nonprofits  Loyalty program prototype will launch real soon. And more.  3) We have been privately funded and working almost a year now. ICO for us is just one of the ways to raise funds as well a platform to promote our vision and technology. We also working with VCs and philanthropists.  4) Goltsblat BLP, an international law firm, now determines the jurisdiction for us and in the coming month an office will be opened.",True

Simple strategy:  1) We get all charitable foundations aboard  We solve trust problems for charitable foundations and help them to raise more money.  Last year we were busy testing our ideas and signing agreements with charitable foundations, which is a proof our concept works.  2) Donations data from foundations allows building a large leads database  There are 700 thousand charitable organizations in the world. These organizations exist thanks to people who support them: fund them through donations, volunteer assistance, etc.   When a new foundation joins the Association and starts importing its financials into Public Charity Ledger, we collect contact information of the donators and offer them to register in our One+1 loyalty program on behalf of the charitable foundation.  For example, the Fight Against Leukemia, the first charitable foundation in the world that joined the Association and started to upload their financials into Blockchain, in January 2017, attracted 3 398 333,69 Rubles (~ $60K) from ~800 donators. Almost all of them provided their e-mail or phone number when made the donation to a foundation.  Fight Against Leukemia's data: https://charityblockchain.ru/foundation/2  You can see the number gets quite big on a global scale. There are 1.5 bln donators making $700 bln being donated each year. This is 1% of World GPD.  3) Growing Chek acceptance infrastructure and scaling the system  There is one step left from a loyalty program to crypto-economy. People get an app where they track their reward points and can exchange them to/from Chek. Thus, making Chek an exchange mean for other cryptocurrencies and way in for people to the crypto world.  As far as the scaling, we achieving it through the integration of the loyalty program with retailers and retail aggregators.  For business - we provide a large leads database of wealthy people (a lot of people who donate are financially secure citizens). In addition, we provide a loyalty program with high customer engagement and return rate since people get involved into helping others via gamification, not just simply earning bonus points - they earn points by helping through buying goods from the business.  For charities - we provide extra money because the business donates part of the sale proceeds to charities.  Participants of the loyalty program - earn reward points, get to track the donation business makes on their behalf and engage with the cause they're supporting via mobile apps, blockchain explorer, chatbots, reports from the charities, etc.  We are negotiating with top aggregators, which accumulated tens of thousands of businesses. We can not yet disclose the names, but stay tuned in.  ---  This is our vision in three simple steps that integrates business and charity into a single effective ecosystem via a global loyalty program and Chek token. Let me know if you have any questions.",True
