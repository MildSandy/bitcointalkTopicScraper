Security: Cryptofitnessclub has come-up with a creative new way for storing your tokens offline. Cryptofitnessclub gives the users the ability to store virtual balances of their tokens in their profiles. The real tokens are stored offline in a cold wallet. This significantly reduces the possibility of loosing your tokens online. Even if a hacker manages to get access to your profile he will only be left with the virtual balance but can never access the real tokens.  New possibilities: The implementation of virtual balances opens windows for new possibilities like transferring balances between users without any transaction fee, instant transactions, micro-payments.

Micro-payments helps users to reward small amounts to authors/trainers if they find any article/video uploaded by them to be useful.  Medium article",False
