I really liked... pretty much everything about it. I think that decentralization is the future. However, I've been looking for someone like you to ask: In your opinion, is the project actually moving forward? I noticed that their subreddit is pretty much dead. The devs still post plenty of updates, but people just aren't talking about it anymore. And I'm just trying to figure out if that is because the market is down these days, or if its because people have sensed that this project is... shall we say faltering somewhat. Is that happening? Or are they going full steam ahead, harder than they ever have?  I'd also heard that there were only 3 devs, but I heard this a long time ago. So maybe it was never true, or it was at one point but now they've hired more. To me, there does seem to be a bit of stagnation. If I had to hazard a guess, I'd have said that there would be at least 1 more district up and running by now. Maybe 2. What are your thoughts on all of this?",False

Both have completely different marketplaces, but being able to atomic swap DNT for PART or vice versa within Particl Project's built in Altcoin.io exchange offers both coin holders easy access to the differing marketplaces.  So, if you want access to a privacy marketplace outside of the DNT/ETH/ANT network, you can exchange DNT for PART.  IF I don't have the need for privacy, I can access the multitude more options/markets on DNT network.

[Note: This is a press release.]  district0x’s cooperation with Confideal will provide uncompromised benefits for both companies. district0x’s experience in creating “districts” as marketplaces that are operated by a lot of smart contracts is priceless, and Confideal will get a lot of experience and recognition by taking part in the creation of the smart contracts for new “districts.”  Thus, it will allow Confideal to get more client-flow through their platform, and it will allow districts to simplify their smart contract creation processes, because all of their d0xINFRA framework is comprised of Ethereum smart contracts and that is what Confideal is specialized in.  The district0x Network is a collective of marketplaces and communities, which we refer to as districts. Districts exist as decentralized autonomous organizations on the district0x Network. All districts will be built upon a standard open-source framework, d0xINFRA. Modeled after the Ethlance stack, the d0xINFRA framework is comprised of Ethereum smart contracts and front-end libraries.  To provide all internet citizens with an opportunity to freely join and contribute to any district, to align incentives across all of a district’s participants, and to implement coordinated decision-making mechanisms to the district0x Network, the district0x Network Token has been introduced. The district0x Network Token (DNT) is a staking token, used by holders to join districts and participate in their governance.  Upon staking district0x Network Tokens to a district, participants receive an equivalent amount of voting rights in the district. Voting rights can be used to partake in the processes that determine everything from a district’s branding, to its accepted code of conduct, to the auxiliary modules that are integrated, to the way that fees collected by revenue-generating auxiliary modules are utilized, and beyond.  For more information about district0x, please visit district0x.io.  Conﬁdeal is a visual smart contract builder that makes creating, managing, and enforcing smart contracts quick and easy. Users with absolutely no coding skills can create an enforceable, self-executing, and secure digital agreement powered by Ethereum for all types of transactions. The platform’s built-in arbitration module allows contract parties to resolve disputes in the Conﬁdeal environment using top-rated arbiters without the need to reveal any personal data. It offers a revolutionary opportunity for enterprises, small companies, and individuals to execute deals without the need for costly and delay-inducing intermediaries.

Thx in advance,   To the staking question, it's not like the traditional staking process, it's voting based.  Much of the high level that you need to know regarding staking is at the below link:  https://vote.district0x.io/  it terms of profit share and all that stuff, that depends on the projects you vote on.  You essentially become a stakeholder and you participate (vote) in dictating the direction of the project.  The rewards/incentives that stakeholders would receive vary from project to project.

Great option to keep the token alive on market cause interest of dev and hodlers is same. Price is searching for the bottom cause most trading will move to ETH on Binance, Volume there already higher as on Liqui also gwowing there in ETH compared to BTC and with switch from selling in BTC to ETH they lost some price as RTH went down compared to BTH. Thats why looking for lower bottom before pumping again or just hetting ready for Bittrex where also ETH will be the trading token. Now all just looking for price on Binance and correcting to it elsewhere and the buyers on Binance looking for lowest entry point. Thats why many selling in Liqui (as withdrawals are slow lately) to convert it to ETH and then buying lower on Binance to keep the value. It will be some time to get enough buyers on Binance and then it will be ready for pump to test last top at least. Atm bottom is being tested in BTC on Liqui where it is around 3600-3550 but looks solid but story in ETH a bit different as ater last fall support looking extremly strong but missing tops from past weeks. We'll just see if DNT will after pumping thst is inevitable break 60 in ETH (past tops) or the latest at 8700 (a bit hard to believe in one shot).

Bittrex is US based and with our financial regulatory body (SEC) recently going on record that ICOs that contain any financial incentive for participation/ownership are subject to regulation the same as traditional securities (financial instruments) Bittrex is vary wary to list projects that clearly fall in that category and hence would be gray area illegal to own or process through US financial institutions without that ICO having SEC review and prior approval.

Bittrex Update Last edited 9 hours ago Last week, Bittrex announced that they had listed DNT for exchange and opened markets for trading. Within a very short period of time they received deposits of more than 40M DNT from members of our community. Only minutes later they halted trading, tweeting that the issue was ‘compliance related’ with no further explanation, which we were only made aware of when we started to receive a wave of questions wanting to know what compliance checkpoints we failed to pass. Shortly after, we received a message from the Bittrex team telling us that in light of the recent SEC guidance they will need us to complete a ‘compliance review’. Having spent nearly 3 years at Coinbase, I can appreciate the sensitive nature of regulators looming over the space, and let them know that we are happy to work with their team or any other exchanges to provide any information they may need from us to perform their necessary checks. Bittrex’s ‘compliance review’ does not simply entail a request for information though. Also included is a request for payment of a minimum of $5000, possibly more, with no guarantee of listing after payment. We have said all along that we will not be paying to be listed on any exchanges and we are reaffirming that stance today. We outline our rationale behind our position below. The district0x Project does not stand to generate any revenue from the listing of DNT on Bittrex. Just yesterday, Liqui generated more than $10,000 worth of revenue from fees of the exchange of DNT. From a financial standpoint, it seems to be a rational move for the Bittrex team to pay the costs associated with performing the necessary due diligence to list DNT on their exchange. It is an irrational move for us to foot their bills when they stand to generate a significant amount of revenue off of our listing and will not be kicking back any of this to support the project's long term goals. We just wrapped up a fundraiser in which we collected funds to build an open source software project with the goals of equitably distributing governance powers and the share of financial successes of marketplaces amongst all participants, decentralizing markets in the process. Covering the legal costs for a centralized service that retains all profits for themselves is antithetical with our vision. Bittrex is one of many exchanges. If we were to agree to pay their legal costs so that they could decide if they should list us for exchange, it would be logical for every other exchange around the world to require us to do the same. These costs would be prohibitive and it is unrealistic for us to do so. In light of this announcement, we anticipate some frustrations from some members of our community. This is a decision we feel strongly about and will not be backing off of. That being said, we completely understand the desire to see additional exchanges list DNT and understand the need for liquidity long-term. Given such, we will be taking the following actions: Partnering with the 0x Project to build an integration for the exchange of DNT with any other ERC20 token at trade.district0x.io. More details to follow in a separate blog post soon. Supporting the efforts of other decentralized exchange projects such as Ethfinex, Oasis, and EtherDelta. Keeping the door open for Bittrex. If they decide at any time they would like to begin their compliance review, we are happy to meet with their team and legal counsel and provide any necessary information. Engaging with other popular exchanges. We have/will be reaching out to the teams at Bitfinex, Kraken, Poloniex, and Yunbi. If there are any others you would like us to contact, let us know. We thank you for your patience and support with this matter and will be sure to share any material updates as they become available to the team. We invite all other projects to join us in taking a similar stance and are always open to collaboration and coordinating efforts to push the ball forward for the Ethereum community as a whole.

There are two options to contribute to the crowdsale:  1. Sending Ether to the address, which will be published when the crowdsale begins. This will be published on the same https://contribution.district0x.io/ page you're looking at currently. DO NOT send Ether from an exchange account. You cannot send Ether from Bittrex and expect to receive tokens to the Bittrex account, because it is not configured to receive the District0x tokens. You MUST send Ether from a supported Ether wallet (MyEtherWallet, Mist, Parity, Metamask, etc.) in order to properly receive the DNT (District Network Tokens). This is the case for any Ethereum-based ICO crowdsale.  2. The team has tried to make it easier for those using the Metamask, Mist or Parity wallets by including the ""Send"" button on the same https://contribution.district0x.io/ page. In order for this to work you must be setup under one of those three online wallets. For metamask and Parity you should enable Chrome extensions. For more information on this check out our youtube channel where we have videos that explain the process: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQq0INymkcGDYYXeFZgYk4g  Remember, do not send Ether from any exchange wallet and make sure to double check your sending address, amount of Ether sending, etc.  Please feel free to reply with any other questions, and thank you for the support!!",False

Soft Cap: $10M USD equivalent in ETH Security Cap: $50M USD equivalent in ETH   TOKEN DISTRIBUTION  We have taken numerous steps to ensure a level playing field for all and to try to achieve a wide distribution of district0x Network Token holders.  No whitelisted addresses No 3rd-party allocations No bonus structure 50 Gwei max gas price Community Advisor Program District Proposal Rewards     Tokens reserved for future contribution periods will only be issued in the event that additional funding is needed and key roadmap items have been completed. They will otherwise be burned. The founding team’s stake vests over the course of 2 years with a 6 month cliff.  ROADMAP    MISSION STATEMENT  The district0x Project will facilitate the operation and governance of marketplaces and communities, referred to as “districts”. Districts will operate as decentralized autonomous organizations which will enable the recreation of many of the internet’s most popular applications and services while eliminating rent-seeking and the relinquishment of decisions and personal data to third-parties.  OUR VISION  The development of the Ethereum protocol has opened the door for experimentation in decentralized organizational structures and the distribution of governance rights to a network’s participants. Projects such as Aragon, Boardroom, Colony, and Giveth are actively working to harness the powers of Ethereum, building platforms that enable non-technical users to create and administrate decentralized organizations. These tools allow for new means of group coordination through economic incentives, making it possible to disintermediate marketplaces and communities and to allocate voting rights to their participants. In short, citizens of the internet can now build and control the platforms they frequent every day.  The district0x Network seeks to be home to a vast array of decentralized markets and communities all of which are governed by holders of the DNT token. In accordance with this vision, d0xINFRA has been designed as an open and extendable modular system that allows districts to implement unique features and enhanced functionality via the plug-in of auxiliary modules.  In addition to Ethlance, launched in 2017, we plan to launch two additional districts. The first will be ENS Bazaar, a peer-to-peer marketplace for the exchange of names registered via the Ethereum Name Service. The second will be Meme Factory which will allow users to mint their own provably rare tokenized memes which can be immediately posted to a bulletin board-style marketplace for sale or exchange.    As a contributor, why should I consider contributing to district0x?  By contributing to district0x you will receive district0x network tokens (DNT) which when staked, enable token holders to exert voting right on district proposals and exert decision making within particular districts. Examples of the types of decision rights token holders can make: voting on proposals which guide the future of a particular district, setting district fees, sharing in network rewards. The extent and scope of shareholder right will be outlined in each district's bylaws and will vary according to the specific scope and purpose of each district.  As a potential user, why should I consider using district0x?  Users of the district0x platform will be able to interact with and use the functionality and services which will be offered by each district. Users will also be able to freely create their own districts. For example, on Ethlance, the first district in the district0x network, users are able to post job listings and find jobs.  As a blockchain enthusiast, why should I consider district0x?  district0x enables the formation and governance of decentralized autonomous organizations. Decentralized autonomous organizations are the first step in this process. district0x enables the formation and governance of a districts which can operate as DAO’s.  district0x NETWORK TOKEN (DNT)  The district0x Network Token (DNT) is integral and serves a vital role within the district0x network. DNT is used to provide users an opportunity to freely join and contribute to any district, to align incentives across all of a district’s participants, and to implement coordinated decision-making mechanisms to the district0x Network. One DNT is minted and staked anytime a new district is created. The DNT also operates as voting rights which may be bought on the open market, and then stakes in order to participate in the governance of individual districts.
