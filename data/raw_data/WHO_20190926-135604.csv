WhoHas is a social platform based on the Ethereum blockchain. Its main purpose is competitive image sharing. WhoHas offers different categories in which users can upload their shots. The images will then be viewed, judged and voted by the community. The winner in each category as well as the community members who voted in favor of the winning contribution will then be financially rewarded. Check out our FAQ  https://i.imgur.com/Il5wei5.png  Who are we? The team consists of experts in the area of Crypto and IT Security. We built the core team very consciously to cover all topics with the best people available. Additionally, we picked people who shared the same vision to bring this great project to success. We have over 7 voluntarily contributors ranging from blockchain developers to cryptographs and have a very strong partner institution. We would love to hear from you, if you are interested in a project like this! More information here: Team  Roadmap: https://i.imgur.com/Dzqy3VZ.png  ICO:  Why should you be interested in this startup?  WhoHas is a refreshing and revolutionary counterpart to traditional social media. It is an entire new dimension of social interaction. We started the ICO, because we need funds in order to complete our vision. Instead of giving people empty promises of revolutionary technology which will be implemented in a few years, our launch date will be in August 2018.  Here are a few reasons why you should participate in our ICO:  Get WHO Token - Use it to vote and submit in our application or trade it on exchanges Invest in a solid and publicly known team with a great community of contributors Implementation goal of a few months instead of a few years - Check our Roadmap Be part in the first decentralized application for a daily use aimed at regular users Active communication with the community and investors (After ICO) Official German business form - GmbH (After Launch) WhoHas blockchain with a new consensus algorithm called Proof of Vote WhoHas contributes to the Ethereum Foundation and research For more information why we are the perfect startup for your investment - Take a look at our Whitepaper  One very important statement from us: We don't want to impress you with bought reviews, follower or partners. We present you our project as it is - with a strong partner and a very skilled and efficient team. If you love crypto like we do.. lets make this project a success to reach regular users with a blockchain project  How can someone participate?  This is the second phase of the ICO. The first phase was like a test in order to verify that everything works and all internal audits were successfully conducted. There may be a third phase to deploy the new contract to finalize the fundament for the launch. As a phase 2 investor you have nothing to do after it is finished.  ICO Start: 21.February 2018 00:00 - 1 ETH - 4420 Token End of Phase 1: 02.March 2018 23:59 - DONE Start Phase 2: 03.March 2018 00:00 - 1 ETH - 3315 Token End of Phase 2: 23.March 2018 23:59 (Countdown)  See ICO and Get Who for information on how to participate in the ICO. We are currently working on a simplified documentation of the process so that anyone can use it.  Communication  We want to build a community for technical and organisational discussions. There are so many projects where community members have no way of talking to the dev team. As 100% transparent project we would love to hear from you at our Slack.  Bonus If you like our project on Facebook and follow us on Twitter you get five free token! To claim them just write us an e-mail with the account names you used! info@whohas.io  Conclusion If you have any feedback or questions, we would love to hear from you! Lets build a new kind of social platform on a decentralized technology with a token that regular users can actually use. As you can see we only started, but the next two months will be huge for us in terms of additional partners and advisors. Thanks in advance for your feedback and participation.

Only, to vote, members will have to use WHO instead of freely pressing that heart shaped button? Although this is a good idea to prevent abuse from fake accounts which created to help voting one or two uswrs, especially given that it gives some tokens for winning prize, but because they have to spent some of their fortune, no matter how insignificant it is,, wouldn't it made people think twice to give a vote?  I mean, yes there are people out there who are willing to spend money to tip inspiring pictures as an appreciation, but I also believe there are far more lot of people who doesn't want to bother themselves with that method.",False

We appreciate this a lot.  But its not a new kind of Instagram. As you can see on our site we have different kinds of contests. (Sorry for not being able to post images yet). There are: Cyclic Contests - e.g. every week with different requirements like Nature or Outfits Community Contests - Apple vs Samsung? Coke vs Pepsi? Show them your community is better! (e.g. Brands or Lifehacks) Flash Events with a very limited timespan - be spontaneous. Best Of - e.g. annually contest of all winners in their areas  So imagine you are at work and a new flash event goes online with the topic ""who has the best office?"" or ""who has the best lunch"" for 1h. It's really funny, and in some tests we conducted that people really love this progress. Even if you are not the artistic type and don't like taking photographs, you can still win a few bucks for a very small amount at stake. The use of our WHO token does not only prevent fake accounts and submissions, but also ensures a high quality of the images in the contests. People don't view an insignificant amount of money (e.g. 20Cent) as a real spending. Especially, in voting or betting applications like bet-and-win, where the majority of the people spend several Euros/Dollars every day. The financial reward is of course a great benefit, but even if it wouldn't exist we believe that people would use it in order to support some of their stars, brands and influencer. Additionally (and even more important), due to blockchain based technology the people can be sure (and even check) that there is no manipulation of the voting process. And a nice little side effect is that the token can rise in value later on.  What is somewhat not that clear in the entry post (due to the missing images) is that we want to build our own blockchain with a new consensus algorithm. We call it Proof of Vote and its basically a consensus algorithm very similar to Proof of Stake. We want to build it so that we are not dependent on PoW or PoS and the winning votes validate the transaction due to the quality. A few algorithm already tried to use this behaviour for other applications. We think it is the future of all voting and similar use cases (like auctions) and we will provide it to everyone, because all of our code is OpenSource. But we want to have a working product asap, so that we can prove the community that we are not another vaporware project.  I hope we could clear up a few things If you have still questions or other feedback, we would love to hear it. Thanks again for your time and thoughts",False

In spite of it, and more or less because of it, I still have to argue about the money required to vote. I can't agree more that cents can hardly be seen as an actual spending, people throw it without think twice.  However, we need to remember that in cryptoworld, especially if you don't have your own EUR-WHO or USD-WHO pair, which then will require your members to exchange them to BTC or ETH first, there are minimum amount of trade and dust transaction. These two factors will require people to do a slightly bigger spending. This is what I think will make people think thrice to join your community, especially those that are new to crypto.  Analogically speaking, it's true that people won't bother much to throw fifty cents to appreciate a wonderful street musician, but if he has to made a deposit of ten dollars prior to the tipping, despite the amount deposited can be used to tip twenty times, they'll more or less being reluctant, especially if they are not familiar enough with the currency system.",False

That is exactly what we want to accomplish. People using Cryptocurrencies without all the hassle, so they can actually see and use them without any knowledge of the technology. They will understand what we understood a time ago -> This is the future in a lot of areas.  These are exactly the thoughts and problems we faced, when we created the concept. Like you, we assume that people don't want to go through the hassle we as a Cryptocommunity have to go through right now. If our users would have to go through this process, our project would be doomed from start. Thats why we are cooperating with another project/ product (more soon) to solve that problem for our userbase. User-friendliness and providing them a great experience in all steps (including getting crypto in the first hand) is an essential step to bring regular users into our community. We are currently working on integrating this whole process in our mobile applications, so that there are no additional steps needed. Additionally, there will be an easy-to-use WhoHas and Ethereum Wallet inside of our App. After launching our own blockchain this will be, of course, a new wallet. Both kinds of wallets are of course light wallets, who leverage the functionality of patricia merkle trees and other aspects.  That was a concern we also had at the beginning, but we found a way to overcome it. That's why we created our Smart Contracts in a way and let them interact with each other, so that we can assure our users have the min. amount of transaction costs available. Additionally, we use techniques like transaction batching for contests(more in the upcoming yellow paper). As researchers we are trying to use and contribute to current scaling and research technologies like sharding, plasma and raiden. At the moment we try to identify the most valuable technology for our project and improve it together with the Ethereum Research team (or the project team).  Thanks again for your time and thoughts WhoHas",False

Together with chris, I did the main part in developing the technical side of our project. And I just wanted to mention a few things.   As you can read on our homepage whohas.io, we are currently finishing our netsec masters program. For us, this project is not about money, it's about pushing the crypto-movement forward. We want to create a real life use-case and make things real. We sure know, other people are trying (and accomplish) this, too. Yet our project is small enough to be not discouraging people wo haven't been involved with crypto. But also it has the potential to surive and bring the development forward. If we want to be financial profitable in the future we have to continuously improve our system. At the current situation, fees are just to high to make micro-transactions. This forces us to implement every new step the cryptocommunity makes. This includes experiments with sharding, raiden or plasma. Since we are working a 100% open source, we will create a lot of  example material and (hopefully) best practices for other people who want to join our trip and even go their own way. With our project we won't harm or compete anyone in this community, rather it will thrive on us. We bring the scientific knowledge to understand the underlying technique and also the motivation of (maybe soon) self-employed people. I really wish you can help us to reach this.  Best wishes felix",False
