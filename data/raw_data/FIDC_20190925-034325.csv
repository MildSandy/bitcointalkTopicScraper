I took a peek at your aan and whitepaper, and I must say that your project sounds extremely interesting.  I have a few questions, though: 1. In the light of the recent events: where is your main company based (under what jurisdiction - I cant find any address anywhere)? I see that you have lots of Russian guys and girls in the team, but are you from Russia, Ukraine, Belarus or any other ex Soviet Republic (meaning, will the regulations in your jurisdiction permit ICO campaign business in the near future?) 2. You don't plan to reserve some share of the funds gathered during the ICO for the ""Buyback"" option, but it will be generated exclusively from the net profit of the future business operations? Thanks in advance, and good luck!",False

Bounty Campaign: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2185693.0  FIDCOM.NET WHITE PAPER                Dear friends, my name is Oleg Saifullin, and I want to share with you our product, tell about it in detail, answer any questions, hear constructive criticism and approving opinions.  Little bit about me - I'm 32 years old, a lawyer of international law. I am one of the founders and developers of a product called Fidcom. In business since 19 years, in my opinion, for these almost 13 years, has managed to gain invaluable experience in doing business and development of companies in various spheres. At the moment I am an investor and a full participant in the gambling, construction, manufacturing, chemical and IT industries. I believe that every person is able to discover the capabilities of a successful businessman and become him, but this will require an inner desire and effort on oneself. Let it be a small shop with ice cream or a travel agency - the most important thing that it brings pleasure, causing the desire to build and develop your project. In addition to the cash component, you need to invest your soul in a business - I think everyone noticed that when your car leaves the car wash, it starts to go better, steeper, cheerful, as if the car thanks you for caring. Business behaves in a similar way - if you only think about how to pump more money into your pocket and not invest your emotions in it - then I can say that the failure is 100% guaranteed.  Now, with your permission, I will tell you about our product, which, in my opinion, will become a bomb and bring a new direction to financial institutions. I hope that our experience will be useful to all mankind and this idea will go beyond Fidcom, becoming a convenient tool for many companies! Our main goal is to show that this technology allows to do business honestly and transparently, efficiently and profitably. Undeniable advantages are also the absence of bureaucracy and minimization of risks of managerial errors. Maybe we'll even get into Wikipedia =) A little humor.  So: Fidcom is the first investment company in the world of cryptocurrency on decentralized control algorithms. The essence of which lies in the fact that all management of the company is in the hands of the Community (holders of assets) and only they are given the absolute right to dispose of assets.  All participants (asset holders) have the right to vote, there are no discrimination by property or social status. Technologically, the management process does not have flaws, excesses or bureaucratic delays. According to Fidcom algorithms, fraud between members is excluded, thanks to honest and open voting proccess on the network, which does not require programming skills.  In simple terms, management of assets in the company using Fidcom algorithms can be done by any person, special IT knowledge is not needed.  All financial statements and indicators of profitability, committed and planning transactions, results and announcements of voting are built on Blockchain technology - open, transparent, and storing all information about all operations and actions. All of this for one purpose - to make the risks of the investor minimal, and the management of the company business transparent.  Community on the general vote appoint an executive body, the purpose of which is to implement the business model of the community. In its turn, the executive body hires staff, adjusts collaboration between departments, a structure of relationship and controls accomplishment of the tasks set, that is, the main purpose of the executive body is to actually turn the communities’ ideas and wishes into reality.  Fidcom's activities are described in detail in the White Paper, in general they look like this:   - Investments: A.   Creating a portfolio of the most popular and promising cryptocurrency and professional management of it; B.   Investments in the most promising startups on the crypto-currency market;  - PoW mining: Directly mining of cryptocurrency on specialized computing equipment with a gradual output to the total power of 1 TH/s.  - Launching of its own stock exchange with cryptocurrency and filling it with liquidity;  - Payment services and apps: Implementing convenient IT applications on iOS and Android platforms (like Smartphone Stock Exchange, CryptoWallet) which will enable users to make payments and attach them to plastic cards.     Management of the company I would like to focus your attention on the voting procedure of the Community as the main point of the company management:  Every investor (holder of Fidcom tokens) is a full participant in the voting and has the right, both to vote and to put on the agenda any issues, proposals that will necessarily be considered. For this purpose, we have a voting mechanism consisting of 3 stages: Terms and voting mechanism 1. The first stage - the transfer of issues and proposals to the moderator; 2. The second stage is the approval of the issue or proposal by the community itself; 3. The third stage is the general vote of the Community on preliminary approved issues. The right and number of votes of each investor is determined by the number of tokens that he/she owns, as of the voting date. Thus - any participant, even that have only  0.1  Fidcom token can vote on any question on the management of the Company.
