This needs to be understood with reference to the blockchain technology again where all the potential transactions are placed into the blocks which then shape sup into a long chain (single). So, in such situation, if a couple of miners creates 2 distinct blockchain blocks then the community of the blockchain platform would by design pick one of the blocks and would eventually discard the other one. The issue here is considerable waste of efforts and resources. On, the other end, Hashgraph is quite smart to tackle such an issue. In its network, every container or the block is always brought into use and no block is ever discarded. Conclusively, Hashgraph as of now is a superior technology than blockchain as it addresses quite a good number of issues of varying scale.

The decentralized cryptocurrencies platforms of Blockchain model are powered by consensus algorithms, which is its most crucial aspect. It is true that the advent of Blockchain changed our life altogether and opened new horizons in the financial domain. But, this doesn’t mean that we limit ourselves just to what the initial model of Blockchain has offered us. Things evolve in any technological infrastructure with time and demand of the market. In Blockchain, the shared public ledger is all dependent upon efficiency and performance of its consensus algorithm.  A popular example of a consensus algorithm is Proof of Work (PoW) which is used both by the gigantic cryptocurrencies, Ethereum and Blockchain. There are multiple such algorithms introduced so far for different cryptocurrencies which were introduced to address a particular issue and to take the blockchain mechanism to an altogether newer level. What does a Consensus Algorithm do?  A consensus algorithm in the blockchain model majorly performs two major things which are given as follows:       Ensuring that the next block in line is every possible sense is the unique version of the transaction or truth.      Countering the resourceful challengers from deteriorating or derailing the network/ system and ensuring successful forking of the chain.",True

Despite having many other algorithms, it is still entrusted by the top of the line cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, Litecoin, Zcash and many more. However, Ethereum is on its way to move to the Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm which we will be discussing in the next section. The performance of PoW is dependent upon the participants which it requires to do the computationally intensive work. Miners in case of the Bitcoin platform work to accumulate a set of transaction, called block, to be associated with the network maintained by the global blockchain. In order to get this done, the miner has to be the first one to rightly point out the ‘nonce’, which is actually a number that is appended at the end of the string, forming a hash. Hash initiates with the number of 0s required. The best part of PoW is that, it has proven itself with performance over a good number of years, which is far more than any of the consensus algorithms that it competes with. However, PoW has its share of downsides as well and the major ones are its excessive.",True

In this one, rather than going for the costly computer equipment for mining blocks, an investment is made by the validator in the coins of the system. The term validator is used here as no mining is done for coin creation in PoS. Instead, all the coins are actually in existence right from the first day and the validator are strictly paid in the fee for transaction. In the case of PoS, the chance for user to be selected for creating the next block depends upon the particular fraction of the tokens that are under your ownership. It means that a validator that has 400 coins is 4 times as likely to be selected as compared to a user with only 100 coins. The block always needs to be fully committed to the blockchain once it is created by a validator. The PoS implemented in different networks varies considerably in handling such a process of block creation. If you consider Tendermint, then each and every node in the network is bound to sign off on the block, until the system reaches the status of the majority vote. On the other hand, in some other systems, PoS make the selection of signers group, randomly. There is one problem that how one should prevent a validator for creating a couple of blocks and in return, looking for double transaction fees? This phenomenon is known as 'Nothing at Stake'. So, a person who has nothing to lose also doesn't have any good reason not to behave badly. The blockchain engineers are driving hard to alleviate this problem. One probable solution insight is to make the validator to employ a virtual vault for locking their currency. The coins gets totally slashed if the validator is found forking or double signing the system. The PoS was first used by peercoin which was then followed by NXT and blackcoin. Currently Ethereum operates using the PoW but in line to benefit from the perks of PoS.",True

This algorithm, as you might can sense from its name is an alternate to the Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm (discussed above), which is quite a familiar one these days. The working mechanism of DPoS is quite dissimilar from the conventional consensus algorithms mechanisms. Here, the stakeholders are responsible for electing the witnesses and the witnesses are then obliged and rewarded for producing blocks, which eventually become part of the blockchain. Stakeholders have the liberty to vote for as many witnesses as they want and nearly half of the stakeholders are of the opinion that the required decentralization has been accomplished by the number of witnesses elected. The voting process here is continuous, so this gives witnesses the potential for having an incentive in performing their function to the optimum level or otherwise they become vulnerable in losing their position.

Ensuring integrity in the carried transactions is also a key aspect of this consensus algorithm. The main application of the algorithm is in the Ripple cryptocurrency where Ripple foundation is responsible for preselecting the validators. The other notable application of BFT is in the Stellar cryptocurrency network, in which, anybody could be a validator and the level of trust is established or gained by the community itself. BFT is highly beneficial, mainly because of its ability to address scalability issues and offering transactions at a much reduced cost.

Hashgraph in one line is the future of the distributed ledger technology. Now let's get to the actual meat of the matter and find out that what Hashgraph really is. It is essentially known as one of the most robust system, especially in comparison to the blockchain briefly discussed above. It also has its own consensus algorithm which provides an absolutely innovative podium for employing the consensus algorithms to get things going in a much smarter way. You may recall the most commonly known attributes which you would associate with the blockchain model and those are consensus based, flexible, distributive, transparent and transactional. Hashgraph is known to have all the mentioned attributes which are also part of the blockchain. The technology majorly is a mix of the innovative consensus algorithm and the data structures which help in providing a more transparent, fast and a highly secure network, especially when compared to blockchain. In order to achieve transparency, speed and top security, Hashgraph make use of the following two highly effective techniques:      Gossip about Gossip - Gossip about Gossip is such a concept which actually tells about associating a supplementary amount of new information to the ongoing gossip. The ongoing gossip is actually about the 2 x hashes to which the last 2 folks talked to. So, a Hashgraph could then be built on this principle and the same could be updated just as some more information becomes available over the node.     Virtual Voting - Just as you find the Hashgraph being ready then this is the time when it is very easy to point out that what the node would actually vote. It is because, we as a user are fully aware about what is the exact information at every node and when actually they knew it all. Now this data can now be employed in order to input that in the required voting algorithm and also to skim out the fact that which of the carried transaction have reached to the consensus point in a quick amount of time.",True

This kind of mechanism ensures that all the data or the records that it contains remains the same all across the network, no matter, wherever it is physically stored. Considering such a model of blockchain, nothing over the network could ever be controlled by any single person or entity. This in other words also means that the blockchain has no single point of failure.  Now let us see what Hashgraph has got to offer. The Hashgraph by nature supports a much diverse and a superior data structure which by every means is fully capable in solving a range of problems which the blockchain network always has been found to struggle with, such as its consensus algorithm mechanism.

On the hand, unlike the public networks, the private type networks limits the usage of the network exclusively for the trusted parties only. The resultant of such approach is considerably low cost and it also enhances the performance of the network quite dramatically. The algorithms employed in such networks have got the potential to ensure as many as 1000 transactions in every second, which is quite speedy and phenomenal.

These are the major reasons which makes Hashgraph solution worth trying over the blockchain model.  Apart from that, the Hashgraph has got a number of other considerable advantages as well where the consensus time stamping feature is worth mentioning here. In the blockchain model, a miner has got the option to preselect the transaction ordering in a block and this could also be exploited to intentionally introduce a delay in transactions with the approach of putting them into the future blockchain blocks. Moreover, they could also be completely halted to enter the system. This is resolved by the consensus time stamping mechanism introduced through Hashgraph.

The white paper at the first place should ideally exist which give users all the necessary finance and technical information about the platform. After that, a badly written or a plagiarized white paper could be a clear sign of a fraudulent ICO business that you need to beware of.  Moving forward, find out about the guarantee of the system to generate profits. There are some business using automated bots as a key offering to clients for generating guaranteed profits. More so, it is now the option of ""staking"" your cryptocurrency that is gaining more popularity and credibility in the eyes of the investors. This has got a high potential and it is also one of the key selling point of the CyBit™ crowdfunding platform.  There are nearly 250 ICOs as of now of varying scale and ensuring due diligence over all of them might not be a feasible task. Even the Subject Matter Experts (SME) would struggle considerably in order to keep everyone up-to-date about the overall integrity of the platform.

Technologies destroy and create lifestyles, enable conquerors and fold empires. To understand new technologies was to predict the future, it is truer today. Imperfect information has always been the barrier to overcome. Throughout the last two centuries, modern finance crafted tools and abstractions as they were necessary to stopgap, categorize and process a seemingly constant flow of information with ever newer technologies. These tools and abstractions are now, themselves, antiquated. Services such as Gofundme and other crowdfunding services represent a final attempt of “modern” finance to acquiesce to a need no singular institution or industry could fulfill.  The oldest discovered uses of written language invariably have to do with economic activity, production or trade. Trade did not come into its own, truly, until there existed a systematic means of recording stored resources and their exchanges. No doubt the second form of writing was somebody trying to convince somebody else to submit their resources to some supposed deserving project.  New enterprises, in the early days of civilization, were the product of villages, kingdoms or counties organizing to contribute. If they were successful enterprises, they would be copied by neighboring communities. Technologies were spread by the very earliest and most primitive form of crowdfunding finance, community labor. To ignore new successful enterprises and technologies was to invite it through conquest.  As technologies advanced so too did economic tools and the arts of finance. With the liquidity of resources gained by the introduction of money, a million avenues opened. This complicated matters. Guilds, banks and private clubs formed around industries, directing resources and managing finance, loans, schools, endeavors and apprenticeships. With these various masters of capital, one no longer needed to convince a multitude to contribute but a small number of supposedly wise men, proof being their largesse of course.  The financial tools developed alongside industrialization did less to inform and more to enable financier controls. These privileges of recompense and legal recourse were granted in the name of encouraging investments. Imperfect information has become an ever rising hurdle with the complexities of human culture, technology, lifestyles and spirit. Sometimes we know so little, even the nepotism of those with the spark to try is preferred to the shot in the dark most investment analysts are capable of in the 21st century.  Most of these financial tools, rights, privileges, regulations and abstractions continue to exist contrary to the spirit of their proposed intents. They prop up dinosaur institutions whose investments are dependent on the stagnation endemic of regression, less and less clarity. Valiant efforts toward the ideal of crowdfunding can be seen to have had some success. Once again, imperfect information halts most drastic advances.  The answer, of course, are the technologies in front of us. Blockchain smart contract ERC-23 enabled CyBit technology introduces a framework for the efficient management of information for financing, truly democratizing the process, enabling accurate community based crowdfunding of legitimately innovative and Earth-shattering technologies that need our attention and resources. The promise and possibilities inherent of such a system that could predict success is not only exciting but responsible, making CyBit (CBT) the right move right now.

To say there is a lot of money to be made in cryptocurrencies is a cheesy understatement but it must be said. Adoption of cryptocurrencies continues unabated despite major and minor setbacks and crashes.  Visit any major exchange website. Sit back in wonder and awe at people trading money earned with their hard labors on these internet monies with only a special identifying or, now, expository number attached. It’s new, strange and even a bit terrifying to people. They’re used to paper money and credit cards with a steadily declining reliable $$$US$$$dollar$$$. There will always be flighty investors down the road to eventual complete adoption of cryptocurrencies  $This$is$still$money$to$people$. General adoption of cryptocurrencies is limited in this way and it explains the rises and falls, the panic sells. But what of relative value? What is it about one coin over the other? With over 2000 coins now in existence, what drives the difference in valuation?  The most obvious problems facing any new coin in the cryptocurrency market are identical to that of the largest and oldest coins, establishing legitimacy. Coins that demonstrate any legitimacy early on, even the shadow of legitimacy, have healthy initial offerings and, outside of typical market movements and outright FUD and lies, go on to do well if honest about their capabilities. What is it that lends legitimacy to a cryptocurrency?  Is it the money already invested in the market and, more specifically, directly in the coin? Longevity and established brand? Steady investment of miners? Perceived security? Real security? Perceived and real utility? Why do we see ups and downs in the first place?  Blockchains are natively secure and reliable, as reliable as transactions they can fulfill in their network. Especially secure are those blockchains based upon complex and robust standards adhering to strict confirmation processes, made reliable by proliferation. This leaves us, still, with utility.  Some might say the nature of cryptocurrency as a secure store of value grants usefulness but this is ancillary and utile only to previous adopters. It’s a general utility true of all cryptocurrencies and tied to market capacity. This does not encourage specific adoption any greater than other secure stores of value. Other very secure methods of storing value include, but are not limited to, your mattress, a hole in your backyard, a dirty sock or real estate.  If simple storage of value was of true primacy to utility, the coin with the largest store would be sopping up all leftovers (as predicted by some analysts in the earliest days of crypto and “altcoins”). Rather what we see in the current market is a soul searching for purpose, meaning and, ultimately, utility in blockchains.  Here I am, another analyst writing about cryptocurrency, shilling right? Every analyst becomes a shill necessarily, at least any good analyst will be honest about it. The honest analyst believes and follows that belief, whatever it is. The truest statement this analyst will make in his cryptocurrency career is this, “utility drives adoption.”  Utility is the single most important element of future relative cryptocurrency value. That bears repeating, utility will be the determinant factor in which coins flunk and which coin shines. The calculation is very simple here, everybody knows the first cryptocurrency to be featured on a major retail chain’s website connected to the shopping cart will, for lack of a better verb, “moon.”  So too will moon, the first cryptocurrency involved directly in the financing of the next Dyson and Tesla. Just saying it very clearly right now, going to happen, people invest in well-researched industrial and commercial opportunities. Cybit has the infrastructure and technology to marry industry, finance, research and this simple store of value. Don’t be terribly surprised when it is Cybit mooning.

Today, the world has been watching the rise of crowdfunding on top of Blockchain technology. The modern business environment considers crowdfunding as a way of connecting investors with modest business start-ups and projects.  However, Crowdfunding is emerging at a very fast pace, but existing platforms still have some limitations, such as:  The approach to develop and launch an ICO is very scattered and there are no certain rules to be followed; Duplication of efforts wastes time and resources; Various fraudulent campaigns have been conducted that resulted in founders disappearing after raising funds—essentially swindling the public; Developers create their own set of instructions, landing pages and publicity campaigns from scratch; There are no synergistic channels between developers and potential investors.  CyBit is developing an open source ecosystem that will allow consumption and creation of financial services and products to facilitate the crowdfunding mechanism on a global scale. The ecosystem is built on top of the Ethereum platform with smart contracts and will assist start-ups in getting investments and help Investors evaluate submitted business proposals. Our goal is to offer a platform for potential investors to fund projects through “CBT” as the underlying utility token. This initiative enables start-ups and investors to collaborate in a global marketplace that is built to provide a credible Blockchain-based token, which in turn facilitates the payment system through forex transactions and crowdfunding sources. In creating the ecosystem, we selected a development strategy with a strong view toward the various limitations of existing solutions. The solution (CyBit) will empower ICO developers to visit the platform, submit their funding requirements, and use CyBit channels for evaluation by potential investors. Upon successful evaluation, the investors will invest in their projects using CyBit Tokens.      ABOUT CYBIT  CyBit is an Open Source Ecosystem to facilitate Crowdfunding! Our platform is built on ERC-223 protocol with smart contracts for highly secure validation of transactions and protection from malicious attacks. It adopts methodologies that support infrastructure flexibility and ensures safety & stability of the system. CyBit supports three kinds of fundraising campaigns; Initial Coin Offering, Crowd Investing, and Crowd Funding. CyBit offers a unique vehicle for Investors to finance projects through CBT as an underlying value token! We’re providing a comprehensive smart-contract capability for seamless execution of projects with full transparency and liquidity.    WHY CYBIT  CyBit Tokens —or CBT — have many advantages over mainstream currencies. CBT tokens utilize the secure ERC-223 platform to provide Trackable Tokens through Smart Contracts. This supports infrastructure flexibility to ensure safety and stability of the system.    On the CyBit platform for investors, one additional CBT is always received. When investors support pre-ICO, ICO, or Crowdinvesting campaigns, they receive two currencies at once, offering a double benefit. When they support Crowdfunding campaigns, they receive CyBitCoins, insuring them against the failure of the project.  Blockchain Infrastructure Integrates blockchain technology to provide unique identities for each node. Easy Token Integration Every node has its own token. You can earn tokens by doing work.
