SLT is listed on SDEX,"Smartlands Attends Investor Property Show 2019: The Cry For Digital Transformation  It was great showcasing STO at InvestorShow, lots of useful takeaways, plenty to think about, major interest from property managers, financial institutions, and the community.  The property industry is undergoing a major transformation in the UK. Even though you cannot yet complete a transaction without a stack of papers, wet signatures, and multiple personal meetings with estate agents, at the Investor Property Show 2019 we clearly saw the traditionally conservative industry inching towards the light.  The majority of reasons for investing in property in the UK largely remain the same as they always were: since people are being forced out of the housing market, about 20% of the population is going to be renting by 2035, which means that bricks and mortar will remain a robust asset class. Investing in property is relatively simple; it’s easier to understand than stocks and obtaining finance is reasonably straightforward. Besides, a diligent investor could take advantage of the cheaper pound and the fact that pre-Brexit jitters brought the prices for commercial property in the UK way down.

This type of product offers several advantages to investors: digital stocks can be traded even when equity markets are closed, investors will be able to own fractional shares, and lastly, the offering will give foreign investors an easy on-ramp to buy/sell US stocks, which currently requires several intermediary regulatory steps that often precludes foreign retail investors from accessing US markets.""

SLT is listed on SDEX,"Smartlands In The Process of Obtaining MTF License, Gets One Step Closer To Own Security Token Exchange  As you know, the first Security Token Offering on the Smartlands Platform is underway, and we couldn’t be happier that it has attracted so much attention from investors, asset owners and the Smartlands community. But, once the security tokens are issued and purchased, the most beneficial part of the process is to make them available for trading on the secondary market. After all, it is liquidity that makes security tokens such an attractive proposition; the fact that your fractional ownership of any asset is now irrefutably represented by a piece of code on the Stellar blockchain makes digital ownership of that asset highly agile, easily transferable and tradable for profit. And, since making money is the primary reason we’ve all become investors, the importance of understanding the mechanism of creating a difference between the amount spent and the amount gained is impossible to overstate.  On the way to create this mechanism for you, our investor, we’ve made quite a few significant strides. Today, Smartlands Platform is a fully regulated platform for issuing security tokens on the Stellar blockchain. This crucial milestone was reached, among other things, through the agreed purchase of a stake in Shojin Financial Services (SFS), which is regulated and authorised by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and possesses the crowdfunding licence necessary for the Smartlands Platform to issue security tokens.  Armed with our unbending spirit and the crowdfunding license from the FCA, we are ready to proceed to the next step in shaping up the landscape on the Smartlands Platform. Together with the consortium of partners vested in the development of securities trading on blockchain we are entering the active stage of obtaining the Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF) license.  The MTF license will allow us to create a multilateral trading system for bringing together multiple third-party buying and selling interests in securities as it occurs on all the major regulated stock exchanges around the world.

We’ve managed to keep all of our promises: you believed Smartlands will launch a security token issuance platform and stuck with us, and we’ve launched a Security Token Offering in full accordance with our roadmap.  The Offering and the beginning of the private sale – in which  investors reserve larger investment tranches – were announced on March 19 at the Money20/20 Asia event in Singapore and immediately became a triumph. Let’s double down on our efforts and make the upcoming public sale (which is planned for early May, we’ll keep you posted) an even greater success.  We want to take this opportunity to thank everyone for their input once again. When we were polling the community as to which path we should take for a better, more fluid and comprehensive  engagement in trusted transactions on the Smartlands Platform, you showed us the right way. We are happy that we’ve chosen purpose-built student accommodation as our first tokenisation project. It was a brilliant decision that we have all partaken in!  We shall continue on the same course. Our immediate plans include the work on obtaining an MTF license, which will be the final step towards achieving liquidity for security tokens issued by the Smartlands Platform on the Stellar Network. On April 12-13, we are going to be presenting our tokenisation project at the Property Investor Show at London’s ExCel Exhibition Hall. And of course, we are laser-focused on the iminent  Offering for the tokenisation of the PBSA building in Nottingham, England.

SLT is listed on SDEX,"January was a very fruitful month for the Smartlands team. Here is the brief overview of our most important updates  Launch of the beta version of Smartlands Platform  February 2, 2017 Smartlands has achieved a milestone in its mission of bringing the benefits of blockchain and cryptocurrency to agriculture and real economy sector. We have released a beta version of Platform, which consists of Smartlands Wallet and an updated product site. Smartlands looks forward to the successful completion of the test phase and release of its platform in public network. More information about the release you can find here: https://smartlands.io/wp/2018/02/02/smartlands1-launches-platform-based-on-stellar-network/  Exchanges  Successful bidding on SDEX  Trading of SLT on SDEX in January moved to absolutely new level in both volume of trading and price. Daily trading volume of SLT has surpassed 500 000 USD, while the price soared above 5 USD/SLT. SLT was the biggest gainer on Coinmarketcap for 3 consecutive days (24 hours) and biggest weekly gainer with price growth of 1500%. SDEX has proved to be a robust and reliable exchange with steadily increasing number of traders. Thus we expect further increase in trading volume.  New exchanges  At the moment, Smartlands is negotiating with several popular exchanges. For technical reasons, the process of listing of the Stellar-based tokens takes more time than we expected. But we are proud to bear the status of a pioneer and in the near future we will please our community and all interested investors with new listings.  Partnerships  January 30, Smartlands announced a partnership with Intecracy. This alliance is aimed to a further development of the Smartlands roadmap for 2018. You can find additional information about the partnership and its purposes here: https://smartlands.io/wp/2018/01/30/we-are-proud-to-announce-our-new-partner-intecracy-group/  Team  Smartlands is developing fast and therefore we expanding our team. For additional information about our team members and open job vacancies, follow the link: https://smartlands.io/company.html  New ICOs  We are preparing for the first ICO on Smartlands Platform. Currently, there is a selection among the applicants, which consists of the verification and auditing process. Soon we will announce the name of the company, which will be among the early adopters of the transformation with Smartlands Platform.  Short-term plans for the Platform development  Release of the public version  Security of Smartlands Platform is our top priority. Until the end of January, Smartlands, along with Intecracy, will conduct an examination of the beta version of Platform. After the verification, we plan to release our Platform on the public network.  Release of the desktop version of Wallet  Following the release of the public version of the platform, we are going to release the desktop version of Smartlands Wallet, which will allow our users to utilize all Wallet functions safely on their desktops.

SLT is listed on SDEX,"The main mission of Smartlands Platform is the creation of new class of low-risk tokens based on real high-profitable assets. This new class of tokens – called Asset Based Tokens (ABTs) – to be issued on Smartlands Platform and will favor significant demand from investors, while tokenized business is motivated to cooperate with Platform to issue tokens (you can find additional information about ABTs in our Whitepaper).  The major idea of Smartlands Platform is the tokenization of agricultural assets. In the process of tokenization of the agricultural assets, we also deal with the tokenization of the the real economy assets that are closely related to agriculture (e.g. walnut processing line, pig farms, grain elevators). It means that our platform must be suitable for both farms/orchards and other production assets. Taking a closer look at the issue we decided to expand Platforms coverage to real economy assets, especially related to agriculture, given there is no other tokenization protocol similar to ours.  There are at least 3 major problems for all types of businesses, that Smartlands Platform can solve:  - Chaotic, confusing and unclear token issues; - Extreme volatility of tokens and no safe haven assets in crypto universe; - No secure protocol to tokenize assets.  Smartlands Platform will solve the aforementioned problems by:  - Maximal transparency and accountability; - Risk protection provided by collateral of the assets; - Standardization of token issues and regulation to protect investor interests with rules set by voting (powered by distributed ledger of Stellar network).  Thus, there is a lot of value we can provide for real economy businesses in tokenization of their assets. The only missing link for providing “all-in-one services” by Smartlands is industry specific audits of assets. To fill the gap we will partner with specialized companies that performs such audits in line with our standards: maximal transparency, distributed database of results and use of cutting-edge technologies. By no means we abandon agriculture though. We expand our services into tokenization of real economy assets as we don’t want to deprive SLT holders from great opportunities. Still tokenization of agricultural assets is our major focus and core idea.",False

SLT is listed on SDEX,"  I am pretty sure you are very wrong about cutting out the middleman. It is not easy to create a legal framework to secure the interest of investors in an ICO and even harder for potential investors to assess it and to check for possible risks. That’s where the Platform kicks in and make the process way easier and more reliable for both parties with standardized and proved solution. It seems like you missed the core idea of the project.  From Introduction of Whitepaper: Existing major problems that will be addressed by the Platform 1)   Chaotic, confusing and unclear token issues 2)   Extreme volatility of tokens and no safe haven assets in crypto universe 3)   No comprehensible way to invest into projects in agriculture worldwide 4)   No secure protocol to tokenize assets that leave 9,8 trillion USD market potential untapped 5)   Soaring food demand caused by population growth (to reach 10 bln by 2050) that is unlikely to be met with current productivity increase pace Core ideas of the Platform that will help to solve the aforementioned problems. –   Maximal transparency and accountability: o   Tokenization of agricultural assets with independent high quality legal and business analysis of an agricultural company and its assets o   Smartlands team expertise in agriculture and Platform’s agtech ecosystem will result in state-of-the-art technologies to monitor agricultural assets. –   Risk protection provided by collateral of the assets –   Standardization of token issues and regulation to protect investor’s interests with rules set by voting and implemented with blockchain technology Unlike other tokenization protocols, we don’t take liquidity for granted, understanding that ability to trade tokens does not automatically mean it will be easy to sell, once investor decides to quit the investment. Inability to sell quickly and efficiently, totally undermines the idea of achieving liquidity through tokenization. We see standardization of legal framework, rules and extensive monitoring as key tools to achieve liquidity (as well as transparency and accountability) of ABTs issued on the Platform. Moreover, they will be immediately tradable on the Stellar Distributed Exchange (SDEX)",False

SLT is listed on SDEX,"  You can find it in the Whitepaper Here is the relevant part. At the initial stages, Smartlands intend to create an ecosystem of agtech companies - partners of the Platform, which in the future can be developed into agtech accelerator. Such a partnership will allow the Platform to be always at the center of innovations in this field and to achieve integration with the information systems of ABT issuers as complete, reliable and effective as possible. For agtech companies, cooperation with the Platform is an additional way to find clients and possibly investors, as investors in agricultural assets are also often interested in investing in agtech companies. For ABT investors, the cooperation of the token issuing company with the agtech company from the Platform's ecosystem is an additional confidence in the correct use of the investments attracted by the agricultural companies. First, the risk of overstating the cost of implemented systems is significantly minimized. Such cost overstating is commonly used for improper withdrawal of investors' funds from the account of the company that attracted investments. Secondly, the risk of non-fulfillment of obligations by agtech company is reduced. Non-fulfillment of obligations may entail a lack of improvement in the efficiency of the token issuing company, accordingly reducing the income and profit of the asset, parts of which are allocated to investors. For agricultural companies, cooperation with the agtech company from the Platform's ecosystem is the confidence in achieving contractual obligations by the contractor and larger amount of investments that can be raised, due to greater investors’ confidence in the effective use of the ICO proceeds. Thus, each of the parties of the ecosystem involved has an interest and benefit from cooperation, that makes us optimistic about the success of the establishment and development of such an ecosystem based on the Platform.",False

SLT is listed on SDEX,"   The legal framework will be developed in partnership with top legal advisors as both tokens and smart contracts are new to legislation and we would not risk investors  funds with legal framework that is not 100% correct.   2) What particular escrow company do you intend to use?  Escrow company will be incorporated by the Platform. The incorporation document (e.g. charter) will protect the interest of investors by not letting either the Platform or agricultural companies make any actions with the assets without prior consent of ABT holders.   3) When investor buys an asset-based token, does he sign any kind of (smart?) contract with escrow or your platform? If yes, please provide example of such contract. If no - how does your platform guarantee money return to investors if company they invested in appears to be a scam?  The Platform will set high standards for audit and examination of a company prior to an ABT issue, therefore “scam” companies will not even have a chance to issue tokens (at least within the Platform). Should the company default on its obligations, the collateralized assets will be transferred to ownership of the escrow company and sold consequently. The proceeds will be provided to the token holders.  In the nex post, I'll cover the rest questions...",False

SLT is listed on SDEX,"   With wide acceptance of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies it is a good idea to implement smart contract for automatic distribution of part of revenue (and profit), but currently we believe legal mechanism that will be in place with collateral agreement, public offer and so on is more reliable and practical way to handle the issue. It is not easy to make such legal framework and even harder for potential investors to access it and to check for possible risk. And that s where Platform kicks in and make the process way easier and more reliable for both parties with standardized and proved solution.   5) How the investors can monitor on what their money was spent by fund-raising companies?  First of all, the Platform will provide additional transparency of operations with IT solutions that will collect the data from agricultural companies so it will be easier to monitor the progress in every way including money spent by the companies raised during an ICO. The information will be provided in reports that will be in line with regulations for other public companies and additionally set in legal framework. In case of non-compliance with the rules fines, legal prosecution of executives, or loss of ownership for collateralized assets may apply to the company depending on the magnitude of the violations.   6) Is there any real usage of blockchain in the project at the moment, except for raising funds though ICO?  Creation of new class of low-risk tokens and building the infrastructure for cryptoinvestors seems to be a good reason enough to qualify for “real usage of blockchain”  The rules of the Platform will be set by the SLT tokenholders through democratic organization principles implemented with blockchain technology (providing confidence for all the participants that results of voting cannot be corrupted). The same relates to the ability of the ABT holders to make decisions with voting that differs them from ABS.   Looks like the project requires a lot of coding and drafting of smart contracts. Please provide GitHub link where we can read some code. This part of project will be published on further stages of ICO",False

The return on ABTs is based on revenue and profit of the company, not the value of assets itself, though the correlation may strong. And the loss of collateral does not make the company free from obligations to tokenholders, but it does increase the risk for investors since collateral is a very good reason for the company to behave. Of course, adverse events for the company will influence token holders through a decrease in revenues and profit. Nevertheless, it will be a requirement to insure the collateralized assets, and only some exemption for minor part of assets may be granted given specific reasons (e.g. unavailable insurance for some type of assets or inappropriate price) that will be disclosed to investors prior to ICO.

I don't really understand what legal rights it would give to token owners.

If no - how does your platform guarantee money return to investors if company they invested in appears to be a scam? 4) On the example of your walnut orchard project, how exactly would investors receive their share of profit from the walnut sale? To make this work properly, all sales of walnut should be written on blockchain too. Do you have smart contract that will split the profit among all token holders? 5) How the investors can monitor on what their money was spent by fund-raising companies? 6) Is there any real usage of blockchain in the project at the moment, except for raising funds though ICO?

There are a lot of progressive farmers that apply hi-tech IT solutions for farming like driverless tractors and complicated control systems. So we are sure that there are farmers right now that can comprehend the offer of the Platform, especially given that we will guide farmers through every step. Moreover, we believe that just in few years blockchain technology will be widely applied in many spheres of our life and farmers will be aware of the technology. It would not be something totally new to them, while we will educate them further. So the amount of farmers that will be interested in such an option will grow exponentially.

The Platform will provide answers to task 1 to 4 with ready standardized solution. On the other hand the Platform will attract investors with standardized legal framework protecting their interests significantly reducing costs of problems 5 and 6.

Investors buy tokens of the agriculture company providing investments for development of the company. Platform lists the issued tokens on the partner cryptocurrency exchanges to enhance token liquidity. 04 ABT investors buy the required amount of SLTs from holders at current price. 05 Agriculture companies share the revenue and profit with ABT holders.

SLT is listed on SDEX," Thank you for the great questions.  What is the relationship between this project and Deloitte? Deloitte has performed legal due diligence of the pilot project of the Platform. The idea is to demonstrate the best practices of asset tokenization that involve a thorough analysis of the assets and confirmation of their existence and value. In general audits, due diligences and other procedures will be performed by different reputable firms like Deloitte. Obviously, Deloitte did not perform an audit of the Platform as the Platform does not represent tokenization of assets itself, though it will provide a protocol for agricultural companies to tokenize their assets.  Can you analyze the problem of pain in the agricultural sector? And can solve the solution with the block chain? Small and medium sized farmers suffer low profitability due to use of old technologies and they have very limited capabilities to attract financing for the introduction of agtech solutions. Smartlands provide an opportunity for cryptoinvestors to invest in lucrative projects in agriculture worldwide in a way that protects their investments. On the other hand, it will provide a chance for farmers to raise financing for the introduction of innovations.",False
