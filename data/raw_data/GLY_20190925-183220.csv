Glyff, like Ethereum, allows development of decentralized applications, but with a key difference : the ability of concealing data from the computing nodes. This enables developers to include sensitive data in their smart-contracts, directly on-chain, without compromise on security      Overview  12345678910111211234567891234567891011121123456789 12345678910111211234567891234567891011121123456789           The goal of Glyff is to create an easily accessible, privacy-preserving decentralized platform on which all businesses can benefit from smart contracts. It will provide the security and privacy required to ensure an efficient platform which is trust-less, scalable and fully accessible to those without extensive knowledge of cryptography such that it can be truly ubiquitous and with no barriers.   12345678910111211234567891234567891011121123456789 12345678910111211234567891234567891011121123456789     Glyff achieves privacy by leveraging a cryptographic technique known as “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge”, shortly zk-SNARK, which allows the verification of a smart contract without revealing the data that held within it. That way, computation can be carried out verifiably while all the information can be immutably recorded onto the blockchain without being exposed to third parties. A “zero knowledge proof of correctness” is published and verified by the consensus nodes in order to guarantee integrity of operations. Private data is shareable within and between the relevant organizations, but it remains unavailable to all others, guaranteeing privacy.
