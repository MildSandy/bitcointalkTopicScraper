DAF update  1. The first DAF is on its way and may be followed by a second one straight after. Timing is for this summer. Both should be launched on BTC.USD pair at this stage as institutional investors need to be educated on cryptos, and we have to take them step by step. Both will be regulated funds.  2. Regarding the following DAFs, we will first see how we collect on the first 2 ones to fine tune the calendar. We are targeting European investors to start and will expand our distribution capabilities once we are successful there.  3. Trading bots that we have launched recently will be managed independently and will still be available once DAFs are launched. They are addressing the retail market.  4. Fees will be paid on a monthly basis to NPX token holders that will sublicense their token with us. On management fees, they will be paid as soon as we receive them. For performance fees, they should be collected on an annual basis as per the recommendation of the regulators and would then be paid over the following 12 months to avoid a negative impact on our NPX price.     eToro  As already explained, this strategy has been launched on this platform so that our project gets some traction on this active community of traders.  We have already gathered more than 800k USD in AUM in a short period of time, so our strategy is working.  If you want to open an account on eToro follow this link      Strategies  We understand that some people are looking at the recent performance of our strategies and comparing them to the best assets in class (BTC or ETH).   First, our lead strategy (ETH / BTC / USD) recently made a new all-time high. Second, we had a fantastic run in 2018. Third, we are constantly learning from the past and will propose in the next few weeks a slight evolution to reduce false signals in low price range periods.     Napoleon Software bots    1. We have just made a change on the usage of NPX token in this offering to simplify the constraints and welcome people that do not hold any NPX but might be interested in our project. Now holding NPX will allow to have a reduction in the price paid for this service. Also, as always, the more NPX you hold, the more discount you will have.      2. The bots have been designed to work on margin trading accounts and accommodate additional strategies or discretionary trading to be done on the same account. Therefore, you have the choice in the funding of the account you want to use. The performance we show, however on our strategy is based on a USD funding.  3. Regarding amount traded, no orders would be sent by the bot above a 25k USD level. Adjustment trades can be done in the case of fees being paid or the balance of your account changes because you run external strategies.     Leverage   For Kraken, you need to declare your leverage beforehand in the API to do a trade. As we authorize people to use their accounts for personal trading, we needed to make sure that our strategy could run in parallel.  For those that only plan to use our bot on their account, we will offer the possibility to adjust this leverage directly on their computer. However, because we need to short, it should not be set at a level below 2.0x.     ",False

We are a French entity that will be fully regulated and licensed. We have been founded by former multi-billion asset managers at Tier 1 banks, who have designed and run high-performance trading bots for the past 10 years. We think that two phenomenons are currently shaping a new paradigm that will completely redefine the investment industry, to the benefit of the community, while giving anyone access to the best investment strategies. On the one hand, we witness the emergence of new governance schemes enabled by smart contracts (and the corresponding DAOs, DACs, etc) and on the other hand, we observe the omnipresence of the investing quant strategies and bots in the best hedge funds and banks. Combining these two expanding developments allows people to get their complete freedom back on their investments, far from current investment mechanisms controlled by an ever ageing banking system.

Train your stuff to be tougher in dealing with problems or fire them, its crypto, its not a sundays lunch. unblock all accounts, which are not spamming with advertising, on telegram and leave people being there like they are (dont take telegram to serious, but establish rules for basic communication). make a discort channel for pro talk with moderation and AMA events    there will be alot more difficulties in running a cryptocoin company with a community. pick them up, where they are, make them like you.

Although the use if algorithmic trading software has been in practice by hedge funds dealing in equities, commodities and currencies, the market for trading bots has extended into crypto asset market. As a sort of automated trader, a bot buys and sells in an automated manner typically in the short-term market. Since trading bots tend to be preprogrammed, there is a general idea that they are more efficient than humans since they are not prone to executing trades based on emotional decisions.  Bot trading can be described as a technique that uses pre-programmed software to analyze market actions including price, orders, volume and time. They are now a common feature of many stock exchanges and are for the most part legal in many countries across the globe. In the cryptocurrency market the use of bots is common although it is a relatively new practice if compared to equities markets for instance. Some Bitcoin trading bots have been successful at establishing more efficient trading and are certainly used on many cryptocurrency exchanges.  https://medium.com/@napoleonx.ai/bots-as-a-utility-the-bidding-revolution-in-trading-3845978cb16f",False

Being able to overtake it in less than 24 hours is a colossal positive signal for us, and we want to thank all the community again for your trust.  The ICO has indeed left the launch pad at a phenomenal speed, our goal is now to build on that momentum to reach our final goal: 15 million EUR.     Bonuses are not over, Go for the 10%!  At the moment of writing this newsletter, NaPoleonX ICO has raised a total of 5,804,012 EUR, leaving our first milestone far behind us.  Although all, 20% bonus slice has been taken before the first 24 hours, current contributors can still benefit from a 10% bonus until we reach the next milestone (10 million EUR).  After that mark, there will be no more bonus for your contribution.     NPX now displayed on your dashboard  For some of you it took some time to appear, especially for the very first contributors, but NPX are now normally displayed on your dashboard. Thank you again for your patience and your understanding.     Token distribution  As we get a lot of questions on this point, I would like to make a useful reminder: Tokens will be distributed maximum 8 business days after the close of ICO. Your contribution is visible on the dashboard of napoleonx.ai. Bonus (included referrals) will be shown in dashboard at the time of tokens' distribution.     Spread the word and get 5% referral bonus  Give your unique sponsorship code to up to 5 referrals and get 5% of their contribution, they also benefit from a 5% bonus. Your code is located on the top of your dashboard and appears only once your contribution made.     Useful reminders  Only send your ETH from the address you registered for NaPoleonX ICO. Do not use a different wallet, that would make reconciliation impossible. NEVER SEND YOUR ETH FROM AN EXCHANGE, we would not be able to identify your payment and refund you in case we need to do so.  We recommend 100,000 Gas and 50 Gwei in order to avoid any risk of failed transactions. 50,000 Gas and 25 Gwei being the minimum viable.  Any question? The NPX team is available to answer your questions on the NaPoleonX Telegram group or at contact@napoleonx.ai. You can also check out the whitepaper, and the FAQ for answers.

We will communicate shortly on payment processes that should start early next week. We will make the last update of our Whitepaper prior to that to fix all the parameters.  After numerous discussions on our various caps (min, hidden, max) with our community, it appeared that it was too complex for the coming mass marketing that will start on 4th December. Therefore we have decided the following simplifications :  1. For transparency reasons, we are revealing our hidden cap which is 60k ETH and setting our max cap at this level, removing the hidden cap mechanism 2. We are also removing the min cap of 25k ETH which was not really readable vs the 40k ETH target cap.  The 40k target cap does not seem to be the same as min cap though.",False

Why are NaPoleonX raising more than a million?  First, our target cap is 40k ETH which is not 50millions. We had also taken into account for the volatility of the ETH vs USD that is not negligible. At some point during the project pre launch, we had ETH at less than 200 USD.  Second, to get an asset management licence, you need to demonstrate 3 years of budget to the regulator, not just one.  Third, to have the right set up for an asset management company we will need to hire at least 3 additional people and the overall HR cost will be closer to EUR 1.5 million on an annual basis including social tax  Fourth, other cost will include acquisition of financial data, rental cost and legal cost to set up the asset management company and the future DAF  Fifth, we will need an important marketing budget to launch the first DAFs once we have been cleared by the regulator.",False

What is clear is that we would be reluctant to launch a DAF that is too small in size because of some fixed cost. Below 5000 k ETH it might not make a lot of sense. So in theory we would launch a DAF even if we do not reach the 20k ETH mark to do so. If for example, we raise 30k ETH above the 40k ETH target, it is very likely that we would launch 2 DAFs with 15k ETH each. With regards to DAFs that are launch with external money, we would not want to go below this 20kETH because you might have additonal costs as they will pull money from investors and for security and transparency reasons, we might have to implement a specific structuring to make everyone happy and safe.

The whitepaper has 2 sections about redemption.  Redemption Threshold  Even if DAFs are autonomous, they are governed by their subscribers. A redemption option is to be offered to let them the opportunity to close a DAF if a sufficient number of subscribers want to. Such option gives an ultimate liquidity to any subscriber whatever the second market may be. The Redemption Threshold is set at 75%.  Redemption of the DAF  DAF token holders may decide to terminate the DAF and redeem it. To occur, the number of voting rights deciding such redemption shall be above 75%.  If redemption is decided, then all non crypto-assets in which the DAF is invested shall be liquidated within 5 days. After such liquidation, the corresponding smart contract shall terminate: DAF tokens are redeemed and all crypto-assets are transferred to the DAF token holders in proportion of their share in the DAF.  It seems as though you can not cash out until a majority vote has been reached. is it correct that your deposit is stuck in the DAF until redemption?",False

We are a marketplace for the work of AI, chatbots, IoT and other digital services, so quite different. We are conversational based, So a person user would start a conversation with any bot, and that bot would call upon all of the services in the network. The ranking and routing options that developers choose at either side of the interaction match and then a transaction is made. The user gets continuous conversation. In short it allows developers of AI + to Monetise the work of their product via micro-transactions. They no longer need to seek a total product buyout, product or work search,  or manually negotiate and process sales. Easy! WE have proof of concept working. Check it out in our ANN or at Hut34.io.

When Bitcoin falls, all other coins fall as well, do to panic shorting. If Bitcoin fails, and no other contendor aims to take it's place as equal, or superior, then all other cryptos will fall with it.   The governing bodies around the world each have their own stance on Bitocoin and other crypto currencies,  but they mainly wait and see what the U.S declares first, then follow suit. The U.S sees all crypto coins as novelty assets. That's why the ban hammer isn't being waved around much, but only light advice, and small regulations are given. This is the equivalent of what the wild west was like, back in the 1800's. Before we see a mass adoption occur, a stable set of laws, and regulations will have to he put into place first.

I will need to read the whitepaper to grasp more of this idea, I'll be checking this for sure.  Hello Voltaje,  You are raising a good point. The crypto-market, despite its exponential growth, is not large enough in our opinion. That’s why we will create DAFs designed to invest on real assets, where you don’t have any issue of volume (as per example: S&P 500, Eurostox 50, etc) You can also read our blackpaper which explains quite well the 10 first strategies (without leverage) that we will propose: http://www.napoleonx.ai/wp32Y878754/NapoleonXBlackpaper.pdf.",False

Statements about NPX, DAF tokens and botons are fragmented over several sections in the whitepaper.  This is an example from the whitepaper:  To use the trading bots provided by the Strategy Provider, a DAF has to pay some botons. (page 16)   How does a DAF pay botons?  Botons shall be paid by each DAF on a monthly basis, by the issuance of new DAF tokens, matching the value of the botons consumed on the previous month. (page 6)  That is such a tricky sentence. It does my head in. Because I thought paying botons and consuming botons are the same thing, but here they are separate events.   Each month 25% of the profit is consumed or 'paid out' in DAF tokens, 85% to the voters and 15% to the developer. That is the prerequisite to trade again the next month.  Here is a concrete example:  Botons’ consumption is set at 25% of Performance.  As an example, if, at the beginning of a month, a DAF has a Net Asset Value of 100’000 ETH, and if there are 100’000 DAF tokens, then the NAV of the DAF token amounts to 1 ETH. If the Performance is 10% at the end of such month, then the gross performance (execution costs excluded) is of 10’000 ETH, of which 2’500 ETH represents the botons’ consumption (25% of 10’000 ETH). As a consequence, at the end of the month, the Net Asset Value of a DAF token equals 1 x (1 + 10% x (1-25%)) = 1.075 ETH. Then, 2’325.5814 DAF tokens (2’500/1.075) shall be issued among which 1’976.74419 (85% x 2’325.5814) shall be allocated to the NPX token holders having participated to the voting sessions involving the eligibility of the trading bots used by the DAF. (page 17)   Also, no botons are consumed when suffering loss:  If a given strategy or blend of strategies experienced a negative monthly return followed by a positive monthly return, no botons may be collected before the highest past net performance is reached.  Let me work that out:  Start of January. DAF ICO = DAF NAV = 100’000 ETH. End of January, Performance 10%. Botons consumed = 2’500 ETH. DAF NAV = 107’500 ETH.  Start of February. Botons paid by DAF = Botons consumed in January = 2’500 ETH. DAF NAV = 107’500 ETH. End of February, Performance -2%. Botons consumed = 0 ETH. DAF NAV = 105’350 ETH.  Start of March. Botons paid by DAF = Botons consumed in February = 0 ETH. DAF NAV = 105’350 ETH.  Something like that is also illustrated in a table on page 18.  Took me a while to grasp this and I am still not sure. Am I thinking in the right direction?",False

Quote from: magisterr on Today at 04:22:14 PM just find this ICO. Trying to learning, but cant understand all. What main conception here? track exchange rates?  Huh  NaPoleonX is a project that aims to create a complex platform for algorithmic trading, meaning that they will provide Bots and strategies; the concept revolves around DAFs (Decentralized Autonomous Funds), which is a set of complex bots and strategies for trading a specific asset, being a classic asset or a crypto asset, there will be a lot of DAF for different pairs and markets, including ETH and BTC, but not limited to cryptocurrencies, the good part is that these DAFs will need Botons (fees or gas if you prefer) to function, so 85% of the botons goes to token holders that voted in the selection of DAFs, and it will be paid in DAF tokens, while the token of NaPoleonX is NPX, so NPX can work as a security, but  intrinsically it is not, you will need to participate in a voting session if you want part of the profits obtained by the performance generated from de DAFs; so in short, this project will give you bots for trading in exchanges, there are very complex and a lot of them in only one DAF, so you won't be getting one simple bot, but many in a set",False

So you will not have access to the ultimate code. However, as we want to give some elements to investors so that they make a decision, we feel some level of information should be shared. For each individual strategy, there will be a dedicated ""trading sheet"" that could go a little bit beyond what has been shared in the Blackpaper  2. The initial strategies that have been developed have been developed without leverage. A good trading system could have the following independent components: gross trading signal, filtering system and money management system. - Leverage to us is a component that is associated with risk appetite. And that is why we want investor to pick their adequate risk level themselves and get some feedback on potential risk they will be baring. Leverage is an entire component of a strategy and that is why we have put some description of the Kelly optimal leverage in our Blackpaper. - Gross trading signal is globally where you have the heart of the money generation machine, the 2 other components being there to reduce trading frequency (filters) and smooth drawdowns (money management). It is impossible for any system to guarantee that what has worked in the past will continue to do so. However, if you have the choice between a system that has proven its robustness in almost all possible market configuration, would you be ready to trust it more than another one that have not passed this test ?  3. As explained above, the risk level will be for investors to decide and to do that all existing information will be provided to them. I agree that 40-50% drawdown are quite high but so is the return. Moreover, over the last 20+ years over which we have back tested our strategies, you cannot say that we have not seen a large number of adverse market situations. To reduce this risk, we will count on diversification as what has been exposed in our Blackpaper is based on a unique strategy (even though there are 2 sub strategies encapsulated in them). In reality, we would use Blend of strategies that we already have for some markets like the S&P500, Eurostoxx 50, FTSE ...",False

This is a unique and promising project. But there are a few questions that come to mind with the business model.  1) What level of transparency do investors have around the logic that is used in the bots? The black paper is very terse beyond mean reversion, etc.  2) The White paper mentions that investors may pick the bots and the leverage level.  >>DAFs enable their subscribers to intervene in the building of the best mix (Blend) of strategies, by regularly letting their subscribers vote on which strategies they want the DAF to >>follow. As a restriction to maintain a Blend with a reasonable number of strategies, a Strategy Threshold is set so that any strategy collecting (in percentage) less than such >>threshold may not be selected. The Strategy Threshold will be 20%.The selected strategies shall contribute to the Blend with a weight proportional to the voting rights collected >>during the last voting session.  Truth be told picking traders or fund managers is a very difficult business, many people pick bad managers (e.g. chase momentum, etc) hence you observe very poor track records in the fund of hedge funds community. What mechanism exists so that NapoleonX avoids this problem of investors consistently picking poorly returning bots that do worse than random selection or adjust the leverage higher on bots that are about to experience mean reversion from high profits to large negative losses? Maybe the investors pick good bots, but adjust leverage poorly which negates the good bot selection.  3) In the Black paper the S&P500, FTSE100 and Eurostoxx 50 strategies have drawdowns in excess of 40% which seems too high for a backtest. In real life these could well be higher. Don't the trading bots have risk controls to minimize the degree of the maximum drawdown? Is there a risk control overlay on top of the bot as an aggregated group?",False

It might even be intentionally underpriced, ensuring there is liquidity.  Once an IPO price is arrived at by the investment bankers or IPO deal leaders, it is marketed prior to its first day of trading at its IPO price. It is believed that IPOs are often underpriced because of concerns relating to liquidity and uncertainty about the level at which the stock will trade.  To investors, an IPO may also be perceived as risky because it does not have historical trading data. The less liquid and less predictable the shares are, the more underpriced they will have to be in order to compensate investors for the risk they are taking. Because an IPO's issuer tends to know more about the value of the shares than the investor, a company must underprice its stock to encourage investors to participate in the IPO.  http://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underpricing.asp",False

For algo strategies you can include or not transaction fees knowing that in the traditional asset universe, they are very very low (a few bps) whereas for cryptos they are relatively quite high but will reduce overtime. Once they are down to a few bps, it would be odd to change the fee levels in the strategy index we are going to launch. That is why we always, on our side, run backtest with 0 fees, but are completely conscious that execution will lead to tracking error. What is important is to monitor and manage this inherent tracking error. Using very low frequency, intervening at close is a way to tackle this. As an example, our algo on BTC vs USD trades around a dozen time per year with an over performance on simple buy and hold strategy of 100% annually. So multiply 12 x 1.0% and you would still get 88% approximately. In reality, it will be certainly much lower in terms of tracking error.",False

We have mentioned a 10,000 ETH to acquire an Asset Management licence knowing that it is a regulated activity. The implication is a heavy burden in terms of legal, compliance, risk, fund admin, market access, fund auditing ... There is a heavy cost in terms of setting up the structure knowing that the regulator requires that you have at least 3 years of cash flow ahead of you in order to make sure that any investor investing with this entity would not be at risk of having a bankrupt company as a fund provider. There is certainly a little bit of headroom here but not much in our opinion knowing that we are asking for funds in ETH and not in USD for our ICO. So if ETH skyrocket to 400 USD then we have more headroom and if it plummets down to 100-150 USD we will be very tight. With latest development in ETH price, we know that it is a possibility. 2. The crypto-fiat algo are really trying to benefit from the best of 2 worlds: market liquidity and algo robustness in the fiat world and tokenisation advantages of the crypto world. With the development of futures for ETH and BTC and the major cryptos, it will be more and more seamless to cross these initial borders.

Our bots philosophy is based on low-medium frequency on higly liquid assets only (no illiquidity premium). Our aim is to bring sustainable performance/alpha to tilt the crypto funding of the DAFs(either ETH or BTC). And we will search this alpha mainly into the fiat world (largest equity, credit or fx futures) for liquidity thus scalability reasons. Again, the idea is to diversify investors' crypto exposure on top of their crypto, bringing back the performance from the fiat to the crypto world through hedging mechanism. Concretely, the DAFs will be libelled in cryptos (you will subscribe in ETH or BTC), will convert part of those cryptos into fiat money to look for performance from the fiat world thanks to bot, and hedge the fiat conversion and performance into crypto to bring back value from the fiat world.

From a more general point of view, we have decided to be conservative on these subjects, even if we may lose some (or lots of) participants. There are several reasons for these, besides moral and ethics. The first one being that we don't want to jeopardize the project by putting at risk the collected amount. Indeed, if we are sued after the ICO, we will have to dedicate time and money to an issue that could have been saved. It would be bad for the project and bad for all the participants at the ICO.

When you have a quantitative strategy, you can make it run 'as if' it ran during the past, by feeding it with the corresponding values. The danger is, for the asset manager or bot designer, to try to changes the parameter of the bots so that it gives the best back-test. Doing so, you usually overfit your model, which may lead your model to better handle market situations similar to what happened in the past, but to be worst on new market configurations, which represents a risk. To handle this issue, we have created the Proof of Performance concept (https://medium.com/proof-of-performance/proof-of-performance-blockchain-applied-to-trading-6e30404a9754).

These need to be trained regularly from experience. When do you decide to train them again is more art than science. 3. traditional algos: they are based on market observations and a representation that you may have on the markets. This is very close to a physicist approach. These algos need also to be monitored on a regular basis as market dynamics may change over time.  You are right that our background is from non crypto trading, but to be frank, crypto trading is pretty recent.

Napoleon Crypto, would be the entity advising the asset management entity and executing / implementing execution bot on behalf of this entity. Thus it would need to have a proper licence to operate 5. the asset management entity would be represented by the NPX token holders. They would be the ones taking strategic decisions, based on Napoleon Crypto advices. 6. The NPX token holders would get the bulk of the performance fees paid by the different funds (DAFs). 7. As these performance fees would be paid in DAFs tokens for operational issues, they would contribute to the creation and growth of a diversified portfolio that could be managed through a platform that will launch alongside our project to host several functionnalities (ex: mgt of tokens, voting sessions, index publishing for algo strategies ...) 8.

And we will apply these best hedge fund techniques in the crypto world, and also in the real assets world, bringing back the performance into the crypto-world.  I let you read a previous answer.  Quote from: KryptoKings on September 13, 2017, 10:14:05 AM Quote from: niklasmato on September 12, 2017, 08:46:09 PM Interesting project. Will read up on the whitepaper and revert back with any extra information or questions that i have. But basically as far as i understand this ICO will create a trading bot for S&P 500 and so on?  Hello niklasmato,  Initially, we have developed quantitative strategies for the biggest indices in the real word (S&P500, Eurostox50, FTSE, etc). And we do low frequency strategies (at most one trade per day at close). There are several reasons for that, notably liquidity and execution risk. When you do arbitrage techniques or high frequency trading, you can’t scale. You are doing good return, but you have huge execution risks (meaning you can easily lose money because of a tech pb) and you can’t scale that. By doing low frequency trading strategies, we have no tech issue and we can scale. Meaning, you will get the same risk/return, even with more than 1 billion on it!  So why aren’t all people doing low frequency strategies? Because doing low frequency strategies that gives a good return/risk ration is hard, even very hard! And we have developed such very good strategies for a long time now and used it at the personal level. You can find some of them in our Blackpaper. But, we want of course to continue on improving them also.  We want to bring this potential to the crypto-world. With both strategies on real-assets (S&P500, etc), that would be however hedged in ETH or BTC (meaning you will bring back the performance in the real world to increase the nb of ETH or BTC that the DAF holds), but also on crypto-assets. Liquidity and volumes on crypto-assets are still very low from our perspective, but the market is exponential, and by starting now, we will be in a great position when it will become bigger within 2 to 3 years.  At last, the NaPoleonX ICO is to fund the crypto-asset manager that will launch the strategies. These strategies will be embedded into specific crypo-vehicle called DAF, for Decentralized Autonomous Fund. Do not hesitate to ask more questions if needed.",False

And we do low frequency strategies (at most one trade per day at close). There are several reasons for that, notably liquidity and execution risk. When you do arbitrage techniques or high frequency trading, you can’t scale. You are doing good return, but you have huge execution risks (meaning you can easily lose money because of a tech pb) and you can’t scale that. By doing low frequency trading strategies, we have no tech issue and we can scale. Meaning, you will get the same risk/return, even with more than 1 billion on it!  So why aren’t all people doing low frequency strategies? Because doing low frequency strategies that gives a good return/risk ration is hard, even very hard! And we have developed such very good strategies for a long time now and used it at the personal level. You can find some of them in our Blackpaper. But, we want of course to continue on improving them also.  We want to bring this potential to the crypto-world. With both strategies on real-assets (S&P500, etc), that would be however hedged in ETH or BTC (meaning you will bring back the performance in the real world to increase the nb of ETH or BTC that the DAF holds), but also on crypto-assets. Liquidity and volumes on crypto-assets are still very low from our perspective, but the market is exponential, and by starting now, we will be in a great position when it will become bigger within 2 to 3 years.  At last, the NaPoleonX ICO is to fund the crypto-asset manager that will launch the strategies. These strategies will be embedded into specific crypo-vehicle called DAF, for Decentralized Autonomous Fund. Do not hesitate to ask more questions if needed.",False

First, we will ban US citizens or residents from the ICO (together with Chinese also) and second we worked on our whitepaper with our French (Fieldfisher) and Swiss lawyers (LEAX) so that the NPX token is a fully utility token.  For the question raising the autonomous issue. On the real assets, the quantitative strategies are fully autonomous and handle the market drawdowns etc. We don’t want to involve the human here, because our philosophy is precisely the opposite: human emotions create negative impacts on your trading strategy. We believe and our experience showed us that this graph is very true:   And on the real assets, you don’t have any liquidity issue (at least among the big indices that we are trading: S&P500, Eurostox50, FTSE, etc). On the crypto-assets, we have market timing strategies on the BTC and ETH. The other crypto-currencies are really to small at the moment. As a crypto-manager, we will chase volumes! For the execution part, we will need the involvement of humans, at least, as long as the decentralized exchanges are not mature enough and as long as all of underlyings are not tokenized. We can detailled further if needed.",False

First of all, when you compare returns or performance, you have to compare the associated risk also, measured by volatility or max drawdowns among other. Otherwise you can’t infer anything, since with adequate leverage you can target a given return (almost let say to not go too far in this direction).  This being said, the 8% to 25% daily perf is pretty insane and corresponds more surely to an exception. However, we totally agree on your analysis of bots versus human and you can check the graph I posted earlier that shows that. To be more precise, when you write that the bots are getting smarter and smarter, you refer to a subset of the trading bots that corresponds to trading bots based on machine learning. But the set of trading bots is wider than that and we do deterministic trading bots that perform very well.  To answer your questions: trading bots will be the only ones giving the trading signals, whereas for the execution it could be necessary to have human. There may be some additional performance to earn there too, in what we call money management.  Of course, there will be time where bots and DAFs will lose money. In such case, the investors will lose money. But, to be more specific, our trading bots, in the past, have lost money, but have gained it back quite quickly in general. There are two classic measures for this risk: the max drawdowns (in % ->how much did you lose since the last highest value) and the time to recovery (in days -> how long do you wait to recover the amount of money you have lost). When the NPX token holders or the DAF token holders choose a trading bots, we will provide them with several indicators, including these two ones, so that they can embed them in their thinking when choosing a bot. You can see the historical values of theses indicators on our trading bots in the blackpaper.  At last, as you may have noticed, we don’t intend to create only one DAF, but several. And several over non-correlated underlying assets. Therea are several reasons for that. But one reason is to give the opportunity to investors to hedge themselves by investing on several asset classes and to diversify their investments. So that, when some DAF may lose, most of them may earn money. The expectation is highly positive.  Hope it is clearer!",False

I've previously invested in Iconomi and so far have been a bit disappointed with them.  A few questions come to mind. I don't see any mention of the recent SEC ruling (don't think it's official yet?) that tokens are securities. If this ruling does go through, will you guys have any trouble with this? Will all trading done by the trading bots in the DAF's (always) be fully autonomous? I know the DAF stands for Decentralized Autonomous Funds, so the assumption is that the trading is fully autonomous, but in some cases i can imagine that a human can give the final OK on a trade. For instance when large amounts are being traded, big risks, certain news coming out (especially with crypto assets), etc.   Anyway, you already got me as far as registering my e-mail ",False
