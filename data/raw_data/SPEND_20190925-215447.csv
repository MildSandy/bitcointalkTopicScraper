Most would say, hey that's good, they refunded you, at least you got something... right... but the way it looks they planned it this way from very beginning and there is plenty of facts to confirm my theory.  They collected most of funds, like 90% of all their funds was gathered during pre-sale, aprox. 2400 ETH. That being said, what ever marketing they purchased and legal that costed 75% of 2400 ETH... A lot of money right... The problem here is there was no marketing done, absolute 0, if you think sending few emails out and purchasing bots for telegram costs that much you're in wrong and I haven't seen anything apart from that sadly. During ICO I was watching this project very closely and I've noticed to many things that were screaming NOOO... I lost the trust in project when people confirmed they were buying bots for telegram, which is no no no in my book, you lost all my trust there already. Don't forget ETH was aprox. 900$ back then, so yeah, lot of money went somewhere .)  Anyway today I got 25.68%, which is 2.5 ETH, out of my initial 10 ETH. If just my 7.5 ETH was spent on marketing we would not have only few dozen investors during 1 month long ICO sale...  On Telegram and I've asked exactly this: ""Is it possible to give some better insight or even better a 3rd party report, since you said you used 3rd party accounting / legal team etc. and that you will be fully transparent or is this no longer the case?""... That message was immediately removed, I don't know why exactly, but I guess I stepped on someones toes.  Now I'm seeing a message on telegram that they will be releasing information after refund is done, haha. No matter what they publish I don't believe those people not a tiny bit.  This could be lesson to us all, let's setup smart-contact, write whitepaper, get up a simple website running and voila we have ICO, we spend few ETH for tiny bit of exposure and MILK the cow, after we milked the cow we say we didn't reach the soft-cap and we refund 25% of funds gathered, good deal? Anyone up for it? PM me. (being sarcastic obviously, but that's sadly exactly what happened)      Yeah, posting daily on twitter for gaining credibility and gaining momentum (hype), nothing else, was pointless stuff anyway, nothing valuable... There was a lot of random emails as well of what and how they are doing this and that... Lot has been said, but not much has been done as you can see your self.  I'm sure who ever posted those tweets got paid around 100 ETH per tweet, because that's the only way I can see them spending all this ether (millions in USD value) and don't forget all this money they gathered in pre-ico, because main ICO sale was horendous and there was barely any investors (that's what happens when you spend 75% of your funds on marketing and not 100%, haha).",False

It grew by 1800% in 2017 and had some coins which increased more than 4000%. We’ve also seen a lot of ICO launches, but some of the legit ICOs failed because they lacked an infrastructure.

Any ICO or cryptocurrency such as Ethereum could use the platform and issue a debit card to their holders. They just need to apply for partnership, and white label the MoxyOne’s wallet system. There’s currently no such cryptocurrency or platform for this purpose.

Social (SCL) - formally Nexus is a MoxyOne white label partner meaning they are going to use our infrastructure to issue their users with a debit card. The founder of Social has agreed to be an advisor and is not part of the core development team. Mo Abbas is a co founder of MoxyOne and was a solidity developer consultant for SCL as he helped with the development of the smart contract.  As for Barcoin we have no association with them whatsoever and they are a scam and have been reported.They are using team pictures from everyone from the Social team without permission and using fake names.  Not sure what you mean by DNS registry can you please clarify?  I would suggest you go through the whitepaper and the company registration information for further clarifications and if you have any more questions please do join us on telegram https://t.me/moxyone",False
