There are numerous features that bring need to everyday life; smart contracts, mobile mining, atomic swaps.  However the existing coins tackle only portions of these verticals.  Kryptonium is positioned on a solid base of privacy and a fundamental goal of regaining the privacy that we have given up in our participation with the Internet.  Kryptonium adds value with the smart contracts and atomic swaps; making it very powerful for many potential use cases.  However that doesn't quite bring it down to your specific question... business and everyday life:  That is where the true mobile mining comes in, and the Vanta debit card.  There are significantly more people with smart phones in the world then those with access to modern banking.  The debit card, in conjunction with the mobile wallet and mobile mining, brings the ability for anyone with a smart phone to earn KRYP tokens, and use KRYP tokens anywhere they could use a debit card.  With the ability to have tokenized smart contracts (similar to ethereum's 3rd party tokens), this expands these capabilities to a much wider audience, with exponential growth of use cases.",False

Kryptonium has joined forces with project POMA, and with all these changes, we believe postponing the current crowd sale is in the best interests of the Kryptonium Projects’ growth and success. We are not going anywhere, we are here to stay, and we are growing stronger and stronger every day. The airdrop is ongoing and all current promotions are continuing.  We understand the desire for verification of purchases and awards, and that the paper wallet system was not fulfilling this community need. Based on this feedback, we are no longer requiring the use of the paper wallet system. Instead, we will be creating an interim ERC20 token that will be used until the public release of the Kryptonium mainnet blockchain.  The ERC20 token will allow you full access to your tokens upon purchase, and you will be able to do anything you want with them; they will not be locked down while you wait for the Kryptonium launch. Upon the official launch, the ERC20 tokens will be redeemable, one for one, with the official Kryptonium token. We hope this will remove the stress and uncertainty from those who have been participating in our crowd sale, the Viper campaign, and other various programs to date; and provide you all with a method to see exactly how much Kryptonium you have earned so far, and within your full control.  Speaking on behalf of the entire Kryptonium Team, we want to share our appreciation for you all, as we look forward to seeing Kryptonium’s continued success with an amazing, growing, community behind it. Hence, the crowd sale is postponed until further notice, but the development is still ongoing. Delivering the ultimate privacy Blockchain with Stealth Smart Contracts, Encrypted P2P Messaging, Mobile Mining, the anonymous Vanta Debit Card, and many more privacy features to our users remains our top mission. We take this opportunity to ask our community to stay up to date with future updates and announcements by following us on twitter @Kryptonium_, joining us on Discord/Telegram, or signing up on our Newsletter on www.kryptonium.io  Thank you,  Team Kryptonium",False
