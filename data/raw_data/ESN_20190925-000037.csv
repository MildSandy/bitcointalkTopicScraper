Ways that make ESN practical to use through partnerships     1) Goal        - We have focused on games and online cartoons which have high profitability and good and easy use of cryptocurrency.        - We have tried to make partnerships with companies which can commercialize services in the actual second quarter of this year        - We have more focused on looking for a company which can use ESN and make actual profitability than name value of a company.     2) Online Cartoon Partnership        - It would be good to have the partnership with major companies, such as Naver or Daum, but we decided to approach it realistically.        - We looked for the online cartoon company because it has many advantages with use of ESN.        - You can use the online cartoon service through ESN with value of $0.46. However, the value of ESN would be interconnected with the online cartoon service after listing on exchanges.    3) P2P Loan Partnership        - The partnership with Korea Funding the 7th biggest P2P loan company in Korea        - It was a strategic partnership that required mutual help. Both cryptocurrencies and P2P loans are highly aggressive investment.        - As Korea Investment itself has also established a community for attracting investment using coins and for unlisted stocks, we continue to conduct technical and marketing consultations.         - Currently, we are working on two things through the partnership.             1)   A mortgage on mining equipment for miners: This is sort of loan products that miners can make liquidity of finance.            2)   We are planning to provide ESN to large investor of P2P loan as prize to increase accessibility of ESN in the real world.            3)   We think that we can implement both of them in May.      4) Games        - We have decided to working on profitable business with HTML5 games because it is pretty hard to directly utilize ESN in app games or application games. Likewise, there is not that many advantage in client PC games because it already has pretty good payment module.        - It could be meaningful now, such as “I’m mining coins through free games.” For instance, users can get ESN through click advertisement. It could seem like mining ESN.        - However, the specific development direction could be changed during development. First, we have been in a partnership with MobyGames a company services HTML5 games on Yahoo Japan. After completion of the development, it will release a game in which coins are mined for the first time.        - We are also planning to develop games directly based on ESN as both companies get high understanding each other.     5) Additional Partnership        - We will provide escrow services for safety of P2P transactions.        - We will also provide APIs for safety of coin transactions.   2.   Additional Information     1) Mining Conference.        - There will be mining conference on June.        - We will provide useful information about mining and look for many participate companies.    2) Listing on Exchanges        - We think that it is very important to secure various users all over the world.        - We are planning to list ESN on both Korean and overseas exchanges. However, we have more focused on listing ESN on overseas exchanges first which has pretty high trading volume.        - There could be faster listing than we expected.        - We are planning to discuss once it is clear, but ESN could be listed through voting system which is provided from exchanges.",False

The amount created coins from mining should keep decreasing, so it’s not gonna be an issue even if there is no limited total supply.

It focuses on optimized development of the reward system for online forums and games. Ddengle.com was created at 2013 and has become the biggest online blockchain and mining forum in South Korea. ESN was incubated at this community and began with a discussion about reward system for contents based on text, image and video by community members in the forum. We have a pretty high level of interest in the practical applications of ESN, and we are more committed to direct forum application of ESN and reward system than to ESN development.  Today, thousands of cryptocurrencies have been issued, and hundreds of coins have been listed and traded. However, it is pretty hard to apply these coins to the real life because there are various barriers separated from blockchain. Even if smart contract based on Ethereum was created three years ago and can be used with simple coding, there are still high programmatic barriers.  We have focused on the development of various APIs which can utilize blockchain and practical applications through discussions with members of our forum about these issues. As a result of our effort, ESN has been launched in 2018. There was no ESN ICO, and the purpose of ESN project is practical applications of ESN in the real life. We are planning to make these various practical cases in the future.       The Future of ESN  ESN has been issued already, and there are some ESN miners in South Korea. ESN is not fully completed yet, it is beginning of our project. First of all, we are planning to apply a reward system for our forum advertisements with ESN. In addition, we will support to make the payment systems of online cartoons with ESN during March 2018.  Our team has been composed of exchange and game developers. As mentioned before, we have more focused on the practical development of various APIs, and we are planning to update these APIs by periods. Likewise, these APIs will be applied to online forums and games. It will be steadily updated based on economic analysis and feedback from users. It is not that hard for us to apply these works with our forum, Ddengle.com, the biggest online blockchain forum in Korea.
