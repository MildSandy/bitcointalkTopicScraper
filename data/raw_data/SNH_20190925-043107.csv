Each new application that will be created will increase the price of our token. Synth is useful project which will certainly contribute to increasing decentralization in IT.    Quote from: hamlong99 on May 04, 2018, 07:47:47 AM I have a question.. where would we have to keep our tokens to get dividends? will a user keeping his or her tokens on bitdice get dividends or we have to keep it on wallets like other wallet?  You will get your tokens to webwallet on our website, after ICO end you will be able to transfer it to Mobile/Desktop wallet and hold or transfer it to cryptoexchanges and sell/trade.
