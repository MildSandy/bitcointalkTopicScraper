A lot of investors were asking the same questions, but they never got the answer. The answers were like: We can't disclose this yet, because of the signed NDA... I am a lawyer and I know what an NDA means, but I want to know how many people are actually daily using the SNC platform. Will the Italian people start using it... and if when. Try to be objective man and don't judge people because of your ignorance. I want this project to succeed, you can be sure about that, but I want some constructive debate and real answers not your childish behaviour. I watched all of my investments closely. Look at RDN and ANT and there you will learn how the reports should look like. RDN has a big adoption problem as well (around 50 active channels), but I can see at any time what they're doing. Maybe they will succeed, or they won't, the time will tell, but they're not hiding their work. The SNC team made their platform as they promised, but as I told you: You can have a perfect project, but if nobody uses it, it will become a dead project. Users are important - without them, there is no inflow and that means no salarys for employees; and that's how a project dies. Raiden (Brainbot team) has very successful and well known programmers in their team. They made a working product - MicroRaiden, but other projects that have better marketing copied it and are using it more succesfuly.

What we’re doing at SunContract with this new platform update, is that we’re allowing our customers to reuse their surplus energy from the previous calendar year in the next year, or transfer it to different households as per their decision.  This is something that has never been done before and we are happy to contribute towards a fair, transparent energy distribution paradigm.  “Our reasoning behind this update is this: if you invest in solar power plants, we expect, just like you do, that the energy you produce is yours. We don’t want it,” says SunContract CEO — Gregor Novak More on this update: Users can now see information regarding surplus on the platform by clicking on navigation bar on “Electricity”and then choose tab “My Meters” At the bottom of this page, we have added a new functionality “Transfer”. By clicking on it, users can choose what to do with their surplus They have 3 options: use it on the meter where they produced the energy, transfer it to a different account on the SunContract platform or donate it. A transfer is made simply by entering the email address of the recipient on the platform and quantity of energy that the user wishes to transfer.

Going forward, the platform will allow for peer-to-peer energy trading between anyone and everyone registered on the platform.  Consumers will be able to identify producers whose energy selling price is similar to their willingness to pay. If a mutual price is agreed upon, they will then be able to trade with one another.  Producers who register on the platform will be guaranteed payment from consumers on the platform. As soon as a consumer’s funds fall below minimum level, they will receive a warning notification. Before the consumer’s funds run out, the procedure of disconnecting them will begin, allowing the producer the option to switch to another consumer. Anyone will be able to enter an agreement with anyone, regardless of whether they know each other or not, as long as they meet the minimum requirements for peer-to-peer trading of energy which include:  https://medium.com/suncontract/new-upgrade-of-p2p-energy-trading-features-5e08d91997f3",False

How the fuck will they expand, if they can't handle small Slovenian market, how will they do anything on any larger markets?!  They aren't even capable of creating a ""average Joe simple"" website in Slovenian language, for fucks sake. Can you imagine that? You start ""revolutionary platform"" and aren't even capable of presenting and communicationg your service in targeted country in appropriate language. No one takes them seriously, (only naive people) that's for sure, even investors, just look at the price. Any douche can make a website that sells his/hers products and services, it's not hard for real and if you wish to succeed you need that 100%, NO other way. So there are no marketing pages that would help with user growth, just some mumbo jumbo, partnerships with everyone, everywhere and all the time. But no real progress on their business side. I wish to see the numbers. Or at least i wish too see some advertisements, because this is the only way this project isn't dead when they run out off the money, which if it didn't happen, it will soon... They are just paving the way so that some capable competitor will run then over like they didn't even existed.  Please enlighten me and explain to me i am wrong, i can't wait.",False

In short, a sharing economy. As solar and battery storage systems increase, the concept of a P2P energy trading system is becoming more and more popular. This system, which is at the core of the SunContract platform, allows consumers to take advantage of other users who produce more energy than they need.  Any producer on the SunContract trading platform can become a trader and offer their surplus electricity on the platform to others. This makes it easier for other consumers to purchase electricity based on the renewable energy source of their choice. Also, prices of electricity can be lower than those of conventional energy suppliers. Available on the platform at the moment is renewable energy from the sun, cogeneration as well as hydro.  https://medium.com/suncontract/p2p-energy-trading-on-the-suncontract-platform-bfa5f85d8cb0",False

SunContract and Microsoft signed agreement at the Microsoft NT Conference 2018 at Portoroz, Slovenia on 23rd May 2018.  The strategic cooperation between SunContract and Microsoft aims to leverage the Azure Blockchain Workbench, a platform that is being developed by Microsoft that will host and run the SunContract platform. The Blockchain Workbench can reduce app development time from months to days. An intelligent platform, it will automate the process of infrastructure development so that developers can focus on application logic and business owners can focus on defining and validating their use cases.   Speaking on the sidelines of the event, SunContract CEO, Gregor Novak said that he was extremely pleased and proud with this development. “We intend to establish a long term strategic cooperation in the blockchain industry with Microsoft. With Workbench, Microsoft has entered the blockchain space in a big way and its technology will dramatically reduce development costs and accelerate time to value for developers, independent software vendors and integration partners alike. We are sure that with the global leadership of in software development, the SunContract platform will become more agile and can host a wide variety of use cases that we have envisioned for our customers in a bid to become energy self-reliant.”  “Microsoft’s vision is to provide blockchain technology that drives real business and economic value. For that end, we are striving to be an ideal tech partner for organizations such as SunContract that are using blockchain technology, offering them our many technical innovations, enterprise experience, and collaborations across business, government, standards and policy,” said Tomaž Valjavec, Director, Solution sales team at Microsoft.  SunContract is Slovenia-based and the world’s first peer to peer retail energy trading platform based on blockchain. It consists of a team of expert professionals with over 20 years of experience in the energy sector. Through this unique platform, SunContract has opened the energy market to individuals that have traditionally been controlled by the whims of state-owned, or sponsored, energy producers. Through the SunContract platform, individuals, especially homeowners, can now choose whom to buy, sell or trade electricity with.  Through the platform, people will now be able to buy electricity, solar power plants, heat pumps and storage units and select between a wide array of energy products and services. Individual energy producers leveraging the power of the sun or other natural sources can now sell their surplus power through the platform at their own rates and become energy independent in the process.  SunContract has already started peer-to-peer retail energy trading services in the Slovenian market from April 1st, 2018. It looks at expanding its footprints to other EU member states as well as to USA, Japan and other countries.

Na prireditvi, ki ima že 23-letno tradicijo, so se strokovnjaki s tehnološkega in poslovnega področja seznanili z najnovejšimi trendi in priložnostmi, ki jih prinaša izjemno hiter napredek na področjih, kot so umetna inteligenca in strojno učenje, tehnologija veriženja blokov in računalništvo v oblaku. Hkrati sta podjetji Microsoft in SunContract na konferenci predstavili dolgoročno strateško sodelovanje na področju tehnologije veriženja blokov.  Strateško partnerstvo med podjetjema SunContract in Microsoft Microsoft in SunContract sta na NT konferenci sklenila načelni sporazum o strateškem sodelovanju na področju tehnologije veriženja blokov (blockchain), ki sta ga podpisala Barbara Domicelj, generalna direktorica podjetja Microsoft Slovenija, in Gregor Novak, glavni izvršni direktor podjetja SunContract. V okviru sodelovanja bo platforma SunContract za trgovanje peer-to-peer (vsak z vsakim) z energijo, ki temelji na tehnologiji veriženja blokov, uporabljala Microsoftovo platformo Azure Blockchain Workbench. Slednja omogoča občutno hitrejši ter s tem tudi stroškovno ugodnejši in odzivnejši razvoj projektov s tehnologijo veriženja blokov.   »Microsoftova vizija je zagotavljanje tehnologije veriženja blokov, ki poganja otipljivo poslovno in ekonomsko vrednost. V ta namen si prizadevamo, da smo popoln partner organizacijam, ki uporabljajo veriženje blokov, saj jim nudimo številne svoje tehnične inovacije, izkušnje iz poslovnih okolij in sodelovanje s podjetji in z vladami ter pri standardizaciji in oblikovanju politik,« je povedal Tomaž Valjavec, direktor za prodajo storitev v oblaku pri Microsoftu. »Z Microsoftom nameravamo vzpostaviti dolgoročno strateško sodelovanje v panogi veriženja blokov. S platformo Workbench je Microsoft na veliko vstopil v prostor tehnologij veriženja blokov in njegova tehnologija bo dramatično znižala razvojne stroške ter pohitrila ustvarjanje vrednosti pri razvijalcih, neodvisnih ponudnikih programske opreme in integracijskih partnerjih. Prepričani smo, da bo platforma SunContract z globalnim vodstvom na področju razvoja programske opreme postala bolj odzivna in bo lahko gostila širok nabor možnosti uporabe, ki smo jih predvideli za svoje stranke v prizadevanjih, da postanejo energetsko samozadostni,« je povedal Gregor Novak, glavni izvršni direktor podjetja SunContract.

The platform uses blockchain technology to balance energy demand and supply. It is the first live blockchain-powered peer-to-peer platform and will allow people to sell, buy and trade electricity.  SunContract was launched at an event attended by senior officials from the Slovenian government as well as the European Union. During the event, the company signed several partnership deals with blockchain and energy sector partners. The company said that it will give further details about the partnership in the near future.  The current electric power system is largely inefficient due to underutilization of resources and the fact that they are controlled by governments, which generally can’t do anything efficiently.

We also believe that it is in fact the missing piece to the completion of an otherwise inefficient energy-sector business model.  Blockchain provides us with immutability, removal of intermediaries, automation, decentralization of consensus, speed, lower costs due to the removal of intermediaries, transparency, near-impossible loss of data, a solution to the problem of double spending as well as encryption through cryptography. Given we are well cogniscent of the benefits of blockchain technology, we as a team can no longer fathom a life without it. Similarly, knowing the numerous benefits of renewable energy, we cannot help but strive to disrupt the energy sector by combining these two to make everyone better off in society by maximizing their welfare.  SunContract strongly believes that a relationship between blockchain and renewable energy production is one that has massive potential and for this reason you will find our CEO — Gregor Novak — evangelizing about the two gamechangers at many conferences and summits worldwide.

SunContract, a token in the crypto industry which is only recently beginning to receive exposure, is improving on the existing energy trading paradigm and is currently targeting the European market with plans to eventually expand outside of the European Union.   Aiming for a platform release in April 2018, SunContract is an energy trading platform that leverages the transparent, immutable nature of blockchain technology to optimize power distribution. The current energy distribution paradigm is heavily centralized, with energy retailers and wholesalers participating in an oligarchy that negatively affects consumers.  With the SunContract ICO finished and SNC tokens now trading on multiple high volume, top 10 exchanges, The SunContract team have completed the final stages of their Q4 2017 roadmap commitments and are putting up finishing touches towards the democratization of the energy distribution monopoly.  WHAT IS SUNCONTRACT? SunContract allows independent power producers such as homeowners with solar power equipment installed on their homes to connect with power consumers. Both parties are able to connect and trade with each other directly through a decentralized mobile app.  While the concept of tokenized, decentralized energy distribution is an established use case in the world of blockchain technology applications, there are several key features that differentiate SunContract from other platforms.  SunContract is the very first peer-to-peer energy trading blockchain platform to launch a finished product, and is focused on launching in Europe— a region with highly liberalized energy trading regulations. Legislations are therefore not going to be a hurdle in the journey of this Slovenian company.  Also, as the platform is based in Slovenia, which is an extremely crypto-friendly country, the SunContract development team benefits from a significant amount of governmental support. They have even been seen at the World Economic Forum, being accompanied by the Slovenian Prime MInister – Dr. Miro Cerar.  For investors, SNC is a tunique token with a lot of potential as well. It has a very low total supply (~100 million tokens) compared to similar companies in the energy industry, and is currently priced at a fraction of the price of most other energy tokens.  HOW SUNCONTRACT WORKS The SunContract platform works in a streamlined, agile fashion. Based on the Ethereum ERC20 standard, SNC tokens function as tradable crypto assets that represent value in the form of “digital electricity”.  In the current power distribution paradigm, a homeowner that is able to generate power is forced to sell excess power to large trading companies at a non-negotiable price. SunContract makes it possible for power generating individuals to join a “Pool” via the SunContract app, selling surplus electricity at competitive rates in return for SNC tokens.  Similarly, individuals seeking to purchase power are able to join the Pool and access a competitive market environment in which they are able to select the best rate possible when purchasing power. SunContract provides a succinct explanation of the tokenomics of their proposed system in a clearly-defined white paper, available on the SunContract ICO site.  THE SUNCONTRACT PLATFORM RELEASE SNC tokens are already trading at high volumes ahead of the SunContract platform release in April, and can be traded on HitBTC, OkEx, and Huobi. In a unique move, SunContract is offering investors the opportunity to participate in the SunContract “Pioneer Program”, which will be limited to a small group of only 1,000 supporters.  SunContract Pioneers will be offered a range of exclusive benefits, including: Access to the platform when it is released – before everyone else, VIP status at their launch event which they claim will be attended by distinguished dignitaries, preferential treatment with regards to investments into photovoltaics, and permanently lower transaction fees on purchases from SunContract’s partner companies such as  SONCE Energy. More information on the SunContract Pioneer Program can be found on the platform website.",False

However, this is not the reason we should stop pushing hard. We are still few months away from the full launch of the product and there are things that need to be completed before we establish the first Peer-to-Peer energy market supported with blockchain technology which will be opened for the general public.  Currently, the platform goes through heavy testing and we are expecting fresh updates and upgrades for both, the platform and the app, in next few weeks. We will keep you updated all the time.  Presenting the project to the world Slovenia has become a well-known destination in the blockchain and crypto space with many successful projects coming from this little country at the end of the Alps. The prime minister of Slovenia, Mr. Miro Cerar publicly announced that Slovenia is a crypto friendly destination and invited blockchain-based projects to bring and develop their ideas in this country of 2 million people. Being small is a great advantage compared to bigger nations because authorities and projects can solve problems directly with each other in a fast and innovative manner.  This is why the Prime Minister and his office are organizing a joint delegation of the Slovenian government and key Slovenian-crypto players to present Slovenia on an annual World Economic Forum event in Davos, Switzerland. We can proudly announce we will be part of this delegation and our CEO will be one of the speakers on the panel Slovenia and Blockchain for the Future.  World Economic Forum is one of the most (if not the most important) economic event that gathers all the key players from different corporations, countries and organizations. It will host important speakers such as president of the European Commission Mr. Junker, president of France, Mr. Macron, prime minister of Great Britain, Ms. May, and Israel, Mr. Netanyahu, founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates, world-known singer, Elton John, Al Gore, CEO of Renault-Nissan Alliance, Carlos Ghosn, Managing Director of International Monetary, Ms. Christine Lagarde and many more.  Such an event is a great opportunity to establish new acquaintances and talk about possible business opportunities. Our aim is to present our project to this fine audience and find new partners.  Supporting the future SunContract project is not all about cryptocurrencies, blockchain and profits but is focused on the long term vision. We profoundly believe new and emerging technologies, progress and cleaner economy is the future for the human kind. There is only one planet Earth and if we destroy it we will not get a second chance.  To support the progress of a new, cleaner technology, we have to find interesting ideas and help them grow. This is why we, at SunContract, decided to financially support one of the key events of World Economic Forum, FutureHack Hackathon that started on Sunday, January 22. The aim is to find new, disruptive technologies that will help humankind strive towards the better tomorrow.  There are six opened challenges and the best projects can win rewards of up to USD500,000. Three of those challenges are very interesting for SunContract project: Sustainable Cities & Communities, Sustainable Development and Climate Action. We will help projects on the hackathon as mentors. Interesting projects from those fields can become the future part of our platform. We are looking forward to the outcomes of this competition.  Also, to remind you: Join our Telegram where you can talk with the team and great community. Follow us on Twitter and Medium.

Numbers depend on market size, smaller percent on big markets and slightly bigger percent on small markets, like Slovenia — launch pad of this project.",False

A lot of guys in crypto who made deep profits often took massive risk with a single coin. I'd say that's the way to go. Find a project you believe in, with good devs and go ALL IN when it's at a good price. Big risk can bring big rewards. I also diversified and found myself spread too far. Now I'm invested in a small amount of projects (that I've researched heavily and believe in), and the profits are much greater.

The story of SunContract is a story of harnessing revolutionary technology of blockchain and cryptocurrencies and connecting them to the potential of untapped, green, Independent Power Producers while avoiding all the traps and pitfalls of traditional unidirectional systems of electrical energy generation and distribution. Partners who understand and will support the potential of what we are creating play a pivotal role in this.  The cryptocurrency exchange We arrived to the Pearl of the Orient on November 5th and are, at the moment, on the way back to home. Our first goal was to find business organizations that would provide additional support to our SNC token regarding exchanging it for Fiat Currencies.  As far as exchanging cryptocurrencies for Fiat Currencies is concerned (including US Dollar and Euro), Asia is the place to go. Exchanging crypto for fiat is a fundamental snag, especially when we are talking small home- and solar- owners. SunContract’s goal is to provide complete service on the Platform developed by our team or to find a partner who would enable exchange of SNC token for a reasonable fee.  Shenzhen and us A week cannot end without a short visit of a conference. We took this amazing opportunity to meet with high-level blockchain people from Asia in Shenzhen and spoke about our vision of decentralized energy market. China understands problems with pollution more than any other nation on the planet.  2017 Asia Blockchain Application Congress was there for us on the best possible moment. Two days conference was all about adoption of blockchain technology and mainstream products that could become part of our lives. We feel the big breakthrough of the technology is just around the corner and we want to be in the foreground once it happens.  Getting our foot in with stock markets Our second priority are regional (and global) financial industries and stock markets. We want to find a common ground with them regarding listing of SNC token. Global stock exchanges are already opening doors for select few, but listing of cryptocurrency on a regular stock market is still a rather tough nut to crack.  The SunContract story is far from merely coming up with a nice looking application for P2P Energy Markets. Given the fact that technical parts of the platform (solar, heat pump technology, batteries) have been an integral part of our undertaking from the beginning, we are also probing Asia regarding possible business partners for these technologies.  Our ultimate plan is to support our platform with a wide network of already connected business partners who can provide the customer with the best possible products in terms of energy-generating and energy-storing devices — at the best possible price. In the field of P2P Energy Markets, the issue of energy storage is quite neglected at the moment. In the final phase we want to offer a unified, integrated and easily accessible service to our customers.  Result of those long night meetings are several signed NDAs (non-disclosure agreement) that are the base for future business collaborations between involved parties. We are very optimistic about the future! Polishing, polishing, polishing  The last (but hardly least important) field that our team dived into is the question of cryptocurrency mining and power consumption during this process. Cryptomining is today extremely heavy-duty, in terms of electricity consumption.  So our plan is to find people in Asia, that can enable our customers easy access to mining hardware. SunContract’s part in this setup is providing investors with a power generating equipment and all cooling machinery at the same location where cryptomining will be taking place. Basically: cheaper, locally produced electricity = cheaper mining costs for our customers.  We’ll tell you all about the abovementioned results, as soon as we finalize our arrangements. We guarantee we’ll have an exciting story to tell soon.",False

SunContract: Deploying First P2P Energy market by 2018  We are the new current in town. Or in town of “Peer to Peer energy market” anyway. Our project, SunContract, is now about a year old and since we witnessed an extremely successful token sale on August 1st where we raised 2 mlm, our goal now is to introduce the first Peer to Peer energy market in the first quarter of 2018.  We are not a big corporation and such an undertaking is no small feat for a team like ours, so we intend to share our hardships (and successes!) with you regularly here, as well as on our blog and Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, etc. London story  There are currently some rough seas in the crypto world. We witnessed three hard forks and we expect another to follow soon. We are proud (and a bit relieved) that in this turmoil our SNC token remained stable. The fact that we are engaged in a world-redefining project proved true yet again during our most recent visit to “Energy Systems Catapult Whole Energy Systems Study: “System Transition to Digital Energy” conference organized by London Business School. Event was initiated by our regular advisor and leading expert in the field of digital transition of the energy sector dr. Jesus Nieto Martin.  SunContract team journeyed to London and had a chance to engage in discussion with several key players in the EU energy sector. We also had fervent talks with representatives of ENTSO-e that represents 42 most important TSOs in Europe, we discussed with people of UK Power Networks and National Grid of United Kingdom. Ofgem presented their idea of Sandbox for innovative energy concepts. We discussed a similar idea with Slovenian government and we hope that these two ideas will soon be merged for a great benefit of everyone involved.  We have also met others who are breaking the ground in fields of energy and blockchain: IBM and GridSingularity representatives with their projects. Important business agreement  We agreed on signing a contract with the SolarPower Europe association. This is big announcement for SunContract project!  The signing of SolarPower Europe association agreement is what we are especially happy about. SolarPower Europe is about shaping the regulatory environment and enhancing business opportunities for solar power in Europe. As their member, SunContract will be ahead when it comes to green energies.  This means crucial market advantage and a bunch of new opened doors for us.  However, it is this December that we are really looking toward to.  At that time, our CEO Gregor Novak will present our project to the public during the Digital Solar & Storage conference in Munich. SolarPower Europe is, along with IBESA, organizer of event.  We hope to see you there and have a talk. Until then, we’ll keep you posted with current developments.  https://medium.com/@SunContract/suncontract-deploying-first-p2p-energy-market-by-2018-3a2d3e9a9f84",False

More important, Slovenia as a small country can be perfect base for future market entries.  If SunContract project achieves 2% Slovenian market share than market values would be as follows: Price of kWh in Slovenia is 0.163 EUR (0.083 EUR for industrial consumers) — middle price 0.123 EUR (Eurostat). Annual production in kWh: 12,895,000,000 (Statistical office of the Republic of Slovenia). Rough estimation of revenue: 1.6 billion EUR annually.  2% SunContract market share: 32 million EUR of annual revenue.  More realistic revenue (SunContract will not include trading for industry subjects): 42 million EUR of annual revenue. This kind of annual revenue would be 8/11 times higher than current capitalization of SNC token. In addition, by my knowledge no other crowdfunded crypto project currently generates so much annual revenue.

Thanks and wish you all the best!   SunContract Decentralized energy market platform (Platform) will accept SNC and fiat currency.    I suppose there is no so much people who fully understand energy distribution system/network, especially renewable energy network. I would like to know some basic informations about distribution and SunContract role in it. For example, household from Berlin wants to buy energy from Munchen, how that works? In that case, what would be SunContract role? Can that go internationaly, household from Maribor wants energy from Salzburg, is that type of trade possible in EU? Is that SunContracts point? If that's possible, what are the EU law regulations and how is that going to affect big players in energy business?  SunContract Right now system works like this: Power plant produces electricity that goes into the grid. Local distribution is managed by DSO while transmission is in the hands of TSO. Retailer buys electricity from power plant and sells this electricity to you. Electricity is then distributed to your home. SunContract’s role here will be eliminating the role of retailer: trading with energy. Why would retailer buy electricity cheaper from power plant and then sell it to you more expensive if this can be conducted via our Platform? With this, a lot of money can be saved. Also, retailer’s interest is not to give you best possible service and solution and give you clear data on daily consumption etc. Electricity is transmitter on international level all the time, EU regulation requires open market. However, this is no very efficient because transmission on longer distances is not efficient due to losses in the grid and it is expensive because of cross border costs. SunContract will be focused on local production and local distribution. But in theory, yes, one could do that.   longtermwins When beta release if possible some dates will be great we now full version At q1 but beta is very interesting and we now you are close to make it even possible date will be great tnx stalna povezavaembed  SunContract The key systems of the Stage 1 is already running on our test environment and now we are developing it. The Stage 1 is planned to be introduced by the end of the year or in the beginning of the January and fully tested before public launch in Q1 2018. We have to inform you that at this point of the project Stage 1 testing is taking place strictly with people that signed NDA with us. This is our main competitive advantage so we have to make sure information do not get into competition hands. However, we will share with public pictures, preview videos etc. when final graphical designs will be finished. Some of you are already very impatient about seeing our product and we are doing our best to show you as much as we can.   KingmanKD How is your ecosystem working? - When you are selling as an ordinary guy to an ordinary buyer, why should government/companies let this process be allowed on their system, and how are Suncontract even benefitting if the system is gaining success? (I here think for example on people who hold nodes on certain coins, they will benefit from that – Is it only the gain in price investors and the Sun team will get?) We have heart a little about power ledger, and things going wrong with the cooperation – Which consequences are this gonna have on SunContract and Power ledger? Law suit ? What is the biggest threat for your project? – Is it regulation, if so which? - Or is it other projects like power ledger? – If so, what is their edge compared to you guys? What do you guys have that are unique compared to similar? You raised $2 mio, how does that fit into your budget? – How long can you guys ‘’survive’’ on this, if the market prices stays at this level? Why did the team raised money for this project? – If we look at the big potential, and the relative small amount of money compared, they should easily have had access to this kind of money in the industry through their contacts and maybe just get an angel investor. How many guys are on the team, who are they and functions? – Is it only Gregor Novak who has experience within the industry? Is the team fulltime, or do they have a job on the side? Do you have any prior agreements with companies? Which companies are you in contact with? – And located? How is the market seeing you guys at this point on conferences etc etc., do we see seriously interest or ‘’only’’ some skeptical interest? You are going after the Slovania market first, how is the priority afterwards? What does it take to expand to another country? – Guess the laws is different for each country and that can be a hurtle. - Is there any countries you won’t go into? What is the plan for PR? - And when is the plan to start it? What can get the budget to take of in the wrong way? - What is the plan if the money is running out before planned? How many SNC is hold by the team (if public for members) and how much does the team have in the budget/reserve? If the lead developer or/and Gregor Novak dies tomorrow, what happens to the project? stalna povezavaembed  SunContract SunContract business model can be applied to liberated markets where government has to allow any company access to the grid. This is because government uses public money so any service that could benefit public has to be accepted. On SunContract AMA we should be focused on SunContract platform and services. Legislation can always be problem if it changes suddenly. We feel our biggest thread are tradition players that would try to block our business. Other projects from crypto world are focusing solely on green technologies. We think the only working business case can be hybrid system that guarantees safety of supply at this stage. Also, we have deep understanding of energy market that will give our project most important aspect of this business model to succeed. USD2 million is enough for our business to start making revenue that will help us expanding our project to the market. We need to start making profit and with this profit updating our product and business. We decided to raise money through token sale simply because it is much faster and is community based than tradition VC model. Time on the market and existing community is crucial aspect of this project. Core part of the team has 8 people and few others will join us until the end of the year. Besides core team, we also have four different outsourced team that is helping us with development or other activities. Including outsourced part our team has now 20 people working on project. No, Gregor is not the only one. Mojca is also coming from energy sector. They are leading business developers. Core team is working full time on the project. There were some prior agreements announced on old web page. We are releasing news on collaboration in accordance to our business contracts and terms of NDAs. We will reveal all new business partnerships that will not be subject of NDA on our blog and in the Newsletter. There are two types of industries that are forming our business: energy and blockchain. We consider ourselves as Energy Company. In energy sector, we are receiving great amount of interest. In next three months we will be present on many different energetic conferences. We are also receiving more and more interest from blockchain community. If you are interested in meeting us on conference, we can provide list where we will be present. Slovenia will be our first market. We already have plans for further expansion and we will share this with you once we have business plan developed fully for particular market. There are few very important aspects when expanding to new markets: marketing, legislation, market evaluation etc. This process takes a lot of time, men hour and it is very costly. Countries where we will not go are jurisdictions where there is closed, unliberated energy market. Part of the PR is weekly Newsletter and monthly AMA and community management. As you can see, we try to be as transparent and as available as we can. We will also intensify presence on conferences. Our next plan is to straighten marketing activities with new Marketing Company we just entered into collaboration with. Right now, we have enough funds for our development plan. There is always possibility for VC model that we do not need right now. We already received interest from different parties for this scenario. 20% of SNC circulation was reserved for the team and advisors, bounties. Some advisors were already paid because they worked with us only for purposes of Token Sale campaign. We are estimating that the team still has 15% of those funds that are in cold storage for 6 months. Project goes on. He is not that easy to get rid off.  matjaz Hello, I guess Slovenia is first (pilot) market. So this questions are related to Slovenia market. When do you expect consumers will be able to buy electricity from SunContract? When do you expect producers will be able to sell electricity to SunContract? (annual contracts are signed in nov-dec for next year) Are you planning to connect with other smaller subgroups and create own pool? How many beta testers (consumers and producers) do you have before public lunch? Are you accepting new ones? Can you give us some estimations what will be the energy price comparing to other dealers? Are you planning to create some ""fixed price offers"" or similar? And here are some general questions. How do you plan to handle green certificates and carbon credits, which belongs to renewable producers? When do you expect to expand to other markets? I guess those will be EU markets first, which are liberalized. What is the status of platform development? Are you on plan? What are the most hard challenges you faced so far (technical, legal, market)? What are the marketing plans? Will blockchain be public? Can producers see their own production data? Thank you for answers and keep up the good work!  SunContract  Our platform is planned to go live in Q1 2018. This is the time when consumers will be able to start buying electricity from producers on the platform. We plan to start generating steady revenue already in 2018. In November we plan to start negotiating for business deals with producers for next year. That means electricity offers will be on the Platform when it starts to operate. This part is still subject of business development. We can have both models. Right now in Stage 1 testing is opened for core team and outsourced companies. We will expand beta testing to others. Everyone that will want to beta test our system will have to be strictly under NDA. Both questions are still in business development. Every information I would give you right now would be just rough approximation. General answers This is not our business. Producers receive carbon credits for every generated “green” kWh. So this part is not our business part. We do have some brief ideas for this part in the future but those are just office talks right now. Slovenia will be our first market. We already have plan for further expansion and we will share this with you once we have business plan developed fully for particular market. Right now development is running very smoothly. We are very satisfied with blockchain solution. Now we are connecting blockchain with our app which is fully on track. Right now approximately 20 people are working on our project and everything is very good and on track. The only obstacle right now is listing SNC on more exchanges. We are doing our best to get SNC on another bigger exchange to give people more possibilities for doing business with our token. We entered into collaboration with new marketing company that has a lot of local and international experiences. Marketing plan will be divided into different sectors: supporters, customers, producers and investors into renewable sources of energy. Yes, final solution of blockchain will be public, producers will be able to see their production data while consumers will be able to track their consumtion.  Seclipse7 Have you hit any major obstacles whilst creating the platform? Is everything on schedule?  SunContract No, right now development is running very smoothly. We outsourced part of our development to parties that cooperated with us in preparation of token sale. So right now approximately 20 people are working on our project. The only obstacle right now is listing SNC on more exchanges. We are doing our best to get SNC on another bigger exchange to give people more possibilities for doing business with our token.  Seclipse717 We have heard a little about power ledger and things going wrong with the cooperation between you two. Are there any negative consequences or long lasting affects to SunContract? Law suit ? What is the biggest threat for your project?  SunContract SunContract AMA should be focused solely on our platform and services. We already answered this question in the past many times and we thing we should leave this chapter behind us now.   Seclipse717 You are going after the Slovania market first, are there any other countries you are looking to expand into? Is it feasible to do this considering there are different laws that could cause difficulties. Is there any PR plan in regards to other countries?   Naturally, firstly we are looking into biggest European markets for business expansion. EU legislation allow us to implement our business model into any European country we would like to enter. So there are no major obstacles for that. For that matter, we hired very experienced marketing team that will help us with expansion to other markets.   Will I be able to buy energy in the US with snc? If so when?  SunContract Yes, when plan to implement similar business model in US. However, we do not have any time frame when SunContract will be present on US market. Yet!",False

Becouse of that   Relevant numbers for SunContract project  Now let us focus on Europe, first major market place for SunContract platform. Europe generated in 2016 3,831 TWh of electricity and consumed 3,342 TWh. Average price of kWh (kilo Watt-hours) for household in EU in 2016 was 0.205 EUR by statistical figures of Eurostat. Industrial price was 50% lower, 0.114 EUR per kWh. If we take middle price, 0.16 EUR per kWh than we can make rough approximation of European electricity market. 3,342 TWh accounts for 3 342 000 000 000 kWh annually. That would mean European electricity market solely is worth more than half a trillion of EUR (535 billion EUR). This is a huge market. And we only took into account Europe which is not even the biggest electricity market. Chinese market is almost twice as big and still growing rapidly. USA is second biggest and on the third place is another emerging market, India. First three markets account for half of all electricity consumption on the world.  Now let us focus back on SunContract project. SunContract plan is NOT to become the biggest energy player on the world. People behind the project believe in decentralization. This is why overall plan is to be a smaller player on numerous markets. Goal is to achieve somewhere between 0.5% to 2% market share. Numbers depend on market size, smaller percent on big markets and slightly bigger percent on small markets, like Slovenia — launch pad of this project.  If this plan succeed, what would that mean for SunContract annual revenue? I will take into calculation the most conservative numbers. Firstly, I will estimate what would mean if SunContract would be presented on whole European market and later I will estimate goals in first few years. 0.5% of total European market would mean yearly revenue close to 2.7 billion EUR. Current market price of SNC token, used for trading on SunContract platform, is 3.5 EUR cents or market cap of 4 million EUR. Market cap right now is 675 smaller from overall revenue goal of 0.5% European market share.  Case for Slovenia SunContract’s plan is to test and present product first in Slovenia. How big is Slovenian electricity markets? Below are provided some figures.   What is important for SunContract token holders is the fact that electricity demand is rising in all countries SunContract plans to enter. More important, Slovenia as a small country can be perfect base for future market entries. If SunContract project achieves 2% Slovenian market share than market values would be as follows: Price of kWh in Slovenia is 0.163 EUR (0.083 EUR for industrial consumers) — middle price 0.123 EUR (Eurostat). Annual production in kWh: 12,895,000,000 (Statistical office of the Republic of Slovenia).  Rough estimation of revenue: 1.6 billion EUR annually. 2% SunContract market share: 32 million EUR of annual revenue.  More realistic revenue (SunContract will not include trading for industry subjects): 42 million EUR of annual revenue.  This kind of annual revenue would be 8/11 times higher than current capitalization of SNC token. In addition, by my knowledge no other crowdfunded crypto project currently generates so much annual revenue. Now you calculate your market price estimation and capitalization of SunContract project.

Dear SunContract supporters,  As you probably noticed in our latest newsletter, we are making big changes to our project. Promotions in the real world have already started, and the SNC token is already accepted as official currency in many different sectors.  This will generate a higher demand for our token. However, we will not stop there. All these features are just a fraction of what is coming in the future.   Web page  We designed a new landing page (https://suncontract.org/) for SunContract’s coming product – trading platform. The old web page was moved to different subpage and will be redesigned and re-uploaded in coming days. You will find all relative information from the token sale campaign, general information about the product, and of course the latest mentions of SunContract in articles and videos.  This is not the end of changes to our main web page but we have decided to release new updates and information gradually. Please be aware that the current landing page is not the final graphical outlook.  New Wallet  We are happy to announce the first mobile wallet added SNC as a currency into their service. Users of FreeWallet service have already noticed that SNC token is added into TokenWallet (https://[Suspicious link removed]/J8F3uq). This is first mobile wallet that added SNC token. You can now store your tokens on your mobile wallet, send it or receive it. We are actively collaborating with the development team from FreeWallet.  SNC is also added to MyEtherWallet, Parity, and Mist desktop wallets.  Improve your trading skills with CoinMarketGame  CoinMarketGame (CMG) is not a real cryptocurrency exchange, but it is an exchange simulator where anyone can try out how crypto trading works. Each new user gets a fictional budget of 20.000 USD and can invest in coins and tokens listed on CMG. This is very useful for total beginners in the cryptocurrency world.   How can this help SunContract and the SNC token? CMG users will get familiar with coins and tokens used on the CMG exchange and when they decide to go to a real exchange and invest real money, it is more likely that they will invest in the SunContract SNC token because it will be familiar to them.  In essence, being listed on CMG is a great marketing tool for SunContract and the SNC token.  Monthly AMA  We are announcing our monthly AMA (Ask-Me-Anything) where you can ask SunContract Team any question you have. Public will be able to start posting questions on Tuesday until Friday. On Friday we will start answering all questions. Next AMA will commence at the end of October.

Dear SunContract supporters, As always, our team has been very busy working on different parts of our project. The development team is finalizing crucial aspects of our future Platform. We will soon be releasing some teaser photos to the public. Stay tuned!   SNC use case before Platform opening  We are glad to announce that our token (SNC) is attracting new people and organizations and it is already being used as a payment currency. And this is before we have an official working version of the SunContract Platform!  We have already confirmed in our August AMA that the Slovenian Bitcoin Association will accept SNC as an official payment currency. As of Tuesday, we can proudly announce that the Association has added the SNC payment address and the first transaction and payment has already been processed (yearly admission fee). You can find this transaction on the Association’s official address: https://goo.gl/3yzzKw   SunContract Team at the largest regional trading fair  We understand that our business model can successfully expand only if the SunContract Platform becomes used by a wide spectre of people. This is why we have decided to promote our idea at one of the biggest trade events in the region, MOS Fair. You can find details about it here: https://goo.gl/La7bNZ  SunContract has partnered with SONCE Team and joined the effort in attracting new users to our Platform. SunContract hostesses were promoting the SunContract project and SNC as payment currency for investments into Solar power plants and Heat pumps. We have received feedback that our special offer at the fair (discount on payment with SNC tokens) was successful and it is expected that first investment is just around the corner.   We were also glad that our Platform received wide interest from the visitors at MOS. This is extremely important to us. The SunContract pool will be created before the public launch of the Platform and as a result all activities have to be in perfect sync. We will further explain this part with the coming updates to our webpage.  Cutting Edge conference  Tomorrow SunContract will be presenting the project on Cutting Edge conference about digital transformation. In the local region, SunContract is seen as very innovative and futuristic project. We’d like to share our views and experiences and so we will be attending different events in the future. Community is very important for us so we will try to provide video from presentation.  Find out more about Cutting Edge conference here: http://www.digitalization.si/",False

About getting all the attention I think that every project gets the most attention in the time of ICO. When ICO ends usually everything becomes silent. When founders raise the money they have A LOT of work with starting the project,building a platform, expanding the team, improving marketing.... If you follow the SNC on other social channels, read some articles..... you can see how much work has been done and is being done, what are the plans...

Respect for progress - i am buying more offcourse before platform hits in 2018 - price will moon  Dear SunContract supporters, We hosted our first AMA (Ask-Me-Anything) event on our Reddit channel where we received more than 22 different questions from our supporters. All questions were answered. Below you can find a quick summary of answers.  ROADMAP  SunContract has announced an updated roadmap with developments planned through the end of Q1 2018. The Platform is currently on the way to achieving the Q1 launch date target. Besides development, other necessary activities are fully underway: rebranding, a new marketing strategy, promotions on energy and blockchain events, and forming the energy pool and balance group. The last quarter of 2017 will bring an API update that will enable users to explore data on the blockchain. The mobile app and web app continue to be developed.    SNC AS PAYMENT OPTION FOR SOLAR POWER PLANTS AND HEAT PUMPS  Effective September 1st, SNC will be accepted as a payment option for the SONCE Group services.  Now anyone can buy energy from a solar power plant or a heat pump with the SNC token.  SONCE has already received a great deal of interest from the community and the first purchase is expected to happen in the coming weeks.  EXCHANGES  The team at SunContract has been working to list the SNC token on different exchanges.  Being supported on multiple exchanges will bring a lower probability of price manipulation and greater overall stability.  During the weekend, SNC was added to the EtherDelta exchange.  However, our work does not stop there.  We are currently maintaining talks with other, larger exchanges, but cannot further disclose any information at this time.  INFRASTRUCTURE  SunContract will use public infrastructure/systems and will have to pay the usage fees for these systems. Savings will be made by optimization, transparency, usage of new technologies etc. Primarily green energy sources will be offered to customers but traditional producers will have to be included as well. We have to provide “balancing” to ensure a stable distribution. We will be establishing a hybrid system that can handle this task.  MARKETS  At this time, we can safely confirm SunContract services will be offered in the Slovenian market come 2018.  We will inform you about new markets as they develop.  BUSINESS PARTNERSHIPS  We have already announced a SONCE partnership with one of the biggest energy companies in the region, Petrol. We are also collaborating with many Slovenian blockchain projects on different layers. New information about future partnerships will be announced once they are official.  More great news will follow!  SunContract Team    well any comments of community?    Get your cheap SNC before it will hit 1$   ",False

Quote from: Flad45 on September 05, 2017, 04:40:27 PM Quote from: Mockery on September 05, 2017, 02:55:18 PM I would never advise anyone to buy into SunContract... The parasitic mentality, of the people representing it on the HitBTC exchange is appalling... This group of pump-and-dump scam artists has done this company a grave disservice... Through this representation, your reputation will proceed you.  Damn, you definitely had a bad day. You are right, the exchanges where you can buy Suncontract are not one of the top exchanges yet. You are also right, that the pump & dumpers brought bad lights to this project. And I also would never advise anyone to buy it, because its just too speculative. But for me that coin has definitely more chances to go up than losing value. What I see is a project that is unique and not just copy pasted in several other versions like a lot of the cryptocurrencies. Actually this is the most special cryptocurrency I know. Maybe there are others but I do have concerns how the project will work in the reality. But it is more like I can not imagine it, but I still believe in it. I think renewable energy will be very important more and more. And when there is a platform where you can deal with energy my first thought is, that energy can be  used extremely effective, because if somebody produces more than he need, he just can sell it to someone other. So I just hodl my coins for at least 5 years and see what will happen. Maybe I loose the half of money or maybe I make tons of money.  We cannot control what people do on different troll-boxes and this is not our job. Our focus is on developing the product, find customers for the Platform and building strong and trustworthy community. We strongly believe we are on top of this things and will deliver a product worth trust of our supporters.",False

You are right, the exchanges where you can buy Suncontract are not one of the top exchanges yet. You are also right, that the pump & dumpers brought bad lights to this project. And I also would never advise anyone to buy it, because its just too speculative. But for me that coin has definitely more chances to go up than losing value. What I see is a project that is unique and not just copy pasted in several other versions like a lot of the cryptocurrencies. Actually this is the most special cryptocurrency I know. Maybe there are others but I do have concerns how the project will work in the reality. But it is more like I can not imagine it, but I still believe in it. I think renewable energy will be very important more and more. And when there is a platform where you can deal with energy my first thought is, that energy can be  used extremely effective, because if somebody produces more than he need, he just can sell it to someone other.

However, this will not be sole purpose of our token. SNC token can be already used for two different payments in real life. First, SNC will be accepted as payment method for Slovenian Bitcoin Association – this is huge honor for us and we are proud about it. Second, and we feel this one is real breakthrough, as from September 1st. effectively SNC is accepted as payment method for energy projects by SONCE Group which is involved in solar power plants installation and investments and also heat pump private investments. That means that one will be able to buy solar power plant and heat pumps installation and/or service with SNC token. SONCE Group already received a lot of inquires and we believe first project will occur already in September. We will keep you updated on our newsletter. We think that with this decision we show strong dedication to SunContract project and SNC future value   SNC coin will have value in real life - you could buy with it a whole solar power plant for your house.  i assume that price is going to recover soon when people will start realise how big that is and important   hint:  buy now cheap snc (it was 0.0008)  and now is (0.00015)",False

""I just wanted to say that this ambitious company has built an amazing project, and I have a lot of faith in its success. Thank you for the effort everyone has put in up to this point. I wanted to offer some advice, because unfortunately your project is garnering a bad name at the moment due to the actions of some greedy people. There was an enormous pump and dump ran on the SNC token at the HitBTC exchange. Anticipation of the news announcement created an upward movement in the price of the SNC coin. Then greedy people made all sorts of phony statements trying to artificially pump the coin up, and it worked. They took all the profits at the top, and the coin came back down. Then, the news was released and there were no major announcements, so people started panic selling the coins off. That is fair to a point I suppose. However, now there is A LOT of negativity directed at the SNC project, many are promoting false claims that the developers took the money and ran away, that the project will never be a success, etc. This is pushing the price of the coin artificially low now--this is great for late investors, but is hurting the company. It would be best to get the SNC coin to more exchanges quickly. Unfortunately Gatehub is a horrible exchange, and no one is seriously trading there, so I don't see it having much of a positive effect in restoring the faith in SunContracts and their projects. Please be careful at this early stage of the project and take the image of your coin seriously. Myself and others believe greatly in the importance of your project, and we agree with the goals you have set out for the company. It would be a very smart move to put out a press release/Twitter/Blog about any new business partnerships, meetings, new exchange listings, etc. as soon as you can to bring back trust and restore the reputation of your company. It pains me to see such important work being tarnished by a few dishonest, greedy individuals on a single exchange. I hope you all enjoy the rest of your weekend, and thanks to everyone at SunContract for having the drive and vision to build such an amazing project!""",False

Below you can find short summary of token sale campaign:  Number of ETH raised: 8,732  Value in USD: 2 millions  Number of contributors: 2,274  Total supply of SNC tokens: 122,707,503  Starting exchanges: HitBTC, GateHub  Duration of token sale: 33 days  Enabled moving of SNC tokens: NOT YET  In next days, we will start define our NEW development plans. Due to lower raised funds then predicted, we will have to adjust some of our plans. However, we will try to develop as much as we can. More will be revealed in next few weeks. Please note that it is summer vacations period so it will take us some extra time.  MOVING OF TOKENS  Right now token transactions are not enabled yet. This is due to security measures we introduced to protect our contributors. After all security checks will be performed we will enable transactions and you will be able to move your tokens. You can expect that in next few days or in max. one week time. Until then we ask you for your patience.  EXCHANGES  Right now, we can confirm that HitBTC and Gatehub exchanges will list us. HitBTC is already offering IOU tokens trading. IOU tokens should be changed to SNC tokens after we enable transactions. GateHub will offer FIAT pairs like EUR and USD.  Other exchanges will follow soon. We plan to add one bigger exchange and few smaller. All new updates regarding exchanges will be revealed on our blog and through emails.

Yes, i have heard of selling extra electricity ""back to the grid"", which generally means selling it back to the local utility monopoly, presumably at their price. If the price you sell it to them is the same as the price you buy it from them, then that seems fair enough.    If local utilities have a monopoly, why would they allow their grid to be used to sell electricity peer-to-peer at a lower cost? There is much talk of cutting out the middle-man, but they will still need to be some kind of middle man in any case, yes?   So what is going to motivate local utilities to allow you to sell electricity THROUGH THEM at either a lower, or higher price than the price they are currently offering?    Of course, they will need to be integrated with suncontracts.  Will they be receiving a ""cut"" of the action?   TIA",False

Currently you are offering bonus per 1 ETH and base price you have set as 10000 SNC per 1 ETH. This is quite shady and doesn't really give a picture of how the price is being derived. Since Fluctuation on Ether means I can buy same number of coins depending on different pricing of Ether.  Can we have some calculations here to understand the way the coins are being offered ?  More like I am focusing on Second ""T"" of your 5T and 5D policy.  Recently one coin (based on different idea) was offering its coins in a similar pattern based on coin price per 1 ETH and they fucked up really bad and potentially might end up scamming investors.

It will be easier to answer your question a month from now and even then will be far from exact. You have one picture in whitepaper how much ETH collected to do what.

First of all you say: ""you are missing the benefits which a blockchain energy pool would present. Lower costs, better efficiency ""  Do you have any proof of what you are claiming?  ""there would certainly be nothing illegal for offering a decentralised energy grid service""  Decentralised grid service is fantasy. The electric grid is controlled by a government owned company for many reason. First of all, the producers cannot use the grid as a toy. There are technical constraints to be satisfied to avoid blackouts and grid faults. This is why in the liberalized electricity market right now, the production schedule resulting from the pool has to be approved by the Transmission System Operator ( the company that controls the grid ) to make sure that the grid is not overloaded and operated safely. Secondly, in economics, the electric grid is known as a natural monopoly. It means that the cost structure of building and maintaining the electric grid is such that it tends to market concentration, because of high sunk costs and economies of scale. So the government has to regulate this monopoly to avoid one private company to make huge profits from it. The electricity grid infrastructure and decentralization are two different universes.   ""micropayments allowing real-time pay-as-you-consume bills ""  Is not clear how the market clearing mechanism will work. The whitepaper does not specify anything. Real time payments for energy imply a mechanism to determine electricity prices instantaneously while keeping the grid operation safe.",False

Why the 'magic' $1?  Do you realize 1 ETH gets you 11500SNT?  1ETH is now approx. $280 which means 1 SNT in ICO is $0,02 (your two cents lol).  This means in order to get to $1 you need x50 prices.    Let's say the supply was 100000000.  Then you would have gotten 1150SNT/ETH which is exactly the same thing.  SUPPLY DOESN'T MATTER.  It's basic maths...  edit: supply does matter when you have a huge amount of coins for example 420 billion.  When you have so much coins it's hard to get the price over 1 sats, then you have a problem.  Supply is also a problem when the stake/premine of the devs is too big",False

If we raise less then 5,000ETH then development will go slower (and of course revenue will increase more steadily) but we will keep developing it with collected fees. So we will probably develop (almost) full product but will take much more time if we do not raise more funds. Do not worry, our true marketing starts just now. We showed community with start of the ICO that we are sirious.  Quote from: lwayvo on June 29, 2017, 12:28:05 PM With 1 billion coins, it's gonna be hard to make good profits from this coin.   Any particular reason for such high supply?  The project is very interesting nonetheless and I am in.    Energy market is worth many trillions of dollars so if we raise enough for 1 billion of SNC and SNC will be 1$ worth then this is only small valuation. So this is actually nothing.

What are benefits of this pool of producesrs and consumers. If I own sun power plant how Will I be able to connect to that pool. If I own an electric car or powerwall Will I be able to use it as a grid balancer. When it is sunny I charge it from the grid and when it is cloudy or night I sell the electricity stored in it. If one day all electricity is going to be produced by alternative energy sources some kind of grid balancerrs will be needed because wind doesn't always blow and sun is not always shining. I need more information. I think the idea is good but the whitepaper is just not detailed enough for me. I invested 4 ETH in ICO, I think your project is great.  Kind regards from Slovenia  Hi, main benefit will be lower costs we will have because of blockchain. We will also have lower margins then retailers.  With time we will add new functionalities so eventually also your car could become balancer.  Solar and wind power will not be the only energy sources in the pool. We will use different resources too balance energy needs.  Regards back to you from Ljubljana   In my opinion, the government of many countries control this industry since it is very important to the safe of a country, how to overcome this problem in your project?    EU is liberalised so we already have many countries covered with reasonable legislation.

First I must say that I am a total non expert on this, but can say from first hand that it works in my house in Slovenia and in other countries in Europe too. For example I used to be loyal to the same electricity supplyer for about 20 years. Then came to the market another one with lower prices of electricity and I just simply called them and told them that I would like to be their consummer from now on. They arranged all of the papers (made a contract with me, cancelled the old supplyer), and that was it!!! Now i pay for electricity about 10% less and all I had to do was make one phone call to the new supplyer 😁. Yes as simple as that. I do not know what are the arrangements between the ones who had build the infrastructure and all the companies that are using it,but it works very well.

I also think they won't allow suncontracts to work through the grid unless they are given a cut to help with maintenance. These energy companies would surely prefer cash rather than SNC thereby complicating things further.  Can anyone offer clarity on exactly how the national grid will work with SunContract?

Different countries has different legislation and that is why we will allocate 10% of all raised money to legal matters.  1.   We never claimed that is a new idea. We just believe we are the first one that will be actually able to pull this off. Most of our team is coming from Energy sector and understands all details about how this market is working. We are trying to build energy-trading platform where producer will be able to directly sell production to final customers without the need of retailer who acts as a middleman. Clearly you copied your this post from other thread and did not even bother to check out our idea. If you would do that then I’d see we are not trying to cut out national grid. National grid will still take care of distribution and customers will still need to pay for it. The only thing we will change is connecting two opposed sites together. Other aspects will stay as they are. Why we asked you about from which country you are? Because different jurisdictions need different approach. In EU countries energy market is liberalized so governments cannot decide on how can use grid and who cannot. So again, please check our project before you call it a scam.  2.   We are developing mechanism that will neutralize volatility affect. Actually, our platform will be made in a way people without any knowledge of blockchain will still be able to use it in a traditional way. System behind platform will make it as easy as possible even to people that do not want to educate themselves about this new technology. And we strongly believe this is the right approach as we will reach all of the population.  3.   This is not true. In EU you can see there are many countries that are trying to build systems where production of electricity is localized. Take for example Germany. They are shutting down nuclear power plants and as well coal power plants and try to take advantage of solar and wind power. And those solar power units are built locally on private houses etc. We do not believe grid needs to be privatized to encourage investments into green technologies and Smart grids.  4.   Again, you are stating something that is not true. We will use existing meters and existing grid.  5.   Our entire project is NOT relying upon storage capacities and we did not state that anywhere. Maybe project stated that where you posted original post but we for sure do not thing storage would be relying point. We have solutions for energy shortages during the night and during bad weather. Keep in mind we will not use only solar power plants but also other renewables. We will also do hybrid system so we are not worried about that.  One last thing. At least we agree on something: blockchain and energy grids are great combination indeed. But here is a question to you: Why would one need to sell electricity to utility company which sole purpose is to buy cheap and sell expensive? Why would not this particular person rather take some of utility’s margin at keep it for itself and on the other end why would consumer buy electricity with high margin if end-price can be lower?  We are doing token sale because we are not big retailer company but are rather small and want to disrupt big players in energy sector. The same as Bitcoin did in financial sector.",False

Decentralization on the grid will never work for the following reason. Some of the facts could be beyond the scope for the project, but most of them apply.  Do Not Risk a Penny on this  Here is why: 1. This is not a new idea. I work for a utility company and we have been investing billions in microgrid projects. This is exactly what it is. You create a local community / local grid, where people can support each others energy demands. The only exception here is that they are creating a decentralized buying/selling system.  BUT utility companies are never going to allow this, because it does not pay to maintain the traditional grid infrastructure.  There are already laws in place for exactly this reason, that people cannot sell their electricity to other people directly.  What this company, and other similar companies like trans active grid are doing is creating a token to make that sell-buy to get around that law(which states money isn't to be used).  Here is what will happen after. Governments will realize people are trying a way around and will BAN any asset trading that would lead to violating that law. All the money invested in these companies  and their platforms will collapse.  Utility companies in the near future will be launching microgrid systems.  2. Volatility in the Token Market:  The token that the company is selling again is not real money. They will be used in the platform they are launching, which means people will be buying and selling it ultimately leading to a market for that token on an exchange.  So if I am a person in a small society looking to participate in a decentralized energy production and buying platform, I would firstly have to buy these tokens, and then sell it to meet my real life demands.  But this  token will be traded on an exchange, the price will be volatile just like bitcoin and hence a normal person would simply not be interested in such a technology due to the price variation in the tokens. Because that could mean losing money by selling to the platform as theilr sole incentive was to be informed on who they are selling to, and getting slightly higher price than selling to utility companies.   3. No Need for Decentralization on grid : Governments around the world buy electricity on smart grids at competitive prices. There is really no need for decentralization of grids except in third world countries where there are problems such as energy shortage etc. because utility companies have a monopoly and benefit by power outages.  But I predict that as smart grids evolve, companies like Tesla will take care of the buying/selling platform by offering something like Uber. But again that requires privatization of the grid.  And all the subsidies and incentives government provides are only to those selling and buying from the grid. They won't offer it for a private microgrid.  4. Smart Meters: Utility companies have started providing free smart meters to its customers. What this company intends to do is use the blockchain for accounting of the electricity produced and used. But it will require customers to install separate meters which would cost a lot. Things will go wrong, and will need to be fixed.   5. Storage: Storage is currently a big issue for solar. Installing a solar system is expensive, but installing a storage system/batteries is even more expensive. Hence most of the houses that buy solar, usually do it as to only satisfy 60-70% of their electricity needs. A lot of those houses usually do not generate an excess. This means what this entire project is relying upon i.e community buying and selling is not going to be a big thing in a neighborhood.   What I am trying to say is , that blockchain and grids is a great combination. But utility companies have already started doing and investing in it. In general there is no reason for one resident of an area to see the production/consumption of another, which means that there is no need for a decentralized electric grid system. People have meters in their home and all the data relevant to them is already transparent.  All these companies are doing great work, but I don't think a Token sale is the way to go because once the token is on an exchange, it will kill the motivation of the local resident to even participate in that purchase/sale.  What these companies need to do is find investors for a direct investment than creating an altcoin to just get more money, which I feel is the scammy part.",False

Probably market price will be affected with pairs that SNC will be traded on exchanges (BTC/SNC or ETH/SNC - we will not know that until SNC get listed).

I cant tell if it has anything to do with SunContract or is it a random project open. because everything ETH related has nothing to do with C#, I am excited to see some altcoins or smart contracts written in C# though.  Cannot say, this is my coworker that is coder which I am not hehe. But all the coding will not be done just for ETH purposes, right now we are doing also some things that are for pilot project that will be basic for platform development.

Still, it should be clear to the users. So I believe, the team can still provide much detailed video regarding this project. Some info are already in the whitepaper but the role of National Grid is not emphasized or maybe a complete flow chart will explain that. In what instances they (National Grid) are not participating in? Because there are some places that will not allow the direct negotiation with the consumers.  This is exactly what we need. The video or blog doesn't mention the role of the national grid, if they refuse to get involved in smart contracts then how do we use suncontract?  If the national grid prefer to use resellers and real money then suncontracts can't be used? I like the idea, but it seems to rely heavily on the cooperation of the national grids to succeed.

Now this question might sound utterly stupid, in India renewable industry comes under Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, means the government should be on one end of the contract as a supplier, right. And if that country has not legalised BTC or ETH, that would be tricky. This is exactly what i mentioned earlier in this thread,there will be legal issues and many paper works to be done to make this project a reality and it might take a longer time for everything to settle down because it is not that easy to get the paper works done pretty fast particularly if a government is involved,legalization of bitcoin or ETH is another chapter. I think the government will not be a bigger problem for that project because they are using this system as a way to collect funds for the project and the token is working as the shares of the investors which I think is legal for any government.  I think is there has no problem with token or shares. the energy market is very sensitive. In many countries, you have big taxes through which the state controls GDP, and they do not like a lot of innovations in this sphere especially with the decentralised market. Project like SunContract is for future, and i think 3-5 years is minimum to become applicable to me in my country there is intense need of this project. because we have too much electricity shortage and specially in summer when the temperature raise to 45+ C. the situation become more complete because of the increasing demand of electricity. i am sure that this project will be on top in my country. We hope that this project get a bigger success and this project reach to every needy country of he world for electricity. In the start I think they are limited to a few countries and then they will reach to other countries up to which I know but right now we can get the profit by participating in their crowdfunding. Yes it really need to invest in their ICO because if we will participate more in this project then this project will become more stronger financially and if they will become more stronger financially then we hope that this project will give benefit to more part of the world. I hope that this project will get their success and it is sure that this is provided for all of the world. We will get the benefit from it by two ways one by investing in this project by buying their tokens and the other benefit is that this project will reach to our country to benefit us with that technology. I agree with you, I am studying about this project from a longer time and after reading about the planning of the developers and after reading about the response of the people to this project it convinced me to take part in this project and now I am confident that this project will bring a good fortune for my finance. Not only India is the target market but other developed countries as well. Have you seen the floating solar farm of China? Which produces more than the floating Solar Farm in London. Many countries are shifting to renewable energy because they know it is better than fossil and coal energy, that is why in the long term it can be promising for this project.  We want to reach whole world and not just some parts. Whole world needs shift in electricity generation and sustainable supply",False

First of all, middlemen often do not complish their jobs without getting their bills. Uaually they are responsible for building and maintaining a huge line system to transport electricity. Profits earned by middlemen are often used to subsidize these expenses. In the ecology model of your project, where users and power producers can find their own positions, then where are the middlemen and electricity lines developers and maintainers? Without this side, your project is not likely to succeed.  Second, there is a huge difference between an electric pool and an intelligent contract, not anything that can be done with an intelligent contract. Intelligent contracts can only establish the relationship between producers and consumers, establish the relationship between payment and supply and pay, but can not ensure their complete matching, but also can not guarantee other things. Unfortunately, electricity can not be preserved, and some special and even clumsy methods have to be used to ensure the balance of power supply and demand. Therefore, the design, construction and maintenance of the power pool  is the problem.  Third, the existing power system is complex and still doesn't solve the problem well. Your project doesn't seem to have anything new to make the system better. It is not reliable to build a more complex system through an intelligent contract based on this laborious old power system, not to mention the construction of an intelligent contract that does not have large-scale applications for the time being.",False

Project like SunContract is for future, and i think 3-5 years is minimum to become applicable  Energy market had fallen to sleep. We did not see many inovations in it if we do not count in solar, wind and fusion power which are not main sources of energy. We want to show that renewable sources can be competitive and price of electricity can be lower. In some countries electricity represents only one third of total costs on the bill. Which is kind a unfair. First thing is that we need to put on decentralized platform and from there on we will build on our vision.

Because regardless if this campaign existed or not, there will still be people doing dynamite fishing, deforestation, illegal logging, or simply just polluting the whole country because of the huge factories that they have made.  SunContract was just made so we can buy energy online using the blockchain technology. What's up with all these solar panel thing?

Yes one of the purposes is to remove middleman because that area is where usually a lot of fees pops up and increase our electricity bill. With blockchain and smart contracts we believe those fees will be much lower. Of course there will still be a system but we want to lower costs of this as much as possible.  Also it is worth noting that renewable energy is becoming cheaper with its development. So we think that with our focus on that energy source our products will become even more competitive against mainstream offerings.",False

We have a team of people, who worked in energy business for a long time, have IT and blockchain knowledge and are very aware of security issues in energy, finance and crypto sectors.  The key of success is to know how energy sector is working now and where it can be improved, changed or disrupt. Blockchain supported solutions in energy sector have wide range of useful applications, but mostly they are not supported by regulations to be able to prevail.  SunContract project is oriented to the fields, where P2P energy market can be put into operation without prior regulatory changes. Such an example is a decentralized energy pool based on net metering scheme, which is adopted by regulators in many countries. Net metering is put on place to promote renewable energy sources like photovoltaic, wind, hydro and some other energy efficiency technologies like cogeneration. Merging net metering scheme with a blockchain supported services, we get completely different possibilities to provide more competitive and transparent service for consumers and producers.",False

THE 5T:   TRUST | TRANSPARENCY | TRACEABILITY | TIME STAMP | TRANSACTION     and renewable energy     THE 5D:   DIGITALIZATION | DECARBONIZATION | DEREGULATION | DECENTRALIZATION | DEMOCRATIZATION   ... to create entirely new services that will revolutionize the existing market. A decentralized energy market on the blockchain is just the first step of transforming energy distribution grid services in the future and will be followed by grid-flow optimization services, demand response services etc.   How it works   The SunContract is a platform that directly connects energy producers and consumers into an energy pool based on smart contracts. The blockchain takes over the role of the middleman as a trusted technology infrastructure. Blockchain technologies are implemented into existing energy distribution systems without previously changing the general energy regulatory framework. We already developed a pilot project for use on a national level. On April 1st, live trading with energy started in Slovenia as a first open energy market. The first customers on the SunContract platform are called Pioneers and are a valuable feedback for further expansion of services and improvement of customer experience. Expected expansion will happen in 2019 with priority in EU markets due to similar regulation across the European Union.   Vision   The SunContract's vision is to support the global self-sufficient energy community based on renewable energy by digitalization of electricity. With SNC tokens, one can buy electricity through the SunContract Energy Pool or different services already available in some countries.   Token economics   At the token sale, we issued SNC Ethereum based (ERC20) tokens. By specifying the amount of supply, we created a closed ecosystem with a finite number of tokens. SNC token is used as the only currency for purchases of energy services like electricity, solar power plants, heat pumps, IR panels etc. on the SunContract platform.      AVAILABLE EXCHANGES: Next.Exchange, OKEx, Huobi, HitBTC, KuCoin, Yobit, IDEX, Etherdelta   Change USD and EUR to SNC easily on Kriptomat   Opportunity   The energy sector is a multi-trillion $ market. Our focus will be to constantly increase the real life use cases for SNC tokens. Cutting out the retailers and diminishing the dependence on distribution service operators contributes to the competitiveness of electricity prices, which is making SunContract more attractive for customers. The volume of electricity traded in the SunContract Energy Pool will increase also by utilizing energy storage. It is an opportunity with the potential to reward all participants; the consumer is rewarded with lower costs and cleaner energy, while producers are rewarded with better compensation for the electricity they produce.
