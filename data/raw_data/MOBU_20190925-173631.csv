Because they have raised only around 27k in their public round, they are focusing now on private investors and will use the Telegram group only for important announcements from now on.  Here is the full message from them (source: https://t.me/mobuCHAT):  'ANNOUNCEMENT  As management team, we are proud to announce that MOBU has partnered with an Investment bank, called Entoro Capital from the USA. The sole purpose of this partnership is for Entoro Capital to help MOBU to reach the fundraising goals for our amazing project.  Entoro Capital made some value propositions to refine the MOBU concept and to round off this outstanding project to ensure its inevitable success.  It is a well-known fact that the fundraising model has changed significantly over the past year or so and also that a month in fintech can result in a lifetime of differences.  Another well-known fact is that 2018 has been characterized as a very challenging year for cryptocurrency projects overall.   We trust that the community will know and understand that raising capital is of the first and foremost importance to ensure success.  In these challenging times it subsequently means that in most cases the fundraising period needs to be altered and extended to reach these goals.  MOBU is therefore no exception to the rule.  Only 27k USD has been raised through the public portal from retail investors thus far. MOBU once again gives all investors the assurance that their investments are safe and secure.  MOBU also would like to take this opportunity to thank the community, airdroppers and bounty hunters for all their hard work and support.  All these efforts, patience and understanding are indeed noted and appreciated by the MOBU team.  Since the focus for the next fundraising period will primarily be on private investors, the MOBU telegram communication group will only allow for important news updates from the side of MOBU from month-end. The MOBU team however believes that all uncertainties and questions from investors’ side have been clearly clarified over the past months.  However, if any potential investors still need any clarifications, they are most welcome to contact the MOBU team at info@mobu.io  The MOBU team will therefore conclude the fundraising privately with the support of Entoro Capital and other individual private investors to ensure the achievement of MOBU’s fundraising goals and future business success!  MOBU sincerely appreciates your continued support and understanding.  Best regards The MOBU team'",False

The same report reveals that 40% of respondents reported that their organization will invest $5 million or more in blockchain technology in 2019.  There is a case to be made for why companies should be looking to exploit the massive potential Africa has as a market for blockchain innovation adoption.  In another 2018 report from Citibank, it was found that South Africa took the sixth place globally for the highest amount of bitcoin holders per capita, Kenya came in the fifth and Nigeria came in third. However, until recently, adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology across Africa has been sporadic. Nonetheless, some of the transformative use cases in the space will likely have their greatest impact on the African continent.

Real businesses wishing to raise capital by issuing security tokens will build their ICOs on the MOBU platform. MOBU creates an abstract smart contract from which all security token ICOs will be extended. The MOBU abstract smart contract will contain the code that is required by the security token ICOs to conform to the MOBU ERC20 platform and the MOB20 standard to adapt to the ideas and requirements of MOBU.  what will the project do to increase the value of the MOBU token? MOBU Referrals – Companies/Individuals referring ICO issuers onto MOBU will be rewarded in MOBU tokens which will be equivalent of one year`s revenue generated on the platform by the percentage of fees generated from the marketplace. This amount will be paid in MOBU and locked-up over a 3-year period also ensuring increase in demand and scarcity of MOBU.  Does the market have demand for MOBU token? MOBU solves a distinct problem in a multi-trillion-dollar securities market. The MOBU platform creates a set of rules that govern the issuance of compliant security tokens, and program them into smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain ensuring transparency and immutability. Its clear business model demonstrates the unique use of and demand for the MOBU token on the MOBU platform by tender users. The MOBU platform ensures competitive pricing for legal costs, smart contract design, etc. to ensure lower barriers to entry and higher profitability for investors.",False

As a whole, they seem good, but not great. Here are a few that stood out. Juan Engelbrecht – Founder/CEO. Also founded Zaber (a large South Africa crypto farm) in 2015. He spent 2 years as Director at Khalifa Capital. Has been Director at Evolve Fund Managers since 2013. Paul Pelser – CFO.  He spent 17 years as an accountant for PSP Pelsar Accountants. He has been the owner of Pregal Mining for the last seven years, Paresh Masani – Blockchain/security engineer. He spent three years as Mobile Platform Exec Director at Goldman Sachs, London. Senior Director at Thomson Reuters and ETX Capital. A total of 12 Advisors, and two are from Realstart.com, a custom software development company. At least six of them are ICO experts and three are blockchain enthusiasts.  Verdict This is an extremely attractive project andnd it looks like the hype/demand for this token is there. They already raised $3 million in the pre-sale, and are asking for just $6.5 mill more in the public sale. Being a front-runner in the cryptocurrency space has proven to be a beautiful thing. When we asked CEO Juan Engelbrecht, who is your nos 1 and 2 competitors, he named Securitize and Polymath. Polymath has a $75 million market cap.  Risks     Pretty much crickets in their GitHub. Twelve followers. -1     No MVP out yet. They provide this video of what the MVP will look like, though. -1      Non-accredited investors from the US are banned from using the platform. This is the opposite of a risk but gets a minus nonetheless. -1     Their Blockchain Engineer, Paresh Masani (Goldman Sachs and Barclays) is a stud. But the rest of the team and advisors seem pretty average. -1     At this point in time, no major exchange is going to list the security tokens birthed from MOBU. When asked about this in Telegram their CEO said, “LA token has a security token exchange division. Also, MOBU is securing equity stake in an operational stock exchange. GBAX and Tzero will also have security token exchanges available soon.” -0.8  Growth Potential     They already have a Chrome and Gold mining business signed up to tokenize through MOBU. +2     The $9 million hard cap leaves all kinds of room for gains.+3     120 million tokens is all there will ever be; 100% of them will be sold in the ICO. +1     MOBU will develop a First Forex Percentage Allocation Money Management Account and will retain 20% of the authorized tokens to put back into the development of the MOBU Platform.+2     From the company: “MOBU token will be available on most exchanges such as Bancor but have already been approved by COINEXCHANGE, CRYPTOPIA, IDEX, GET BTC, HitBTC, LIVECOIN and YoBit.net.”+2     Although most of these reviewers have lost credibility over the last year, their strong scores prove the hype train around this project is real. +2  Disposition We usually don’t cover ICOs post-pre-sale, but this one is an exception because it’s still an attractive deal. The pre-sale bonus was 25%, and if you are fortunate enough to get into this crowdsale the bonus will be 20-25% depending on how early you get in. After that, the sky is the limit for MOBU.  7.2/10  Investment Details     Symbol: MOBU     Platform: Ethereum     Total Supply: 120,000,000 (120m)     Presale: 25% bonus. ended Sept 15 Soft Cap reached     Public Sale: 5-20% bonus.

MOBU developed the MOB20 standard protocol that defines a set of commands that a security token should implement. MOBU is an ERC20 utility token and built on the Ethereum platform. MOBU’s transaction costs and speed will be the same as the Ethereum network which is almost instantaneous! The ERC20 protocol defines a set of commands that a token should implement. It is a technical specification with basic functions such as the transfer of tokens and enquiry of the balance and supply of tokens. In the past it was more complex to support trading for Token A to talk to Token B. Similar to how the $80 billion USD Ethereum platform simplified the process of launching a utility token, MOBU simplifies the process of launching a compliant security token. The MOB20 standard is the technical specification of a compliant security token and can be compared to a stamp of approval, quality or standard. If a security token is issued on the MOBU platform it will meet all the requirements of the MOB20 standard.  Hope this answers it",False

We know that a security token start-up can be a legal, technical and regulatory nightmare. MOBU is a decentralised organised ICO platform  that  facilitates  the  release  of  validated  security  tokens.  There  are  several  legal  restraints  when  a  security  token  is  considered.  When  funds  are  being  raised  for a security token a KYC/AML process, a SEC 506 C reg D approval and an FSB CIS CAT 2 licensing in South Africa are required. Every country has different requirements in legislation in terms of this. By partnering with MOBU, cryptocurrency developers will be able to navigate the process with ease.""
