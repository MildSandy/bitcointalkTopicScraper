Thanks for the expressed opinion. 100% probability of predictions can not be achieved unless you have in your hands a volume for trading, capable of ruining the market (as it was recently). And then this is no longer a prediction. As for accuracy. Our AI analyzes information from more than 100,000 social resources (including exchanges, social networks, some media), the database will expand over time. This is a very large flow of information that allows you to create a forecast for different terms. Of course, if we take a sample of individual forecasts, we can say that the accuracy is reduced. But if you take the whole mass of forecasts for all time, it will be seen that the accuracy remains approximately in the same range.

Data collection and processing occurs in real time from variety of sources in order to capture and record all relevant signals. Cryptocurrency market is quite complicated and not understandable for offline investors. It takes high level of knowledge and many years of experience in order to understand current trends. High-qualified specialists in this field are just starting to appear and their knowledge is scattered and not systemized, so it is hard to form global reliable predictions.  All information mentioned above causes difficulties for medium and small private investors in dealing with cryptocurrencies.   Our Mission  Our mission is to give any person, whether it`s an investor, an export or a novice market participant an ability to find key information, based on which it will be easier to take most relevant decision regarding the mining, buying or selling the cryptocurrency, creation of portfolios of cryptocurrencies. Cryptics will stimulate scientific research in the field of artificial intelligence, as well as contribute to the further development of the blockchain, offering an infrastructure for creating funds for small and successful trades.   http://s018.radikal.ru/i517/1708/53/aa158b18a532.jpg http://s002.radikal.ru/i198/1708/15/24650915c4d0.jpg  http://s019.radikal.ru/i624/1708/67/a4308a6d2ea5.jpg  Cryptics Token Release   Fundraising and release of Cryptics tokens is intended to finance the development of the platform, the functionality of the self-learning part of the platform based on AI, as well as the development of a decentralized system for the collection and data updates.

Due to the fact that cryptocurrency markets are very new, the factors that drive prices are coming from very different sources, so the algorithm uses the method of Artificial Intelligence (AI) such as Machine Learning (ML), and specifically Deep Learning (DL), in order to combine quantitative (e.g. prices) and non-quantitative (e.g. news) data to come with a stable and reliable prediction. The collection of data and its processing occurs is done real-time, and leads to predictions time horizons ranging from minutes to days. These predictions can be used by any customer of the CRYPTICS platform either for private purposes (personal investments), or to build a trading strategy and create a small fund on this platform.
