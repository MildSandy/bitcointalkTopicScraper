Now, you can use your card to pay for services wherever the CARD Protocol is accepted. Service providers will simply bill you by deducting your usage fees from your balance.

We are working on a set of demoable features that hooks into the Card rendering pipeline we have been working on, as well as a Git based distributed versioning work flow that is ready for the community to use. We will be scheduling a series of weekly demos starting in about 2 weeks that will walk you through various use cases of how you can leverage the Card paradigm to create decentralized applications that feels like polished web experiences, but hooks into one or more decentralized technologies underneath. Our focus is to get the top level of the experience layer right, and we will be announcing our four edges design system, which implements the common capabilities needed for Card development as a set of out-of-the-box functionalities and system services. We will walk you through what developers get out-of-the-box, and where the areas of customizations and extensions are. For those interested in the underlying architecture, we will also provide an overview of how the code works together to create this cohesive experience that could be extended to cover most of the techniques needed to decentralize the key elements of the web as we move towards a web 3.0 ecosystem.

I'd say that there is ample evidence Cardstack is not a scam, since there would be no reason to continue developing and making improvements if that were the case.  Regarding staying within the token sale price, that's a bit unfair. The token sale price was set back when the market was still in a good place. The team has no control over the price once it is on secondary markets, that WOULD be manipulation and is very illegal. That is the unfortunate risk of contributing to a token sale, there is no guarantee that the price will be the same or better.  However, your argument that the team should have waited to release the tokens does have merit, and it was hotly debated. In the end, the team had made a commitment to unlock the tokens by a certain time, and without a very good reason it would have been irresponsible to delay further.",False

The interoperability of all these disparate blockchains is an ever-present question facing the usefulness of blockchain, and while some have tried to connect blockchains, Cardstack suggests a different approach.  Its system represents individual dApps or platforms as cards, and users can create custom business flows or services for themselves, by stacking different “cards” on top of one another or in a certain order.  This open source framework is catching fire with developers who recognize its potential to scale blockchain for the mass market. The media is abuzz with rumors of new “Super dApps” spurred by the existence of platforms like Cardstack, which create the idea of “software orchestration”. Such a concept has a pertinent place in blockchain’s future and is likely to gain momentum in the coming years.  https://www.forbes.com/sites/yoavvilner/2018/09/29/9-blockchain-and-cryptocurrency-companies-all-set-for-2019/",False

The industry-leading pilot program enables record labels and publishers to form a collective truth about their media assets using a distributed ledger, ensuring metadata about ownership rights and representation remains up to date and is permanently associated with recorded media wherever it goes. The platform will manage an initial collection of 5,000 tracks under WMG.  The Cardstack Framework allows the correlation of the metadata and media files to be bundled as a version-controlled repository using our Git plugin. Using our Card Flow workflow UI, participants can submit changes and updates to these bundles, which can then be viewed, edited, approved, and/or denied by counterparties. The complete record of metadata submissions and amendments is tracked via a permissioned ledger running on Hyperledger Sawtooth — which can be searched and viewed by anyone using Cardstack’s search engine plugins.  We applaud dotBC and Warner Music Group for taking this important step toward creating a modern media rights infrastructure for the music industry — and we’re excited to be a part of this groundbreaking implementation of blockchain for solving real world problems.

We would ask you to remember that Cardstack does not have any direct control over secondary markets, and the best thing they can do to support the price is to provide solid utility for the token itself. The team very much does care about the early contributors and supporters. You might be interested in this message with some of the things the team has been focused on.   Quote A lot of the development at Cardstack has shifted to the front-end, so we can build up a catalog of reusable cards that can be placed within a Card Space authoring environment and embedded as part of Card Flow workflows. This work is current happening in a private repository on Github called cardstack/deck (as in a deck of cards). When the code is ready for public review and to solicit broader developer contributions, we will open source this repository of front-end code so developers can learn to create new card-based UI that can communicate with the Cardstack Hub RESTful services (repo already public at gitub.com/cardstack/cardstack).  Many of these cards being developed inside the deck repository will be leveraged on the new, yet-to-be released Cardstack.com. For security reasons, we do not plan to open source the code for the main website, but will instead publish simplified example web sites/apps with tutorial on how to leverage the deck of cards in custom web apps. These sample apps will be open sourced soon after cardstack.com is relaunched with this front-end codebase. Across the entire Cardstack project, we currently have 12 developers working on the codebase everyday.",False

There have been mistakes along the way, that is true and also not unusual. But the team has worked hard and continues to correct and fix them. One thing that many people point to as a large factor for the low token price is unlocking the tokens with no official exchange listing. Here's a bit of background from Jacqueline Thong, Head of Operations, on what happened with that and why the decision was made to unlock still:  ""I want to give you a little background: Through one of our advisors, we arrived at a listing and co-marketing agreement with a popular centralized exchange to list CARD upon unlocking. At the last moment before the schedule time of unlocking, they reneged on their offer. As we had previously announced the date of unlocking, we felt we needed to keep that commitment to the community and proceed with a more gradual approach. We will prepare a more detailed write-up on this in the future, but we are still in discussion with them to try to get them to keep their commitment to list CARD.  In parallel, our team and our advisors have continued pursuing both well-established exchanges as well as up-and-coming exchanges with innovative incentive models. While we satisfy the listing criteria given our compliant token model and TGE process, many of the bigger names now require an exceedingly high-level of community engagements to list, whether it is through token-based voting, new account creations, or minimum deposits.

My plan was to buy some at ico and some after as it’s not an Ian Balina all star type project  based on certain things.  Like I said I’ve suggested things and will  see how that goes some may even not be looked at for a year or so.  Maybe look at your business and see how cardstack could be applied hope it all works out for us all,False

As we mentioned in the previous messages, some of these opportunities will require community participation to come to fruition. We have completed the preliminary qualification work for Cardstack Token to be included in a round of voting for a Top 10 exchange (details to be announced by the end of this week). Once we get confirmation that the voting page is live, we will point our community to the voting URL via an announcement message here on Telegram. We hope to have your support to show the strength of the Cardstack community and allow us to expand the reach of the CARD token ecosystem.  In other news, Chris will be returning to Beijing this week to be interviewed by both mainstream tech journalists as well as a crypto influencers with broad reach into the chinese-speaking audience. The community in the greater China area accounts for, by some measure, as much as 80% of the volume in the crypto world. It is important that they are aware of what Cardstack’s value propositions are as we make CARD tokens more available through more places. We will continue this PR and marketing push through our Beijing-based partner to distribute new developments through trusted media channels. Our English-speaking Telegram channel will also get these updates on a much more regular basis going forward.  We will also be releasing a technology roadmap next Monday of the planned work through the end of the year. As we wrap up a major phase of development around our new general-purpose indexing engine, our focus will now shift to shipping end-user accessible applications that show how Cardstack software will work in daily workflows. These apps and the underlying plugins will of course be open sourced, so they simultaneously serve as example codebase for external developers to learn how to integrate their dApps into our data fusion, or indexing and query layer, in the Cardstack Hub. After we release the updated roadmap, Chris will be doing an AMA with the community to answer any outstanding questions you may have.""",False

In nature, a healthy ecosystem is a combination of elements — organic or inorganic, wet or dry, living or dead — that interact in intricate ways to sustain life. When an ecosystem is functioning well, one barely notices the mechanisms that keep the circle of life going. It is when conditions suddenly change — due to the introduction of a predatory species, a shock in the freshwater supply, or a contagious disease spreading through a population, for instance — and the ecosystem stops working well that one understands how it functioned before and considers how it may function better in the future.

One is to build the foundation first, and then build the use cases next. That's Cardstack's approach. The other one is to find a narrow slice, and then build all the components but in a one-off basis. The second approach is more similar to what Augur just released, which is a full-stack dapp that only does prediction markets. The Cardstack platform matched Augur's platform almost one-to-one (node, docker, indexing DB, smart contract and electron app). Our approach is that we are extensible in every layer, so developers don't have to spend 3 years to build something like Augur from scratch, but use our stack to customize only the layer they need to change and re-use the modules we already have. To show the developers can do this in a month or so, you will see a lot of features released from Cardstack as demo apps on key use-cases we are working on.",False

Good question here, as Cardstack basically aims to provide 'real time environment' experience for users, who don't necessarily know what a blockchain is and how does one work.  Let's say you want to create a blog about something and you'd like to be able to organize social activity and receive rewards there. You might go a traditional way and choose a particular service like Facebook to reach out to a large audience, then post articles on Steemit to get paid and repost articles on your page. OR, you might use Cardstack's card and set up everything in one place and the system will refer to FB and Steemit for you. So you would just care about posting quality content and not about technical side of things.  Another example would be that you want to sell a car. The person interested in your car is in other town and can only communicate via calls/text/video. You might use What'sApp/Telegram/Viber for negotiations, then you'll need legal support to create a contract, after that your counterparty will have to buy Bitcoin/Ethereum/Other token, or arrange a fiat transfer (also they and you will need to manually report to the tax authorities). OR you might use a specific card for Real Estate selling in Cardstack and the protocol will let you and your counterparty concentrate only on price negotiations, while all the technical stuff is handled for you.  Have you checked the deep dive to Cardstack with Chris? If not, let me recommend this to you, you will find answers to many questions in there and understand the concept of the project a lot better: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w8YUXg0NTQ&t=3950s.

Cardstack is a deeply technical project, so it might be confusing. Cardstack is not a chain, it's dApp, orchestrating various services on the internet, including blockchains. As a result, the team doesn't ever need to launch its own main chain. Regarding competitors, only Block Apps coming to my mind, but please keep in mind that Cardstack team has been out there since 2014, they've spent around 3 years on the development.  Hope this helps.

The following is from the Team on why this happened (https://t.me/cardstackupdates/76):  Thank you to all who submitted KYC applications during our whitelist registration period which ended on Sunday May 20th.  Quote We’ve received a remarkable quantity of applications, greatly exceeding our initial projections. Our automated process successfully screened out clearly fraudulent applications, which comprised only a small percentage of the applications received. We now have a backlog of thousands of legitimate applications that we need to manually review as required by Swiss regulations. Since you all spent a lot of time and care to prepare the required documents, we feel it is our responsibility to the community to review each and every one of the submitted applications.  Even with a team of 10 that has worked tirelessly to review documents since the start of the KYC period, it would take us more than the next 48 hours to be able to go through each application and arrive at an (approved or denied) decision based on the KYC criteria.  After discussion with our team and our advisors, we are updating the TGE start date to Thursday, May 31, 2018 13:00 CEST (Zurich) to accommodate the large amount of applications. Based on acceptance rates, we should be able to project and announce the individual caps for Batch C by Monday, May 28, 2018. For early Cardstack supporters, you will also receive notification of your individual caps which will be higher as a symbol of our appreciation. We will be updating the TGE dashboard to reflect this information in the next twelve hours.  We know how eager you are for the TGE to commence.

The answer is yes. We currently deploy ridiculous amounts of GPU hash power for proof-of-work calculations, but the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) functions like a simple, slow CPU.  This is by design. But it means the network gets choked by games like CryptoKitties. And it’s freaking people out.  Scaling solutions like sharding or off-chain payment channels speed up peer-to-peer payments. But if we want blockchain to live up to its biggest promises, we need a solution that can coordinate large ecosystems with diverse governance models, managing huge numbers of actions all happening at once.
