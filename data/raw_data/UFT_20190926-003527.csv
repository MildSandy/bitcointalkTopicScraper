We are glad to announce you our ufoodo project. We are a group of 5 newcomers from Germany. As students, we are aware that we can't score with 20 years of experience each. But everyone has to start building his reputation. So with a lot of engagement, we make sure that in 10 years ufoodo will be for all of us a successful reference. We truly believe in our skills, in the Blockchain technology and the mindset/ philosophy behind decentralization. That's why we worked hard to develop a concept that can bring the Blockchain technology and our ufoodo Token into the mainstream, creating a fundamental value while providing advantages for everyone. We are strongly supported by our professor and due to a lot of positive feedback for our project and vision, we are also negotiating to cooperate with universities for research projects. With the combined passion and knowledge of our team members, the support of our advisers we are sure that we can make this project successful.  Even if we believe in our potential and the potential behind ufoodo, we can‚Äôt expect trust by our public community. Therefore, we are more than pleased about the recently released concept of DAICO by Vitalik Buterin. The model of DAICO perfectly fits in our vision and moreover, it is no longer necessary to be trusted from the beginning. The model places more power and authority in the hands of our community of contributors. They are able to build a community consensus on how much funds a project receives in a given period like monthly. It will offer us a reasonable monthly budget and it can be raised later, as we exhibit competence in the way of how we use the funds.  Since it is important to us to provide transparency for the community, please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions!  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ""Our mission is to establish cryptocurrencies in millions of people‚Äôs everyday lifes""  What is ufoodo? For more information please read our Whitepaper  Ufoodo is a non-profit food delivery service with its aim to revolutionize the on-demand delivery service branch. With the help of the Blockchain Technology and the therefore created payment method, the ufoodo Token (UFT), ufoodo creates a decentralized ecosystem which should equally serve the clients, restaurants and couriers. The platform directly connects clients, restaurants and a courier pool and allows to interact between the different parties. The Blockchain or rather the uChain-protocol ensures a safe autonomous process and a transparent payment processing for restaurants and couriers. As a result of eliminating the middleman, ufoodo is able to provide the delivery of qualitative food from the favorite restaurants of the clients, whereas the profit stays where it has been created.   Immense potential: Today‚Äôs popular on-demand food delivery services firstly appeared in 2013 and enjoyed a hyper-growth since then. By targeting the rising food delivery market ufoodo has the enormous potential of being used on weekly or even daily base by thousands of people worldwide, surpassing the dominating purely speculative role of common crypto currencies by integrating the ufoodo token into people‚Äôs everyday life.  Problems of today's services: Despite of the boom of the new (on-demand) delivery services they get in public critique. A lot of restaurants fight with high commissions (about 20-30%) and the couriers complain about exploitative working conditions and bad salary. Despite of their rapid expansion the established players limit their growth on the largest cities, excluding wider parts of potential customers.   Ufoodo Ecosystem Ecosystem  Operative process: In the order and delivery process a direct peer-to-peer connection of all participated instances with a safe payment transaction and delivery handout will be established. The part of an expensive agent is unnecessary. The participants in this process (restaurants, couriers and clients) are our focus and are value creators and earning contributors.  Decentral Growth: With the concept of Digital Decentral Franchise users can develop new delivery areas by their own, by recruiting restaurants and couriers and cover local administrative tasks. The recruiting and franchise contracts periodically distribute recruiting commissions and rewards for administrative tasks. So, with minimal effort a global decentralized growth can be enabled.  Governance: Every user, courier and restaurant owner can participate in the global board and in the delivery area specific local board. In these boards policy, features and projects are discussed and elected. Each board decides over a budget pool, which depends on their local area revenues. In the interest of all groups, the area specific delivery costs, wages, and the distribution of the budget pool to submitted projects are elected democratically.  Development: In a project oriented open source development, users can push new developments and can submit a project proposal on the local or global level. The respective board can vote for marketing campaigns, new features, etc. and can allocate a corresponding budget.
