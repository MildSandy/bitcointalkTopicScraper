There were restrictions for Americans to buy Waves a few years ago during ICO, maybe this will be once more restricted because of VST.  It is self explanatory that America will not adopt a crypto by Russia. It is a Sovereignity issue.  Stellar is an Americanized version of Waves, and crypto industry is already divided into privatized domestic versions similar to search engines and social media.  Marquise $Museum is using WAVES because it is a piece of Russian engineering marvel. Waves is the most progressive diplomatic invention to come from Russia in decades, it is very good for Russia so they should be careful to not sabotage this beneficial prospect.  It is better if they instead of launching VST, buy waves in open market up to 40-60% majority stake and remain as passive owners in case of wide spread future adoption.  It seems this moderate style of control is not in their taste. VST is also censorship permitting so all projects there are vetted before approval.  A fully censorship permitting crypto issued by Sweden for example, would never be trusted by the people because why choose an autocratic model for the future if they can choose a free model for the future?  Governments of course understand this hard reality and crypto is a huge problem, like a hydra with many heads, impossible to kill, better to subvert.  Society would be divided over night with a government issued crypto, it can lead to civil unrest and possibly armed conflict.  Governments must use underhanded methods of infiltration and astroturfing and it is working so well, it is so easy to make investors and inventors fold, always were very easy to influence and control this class even in world war 2 with scientists switching sides all the time and mass propaganda for the people.  The strategic challenge is not against a mainstream of inventors or investors who are easily controlled, private money by large corporations will be a bigger rival to governments.  These companies are unarmed so it is only a small problem for now. I am sure super computing ""weather simulators"" inside mountains and military bases are very busy with statistical modeling of economic geo strategy based on crypto data set input.  If VST integration is stopped, I think waves will go to $200 because Russian military must then buy all waves in open market.  Because if they don't, they will be far behind in new economy, and no investor will trust something that they issue themselves. WAVES is Russias best option to win control and influence in new economy.",False

This is what will happen in our next major release, which we are calling ‘Waves 2.0’. This is currently in the research stage. Further details about this release will be published in Q4 2019.  – Will there be a VST and WAVES merger?  We do not plan to merge these tokens. We are starting development of both Waves Enterprise and Waves Platform networks in a such a way that they will become sidechains for each other, and they will interact with each other via a special protocol.

Unless you are staking, you will not benefit from a higher supply. Lets say someone stores their tokens on a Ledger and keep it long term as an investment. Now supply is increased through a higher stake reward. This means that the price per Waves will decrease as that is how crypto economics works. The person holding it on the Ledger, or any other wallet, will have their investment devalued. In order to maintain value, the person will have to stake their tokens to at least get more tokens.  The article mentions ""The use of a Proof of Stake consensus algorithm leads to some WAVES being withheld from circulation in full nodes. Similarly, some tokens are withheld because of leasing, and with the arrival of sidechains yet more tokens will be locked up and removed from circulation."" The introduction of higher rewards and increasing supply will therefore increase the problem with more people withholding tokens by locking them up in staking nodes to not devalue their holdings.  I cannot see any benefit with increase in rewards. it seems like a short term ""solution"" to increase interest in Waves in the short term. Why not rather wait until it becomes clear that there is a real problem. Currently the problem is only a perceived one as the writer of the article uses the words ""Ultimately, this may prove unsustainable"". Why make this change on something that may happen. The only know issue that will materialize out of this is that the price of Waves is going to the gutters and the whale holders will increase their holdings even more as they will get the most of the increase rewards.  I would much rather prefer if the team ramps up adoption and usage so that circulating token supply becomes a real problem. There are way enough tokens already in supply. A shortage of token supply would in fact cause an increase in the price of Waves which would create much more interest in the token than getting more tokens in the short term.",False

Max supply should remain unaltered, it is better to increase fees to cover reward increase. Or in combination.  Inflation is a zero sum game because the reward is offset by discounted price appreciation due to increased supply.  Liquidity is not a problem for waves because it is divisible to many decimals.  It is better for community to vote on max supply increase, all the coins I invested in 2018 went to -99% because of staking dumps in exchanges. Although their annual inflation was over 100%.  Bitcoin is well known to increase in value after halvings because supply inflation is decreased, similarly, price demand of waves will have no effect if the reward is dependent only on supply inflation, then it is not a real incentive for professional investors.  On the contrary, 5% is not much, and bitcoin is a healthy market maybe partially because of block minting emission rate by miners, who knows. Perhaps it is good for waves.  Waves is not bitcoin, they behave differently and with different use case.  There are other more pressing issues with waves demand at the moment, and that is VST integration with Waves in 2021, it will lead to increased supply from 100 million to 1.1 billion because VST will do everything that waves can do now. This is Russian government who are invading this decentralized space, it is very bad.  Waves market cap should be determined from supply of 1.1 billion because VST cloning. So the value is actually 1.1 billion at $1 and this can go to $0.1.  ******  Marquise $Museum has two types of reward models for users:  1. Top 100 Rich list airdrop (reward depending on stake amount, total 5% of profits divided on 100 wallets) 2. Profit airdrop from cryptobook sales (10% fixed reward, only for top 100 wallets)  Both of these rewards are depending on external drivers of revenue through book sales and do not rely on increasing supply of $M-2 which is non reissuable.  All the big investors on waves platform only invest in non reissuable coins and there is agood reason for this, so that supply is reliable.  So, the way that $M-2 is airdropped at an annual rate of 15% is like this:  1. Company has founders fund to enable supply distribution and airdrops, currently 22% of max supply 2. External users can buy into this founders fund for cryptobook redeem rights, price is $30k per book/a few million $M-2 depending on price which is flexible at this stage 3. It is the revenue generated from these certificate sales that is redistributed through market buybacks or $M-2 airdrops to rich list wallets  If I simply minted new coins and airdropped them without any real backing of revenue profit, and say this is 5% staking reward, price will dump because it is Air. Maybe Waves can be renamed to Air.   ******  However, Waves does have a valid revenue model with exchange fees, but it is for some reason not used properly. Let waves company have a maker fee of 0.1% of all transactions, and then redistribute half to stakers and let this be the 5% reward.  Now team can be incentiviced to build volume on the dex which will result in greater demand for staking (thus increased buying of waves) and profit for the company.  The staking is then centrally controlled, perhaps this is the price to pay for this type of implementation.  If Waves is suddenly generating profit for itself and for investors, then we can begin building a valuation matrix based on future expected revenue.  This valuation matrix is founded on active users and daily exchange volume. If Waves dex can become top 50 exchange, daily volume could be $200 million of which 0.1% is normal fee in centralized markets such as Binance.  This is $72 million annual profit and at P/E 30 it values Waves to $2 billion simplified.  Another method of backing the 5% reward is by increasing cost of issuing new tokens from 1 waves to 50 or 100.  BNB coin is top performing crypto of 2019, it is a popular model for crypto space and good timing for waves to join this revenue model.  In order to grow this business model, waves can onramp fortune 500 on their dex with issuance of private money. This eco system will be the first of its kind and waves platform can then become a new form of decentralized NASDAQ index.  For reference, NASDAQ's daily volume is $90 billion and with 0.1% transaction fee waves would have a market cap of 1 trillion USD if 100% market share.  VISA is $30 bn per day.  Considering Waves competitive position in the crypto sphere, 10% share equivalent in both these sectors is attainable easily, thus market cap of $100 to $200 billion USD.  It is $200 on VST integration and $2000 on Waves 100 million original max supply.  When crypto infrastructure is adapted with neural networks powered by 8 billion user devices, there will be an economic boom comparable to industrial revolution, with GDP growth from $80tn annually towards 1 quadrillion. Crypto is a singularity facilitator, the atlas of the global brain. Thousands of times more powerful than all supercomputers combined. Once the brain is in place, automation can follow with the building of robots.  NASDAQ & VISA can never attain this level of evolution because USD is not programmable currency, it is analog.",False

The problem is that crypto is a short term game and the whales will vote whatever brings them the biggest profit in the short term. If they can quickly score larger stakes with their big wallets they will vote for it and then dump the stakes on the market. Holders will probably move on before 2021. I am still trying to figure out why Waves dropped from 18000 to 9000 in just a few weeks, but is probably because people are pricing in the future supply side. When the proposal is voted in (and it will most probably be voted in by the whales) then everyone should move their tokens to staking to protect their holdings or move out of Waves and move back in later when the price has dropped a lot.",False

This is why VST is x10 times more supply than waves.  Everything about this is clearly written in the articles, did no one read them?  The only question that remains is that one article says two will become one new native coin, and the other article says that these coins will not be merged at all.  Ivanov was paid $120 million and he could not refuse this partnership because there may be problems for him legally otherwise...He was hotel jumping and then got intercepted, this is very easy for FSB operatives to find him.  It is nothing strange here, this is typical how governments behave and there is not only bad news because Russian oligarchs and Putin is capital strong and can influence price alot to attract significant userbase.Most normal people will use this anyway, they don't understand anything about money and power.  All the early investors who have coins now, will probably be rich, but the price to pay is that the old centralized system still is in control.  But atleast, they cannot print new currency unless max supply is changed in the future. And because they have 90% majority stake, they can now decide everything with voting.  The reason why Russia is early in this industry is because of international economic sanctions, it is a problem for their lackeys to hide capital around the world now because of international treaties.  None of the top coins are decentralized, NEO is china, Binance - China, NEXO - Goldman, CMC - Goldman, Bitcoin is same rich people and governments as before.  This industry stopped being decentralized years ago in 2017 with bittrex subversion by American Government through KYC implementation.  It was very easy to contact developers and demand that they follow the rules of their military commanders, because these developers are unarmed.  I already proposed a mobile militia currency to counteract this subversion, like flash mob but on a more advanced level. So when these things happen with government blackmailing, the mobile militia can intervene and protect devs.  Crypto is a big problem for fiat central banks, they lose all power without their money. So they try to do something smart and fool everyone, but it is obvious how their game works.  Russian, China, US and EU will have separate interests and stakes in different chains, similar to baidu, vkontakte, facebook and so on. Waves/Vst can become Russias main entry into blockchain, perhaps there will be some local cryptos for national and municipal election tampering and so on, but the mother chain for all these could be Waves/Vst because no investor will put money into something that is obviously controlled by Kremlin or Central banks. So they use the back door method of subversion.  Did someone think that these century old super powers would simply disappear because of crypto? This is soft power of influence, there are alot of bad things that can happen if there is a shift towards use of traditional force, such as civil wars and mass criminalization and persecution of investors who do not follow the rules. In their mind, this method that is used here with VST, is like diplomacy. They take all - business as usual.  There cannot be a decentralized merchant and retail adoption because this is brick and mortar stores subject to border control and domestic law enforcement. These wealthy businesses have no where to run or hide from governments while still making money.  Global market cap over $1tn requires government control because the capital influx will be fueled by retail and merchant onramping with crypto/crypto payment gateways within 12 months.  Decentralization is a pipe dream of crypto anarchists and they can have their privacy masternode sandbox at a far corner of crypto space, but mainstream will always follow the herd. It is the people who choose this Neo Feudal model of society for 21st century due to passivity and compliance. Everyone gets out, the effort that is put-i-n.",False

Unless there is a lot of effort and a solid purpose there will be no value. Lots and lots of tokens on all the chains I mention are worthless now.

The same, can be realized, for example - for changing the invalid name of the token, change the ticker (if already exist).

Transfer to another wallet, without any comissions. Maybe, this can be realized, if issuer can pay comissions for all transfers of his tokens.

Something, like a rebranding...    I see also, on this picture, you wanted to add off-chain messaging. Is this already realized? This is good idea! You can add something, like BitMessage and open the way to write some messages - for the address owner. This will be better, than using a special token ""Read Attachment"" to do the on-chain messaging.  Maybe, you can using ECC (Elliptic-Curve-Cryptography), and maybe, this is assymetric cryptography. That means, you can encrypt messages by pubkey (or address), and allow to decrypt this messages only by the owner's priv_key. In this case messages - will be encoded as a points, on the Montgomery-elliptic curve. But... Not address using for encrypt messages, and pubkey must be published to using ECC. This is not secure, because maybe, can be provided the attack to solve discrette-logarithm. So, I think, will be better to generate another, empty address, to do messaging, and associate this address with the main address in blockchain, using the transaction ""type=data"". Also, there is possible to using TOX, and TOX_id can be attached to the address, also, using the transaction with ""type=data"".

The fact of the matter is that this environment is under strong centralization by different strategies of infiltration to present an appearance of remaining unfiltered as it became known for.  BTC and the top 5 are entirely subverted and only reached these positions because they are already infiltrated by the establishment.  If you have a project that is independent, you have nowhere near the opportunity to reach this level of exposure because it will destabilize the status quo. Then, if you sell your share for penny on the dollar, then you are welcome on the inside because it is the same elite who will be raking in the profits.  Situation was definitely different in 2014 because the environment was unrestricted, now, all value extraction has been stamped out by gatekeepers who hate this invention because they understand that ultimately it will radically overturn the current and corrupt system.  China = Binance Bittrex = CIA CM = Goldman NEXO = Goldman NEO = China WAVES = Soon to be Russia by VST integration  The list is endless, and it is the same 3 powers behind most coins in the top 10.  If you are a genius dev, of course you will become rich in crypto, but for normal projects it is a hard environment to constantly go up against establishment gatekeepers that are like weed now.  Marquise $Museum was integrated with crypto because if you are an artist who want to find sales channels and expositionl then you must also become a communist lefty. Unless you are a top 0.1% of world talent who can automatically attract collectors, only then may you decide how to operate your business more freely. Look at Chapelle, he servied the fashion industry for decades and was all but forgotten in Hawaii when someone in the inside invited him back to exhibit worldwide in the best galleries. This can only happen because 1. he was top talent photographer. 2 he served the cause (communism).  Crypto was once unfiltered for startups and a very promising method of raising money for all kinds of things, but this was radically subverted by criminals and sock puppets in little less than a year. It requires a solid methodology to be successful in this space, but now even with proper documentation it is not possible to be approved by bettertokens for qualified issuer status because they decided so, ie centralized gatekeeping. Bettertokens did not even exist as a unit when Marquise $Museum was launched way back in late 2017. It is a joke, but it is an expensive joke for my project.  If this was 2016, $MM would already have CMC integration and qualified issuer status, bad timing is all, too late.  Remember, this is crypto, this invention was given away freely from the unknown creator. Can you see how incubated startups and university projects are completely controlled if the military can do this to a tech that was not even in their control from the beginning. It took them a year to subvert key sectors in crypto.  And if you refuse to cooperate? AK-47 to the face.",False

It took some time to prepare the IEO price of $M-II but now raised 3000 dollars in 24 hours based off 2/3 of supply with another third in reserve for liquidity and cryptobook cycling.  If you are a new project with some real use case, it is very likely that you will be able to raise a small amount of capital here and importantly get exposure to thousands of rich people by using the automatic airdrop service from read tokens which have their own telegram where you can place orders. Airdrop to 5000 active users cost only 4 waves and then the amount of your token that should be included to each receiver.  New projects should have these things in order before launching:  1. User friendly website, perhaps on squarespace, and bitcointalk and twitter or other social media with detailed updates 2. Original White paper 3. Good product presentation 4. Token economics calculated before public offer 5. Regular weekly airdrops with 5 cents or more sent to each user on this platform so that they can feel that it is worth something to use your projects token 6. Non reissuable token 7. Bounty for token upvotes on tokenrating to get your project 4 stars or more, all voters should receive airdrops for voting as long as needed as an incentive to upvote your project 8. Complete logistics chain to produce and deliver your product or service  Waves can become a perfect platform for Fortune 500 companies who want to migrate to blockchain and already have customer base and services available. It is enough if only 1 big player like Rolex enter this market for this coin to go parabolic $200 or more. It is much easier to use than XCP or ETH and it offers much more detailed token tracking through pywaves compared to Stellar.  There is no other platform in the world where you can advertise your product for 4 dollars to thousands of wealthy users. CPM on wall street journal digital ads is hundreds of times more than on Waves. CPM on google adwords is similarly order of magnitude more expensive considering this ultra targeting that is available on waves.  Projects can include tailored messages with token airdrops which means this is like twitter but much more interactive, like stocks where you can send a message to all traders and advertise your stock.  So this is like a combined twitter and product platform for selling services and merchandise, it only takes some trigger to be at $20 billion market cap and I belive that streamlined Dex UI (it's already very good since the recent updates), coin sorting by volume fin tabs, community qualified voting instead of bettertokens (which is centralized), spreading the use case of waves through partnership invitations with fortune 500 or small businesses, making pywaves like wavescap UI, increasing price of token minting from 1 waves to 50-100 to remove spammers and make it more upscale, marketing the platform to upscale businesses in general. widgets with 1 click trade button integration so new users are onramped easily.  Waves is already partnering with gaming industry and the team should have a look at game lobby UI's for inspiration here, it's very suited for gamification and there is some gambling games already. Casino UI's are also a good match here.  Waves itself is maturing from the founders phase which is heavily text and code based, to the early adopter phase which is more user friendly adapted. The critical turning point here in market valuation is when the already present but hidden value, is revealed to the public through UI streamlining and marketing. There are many exotic tools here that simply does not exist anywhere outside crypto but people do not understand how they function, and when they see the and understand use case the value will explode.  My project went from A to Z on waves in 1 year so I have a complete overview of the status here at a crucial timing aswell so looking forward to retiring wealthy by this valuation error of Waves which probably occurs once every decade. I have seen a few during my 15 years in stocks, it doesn't happen often like this. Been hoarding alot of coins. Bought ETH at $7 in april 2016, similar situation.  All first time buyers should research what waves is before going all in, I would advise a few thousand dollars depending on your equity level.

It is completely counter productive to have a centralized review board in a decentralized industry. It is suffocating all value potential of this free space which until recently remained without gatekeepers. Bettertokens have proven twice now to invent new rules for projects that want to become more streamlined with regulations, for example, it is not possible to improve white papers according to BT specifications after they have reviewed your project one time, even if there is a professional legal team who are standing by to implement the improvements like in our case. I have email messages to prove how BT is attacking independent projects that are not part of the elite agenda. It's the same with CMC by the way, owned by Goldman Sachs. Does anyone know what happened to the Bitcointalk user who created CMC? He's not been active here for a long time...  - Do not mix VST with waves, because VST is owned by russian military industrial complex and they have no authority in the crypto space, which is also why we are creating a decentralized world, to combat war makers and counterfeiters. The world in the 21st century has ONE chance with this, it can become a complete dystopian future, or a prosperous and free and equal future for everyone when it is integrated with AGI in the coming decade. Do not let yourselves be blackmailed by outdated power systems who understand that they will soon be out of business because their model is 100% corrupt and everyone already knows it at this point. This goes for both the west and the east. People want their own Sovereignity now, and crypto is the enabler and I have never seen any invention under attack by the establishment like I have seen in crypto since mid 2017.  Most technological inventions are incubated in ivy league universities under careful guidance by military professors who are also darpa operatives as in the case of America. Or VC firms who are embedded with this community of the military industrial private sector.  This millenia old hunter gatherer tribe that we simply know as ""elite"" is facing insurmountable challenges with the crypto invention because there is not a single attack vector.  I will bet my last satoshi, that the smart token scams on waves were coordinated by the very same operatives in order to promote Bettertokens as a solution. This is standard tradecraft but this model of influence is transparent and outdated in this new world of decentralization.  There are images of Vitalik when he launched Ethereum, surrounded by parasitic bankers from Sweden and other countries, dispatched by their respective governments who wanted to get close to him in order to apply influence and pressure on him. For them, it was a blessing that ETH did not scale properly and possibly never will. However, this was the beginning of dev targeting for projects including waves, they always strike at the weakest spot, and in crypto it is the devs and that is why some projects use aliases and privacy measures to protect against this military elite that is controlling and corrupting everything in society and implementing a totalitarian rulership through systems like the SIS Interpol border control surveillance and sharing program.  I predict that this community will not survive and that crypto will become subverted by the military because most here are only after profit and are not used to conflict on this level. This is soft targets and the masses you can forget about them, they are eternal enablers of further restrictions on liberties inorder to feel safe against a sock puppet boogey man who is also controlled by the military (remember CIA cocaine scandal in the 80's, read about those Compton Gangsters who was supplied by agents, it's all the same today).  This is not my battle, it is Waves team who themselves must do something about this situation. I can perceive what is happening here and it is unfortunate, but you are not the only ones who were targeted like this. Bittrex was coopted way back in 2017 and that was the beginning of this crisis. People deserve to know, and that is why I am forwarding this publically, and also because my project was now a victim of Bettertokens and by extension, the status quo elite.  If nothing is done about this situation , I would advise the community to fork waves into a second dex controlled by the community while excluding the coopted factions.  There may also be a pump of VST/WAVES to $200+ by the military using counterfeit cash to gain supply control and monopolize the userbase. Russia is sanctioned by the UN as we all know so this is one of many method to circumvent those sanctions.  My team was already advised that even if we clear the 116k waves stock in $M-II/WAVES pairing, Swedish banks may not authorize withdrawal to domestic bank accounts in fiat. So it's a big problem because I don't like tax shelters in banana republics.  ",False

Suspicious tokens are hidden within your Wallet tab by default, to make them visible by using a mobile phone, you need to navigate to Profile > Network > Spam Filtering (Switch off) and you will see them in your Wallet tab down below. Speaking about Desktop & Online Client, the same procedure with the same path should be done in your settings too. After that, you'll be able to see Suspicious folder and see hidden assets there and make them visible again in case you want.  Kind regards, Waves Community Manager",False

Maybe, no need to issue this, and this can be issued, after incoming transaction by ethereum blockchain, and burned, after outgoing transaction...  But... If you open the listings for ERC-20 tokens, maybe you have some functions for bitcoin-based altcoins? How to add random bitcoin-based altcoin, like BSV, BCH to the WAVES DEX? Someone need to pay to someone for this? If some token will be associated with this coin, then need to make gateway, but this is will not be official gateway, and will not have this mark, but will look like a spam-token or scam-token.  The first thing that comes to mind is to contact to coinomat, but... What, if coins will be so many?  So, can you hardcode supporting for altcoins by default, LOL.

My reply:  In this case, the token sale has not generated any significant revenue, and the investors were also insured for losses. So this token was not affected by the contents of the white paper which was assembled for the bettertokens review board. This project was also not exposed to a large community of investors through for example top 20 exchange listing or coinmarketcap, so it has remained largely invisible to the broader community, and that is why the collaboration with Bettertokens during this phase will ensure a better token for the investor community, as I believe is part of your philosophy. So I believe it is the wrong choice to discard any proposed amendmendt in exchange for qualified issuer granting.  TSA also didn't exist at date of issuing of Marquise $Museum which occurred at the height of the 2017 peak, Your twitter came into existence august 2018, and I have not heard of this board prior to 2019 when Ivanov joined it.  My recommendation is to issue a provisional approval for Marquise $Museum during the assembly of the amended white paper. It seems Bettertokens create their own rules as they go based on data sets by applications, so there is no reason for this inflexible mindset, in a market that is dynamically evolving.  Their email to support Marquise $Museums complaint: sec@bettertokens.org  You can write to them, that Maruise $Museum should be issued a provisional grant during white paper amendment, to ensure a better tokenization for the crypto community.  Sidenote: Looks like Waves may be forking in the future as there are two camps developing, a usurped and centralized autocratic (or the term I coined, neo fuedalist) faction, and the community decentralization faction.

Instead, Sasha is going to pocket a large chunk of $600 million (or vastly more if the price spikes temporarily upon a Sasha pump and dump announcement. Pump, pump, PUMP IT UP. Dump, dump, DUMP IT QUICK) on top of what he's already NOT earned from legions of gullible Waves buyers who go by the name of ""The Waves community"", a warm, loving, friendly community with Sasha in charge, emptying everyone's pockets.  Now, Sasha is insulting us little people with talk of a buy back, saying it would be dumb not to buy at this price. Just how obscenely greedy can a person get?  To give you an idea of the size of Sasha's wallet, he could stay a whole year in a top 5-star hotel in New York, London, or Paris, costing $10K a night, and it wouldn't dent his wealth noticeably.  Yeah, buy our Waves for $0.0000002, Sasha - about all they're worth when you release the hot air out of them. Waves hit #55 today, but that's by market cap. CoinCheckUp ranks Waves at #357 based on real metrics, such as business strength, coin strength, team strength, etc.  And, by the way, the Vostok airdrop of Vostok tokens was done in a way to give the most money to the richest Waves holders, which includes - you guessed it! - Sasha himself.

His opinion is coinomat victims owned ""rights"" to WAVES with Sasha as the custodian exactly the same as owning WAVES held by a custodial wallet, so ownership is separate from possession.  This is good, my accountant agrees with AL that as long as we use a consistent inventory tracking method for taxation of FIFO, we can legally account for the stolen waves using FIFO, which in effect means the ""disposal"" event for the stolen WAVES can actually be used to reduce WAVES that you owned from as far back as the ICO.  Summary: we owned the swap waves all along, Sasha's email the other day triggers a disposal of WAVES (he stole some of your WAVES ), but we're allowed to use an inventory control method of FIFO that means Sasha theft of WAVES can be accounted for using another parcel of WAVES,  they're all fungible after all.  You can indeed sell some WAVES now, keep the funds, and record the stolen waves as being from a parcel purchased before the swap (where we record the trade and change of ownership, with no physical delivery), BUT, you can't swap now for WCT (Sasha owns the coinomat assets already, he just hasn't taken possession of them yet), and you have to report the theft of waves Sasha's email implied to POLICE.

The INDEX security was tracking the price of the top20 cryptos supposedly ... you can't issue something like that to American citizens without a proper license, and raising +20M USD in a high profile ICO during the peak of the ICO wild west scam-era will have put Sasha Ivanov in the sights of global regulators looking to send a message by prosecuting some of the worst offenders from 2016-17, especially public people from geopolitically juicy targets like Russia.  If you doubt this look into the history of Liberty Reserve, the same thing will happen to Mr Ivanov https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Reserve  Quote In January 2016, Arthur Budovsky pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to commit money laundering. On May 6, 2016, Budovsky was sentenced to 20 years in prison.  The most likely scenario is Sasha Ivanov will be prosecuted by the SEC later this year for illegal securities fraud and be sent to prison, Coinomat will feature in the prosecution as everything is documented and police reports will now be mounting up. The crackdown is coming and Sasha Ivanov is an easy target.  If you swap your Coinomat assets now for WCT you will get nothing back, however, so assuming you are declaring your crypto activities the best course of action is to convert your Coinomat assets into collateral held by you for a debt of WAVES owed to you by Mr Ivanov, and write it off against other crypto gains now that full details of the theft are known.  If you keep WAVES on an exchange what you really own is WAVES IOU's from that particular exchange - not your keys, not your crypto - and with the long-delayed coinomat swap we are entitled to use all the stated terms for the swap to convert the coinomat assets into WAVES IOU's with Sasha Ivanov as the counterparty. That is the law!  You could even sell other WAVES IOU's held on an exchange, keep the funds, and for Tax purposes your WAVES balance would stay the same, you just sell WAVES to decrease your exchange IOU's by the amount of the Ivanov IOU's you gained during the 'OTC swap' you did with Ivanov at the peak in 2017 and your WAVES balance is unaffected. Mr Ivanov is NOT going to protest is he, he's not negotiating at all, and even if you get audited later you can easily show the calculations and evidence for where the Ivanov WAVES IOU's came from, and when and how they were stolen  All crypto is just ledger entries for taxation purposes anyway, and IOU's for crypto tokens stored on exchange custodial wallets are treated the same as coins you own the private keys for in a wallet on your PC, until you dispose of them, or they get stolen like Mr Ivanov has done - he admitted he stole your WAVES with this recent email (he is offering to swap to WCT, not WAVES at all), and you can value them at the peak if you want, when the 2nd Coinomat swap should have happened. Remember, the debts Ivanov owes you were denominated in WAVES with set values, not worthless WCT, which you were entitled to anyway from the airdrop. The goal is to maximise the fiat value of the theft that you can write off, the value of what you lost at the peak of the 2017 bubble.  But, if you swap now you wont have the Coinomat collateral for the debt Ivanov owes you, and you effectively forgo the chance to value your Ivanov WAVES IOU's at the 2017 peak, and your write-off is peanuts. What you'll get is a trade from coinomat assets valued in 2016 at a few cents, into WCT valued at 0.03 cents today, you miss the 2017 boom completely, like you hodl'd the worst shitcoin from bottom to top, and back to bottom, and you never took any profit. Bad trade!  My advice above is obviously not relevant if you're not declaring your crypto activities, for those poor people I don't have any useful advice.",False

All the evidence suggests there was a new implied contract for a debt once the WAVES DEX went live and the swap date was past due.  If you agree to swap for WCT now there is no actual theft of your WAVES debt anymore (just a shit load of lost value), coz you agreed to the new terms and settled, so there's no debt @ 2017 bull prices you can write-off now, nothing to report to the police except your bad trades with Mr Ivanov that you consented to.  If your crypto activities have been declared for taxation (as mine have been since 2013) then Ivanov has broken a legally enforceable contract with you, and you have legal ways to claw back some wealth, so DO NOT swap for 0.03 cents now.

It's time to accept the truth,  Coinomat asset holders who did not swap in 2016 have been scammed, Sasha Ivanov is NEVER going to pay you anything close to what he owes you for using your wealth since 2014. This is a reality!  @Waves.support will continue to ignore this issue (HIS BOSS IS A SCAMMER), but who can blame him, he's just a forum mod worker, not the person who stole your funds in 2014 and used them to make millions.  I have spoken to my accountant and this is the best course of action IMO  Do not swap your old coinomat assets for WCT  If you swap now you will get no value from your original NXT coins from 2014-16, you effectively miss out on the crypto boom from 2017, your NXT was worth peanuts in 2014-16, and the swap rate of WCT is peanuts now. Ivanov used your money to bootstrap his WAVES ICO which made millions, BUT, you get nothing!

He isn't even bothering to swap all the old coinomat assets.  You can use this to your advantage though.  What you should do is convert the value of what your old coinomat assets would have been worth at the peak of the 2017 boom in December, assuming you had swapped them to WAVES, and convert that value into a personal debt in your local fiat, a debt owed by Sasha Ivanov to you personally for keeping your money past the promised swap date.  ALL his public statements since 2016 clearly explain the terms of the Coinomat::WAVES swap, and you are legally allowed to value Ivanov's obligation to you using WAVES value from December 2017 if you want, he promised the swap as early as April 2016 so the obligation to pay WAVES, (i.e. the debt) is beyond doubt, and you are legally entitled to value the debt and write it off ""when you realised it wasn't going to be paid"". This is the Tax law for most countries, it is for me anyway.  The original promise to swap is very clear, when WAVES DEX started, and as this was never done, the swap became a debt that you can write off when you first realised it was not possible to recover.  What you want to do is maximise the cost basis of the 'thing' you are going to write off, so DO NOT swap now!  I am picking December 2017 as the date to value Sasha Ivanov's debt to me, and he made it clear he refused to repay his debt with the recent email!  The debt was in WAVES, not WCT!  This will not let me ever get my money back, but it does mean I can file a police report for an unpaid debt valued at the peak of the last bull market, and then I can claim that as a capital loss for tax purposes to offset against other income.  It's better than nothing, 100% legal, you just need to file a police report.",False

The team should do like other crypto exchanges and make levels of KYC and give tokens verified badges for each level and color code tokens according to each level. The rewards for different levels of KYC and TSA adherence is increased ranking in the index listing and higher level colors and logo enabling.  Waves talk about gamification and this implementation is a good example of gamification. And this segmentation of economic assets is often used in lending platforms with AAA,B,C,D credit scoring for loans.  But the team is planning community verification of tokens so the june 15 ticker removal is not only depending on Bettertokens review as BT will only be one form of verification. However, it is unknown when community verification will be implemented.  The team could consider hiring a creative director and staff to overhaul the dex UI, as soon as the UI is enhanced along with these simplistic alterations, the value will sky rocket.

WAVES is trying to structure its platform in preparation for enterprise onramping but at the same time this regulatory compliance will alienate the original decentralized community.  From a business and money making perspective, this community engages in speculative behaviour and there is no traditional consumer product demand beyond tokens and novel coins it seems after having provided market making for Marquise $Museum for more than 1 year.  It remains to be seen if Waves can attract the big players to their innovative platform and what the sacrifice then will be in terms of decentralization and free market economy.  All of the above is highly speculative at this point in time and if successful the platform will become a household name and there will be high valuation but also high competition from other platforms like Ethereum and Stellar.  The UI must be completely revamped alongside this brand rediscovery and ticker pairing should be limited to btc waves and usd because it's a mess right now and the text is too small.  Waves is already planning to have a decentralized review process for tokens and these should then be indexed on a sister platform for small business owners similar to Russell 2000 or Small cap on Nasdaq without the rigorous TSA requirements.  It is possible for Waves to permit both types of economic and philosophical paradigms of this new frontier mixed with old business without alienating the original ICO participants but short term it might suffer in market cap and ranking simply because of the high standards of operation it is attempting to satisfy.  Dollar adjusted market cap with lower barrier to entry for small business indexing while minimizing spam tokens can easily be $70 to $200 within 1 year if the decentralized and censorship resistance model is retained. What we have then is an early version of something similar to ebay combined with twitter.  If the focus instead is on enterprise solutions, as I believe it is for Vostok and was not intended for Waves, then Waves value proposition can certainly stagnate indefinitely at less then $1. So until this speculative analysis is confirmed by actual enterprise onramping, then the value of the platform after june 15 is not much once tickers are removed on the dex for unverified tokens because that is a significant branding utility aspect of the dex. I believe that the team is moving towards enterprise and government solutions through Vostok because the performance of token generation and demand on WAVES has been lacking for small investors and small business so far.  June 15 ticker removal has a very easy to solution to implement a tiered indexation of tokens that opens a spectrum between 1 waves token issuance fee and TSA Nasdaq level qualifications and the 1k fee. Vetting can be community guided or by fulfilling tiered KYC similar to how centralized crypto exchanges operate. The dex can be catalogued with several color coded pages from tier 1 to 5 that users can browse instead of the singular main page that we have now and that is a mess because of multi pairings. Optionally, tokens themselves can be color coded green/yellow/blue/black depending on tier.  ",False

This team, which is actually a trust, will ensure KYC compliance and the contract terms are being negotiated. Bettertokens want 1000 waves to review this project after custodian update and the sum will then be subsidized by waves devs if the application is approved.  The 1000 waves will be secured by loan and anyone is welcome to evaluate the merits of this loan which I personally believe is beneficial to the project by index inclusion on the dex startpage where it will gain alot of daily views and possibly increased volume and coin sales.  There may also be some separate loans to cover listing fees for bigger exchange inclusion on centralized markets but those fees are more significant and requires deeper assessment to ensure proper methodology. This is only if the first loan of 1000 waves is successful.  In case that the application is dismissed, the 1000 waves repayment is divided on a 24 month term to avoid substantial economic impact on Marquise $Museum.  The project currently holds alot more than 2000 waves but because of the uncertainty of this application process (many were rejected in february), I believe it is better to secure a loan for the review procedure in case of dismissal.  Lenders will receive an equivalent fiat amount of collateral in $MUSEUM which is released monthly from an escrow wallet over 24 months or a one time direct repayment in case of approval.  Current rate for 1000 waves is $2.7 or 600 000 $MUSEUM. Lease terms are decided in fiat equivalent at moment of erecting and any up or down swings in waves price will be offset by the original sum in dollars during the 24 month repayment.",False

Now the question. What functions will this token perform and where?  Hello Ukraine2020! Vostok utility tokens are used for validating transactions on the blockchain. To use Vostok blockchain for projects, you will need to have a required balance of tokens, depending on throughput, expected number of transactions etc. You can find more information about Vostok project by using this site - https://vostok.io/  Sincerely, Waves Community Manager  Hello, Waves Community Manager! Thanks for the answer. Yes, I know it. But then what is the difference from Waves blockchain? How do I understand - the difference in the areas where it will be used?   Hello! Thank you for your question. Waves blockchain is an open source with the main idea of mass adoption. Vostok blockchain is based on the same algorithm as Waves (https://docs.wavesplatform.com/en/waves-environment/waves-protocol/fair-pos.html) but available for a limited group of users, designed for providing blockchain services to a corporate and governmental segment.  Best wishes, Waves Community manager.     Hello! Mutually! Thank you for your reply! Got it. What are the technological features of Blockchain Vostok? By the way, as I understand it, I can still buy more Waves before the airdrop?   Hello, Vostok features not just blockchain but also technologies for artificial intelligence, IoT, systematizing and analysis of big data etc. More details about the project and its development will appear soon on our social media accounts and on Medium. In addition, Vostok system integrator is being created, which will help companies to implement blockchain-solutions based on Vostok and Waves in their IT infrastructure.

Waves keeper is not another wallet or client. It is a chrome extension like Ethereum's Metamask, (only way better). You don't need to move your waves from the waves platform client, or create new wallet. You can easily use your password and keys from your client to login to your existing wallet with Waves Keeper extension and then use Waves Keeper to sent waves where you want or just login to the vostok airdrop page to be eligible for the 2nd Vostok round. It won't be hard for you even if you never used metamask. Waves keeper is more user friendly and it's like Metamask 2.0 imo. Basically whatever Waves is creating is more advanced and user friendly than anything available right now.

All of them are tradable on the Waves Decentralised Exchange and can be found via their assets id but there are some details which should be clarified. WavesPlatform doesn't require any KYC and additional procedures to issue a token. So, everyone can create it in a few clicks. Unfortunately, some users try to use their tokens for fraud or phishing attempts so all tokens which don't fulfill the rules mentioned when creating an asset, will be marked as Spam  / Suspicious and will be searchable on the Waves DEX only via their asset id. See more in our documentation https://docs.wavesplatform.com/en/waves-client/security/spam-transactions.html Tokens which were mentioned by you with value 200k etc are Smart Assets and most probably they are marked as suspicious ones as well.

Waves World is a diverse rewards based ecosystem built around a major Waves mining pool and a new marketplace, which launched on 23 November and provides official Blockchain themed merchandise and services.  WW token  The grassroots initiative has been running for almost a year now, steadily building a community around its mining pool and Telegram channel, and around the Waves World token that is the native currency of reward for the project. Waves World never held an ICO; instead, WW are distributed along with 100% of WAVES and MRT received for leasing balances to the node — which now has over 1 million WAVES — and as rewards for assistance in social media promotions through a Twitter bot integrated with the Telegram channel. WW are also used in the channel for tipping, and can be spent on the marketplace alongside several other digital currencies. A faucet dispensing small amounts of tokens is intended to serve as an introduction to both Waves and Waves World.  Waves World in figures: 14 December 2018 (30 October)  WAVES leased to WW node: 1.1 million (790,201) Node rank: #9 (#12) Ticker: Waves World Exchange: Waves Decentralized Exchange Asset id: AbunLGErT5ctzVN8MVjb4Ad9YgjpubB8Hqb17VxzfAck Number of holders: 3,959 (2,876) Number of Millionaires: 76 (47) Telegram channel: 2,809 members (474) Those who hold at least 1,000,000 WW automatically become members of the Millionaires Club and will receive daily rewards of 3,500 WW as an introductory rewards distribution.  Marketplace competition  To celebrate the launch of the marketplace, kickstart sales and bring value to WW, Waves World is holding a competition, using Gleam to help promote the platform. Each task completed gives another entry ticket to the competition. Three winning tickets will be chosen from all the entries.

Marketplace Services  WW are currently being distributed from a marketing budget, but by June 2019 the project aims to have shifted to a sustainable and profitable approach of paying WW from marketplace revenues. These will be earned in various ways — including the affiliates programme that will pay out income in WW. With a rapidly growing community, there is already increasing demand for the token despite the significant daily payouts.  Many of the services used by Waves World itself can be purchased from the marketplace, as well as a number of others:  Custom airdrop script Featured merchandise Telegram referral bot VIP merchandise campaign Waves World tip bot campaign. In the near future it will also be possible to buy services such as content and tailored marketing for crypto projects. A customer service ticketing system has been added to the marketplace, which will enable Waves World to stock merchandise like the Ledger hardware wallet.  Bitlivewire News  Complementing all of these is the BitLiveWire Blockchain news site, which aggregates major crypto news and analysis from a wide range of sources.

I bought some at about 6 dollars per piece, and have been disappointed with its performance in the past months, even though the news surrounding the project are good.  Hard to say. The crypto market is not predictable. It depends on so many different factors. However the Waves road map looks good. Also we will see the Vostok ICO and the free  distribution of a part to Waves holder which will cause in a buy pressure.

A distributed ledger is a consensus of replicated, shared, and synchronized digital data geographically spread across multiple sites, countries, or institutions. There is no central administrator or centralized data storage. A peer-to-peer network is required as well as consensus algorithms to ensure replication across nodes is undertaken. One form of distributed ledger design is the blockchain system, which can be either public or private. Blockchain was the first fully functional Distributed Ledger Technology and the only one people knew about for close to a decade. This likely led to people coming to the conclusion that it was and would forever be, the only form of DLT, therefore making it acceptable to use the two interchangeably. Blockchain is a type of DLT, a subcategory of a more broad definition, much like how the word ‘car’ falls under the umbrella term ‘vehicles’ and ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ falls under ‘geniuses’.

We are operating Turkish Lira gateway on Waves Platform since December 2017. We have managed more than 8K deposits and withdraws which is more than 13 Million Turkish Liras.  We are proud of our fast service, easy integration and I am sure that Waves Team didn’t get any ticket about complaining our service so far.  Unfortunately, on 26.06.2018 and 27.06.2018 we have faced with fraud actions by using our gateway service. I will explain the details about Coinomat related part which was happened on 26.06.2018.  On 26.06.2018 digilira had encountered a fraud money transfer. The transfer took place as an ordinary money deposit request. But soon after the corresponding bank informed us that it was a fraud transaction and request us to send money back to victim.  Note: Scammer somehow got victim’s National ID, went to the telecommunication store and claim that he lost his sim card and gets new sim card. After he got that sim card he called bank and claim that he is victim and gave the whole info about victim and got access to his bank account. He signed up our gateway by providing his cell phone, uploading National ID etc. Went throught KYC process. He made a request to deposit 37K Turkish Lira and sent from victim’s bank account.  Scammer transferred money to digilira’s bank account and our system checks and everything seems ok at that time then sends WTRY token to scammer automatically.  We traced suspect’s wallet history and find out that the suspect exchanged WTRY to WAVES and then WAVES to WBTC. (Exact amount is 1.15864958 WBTC) We informed Waves Team and Coinomat that he will use Coinomat gateway to withdraw BTC.  We were so happy that Coinomat closed gateway service and got the scammer. They claimed that they will resend WBTC back to us instead of scammer. We refunded the victim’s money (37K Turkish Liras)  But guess what? Coinomat didn’t refund the stolen WBTC. They are still keeping our 1.15864958 WBTC . They closed the gateway, got scammers WBTC but still keeping it for themselves. I am asking support from Waves Community and Waves Team to make pressure on Coinomat and let them give back our stolen WBTC.  To read more details and see proofs check reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Wavesplatform/comments/9yqxm9/coinomat_issue_they_are_still_keeping_our_wbtc/   I am asking support from Community and Waves Team.

As mentioned above, due to Digilira gateway’s fast speed the scammer managed to deposit 37 000 TRY (approx. 6 800USD) and 100 000 TRY (approx.18 500 USD) the very next day. Deposit 1: https://wavesdesk.com/tx/7B9yMfLMEDTuBrxuGaCoN8eEMicUWD2qBbTqT7idJfSP Deposit 2: https://wavesdesk.com/tx/FD2Dd2K17DqhjGiiUVCwLjYn9GroSsnkV4Lops6jSyyG Here at Coinomat, we apply several security methods to prevent such situations, including but not limited to block generation time, several confirmations on the blockchain and many others.  Since Coinomat provides services to the Waves Platform and within the client, we decided to provide assistance to the Digilira Gateway as they informed us of this fraud transaction, despite the fact that we don’t have any business relations with Digilira.  If you look through the first fraud transaction recipient address, you can see that he bought Waves and wBTC for deposited wTRY https://wavesdesk.com/account/3PGTVJDuHc1Tdg8aGgbzTSXHJtpBsKvVFGs [see Trade History tab] and made an attempt to withdraw the wBTC later that day: https://wavesdesk.com/tx/3aG3UFcK8FQApEknKAD9rQk8z2KKTEAGxka8gkAK5DdQ   We were able to stop this attempt as per point 6.1.4 of our Terms of Services: 6.1.4 Unilaterally terminate the provision of Services to the User by cancelling the Agreement and/or blocking access to the System in the following cases: in the case of the identification of User transactions that contain signs of suspicious operation in accordance with the applicable law, law in User country of residence, international law and in accordance with AML policy, and if the Company has suspicions that the operations are carried out in violation of the requirements of the applicable law or are fraudulent in nature;   Unfortunately, we were not able to do the same for a later and larger transaction, as this time the recipient didn’t make any attempts to use our services. Currently, the wBTC is frozen on the gateway and we’re planning to keep it that way. wBTC, just as wTRY is emitted asset, which means it is strongly bound by the amount of actual BTC and TRY on gateway’s accounts. The initial bank TRY deposit was recalled, thus making wTRY not backed by anything. Digilira is asking Coinomat to refund BTC for emitted wTRY asset which is not backed by FIAT.  In view of the aforementioned, Coinomat cannot be held responsible for third party information security system malfunctions.

It's just not only the slowness of developement which is for obvious reasons frustrating, but also the surreal inadequateness of some of the adopted solutions. One little example: Finally we've got Nano Ledger support, something I've been waiting for a long time; but then, the way to access your waves wallet on Ledger is a pain in the ass each time, since it is totally counter intuitive. Each time you try to access your account on a different device with the Waves client you are prompted to create a new account. Why? I already have an account on Ledger. So you click to create the account  and then you notice the little link in the lower part of the windows which offers you to import the account. It seems absurd to have to import an account you already have on the Ledger but you click it anyway and then - and only then - you are offered the option to ""import"" the Ledger account. So you happily click on that and suddenly you have to decide on which of the 5 (five) door you want to knock, ie which of the 5 addresses which are displayed is the one where your existing account is hiding. How the hell would I remember? So you just import them randomly, one after the other, hoping to get the right one before the firth attempt, and each time you are asked to give a name to each account. Obviously later on you will have to deal with all useless accounts which you ended up creating at this point trying to access the wallet which already exists on the Ledger. In the end you finally make it inside, and in the right account and you see your waves balance. Great. Great? Now you need to transfer to your wallet some new waves tha you have bought on an exchange and so you are looking for your waves address, which obviously is displayed nowhere for you to copy. Very smart. After all, who ever would need to copy their own Waves address ? Below your Waves asset tab there is a nice button ""receive"" and you click it and finally you can see your Waves address. But there is a catch: there is no way to copy this address. Now it's getting smarter and smarter. You are instead offered either to copy a link for an invoice to be sent to someone (but I don't need a fucking invoice, I just need my address!) or a link to the option of purchasing waves via credit card - which may be useful indeed for the morons who cannot deal with buying on exchanges but I'm totally not interested in that. Even to select the Waves address and to copy it the old way doesn't work, because the right click of the mouse is disabled. Totally brilliant. I'm starting to think that perhaps, instead of buying I should rather sell (which is probably what many others are currently doing, looking at how the price is behaving), but I decide to give it one more chance and I click on the ""portfolio"" tab, in the upper part of the wallet. There I'm getting a new button which allows me to ""receive"" assets, I click it and - surprise surprise - as a default option I'm offered to receive Bitcoins, and a dropdown menu offers me to switch to several other coins, but not Waves. And anyway, all the addresses to receive any of those assets cannot be copied. Mission aborted. But who is writing this stuff? In other words, WTF, Mr. Sasha Ivanov?",False

He has money to hire a top legal team for WAVES ICO matters, but Coinomat ... it's an open & shut case, Coinomat investors have been defrauded which is beyond doubt, and Coinomat assets were issued illegally in USA, so Sasha is an easy target for SEC with a BIG headline-grabbing WAVES ICO from 2016.

Because fintech attracts inherently affluent demographics, all that is required from a user perspective is to enhance the visual design of the UI, increase token minting fee, and enable token verification for index listing in exchange for a fee. Simply make the barrier of participation a little more exclusive, this will attract merchants who will then associate Waves with upscale business. 1000tx/s is plenty to represent a luxury sector of society on blockchain without going overboard with mainstream VISA/Mastercard level of competitiveness which is both technically difficult and not necessarily beneficial from the socio economical viewpoint.  Stellar permits American users and as a result their platform is valued x100 of waves when including max supply. That platform is inferior to waves when waves decides to optimize pywaves index. Stellar platform charges $25 to deposit fiat and there is a 0.5% exchange fee which is absurd and in level with exodus wallet which is borderline fraudulent.  Waves is Russian engineered and decentralized, it is challenging to attract western luxury brands due to economic sanctions against Russia. The case of Stellar once again drives home this point, the two platforms are very similar in everything but geographic user permission. It is a fundamental cause of this x100 valuation difference, and Stellar was founded 2 years before Waves.    ",False

There are now 10 000 wallet owners so I am sure some on bitcointalk thread recognize the name.

This represents a potential upside of nearly x2000 and would place WAVES in the same category as Google with solid fundamentals:  1. It will be used by merchants on a global tokenization process 2.

Every platform could be utilized regardless of the price of the tokens.""   That is precisely what I am saying. Thanks.  But I will allow Simon Black to explain more fully the point I am trying to get across. Do not get me wrong, I love WAVES and own lots of it, but I also want to recognize something and get out of or into something before the crowd sees the light.  Read this:  "" Back in the early 1990s when the consumer Internet was in its infancy, the “World Wide Web” didn’t really exist.  We used to use something called ‘gopher’, a text and menu-based version of the web.  Then a bunch of engineers perfected hypertext transfer protocol, ‘http’, and the World Wide Web as we know it today was born.  Given how much better the user experience was with http, it didn’t take long for gopher to almost completely disappear.  The same thing could happen in crypto.  And this is important, because as these new Distributed Ledger Technologies continue to develop, it’s possible that almost ALL of today’s tokens and cryptocurrencies could disappear.  Some of the newest Distributed Ledger Technologies don’t even have tokens.  Hyperledger, for instance, is a project run by the Linux Foundation in partnership with dozens of major companies like IBM, Accenture, Cisco, Deutsche Bank, Intel, and American Express.  They’ve already released a number of working DLTs. And not a single Hyperledger DLT comes with a native coin or token.  In other words, it’s like a really advanced blockchain without the Bitcoin.  The use cases for Hyperledger are far-reaching- document storage, financial transactions, property records, even voting.  In fact there’s a candidate for US Congress in the state of California who claims that he’ll use the technology to allow his constituents to vote directly on federal legislation.  Then there are the banks-- many of whom are developing their own DLTs.  JP Morgan already launched one called Quorum, an open-source distributed ledger and smart contract platform that rapidly processes financial transactions among a closed network of participants.  They’ve essentially created a blockchain to modernize global banking infrastructure.  Outdated crypto technology doesn’t stand much of a chance when some of the largest firms in the world are putting a ton of resources into making it better.  And this brings me to where the real opportunity is.  Most of the talk about cryptocurrency these days seems focused on what’s going to be the next Bitcoin or Ether. People are trying to figure out what’s the next currency or heavily promoted ICO that can turn $1,000 into $1 million.  That’s probably not the right way to look at this sector anymore.  Certainly there are a handful of specific tokens or coins that have real utility (like some of the privacy coins).  But again, aside from those select few, it’s possible that today’s most popular cryptocurrencies and tokens might follow in the footsteps of gopher.  It’s not going to happen tomorrow. But over the next 5-10 years, inferior, pointless coins and tokens could easily be replaced by superior technology.  So rather than trying to speculate on the next hot ICO, or divining whether going YOLO in Shitcoin, TrumpCoin, or Fuzzballs will make you a crypto millionaire, the real fortunes to be made are in the application of these technologies.  Manufacturing. Real estate. Insurance. Global shipping. Retail. Healthcare.  There are litereally thousands upon thousands of compelling, lucrative ways to apply these Distributed Ledger Technologies across various industries around the world.  This is what happened with the Internet. Once the technology was developed, the real money wasn’t made by the people who developed TCP/IP and HTTP.  It was made by the entrepreneurs who applied the technology in ways that fundamentally changed how we do business… and by the investors who backed them.  Right now those opportunities with DLT are wide open.  To your freedom,   Signature Simon Black, Founder, SovereignMan.com """,False

Also, rating innovation is largely meaningless when the technology is constantly evolving - Waves may have the edge over Ethereum in TPS, for example, but that won't last.

If the point is just to show how blockchain voting can work, as a proof of concept, then they have also failed on this point. Let me explain...  Just like the DEX, they try to pass it off as decentralized while in reality, it is centralized. As we have seen with the recent DNS hijacking, the dex is controlled by a single server. Yes, there is the capability for people to run their own DEX if they want, but the current DEX that all the clients use is just one server, just one Matcher that gets all the trading fees. NOT decentralized.  The voting is similar. They have you verify your account through client.wavesplatform.com. Okay, nothing wrong with that, let's give them the benefit of the doubt and just trust that they're not saving your private keys. They use this to verify your Waves address and record your vote. When voting closes, they tally up the number of WCT that each account has, to use as their voting power, and the token with the most WCT voted for it wins.  The problem here, if you didn't realize, is that the votes themselves are not recorded on a blockchain. What's to stop them from saying that an account with alot of WCT voted for something when really they didn't? Yep, it's centralized - they can completely control the results of the vote.",False

Waves can make up votes if it wants, and have them appear on that list, to force whatever token they want to win. Hence, no point in that vote. To have a proper vote, it needs to be on the blockchain. Eg, send any minimal amount of Waves to a certain address that corresponds to your vote. That's how I've seen other votes be done in the past. Other projects using Waves tokens are looking at how Waves itself does things, and this is not the correct way to hold a vote at all.",False

I dont know if there are specific reasons for this underperforming in prices, but I think that the price action of a coin can alternately overperforms or underperforms benchmark in short time or for few months, the pillar is to alternate the two situations. Anyway I dont panic now for beeing in the little underperform one.",False

Again a lot of people complained about this, but I appreciate the honesty, I can tell you every icon you invest 500k you will get a bonus. and for the risk you take for investing so big I think its earned. so what about the rest?  10% are only buyable through waves, means A LOT of big investors will have to buy waves. this will lead to a lot of new people looking into waves and eventually finding all its benefits. 3% are AIRDROPPED to Waves holders! this is insane!",False

I emptied both of my Jaxx wallets and sent all me Ether and Bitcoins to the Waves client. I figured this would also be a great way to test the two networks in terms of transaction speed and fees. Here are the results: So, two transactions for similar amounts. Bitcoin’s mining fee amounted to just 10 cents and it came through in just under 10 minutes. Ether was a lot quicker - less than 4 minutes, but the fee was a bit higher - exactly 19 cents. I’m not going to lie, I spent quite a lot of time trying to figure out how DEX works. Then, I gave up and decided to just try it out. I went to sell all my Ether for WAVES, choosing the price of the last successful sale.

Use Cases will determine the price in the future and not the mentality: Buy the coin, which is great, why can not I say, but I bought it myself. Thanks to me later Vitalik Buterin said about the central stock exchanges that they decide which project will be big. Another example: Influential people express themselves about a specific project. As a result, the mass of people invests blindly in this project.  Institutional investors will not be interested in investing in projects that don`t have a product.

For sure things can be improved by the Waves team, but the platform is progressing with regular updates, soon smart contracts and atomic swaps are expected. Looking at facts, Waves team is still committed to this platform. Regarding Vostok, the intention is to complement the Waves platform, as centralized institutions will not work with public open blockchains. I compare it to Windows home and Windows Enteprise, both the same basic tech, but each serving a different market. Creating new funds for Vostok makes sense as the current Waves funds can remain to be used for the Waves platform developments. The strenght of the Waves platform is not only it's ICO platform, but a combined platform where ICO and DEX works together. Volumes on DEX are increasing daily and has the highest volumes of any DEX platform currently available. Good times ahead for Waves. If you still believe in Waves, keep positive and help contributing to the project instead of complaining. If you dont, sell your Waves tokens and move on with your life.",False

In my view, there should be more fiat/Waves pairs to disconnect from BTC price. Next to that, there are other projects that have a lot of hyped marketing, empty promises and fancy websites, but no working product. It takes time for the crypto market to mature and for investors to value projects on their true value. Waves is a great platform and with a fully working product that is fast, safe, high quality and receives regular updates from dev team. Just be patient, as at a certain point price will follow quality.",False

As you know original Waves Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm from Nxt blockchain. It’s based on very simple where time to mine next block depends on miner’s balance and semi-random value from previous block.  The disadvantage of Nxt formula is that it allows very large miners to forge not proportionally greater number of blocks. We can see that performance is much better on our real network, e.g. WavesGo’s performance is 1.168 which means that with 22% of stake it gets 27% of blocks:  https://forum.wavesplatform.com/t/fair-pos-adjusted-consensus-algo/239  It is logical why a big pools do not want fair mining algorythm, but to hide behind the noble goals is disgusting. ""Need 3rd party audit"" is the second excuse after ""1 by 1 activation better for debug"". Now we see the real reason. ...nastily",False

Quote from: TomThumb on June 30, 2018, 08:23:57 PM Should have said, but there is some dirt on the CEO of Qtum, Stephen/Patrick Dai - he supposedly ran off with the money from a previous venture, and changed his first name to hide his past. But Qtum has numerous people on board, including angel investors and a billionaire, so it's NOT all about Dai!  Not supposedly, he manipulated the people he was ""working with"" and stole more than 200BTC, also a huge chunk of the supply of Bitbay. Just goes to show that even angel investors and billionaires don't always know how to vet people properly and that it's too easy for scumbags like Patrick Dai to get away with things like this and still become successful in the public spotlight.",False

He said it's been 10 years since Bitcoin was created - why is it taking so long for a supposedly promising technology to gain traction? He was paraphrasing Bill Gates, the guy who stole the personal computer OS market that Gary Kildall had single-handedly created. In short, Gates bought a clone of CP/M and sold it to IBM while Kildall was still negotiating with them.  -  SIDENOTE (skip over for comments on Vostok)  When Kildall died, Gates used it as an opportunity for self-aggrandizement, saying that they were competitors, giving the impression that he won some mythical OS war. In fact, Microsoft at the time was a small software house making - mostly mediocre! - compilers and interpreters.  IBM initially visited Gates by mistake. Gates said, ""I don't do operating systems - speak to Gary Kidall!"" After Gates had bought the CP/M clone, he signed an agreement straightaway, saying, you just had to trust IBM, but the reason Kildall didn't sign straightaway was because he had an OS business to protect. Also, IBM had put obstacles in the way that were removed for Gates. Gates' mother knew the CEO of IBM, so that might have played a role, too, in Gates' success.  Later, Gates gave the impression that Kildall priced CP/M for the IBM PC at $240 vs $40 for DOS (the CP/M clone). But it was IBM who had done that - to kill it! Kildall could have sued IBM, but, instead, said that the market should decide, and IBM agreed to sell CP/M for the PC alongside DOS. Gates and IBM, effectively, conspired to destroy Kildall's firm. A decade or so later, Kildall went cap in hand to Gates, offering to sell his firm to Microsoft. Gates offered a paltry $10 million for it. Kildall later got over $100 million from Novell.  For the definitive account, get the paperback (NOT hardback) version of ""They Made America"" by Harold Evans. From that book: ""But Kildall told him [Gerry Davis], 'Bill's a friend of mine. He wouldn't cut my throat'"" Some friend!  Kildall wrote privately of Gates, ""He is manipulative. He is a user. He has taken much from me and the industry.""  Google ""Gary Kildall and the 40th Anniversary of the Birth of the PC Operating System computerhistory""  Google ""Gary Kildall and Collegial Entrepreneurship drdobbs"" for an article in a well-known computer programming journal.  Search YT 4 ""The Computer Chronicles: The Macintosh Computer (1985)"" by user ""Bob Blahloblaw""  Move slider to 14:23 and watch Kildall (he co-presented that program for six years) introduce GEM. GEM is what we would have got had Gates not stabbed a friend in the back. What Microsoft gave us:  Search YT 4 ""Mum tries out Windows 1.0 (1985)"" by user ""OSFirstTimer""  -  Vostok is for SUPER WEALTHY INVESTORS ONLY using technology developed with money provided by Waves investors! So, the rest is simple inference. There is NOTHING stopping Sasha from later porting Waves over to Vostok and killing Waves.  No one with half a brain would trust the guy now. His job was to make Waves a success - NOT move on to another project - JUST HOW MUCH MONEY DOES HE WANT? But he has form in doing this.  As for Vostok - a completely separate project to Waves! - creating synergy: you might as well say every cryptocurrency out there gives Waves synergy, because they're all contributing to the development and uptake of blockchain technology. This is just a sop to gullible investors!   Not supposedly  Well, it's what I read. I have no hard evidence - do you?",False

Due to decentralization we can't forbid our users to run ICO, create assets and make a mass transfer for 'em. Unfortunately, some of these assets are spam/scam tokens (such as WTRY.tk that was mentioned by you). Now you can hide these assets manually. Also while airdropping by fraudsters they will fall into a Spam folder. With futher updates you'll be able to burn such unneeded assets with phishing attempts. Always stay attentive and don't get phished. Never provide your seed to a 3rd party or fraudsters will intercept access to your wallet.  Kind regards, Waves Community Manager.",False

This ITO is going to be different. We don't use Ethereum, we use Waves.

At 28 Millions Developers worldwide, this deal equals to $267.85 per dev. Your data, your repositories, your time. So this is why we believe you deserve this. The IGT ITO transparently offers investors no value, so there will be no expectation of gains.

Thank you all for your question and interest in Waves Platform.      Waves allows you to hold and transfer external currencies on its blockchain. This works through an established centralised Coinomat gateway: Bitcoins or any supported external coins are sent to a user's personal Waves address via standard transfer and after the deposit user receives BTC/ETH* tokens (wBTC/wETH*) on the Waves blockchain. Every single wBCT/wETH* tokens is backed 1:1 with a real BTC/ETH*. After creating withdrawal request, Bitcoins or any other supported external coins are transferred to the gateway side as wBTC (Waves BTC) tokens, then gateway processing them and finally sending as external BTC transaction, i.e. wBTC > Bitcoin gateway > BTC. For deposits, the process is repeating but in the opposite direction BTC > Bitcoin gateway > wBTC asset. You will receive coins to specified address, deposits and withdrawals may takes up to 120 minutes.

Nobody who knows the history is going to be fooled, Coinomat might be a waves 'partner' today, but Sasha issued the unswapped assets, so they are most definitely his responsibility, so he either ensures the new Coinomat operators honour the swaps, or he does it himself.  Sasha issued the unswapped assets , and he was the one who promised a second round of swaps after waves launched. What new waves investors since 2014 believe is irrelevant,  the facts in this case are clear.",False

However a successful ICO does not make for a successful project or business. Most fade and die, some moon on hype and then fade and die - only a tiny fraction will succeed and those that do probably will want their own private fork anyway. The big problem is the lack of scale, compounded by all the projects attempting to use the platform. The second problem is lack of any data or service guarantee that in inherent in public, permissionless blockchain.  The next 'big thing' in crypto will be those open, decentralised platforms offering blockchain as a service to those entities requiring blockchain processing, be it Smart Contracts, algorithyms, payments or tokenization.  At the present time, in this space there are only two platforms in the running; Ethereum (Alliance) and Waves (Vostok).",False

The problem is Sasha Ivanov a.k.a. Alexander Ivanov. He failed with Coinomat, left investors (just learned about this recently, don't have the full story).  When Coinomat failed he started Waves and collected millions... and founded a lot of ICO's on the 'Waves Platform'. Like Putin he is a scumbag. Why? Let me tell you why.  The problem with Waves is that he wants all that money for himself so he hired some mediocare devs and keep the funds to himself. But then realized he wanted more. So he crowned himself ICO King (Google it and told Russian ppl they could be rich if they ran an ICO. - Encryptotel - Primalbase - And many more...  Facts: - Sacha is not Vitalik, Vitalik brought innovation, ALL of Sacha's projects, Coinomat, Waves, Encryptotel, Primalbase etc. etc. failed - No ICO on Waves has succeeded, all ICO's were launched by thieves and probably Russian criminals like the guys behind Encryptotel. They have your money, why would they care about you now? Show a couple of printscreens and be silent like they have done the last couple of years.  What can you expect? Waves is not your average project. It is highly influenced by politics (money), did you know Waves 'spent' 10k BTC on this site: https://waveswallet.io/  Yes that is a lot of money, the next ETH? Guys like Vitalik are scarce, they usually come once in a decade. But don't sell because of this post. If you read this you know now why it all makes sense, why Waves was never pumped. Russian criminals taking money.  You know why Alexander Ivanov has not 1 succesfull project on this track record. He failed all and after giving 10.000 BTC to Putin & Co.  Let's face it. Everytime the community becomes verbal he launches a new bogus coin; wct, mrt, liquid.  Where are those coins now? What's their worth?  Exactly, they are bogus coins.

Waves Platform is intended for assets/tokens mainly. And the whole Waves ecosystem is build up around them: matcher, fast transactions, gateways, multi-cryptocurrency wallet, (smart contracts, atomic swap are coming soon). The Waves blockchain is faster than Ethereum, but besides that it is easier in use, and makes all the actions with tokens more comfortable. As for smart contracts, 90% of Dapps on Ethereum are tokens. We also have tokens that are native, simple and built into the platform. What is more tokens will also become smart when Smart accounts and Smart Assets are issued on Waves blockchain, that will allow users work with predictable price of assets, do quickly and safely basic tests as well.

Just to give you the correct perspective on how new this tech is. 2) According to the number of github commits, Waves team is on the 7th place of the most active dev teams in the crypto space (https://www.cryptomiso.com/) - I would not call it a lazy team 3) Waves team is currently developing smart contracts and atomic swaps. Once this is deployed on main net, it will allow you to trade peer to peer any token on the Waves DEX. - this will contribute to higher trade volumes 4) Waves algoritn (Waves NG) is one of the fastest blockchain techs available. It can handle around 100 tx/sec. which is around 14 x faster than ETH blockchain. - it's scalable for mass transaction handling 5) Waves fees on DEX is only 0.003 Waves per transaction, that is a little bit more than 0.01 USD with today's value. Compare this with the fees you pay on a centralized DEX as Binance, or Bittrex 6) DEXs in general are much more secure, as no 3rd party holds your funds and the decentralized network is much less vulnerable to hacks, or attacks.",False

Thank you for your questions and interest in Waves Platform.

When the situation becomes clear we will definitely inform about the decision is made for it. Thank you for understanding and patience.  Quote from: September11Myth on May 25, 2018, 11:14:52 AM I've just created a new Waves wallet with the new beta wavesplatform and I've remained quite speechless as I didn't find a single smoothless way to copy my new waves address once inside the platform. Of course by clicking on the ""receive"" tab I am shown my address, but I have no way to copy it. Instead I am offered a way to ""Share the link to an invoice"". The only way to extract my waves wallet has been to copy the ""Share the link to an invoice"" string and extract my address from there. Well, are you totally crazy? How can you hope for mass adoption if you make the easiest things impossible for the average Joe? I know how to go around obstacles, but a newbie won't. As I said, I'm speechless.  Could you, please provide the information about what version of Waves wallet you use: mobile app Android/iOS, Online/Desktop Beta Client?

These and other scam tokens of such kind have been overwhelmed Waves users accounts. We have had a lot of messages about spam assets with a URL (http://…) in the name. We can't forbid our users to create their own token or launch ICO, but we will try fix this in the next release. All such assets will be hidden by default. This is only an initial solution.

The ico funds that generated the bitcoin cash should righfully go to the ico investors, just convert the bch into waves and allow ico investors to claim into their original waves account.

By distributing small amounts of tokens to many different users for free, you instantly gain a very large potential userbase.  You can conduct airdrops on any blockchain. A handful of them can cope with that reasonably well. But there?s only one that has specifically been designed to support the kinds of transaction volumes that a large airdrop requires.  Waves? consensus algorithm is Waves-NG, which is capable of processing an order of magnitude more transactions than most other blockchains ? quickly and at low cost. Standard fees are 0.001 WAVES per transaction (around $0.005 right now) but it gets even cheaper thanks to the mass-pay function, which is purpose-built exactly for this reason.

Waves processed over 330,000 transactions in a single day on 26 December 2017. 170,000 transactions were confirmed within just 20 minutes, and it is theoretically possible to process up to 10 million transactions per day.

Quote from: thecreakers on May 17, 2018, 01:31:51 AM Does anyone have problem with waves on iPhone which don't implement any Passcode?  Could you, please try to reinstall the app. Please make sure you've made a back up of your SEED before.

This means that they function as a 3rd party between a buyer and seller. The issue with centralized exchanges is trust. You do not know if they can be hacked, go bankrupt, or simply take your funds and run to the Bahamas. Waves has a decentralized exchange (DEX), which allows peer to peer trading without needing a 3rd party. The Waves decentral network (nodes) will verify transactions for only 0.003 Waves as a fee. As there is one common truth on the decentralized blockchain, it cannot be hacked and no 3rd party is in control of your funds.  There are also some other pros for a DEX:  1) low transation fees: a DEX does not need a margin to cover costs that a centralized exchange has (e.g. profit margin, employees, facilities etc.) 2) fast transactions: with the Waves NG algoritm, the DEX can handle mass transactions volumes 3) Secure network: A decentral network of nodes is less likely to fail running, compared to a central server from a 3rd party 4) No central gonvernance: A DEX cannot be shut down by a central goverment or institution  See also the following link that explains how DEX is working.  https://coinsutra.com/decentralized-vs-centralized-crypto-exchange/",False

In my view the value of Waves is not the trade or sell on exchanges, but the utility of the tokens in a business. If it was up to me I would add an option to a token creator to disable all trading in the token. This way tokens can be used for what they were meant for and not form the topic of pnd or other whining about exchange prices.

Quote from: Waves.support on May 05, 2018, 10:49:15 PM Waves Platform is intended for assets/tokens mainly. And the whole Waves ecosystem is build up around them: matcher, fast transactions, gateways, multi-cryptocurrency wallet, (smart contracts, atomic swap are coming soon). The Waves blockchain is faster than Etherium, it is easier in use, and makes all the actions with tokens more comfortable. As for smart contracts, 90% of Dapps on Etherium are tokens. We also have tokens that are native, simple and built into the platform. What is more tokens will also become smart when Smart accounts and Smart Assets are issued on Waves blockchain, that will allow users work with predictable price of assets, do quickly and safely basic tests as well.  I am much interested in the smart contracts component. Can you clarify on the highlighted part what is the impact to existing tokens. Will existing tokens become smart automatically or will only new tokens created after smart contracts be smart?",False

And the whole Waves ecosystem is build up around them: matcher, fast transactions, gateways, multi-cryptocurrency wallet, (smart contracts, atomic swap are coming soon). The Waves blockchain is faster than Etherium, it is easier in use, and makes all the actions with tokens more comfortable. As for smart contracts, 90% of Dapps on Etherium are tokens. We also have tokens that are native, simple and built into the platform. What is more tokens will also become smart when Smart accounts and Smart Assets are issued on Waves blockchain, that will allow users work with predictable price of assets, do quickly and safely basic tests as well.

WAVES token serves as the ‘fuel’ for all operations on the Waves network and as a spam-prevention mechanism.[18] A fixed supply of 100 million WAVES tokens were created after the crowdsale. The transaction fee for simple WAVES or token transfers is 0.001 WAVES, whilst it costs 1 WAVES to create a new token on the network.

But don't you worry, i'll be gentle with you.  imho these are the metrics you can use to determine if ""crypto community"" trust the project:  - total number of ICOs held on Waves - total number of tokens released on Waves - total number of wallets generated on Waves - total number of funded wallets on Waves - total number of nodes - avarage number of transactions occuring on Waves - avarage number of trades occuring on Waves DEX - avarage trading volume on Waves DEX  Now, i urge you to check these metrics write it down and compare with ANY other crypto that is around Waves' age (2 years). NEO, Komodo or Ethereum classic will be good starting point as they appeared around the same time as Waves did. Go do that and come back with your data (and the sources off course) on other platforms that you say are more trust worthy than Waves. Statement like the one you made are easy to throw around when you're as uninformed as you are.  To make things easier for you here you have a link to all statistics mentioned above http://dev.pywaves.org/",False

I'm not sure but this figure is probably was limited by network settings which are set at the moment, which if required can be increased later on, but for better distribution of fees between nodes' should be kept still on lower limit as possible.

It is actually on a level of personal preference so I respect your judgement on it.  Regarding to its price, the devs made it clear in the early days of this coin that they will not provide any buy wall nor manipulate the market just to support it.

IF waves didn't change its strategy other smart platform will overtake waves and they will leave behind in the race.  Waves Platform is intended for assets/tokens mainly. And the whole Waves ecosystem is build up around them: matcher, fast transactions, gateways, multi-cryptocurrency wallet, (smart contracts, atomic swap are coming soon). The Waves blockchain is faster than Ethereum, it is easier in use, and makes all the actions with tokens more comfortable. As for smart contracts, 90% of Dapps on Ethereum are tokens. We also have tokens that are native, simple and built into the platform. What is more tokens will also become smart when Smart accounts and Smart Assets are issued on Waves blockchain, that will allow users work with predictable price of assets, do quickly and safely basic tests as well.

The seed can comprise several random words (presently 15 if using the wallet seed generator) - although if you type a seed in manually you can change this and add non dictionary words/symbols if you like.  The seed is cryptographically highly secure and you need to write it down and store in a safe place. Do not ever divulge your seed to anyone, for any reason. Do not keep your seed on an insecure location. I use veracrypt to store mine off-line. https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html  The seed is all you need to access and use your wallet - 2FA solutions are coming for other applications and it's possible many users will use these as well - but for users, the seed is what you need for now.  You cannot change the seed and use the same main and additional addresses. For example; If you have the slightest suspician your seed may have been compromised you should create a new seed, take note of the new Waves address and transfer all your Waves and tokens to the new address.

Also, you can read a lof of information on their Website, or join their Discord channel.  There are some major differences between Waves and ETH. 1) Waves has Leased proof of stake (LPOS) consensus algorithm. No hardware needed for mining. You can start your own node, or lease them to another node. 2) Waves has the new generation consensus algorithm implemented (Waves NG). This means the network can handle much more transactions per second than ETH (around 8.5x faster) and it can scale up even faster. ETH had a lot of issues in the past with handling large volumes of transactions. 3) Waves has much lower transaction fees than ETH 4) Waves has an integrated working DEX on it's platform. You can exchange crypto's for only 0.003 Waves, which is around 0.01 USD today. 5) Waves has a very user friendly wallet, both desktop and online version   6) By owning Waves you will receive regular airdrops and miner rewards (passive income) 7) This year, Waves will implement smart contracts and atomic swaps.  I own Waves since beginning of 2017 and really believe on the long term potential of this project. It has an actual working product, with a clear unique vision for the future. Also, it has a state of the art technology that can scale up for mass adoption with ""Waves NG"". When smart contracts and atomic swaps are implemented, Waves can easely compete with ETH, or NEO from a technical point of view.  There are so many over-hyped cryptos in the space that have no proven working product, or are just copies/forks from the same thing. i am sure that at some point there will be a major shake-out in the market. Having a solid working product will be the key for survival on the long term.",False

I really hope they get to do that as well honestly. I have always believed so much in the waves platform and I have been holding the coin for a very long time which I believe it is going to be worth waiting anyway considering how the devs have been working hard and trying to make the project of having a decentralized exchange platform a success. If they can have much more suitable wallets anyway, it would not be a bad idea at all.  These are the reasons that I have always been a very huge fan of waves and even though some have complained about the movement in its value as nothing much is being gotten from holding it, but for those who can see a great future for waves and with the way the devs have been active, I feel it is pretty much worth knowing that this is one coin one should be holding in his or her portfolio because I see a great chance for the waves decentralized platform.",False
