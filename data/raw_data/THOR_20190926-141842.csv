Through their hard work and success, they decided to delve into the lackluster aspects of current crypto exchanges. Thorium is the result of a year of research, design, and development. First, they wanted an exchange that is more in touch with the community. The idea was to create a token, within their exchange, that would sustain even the worst crash by backing it with tangible assets and also reward the community by paying out dividends from their mining operation as well as from the profits of the exchange’s transaction fees. Thorium will be available this summer.  Exchange Thorium is a crypto to crypto decentralized exchange that will regularly add tokens through a voting system. Thorium will offer market price buying and selling options by using 25% of its profits to create a float for each crypto listed.  Token THOR Token is the platforms Token, it will pay out dividends to users that hold it every 24 hours. It will also reduce your fees, eventually, we plan to back Thorium tokens with a blend of ten precious metals: 21.89% Gold 16.80% Rhodium 16.80% Platinum 16.80% Iridium 15.12% Palladium 6.72% Osmium 3.36% Ruthenium 1.68% Rhenium 0.50% Indium 0.33% Silver  Mining Operation 10% of our profit will go into growing a mining rig that will be connected to our token in the same way the profit from fees is. So not only will you be paid dividends from transaction fees but once we have started the mining operation you will also get paid from the mining operation.  Institutional Investors For crypto to truly grow into the mainstream, institutional investors need to get involved. At Thorium we are creating different options for investment companies to be able to use our tools to invest in cryptocurrencies.  Messenger Our encrypted messenger system will allow you to connect with friends as well as with your favorite crypto companies.  Lottery Every single day, every user will have the chance of winning 5% of the Thorium’s profit.   Charity We will be partnering up with Aidcoin to distribute the funds to the different charities we will be donating to. We will also offer users the option to donate to their favorite charities.  Portfolio For the cryptos that are not available on our exchange yet, you can add them to our portfolio. This will allow to stay up to date with all your coins through one platform. News We are putting a lot of our resources into creating a reliable source of crypto news for you. We plan on interviewing all the leading blockchain elites. Also, we will consistently communicate with our users about all the updates from the various cryptos we support in our exchange.  Votes Users will be able to vote for their favorite tokens to be listed on Thorium. Additionally, there will also be community polls that users can partake in democratizing the direction the company should move in.  Forum We are creating an easy to use app that will also include a Forum where you will be able to find answers to all your questions. We have a devoted team that will keep on adding new questions and answers to the Forum and encourages the community to take over.  Events Thorium wants to create a culture where the profit is always shared. After the first year, We will set up events in many cities around the world with different themes. Users & companies will also be able to create events to share with their peers.  Conferences Our conference feature is built with start-ups in mind. It will allow newcomers to give weekly updates and offer a chance to be part of this competitive industry. It will allow for more credibility, exposure and the ability to broadcast conferences for all of your followers.  Documents Although the essence of blockchain is anonymity, we believe users should have the option of downloading legal documents as required by each country’s laws. The crypto-sphere is rapidly evolving and we will make sure to adapt as best we can by listening to you.  Support Our heart lies within the customer. That is why we are creating many options for users to contact us. We will begin with Emails, Tickets & Live Chats. Eventually, we will consider adding a direct phone line for customer support.  The Application We will have a website version of Thorium as well as a mobile Application for both android and apple products.  In the near future ICO Support Marketplace Games Fiat to Crypto  We are having an Airdrop & an ICO next month. Go to our website and register. https://thorium.exchange/ To avoid any scams, the only way to participate is through our mobile application.  Thank you. T.R.",False

First of all our exchange token will be backed by gold and other precious metals, users will have an incentive to hodl their thorium as it is a real store of value that keeps on increasing in value because every month we buy more gold with 10% of the exchanges profits. Our token will also pay out dividends like Kucoin does. Except we will also have a Mining operation that will pay out dividends, so two sources of revenue in the same token.  Secondly, our exchange will be available in all platforms: mobile, tablet, web, desktop. We are making it very user-friendly for mass adoption, not only will it be an exchange though as we are adding group chat, ability to add friends follow pages, post on the forum, create groups, create polls, create events, all in the same place. Basing out messenger system on telegrams model and all this peer to peer and encrypted. The only part of the app the admins will have some authority over will be within the exchange in case there was ever a breach we would want some sort of access to be able to stop it.  Thirdly, although 25,000 users is not a lot for an exchange we opened registrations last Thursday and have had a flood of interest, this will give more liquidity to the exchange, having more and more users.  All in all, Thorium has yet to prove itself as a great crypto exchange where you can do absolutely everything crypto related, but we are working seven days a week to make it a reality.  We also come at a great time, I'm sure you do not agree with most of Twitter and Facebook's policies, instead, you could have your friends on Thorium and not have to worry about ads or your information being stolen.  Hope this answers your question, if not please ask me anything else!",False
