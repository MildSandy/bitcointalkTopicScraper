PMTN will be available through a token sale open to the public.  The crowd sale will start TBA  It will end on TBA   Join the Whitelist Here   Peer Mountain is making blockchain commerce a reality. Using a forms-based architecture, businesses can seamlessly transact data with self-sovereign identity (SSID) solutions to improve the security and efficiency of their commercial operations.   Patent-pending Peerchain™ technology encrypts and decentralizes data in all its states, providing businesses with automated regulatory data protection compliance and push-button auditing. Automated onboarding increases operational efficiency Swift, secure ID verification improves customer experience Blockchain audit trail provides push-button auditing and instant regulatory data protection compliance Decentralized data operations reduce risk of data breaches and hacking    Visit the Crowdsale  Read The Whitepaper      The current problems solving the digital identity crisis are greater than many think. Information can be stolen from organizations that centralize the data they collect from official identiy. Details are commodities that can be purchased for potentially corrupt purposes through personal data. Peer Mountain facilitates identity consolidation through an intuitive mobile application, providing the peace of mind that comes with comprehensive, blockchain-based identity protection.  Peer Mountain uses blockchain technology to give individuals and organizations full, secure ownership of their identities, and, for the first time, enable people to safely share their self-sovereign information with organizations and each other. Peer Mountain facilitates the rapid delivery of services through its blockchain framework. Identity is a core component of Peer Mountain, but this is not an identity platform. Peer Mountain is an application ecosystem designed to facilitate the commerce and exchange of digital and physical services.  Peer Mountain is at the intersection of consumers who want Self-Sovereign Identity and service providers who need Continuous and Reliable Compliance and Efficient Commercial Service Delivery. Trust providers offering validation services to third parties further support the ecosystem, which reinforces itself with network effects through Trust Interoperability and Portability. Peer Mountain is the facilitating technology for the Trust Ecosystem and sits right in the middle - without requiring that any of the three interests (consumers, service providers and trust providers) make a compromise of using someone else’s platform or solution.      Watch The Video Describer Here   Peer Mountain emerged from the desire to create a ‘human-scale’ system of trust that works for all trust-based purposes, for everyone, everywhere in the world. Backed by KYC3, a separate business operating in the ID verification space since June 2014, Peer Mountain has been developing its groundbreaking Peerchain™ technology and generating commercial interest. It drafted its first commercial agreements in 2016, when main development began. With commercial partners already on board, tested and proven code, and extensive market awareness, Peer Mountain will be launching its ecosystem of trust with the best chance of success.   PMTN is the utility token for measuring the value of trust within Peer Mountain’s peer-to-peer ecosystem. Token holders can use it to pay for ID verifications in the Peer Mountain network.With millions of trust-based transactions occurring daily, the demand for PMTN is likely to grow. Due to its finite supply, the token is also likely to rise in value as transaction velocity and utilization increases.Designed using Ethereum, the ERC-20 compatible PMTN is cross-chain compatible. Holders can exchange or use it across multiple Peer Mountain instances, with the Ethereum mainnet acting as a transfer rail.
