According to Singer, the growing access to the internet through affordable devices could enable particularly those from emerging markets to use a cheaper payment system with a transparent means of recording transactions.  Many scoffed at the idea back then. Indeed, cryptocurrencies and blockchain had yet to reach the same level of popularity they enjoy today. But what a difference a couple of years make.  Despite some recent shakiness, cryptocurrencies have increased ten times in value since. We’re also seeing more organizations and governments recognize the value in blockchain as a transactional platform and new platforms such as Ethereum can now even facilitate smart contracts using the technology.

Don't trust your emotions. You will end up getting rekt.  3. Don't rush to trade after having tokens at you disposal.  4. And keep hodling $EVX like forever, even though you would sometimes feel to sell it for the best.  5. Patience is the key 🗝  to success my friend. Because , in long-term, Everex will reap into a Big beautiful (not woman) Money tree. (Disappointed?)  6. Don't expect too much in short term. Yeah, its important not to expect too much, because while expecting too much too early and not seeing your ideal results will lead you to subconsciously prepare yourself to sell out at even minor 20-30% to 2x-5x profit and being grateful for that you atleast didn't loose any money but after some time you will end regretting.

Just check what Alexi posted above.  Quote from: Alexila on July 07, 2017, 04:04:38 AM The difference between EVX and Cryptocash :  Everex offers 2 types of coins.  1. EVX is the Everex ICO token to raise funds, bring return to supporters, and to further develop business and marketing. Funds will be spent on building technology and business infrastructure for cross-border microlending, remittances, p2p payments, and currency exchange, along with licensing blockchain payment technology to financial institutions. EVX is a utility token serving as credit score indicator and reward mechanism, and as well it gives the right to receive up to 20% profits to investors by quarterly buybacks via ""reverse ICO"".  2. Cryptocash. This is fiat currency smart contracts on blockchain, issued in different currencies. This is fiat pegged stable coin backed by 100% in reserves held with 3rd party cash custodians. This token is not an investment vehicle, as it’s value is always pegged to respective fiat currency (USD, EUR, CNY, etc). Cryptofash is used to transfer money cross-border p2p, in 30 sec without involving banks. As POC, we have one such contract developed, THBEX (Thai Baht, Thailand) with 300,000 THBEX issued and reserved with SCB (Siam Commercial Bank), the cash custodian.  The smart contract address is https://ethplorer.io/address/0xff71cb760666ab06aa73f34995b42dd4b85ea07b Where you can see all holders and transactions.

I have researched your project for several hours from yesterday to today and I'm pretty confident you guys have the most important aspects to being successful in this:  1. You have a deep experience with this. I saw your LinkedIn profile and you have tons of experience in the FinTech market.  2. You already have a product and you know exactly how much you need to get in the ICO.  3. You are going to give back to the community of investors, which is awesome and shows how your team also wishes to harvest the fruits from this.  4. You are inserted in a market you seem to know about. Also, it starts with a select target audience (Thailand > Myanmar cash), which I really like. As far as I see, there's no need to start huge or think about how big the audience is (although it is). You just need to begin small, one step at a time as you said. You already have value (at least the 7% you could reduce in taxes in your 100 Myanmar migrant workers test - http://www.coindesk.com/press-releases/100-migrant-workers-test-blockchain-remittance-thailand/)  5. I am an Internet Marketer, WebDev and SEO professional as well as a physician. As an Internet Marketer, I checked all your websites and you have good, solid content. You also developed several times your main websites, and you also rewrote your copywriting several times as I can check via Archive.org.  You and your team seem to be great entrepreneurs and I'm definitely investing in this when the ICO is released, along with 2 friends of mine. Best wishes for the project, from Brazil!

Before issuing the loan the applicant goes thru rigorous, yet automatic, verification with lots of hidden tools. Two major data sources will be used, blockchain itself as data source for transactions (frequency, volumes) and smartphone, from which we derive hundreds of data points that state the credit status of the borrower. (model and brand of the phone, service provider, contact list, sms, camera, social media, etc.), all of this data is being processed by our algorithms and the Yes or No, or if Yes then How Much? decision is issued. We want to think about our app as ""credit card on blockchain"".  Our default rates is 20% and we also do collections for 3rd parties as well.

Suretly is an interesting idea to help professional lenders in simplifying lending decision by supporting the borrower with vouching for him random people. As professional collectors we already see that this project may turn to a dating app. (E.g. personally I'd more likely to vouch for a cute girl who needed some money, rather than for a dude). Plus having a ""tinder"" like interface I'm not sure, but wold love to be proven wrong.  It just gives collectors more options to collect (which is good for us, in fact we will be happy to collect for Suretly lenders) but will this result in acceptable default rates, is yet to be seen.  I wish them all the best, as we all need more financial dapps on the market and less of ""pink elephants in a spaceships"" with 100s of millions raised, which they don't need.  We, in fact, also will be using vouching system, only not from random strangers, but from from the closest Facebook friends of the borrower. This way if he pays back then, 1. he build his credit score 2. he gets rewarded wit EVX tokens (about 5% from paid interest, like a reward point) 3. his vouching friends are sharing another 5% worth of EVX tokens and building their credit history a bit by vouching for the good borrower. If borrower does not pay back: 1. EVX tokens are taken from his wallet reducing his credit karma 2. EVX tokens are taken from his vouchers wallets, 3. We include vouchers in the collection calls politely suggesting to influence the borrower to be a good person and not angry Buddha but not paying back.",False

I usually say that Everex is ""M-pesa on smart contract steroids"", because Mpesa is rather a payment system than remittance.  If we look at Abra, Coins, Bitspark, Hellobit, and other remittance.  IN SHORT. 1. None of them are on Ethereum blockchain 2. None of them uses smart contracts 3. None of them is transparent (meaning you can see their transactions on blockchain publicly) 4. None of them provides lending services 5. None of them has own stable coin on blockchain 6. None of them solves financial inclusion in regards to building credit scores on blockchain and provide access to capital.  Those guys use bitcoin as rails to move value from one point to another. At the beginning and the end there is still cash. Cash does not create a financial record that helps building credit history. Everex does all of that, which is critical to financial inclusion.

No one even knows what Everex is yet and for market adoption you MUST have marketing and be popular.  The ICO is just around the corner, I highly suggest you get your graphic designer to make a clean thread design providing all the necessary facts of the project and more. Make it flashy yet professional.  Announce partnerships, or your future ideas, publish blog articles on how well your pre-sale went, etc. Keeping active and the community well in the loop is needed. Transparent is key.  There is sooo much this project could be doing before the ICO to get the name out there. One being contacting the ICO websites to get your website listed on the countdowns, etc.  Also recommend posting daily tweets on twitter using graphic images containing facts, vision, motivational information.  Overall the project is a game changer, so lets hope it goes well.  Goodluck.",False

As well we are not locking users within our wallet. Cryptocash is ERC20 token and can move between any Ethereum compatible wallets. Try to send money from Alipay to PayPal, it's not possible because those systems are locked and centralized.  Cash in/out can be provided by any independent agent at any remote location.

And how can they access your microcredit services if some of them don't own smartphones? Remember that maybe a lot of them are living in very remote areas that they don't even know what smartphones are. I'll wait how you address those bottlenecks. The objectives are great but how you implement is back-breaking.,False

I'll be happy to answer as I'm sure more readers would like to know the same  1... how you will evaluate the credit score of these more than 2 billion individuals without a bank account?  we use 2 main data feeds. 1) Transaction records from remittance and payments made within our wallet, which is publicly accessible from Ethereum via our Ethplorer.io blockchain reader, filtered by specific cryptocash currency symbol, e.g. THBEX, and 2) smartphone data, from the model to the information that user allows to access when installing the app. Those two feeds have quite a number of metric points that we analyze to make lending decision. Also, once first loan is paid, the credit line increases, and so forth. This allows underbanked to build own credit history on public transparent blockchain.  2. And how can they access your microcredit services if some of them don't own smartphones?  There are enough users who have smartphones, even in developing countries, and we focus our offer to them. The cost of basic Android phone is going down year by year, and if not next year but in 3 years most of the users will have ability to get a smartphone. Some users may share one smartphone between them, like some of our customers in Myanmar do. Thank you.  ",False

I can see possibility for your service.  I would have a few questions which I couldn't find on your site (I might skipped them)  Which country do you operate?  Where do you provide microfinance and remittance service (or planning in the near future)?  Do you already has an operational base in one of the developing countries and now you would like to raise capital for further expansion or you just have the model without any operational income?  If you already have filed operation, where can I check your company registration and financial audits?  On your site, there are only a few of your members actually seems to have connection to emerging markets. Most of them only have extensive experience in finance and software engineering. How do you acquired the necessary experience to operate?  Thank you for the time to read.",False
