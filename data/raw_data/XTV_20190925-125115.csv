The market will discover this, and the ""real"" value of Centive tokens will eventually reflect fairly.  @cbdrick12, we believe we can bring good old-fashioned business sense into the ecosystem.

We have raised private investments prior to this, AND, will capitalize on whatever we manage to raise in the ICO round - so, worse case scenario, we should still be able to bring it to market.

In short, we're looking to build an ecosystem that's all inclusive, and one that converts the value of ""small actions"" such as liking a social media page, or making a purchase, and putting ""it"" into a token where both consumers and businesses can decide the fair value.  A good way to tag a value on this network could be to train your focus on the current situation most marketeers face:  Situation 1: You currently pay social media companies $ to rack up likes on your page and posts Situation 2: You currently run ads to attract people from within the ""social media"" to like a page within the same ""social media"" Situation 3: You end up realizing you are not really spending your advertising $ wisely, as you and your ""supporters"" get nothing in return, because you already spent all that $ to acquire them in the first place  Enter Centive  1. We're not telling you to stop using social media. Infact, we love social media and the convenience it brings 2. You get aboard Centive platform, not only because it's cheaper, and that you could literally pay for performance, BUT you can also engage your ""supporters"" in many creative ways - amongst them rewarding them directly for supporting you. 3. Point is, if you're adding value to the ecosystem, you can start with zero, but still end up with something. We believe this is something that will empower small businesses to succeed. After all, not everyone has the $ to do marketing.",False
