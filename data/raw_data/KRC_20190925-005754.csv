Kure Pay is a trifecta payment system solution based on block chain technology. There is one e-wallet, one payment gate and one debit / credit card in it. E purses, as well as local funds, debt / credit, crypto coins and selected global e-wallets can be used in a convenient way.  The team is built around experts in areas such as Software development, Finance, or Law, and shows that they have experience in all areas needed to be successful. They want to be seen as ""Ethereum of Africa"" but their teams are not entirely African, they could expand the software development space a little bit, but their squad seems to have enough potential.",False
