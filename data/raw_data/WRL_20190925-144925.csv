WHIRL is a socially driven, “pay it forward”-style crowdfunding platform that’s built on the blockchain. On WHIRL, you can only submit a fundraising campaign after you’ve donated to others, creating a positive feedback loop of generosity. WHIRL is inspired by historic community giving funds, but uses blockchain technology to enable anyone to participate, regardless of currency or geography. WHIRL is reinventing philanthropy by helping global nonprofits and charitable organizations access a new source of capital.   Mission  To globally improve the quality of the living via organizing WHIRL, a place where people will be helping each other and forget about loans and debts. Place for everyone, no matter what financial status you have.    What makes WHIRL different?  WHIRL is unique in many ways, but here are three major differences: (1) We limit the number of campaigns that can raise money at one time and prioritize them using a fair and transparent queuing system. (2) You can only create a campaign after you’ve contributed to others. And (3) You can transact with cryptocurrency, making WHIRL a truly global platform.    How WHIRL works    In the beginning, WHIRL will list one fundraising campaign at a time to maximize exposure. Campaigns can cover any category (within WHIRL’s terms of service), from help paying medical bills to support starting or expanding a business.  You can donate to campaigns directly with crypto or fiat. In return, you’ll receive 7 karma points for every dollar you spend. If you own WHIRL’s cryptocurrency, WRL, you’ll earn 10 karma per dollar. (Supporting the campaign with partner crypto, like KICK, will earn you 8.5 karma per dollar.) If you donate to a campaign from a featured nonprofit or charitable organization, you earn a bonus to karma.  Once you reach 500 karma, you’re eligible to submit a campaign of your own. Tell WHIRL more about your campaign and fill out a KYC form. A moderator will review the campaign and, if it complies with site guidelines, they’ll approve it for the queue.  If you work for a recognized nonprofit or charity organization, WHIRL will give your campaign access to one of two special featured placements. WHIRL will also waive platform fees, fast-track your placement, and incentivize backers with bonus karma.  WHIRL uses a fair and transparent queuing system that prioritizes those with the most karma, but won’t forget you if you’ve been waiting a long time. No matter what, if you’ve entered the queue, your campaign will get listed.  Sometimes, disaster strikes and funds are needed quickly. If your fundraising campaign ties directly to an urgent humanitarian crisis (like a natural disaster), WHIRL can fast-track it.  Once your campaign has finished fundraising, your karma resets and the next campaign goes live. Now that you’ve had a successful raise, you’ll be excited to support others and immediately begin to work your way back to a new campaign. WHIRL anticipates that 90% of campaign creators will immediately begin the process anew.    Charitable Giving  Reinventing social giving and philanthropy is one of WHIRL's core values. WHIRL will partner with leading non-profit organizations to give them white glove access to the platform. These organizations will pay no campaign listing fees and have their campaigns featured in a special ""charity"" slots. WHIRL members who donate to these campaigns will also receive a major Karma boost.
