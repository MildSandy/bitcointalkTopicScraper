Other token issuers burn coins as a way to decrease supply to boost their share price artificially as a way to bring value to the people that have their tokens. We, on the other hand, are worried about price stability more than the price. Makers of Cryptocurrency need to understand that they need to act as a central authority in their ecosystem. The ability to create and issue cryptocurrencies gives them that ability to do that. To be that a central authority that can bring price stability.    A mandate to guarantee the currency’s stability is required for cryptocurrencies to become mass adopted. The word issuer reminds people too much of banks or central bank authorities. Cryptocurrencies also need to have elastic qualities like fiat dollars. Fiat dollars need to adjust to the supply as a means of payment that’s in line with transaction demands. Laccoin will expand our base monetary supply buy purchasing LAC tokens at market rates on the secondary markets. This is one avenue that creates price stability. This also maximizes the rewards for people using Laccoin which achieves a certain amount of price-stability, and serving as a store of value.  Volatility, upside or downside, creates an unstable value for the end user. As previously mentioned, Laccoin will buy tokens in the open market for rewards those rewards will also be distributed to the LAC Union Wealth Fund.  Laccoin will be able to buy back coin in high frequencies, particularly in times of market stress but also in times of normalcy. The Elasticity Reserve Fund will also take into account the unsold coins from the public ICO, and shift them towards the elasticity reserve. The elasticity reserve within the company has a capacity of up to 12% of the total supply for liquidity and elasticity demands. The higher the rate of LAC adoption, the lower the need for Laccoin to hold substantial reserves, as increase in usage creates stability.   Thanks for the question.",False

As for the banking license, there are some countries within areas that we can apply for a Series A banking licenses. There are countries where the conditions are more favorable than others to obtain a Series A banking license. There are three options that we can choose from.  A) Obtain a permit for a Series A banking license that is selling their license  B) Start the process when we have the necessary paperwork and capital to obtain a Series A banking license.  C) Partner with an existing bank to use there Series A banking license.  We can do this in Belize, St. Vincent and Panama. We have an ongoing talk with the Belizean government about our projects and the discussions have been ongoing as our team is a mix of people that have worked within the banking industry, and the public sphere, especially in that region.  It puts us in a perfect position to realize our roadmap and goals.  In the end, the jurisdiction which is favorable to our terms and the future growth of Laccoin is the path one that we will pick.
