We really are wanting to grow a community of people who are wanting to work together to take control of their own situation. Property is a passion of ours and is why we have targeted this area. This is something i have been wanting to achieve since my days in Mortgage Broking as a property investment specialist. We were always stifled by the banks who wanted far too much control over the situation. We have found a way where we can bring people together and you leverage of each other rather than the bank leaching off you.  Mike England",False

I was just reading an article, its a good one, they compared ICO raising capital to current IPO and made this statement.......""So, yes it is broken. The innovation capital business does need fixing. Whether some variant of the ICO is the fix is what we now turn our attention to."".......and when I consider that statement where someone who may have knowledge of the financial industry and writes about it states it is broken, yet the regulators are more concerned with stopping something growing that is currently worth 220 billion instead of fixing something that is 200 trillion, or higher. That is 1 thousand times larger that the coin market cap, get that 1 thousand times larger.   And another article I read talked about the howey test and whether a token is a security, and part of forming an opinion about whether a token/coin is a security is making a decision surrounding 3rd involvement for the service or product to work, therefore adding value to the token/coin. The problem there of course is that everything needs some 3rd party involvement, everything has someone else involved to make it better, which means the regulators have their definitions so vague that the compliance people within the various industries and companies choose to err on the side caution when in comes to doing business.  I have seen it countless time within the financial industry when a compliance manager questions you on the way you are doing something minor and wants you to implement major changes, and all at the cost to the client. in fact the client doesn't even come into the conversation until the conversation is complete, they are never even considered during the entire process. So to conclude, why cant the current law enforcers enforce the law, if somebody is doing the wrong this it really isn't that hard to prove. David really needs the community to help this time, because its going to take more than a slingshot to bring down Goliath...  Does anyone else agree...I would love to know your thoughts!",False

We were able to trace the details of the recent Tether fraud to where it came from. And we even worked out it was from the same person as once or even twice before.  The scammers that take money anywhere from Crypto are doing it illegally and should be prosecuted. But it seems that we say the system is not regulated so we can do whatever we like. We say it is decentralised and free from authority. So we need to discuss all this openly, but we also need stronger leaders within the community to tell the banks to politely go away. We will control this ourselves thank you very much. The banks control the markets that we in this system are opposed to, yet we are allowing them to dictate to us.  Lets rally up and REVOLT. We are gaining traction. I know you said $220 billion Andrew but I just had a quick look and the market cap has grown to $250 Billion. We are now getting stronger. Let us go to the governments and talk to them about what we are. DON'T let the banks via the regulators dictate what we are.  When Standard Chartered continually break the law by allowing money laundering and traffickers to use their services knowingly. At least 3 times they have been fined for breaching the law by far more than the market cap of Crypto. And yet we want them to control this market to. REVOLT.  I am so looking forward to helping Crypto evolve through our Peer to Peer Property platform. By getting property into the crypto markets will help get some stability to it.  ",False

As part of our Peer to Peer Property Platform we will be putting up various investing opportunities that we have. We are currently working on a deal with at least a 20% return on your investment. We will have this available to the community straight after the token sale.  Here are the quick numbers for a deal we are considering.  $75,000 Block $85,000 House $50,000 Landscaping and Marketing  That only $210,000  Houses in this area are going for around $300,000 upwards for a standard 3 bed home. So marketed correctly we can make a good amount of money through this investment. We will be looking at having this investment be turned over inside 2 months.  Now these figures are at this stage just for demonstration purposes. We will offer a much more comprehensive report on the platform to allow all token holders to evaluate the best deal for them. In this project we have targeted an area that is desperate for low cost housing. We will be putting this investment on the platform. Along with many other deals. This is just one deal in particular that we have been working on. We have also had a couple of opportunities we have put aside to focus on this project.  Does this type of property investment deal interest you? If you could put $50-$50,000 into this and get a 20-30% return in 2 months would you be willing to invest? ",False

The projects we are looking at are low cost housing type projects. House renovations. Subdivide/Split land into 2 sections. Mainly along the residential housing scale. We are concentrating on the low cost housing developments as we have found a high demand for this worldwide. However on the platform we will have whatever the community brings to the platform. Bring the deal and see if the market feels it is good for them. We are targeting fast turnarounds. The housing projects we are looking at will be finished in 2-4 months with a 20% ROI.  However with fractional ownership these parcels can be traded between parties in a Peer to Peer manner too. However once a project is underway all aspects will be secured. We are also offering a guarantee on all of the projects through the platform. This way we can ensure the parties involved always get their returns.  It could be buying and selling too. We will have a listing app available as part of the whole platform. However you will note that we have a listing app being developed in the first quarter. However, we may have something in the pipeline coming out before the end of the Token Sale. This is to try to build up traction and subscribers all the way along.  So with a lot of small projects being promoted continually it stimulates the token sales which in turn stimulates the value of the token.",False
