Why did the development team not let us know about this decision of not being listed on bigger exchanges untill now?

First of all, I apologize that I was absent for a while longer. Now I am available for you as usual.  On the subject of marketing and advertising, there is only to say that not much emphasis is placed on it. BitIndia spreads automatically through propaganda and through Twitter, for example.  As has been recognized correctly, big hype also means that many people will push the price after launch. This is not our goal, our goal is to connect India to the Crypto phenomenon and start a huge project together.

Besides some news about ""Meet our Founders in Dubai"", I quickly received two e-mails stating that ""BitIndia ICO is Live"" with an Ethereum address in the e-mail - in contrast to that ""only 200 ETH Minimum investments, please first register on our website""-mentality. I do not know whether BitIndia was hacked during that time, all I know is that all e-mails came from the same e-mail address ico@bitindia.co. --> E-Mails and Newsletter are either not aligned with overall strategy, or it is fraud and they hope to get some more tokens besides that ""minimum 200 ETH"" thing, or they are just incompetent to identify hacks and to clarify the danger in public  - In the e-mails, always a minimum of 200 ETH is stated, on the website it is 150 ETH --> incompetency  - When I first read into the project (must be 25. September) there were links to a Slack channel everywhere: bitindiaofficial.slack.com As I see Slack as the best communication tool I registered to find out, that it seems to be the second slack channel (as ""BitIndia Official"" stated that due to spam they opened a new one). However, it was completely empty, and only a few questions (the easiest ones) were answered by ""Bitcoin Official"". I asked them on Telegram whether they have a Slack channel and they said ""No"". I sent them the address and asked them to clarify whether this slack channel is official or not - they never did that. They also did not answer my questions about BitIndia on Telegram  - While Telegram is only a one-way communication channel with the developer alone (well, it was apparently, now they changed it and have 30 members) and the before-mentioned Slack channel is either official and empty or fake (and empty), they have a very big Facebook and Twitter community... think about that what you want.   Last but not least a list of questions of a Slack user, which I found quite interesting. I also sent these questions to BitIndia in their telegram channel, but they never answered:     I do not want to believe this is fraud (esp. with McAfee involved in it). However, the inconsistencies in communication, the lack of any fanbase on Slack / Telegram / Bitcointalk and the intransparent ICO details make me think that it is indeed either fraud (and McAfee fell for it) or a very, very incompetent team - both is very bad for any investments.",False

The Bitindia Wallet will have these features:  1. End-to-End Encrypted  All the sensitive user account data is stored in encrypted format on zero knowledge secure-storage, that makes the data hack proof, even team at Bitindia cannot access your wallet.  2. Encrypted Keystore backup  a. All the important encryption related to the security of user's cryptocurrency will happen on the client side b. BitIndia will not have access to the user private keys and since servers never know your private keys, your web browser or mobile devices encrypts or decrypts your keys on-demand using your passwords. c. It stores the wallet backups securely in an encrypted format on our servers to ensure you, that you can access your wallet from any of your different devices.  3. Multi Layer Security Unlike most of the wallets have only a single security layer to access the account, BitIndia wallet has multi-layered secured login mechanism. The users are required to create a login password which cannot be changed once created and further the users will be asked to set up a 2 factor authentication.  4. Transaction Password  Whenever a BitIndia wallet user wants to perform a transaction it can only be done by entering a transaction password which would be different from the login password. This would serve as an added layer of security in case where a user password is lost or stolen. The transaction will be initiated when both the transaction passwords along with the 2 Factor Authentications are entered.    5. Wallet Mnemonic  A nemonic is the passphrase seed of your BitIndia Wallet provided to you when you create a new wallet. The purpose of this is in case you need to recover your wallet at a later date, if you lose your login information. It is a secure account recovery mechanism  6. Secured Notification  If there any kind of changes to be performed in the BitIndia wallet such as changing the 2FA preference, resetting the transaction password etc. They can only be completed using the 2FA preference which may be a google authenticator app/ SMS OTP.",False
