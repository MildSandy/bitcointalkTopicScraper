Website: www.thortoken.com  Whitelist sign up: sale.thortoken.com  White paper (English): https://indd.adobe.com/view/d7c8c663-91e6-45e0-8342-517f36e7b515  White paper (Chinese): https://www.dropbox.com/s/545upckqzosi4e4/ThorToken_Whitepaper_Chinese.pdf?dl=0  Join our Telegram group: https://t.me/joinchat/F-UKj1Md5AilZgV9zU0Dwg  Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Thortoken  Token: THOR (NEP-5 Token)  Participants must register and get whitelisted to participate! KYC is required.  Individual cap: There will be a $2000 (NEO + Gas) purchasing limit for every buyer for the first twenty-four (24) hours of the sale. This will be to give as many buyers as possible the opportunity to receive the early round bonus, and to make sure that the ordinary token buyers are not crowded out by large buyers.  Bonus Breakdown: The first round will contain 10 million tokens. The buyers in the first round will receive a 25% token bonus, vested in equal amounts over six months, airdropped monthly, after the completion of the Token Sale.  The second round will contain 5 million tokens. The buyers in the second round will receive a 10% token bonus, vested in equal amounts over six months, airdropped monthly, after the completion of the Token Sale. The final round will contain 5 million tokens.  For example, if a buyer purchases 1000 tokens in the first round, that will cost $1000 at the date of token sale. Then, a bonus of 25%, or 250 tokens, is subsequently paid out each month over six months. So one month after the token sale, 250 / 6 = ~42 tokens are airdropped into the specified wallet. Then, one month later (two months after the token sale), another 42 tokens are airdropped into said wallet and so on for six months.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  What is Thor Token? Thor Token is a San Francisco-based blockchain solution for the Gig Economy built on Neo. We will provide Gig Economy workers access to affordable health care, an extensive job network, and retirement planning, while offering the On Demand companies they work for free paycheck processing. We are creating a blockchain-powered Smart Gig Economy for the future!  Contractor Acquisition: Our contractor acquisition strategy broadly consists of two approaches: B2B partnerships and B2C marketing. Each strategy strengthens the other.  Our immediate approach is to develop partnerships with a number of companies in the Gig Economy. The San Francisco Bay Area is home to countless of these startups, and we have direct relationships with many already. We can offer them paycheck processing for zero cost, which alone should be enough to displace their current providers, in addition to allowing them to offer their contractors access to group policy healthcare. In exchange, we ask that our partners encourage their contractors to receive paychecks via Thor Token. In this way, we share the incentive and strategy for contractor adoption.  The goal of these partnerships is to: (i) demonstrate a working product and value proposition for companies, and (ii) aggregate a base of contractors actively using Thor Token. The more “success stories” we develop with partners, the more credibility we gain when selling to larger companies.  Concurrently, we will establish B2C marketing capability. This consists of a cross-channel approach, including: - SEO optimization that reduces our cost of SEM - Publishing relevant content about cryptocurrency, paycheck providers, healthcare options, and retirement accounts via social media and our blog, which improves our SEO and SEM - SEM on Google, Yahoo, and Bing - Programmatic advertising on platforms used by contractors (e.g., LinkedIn, Facebook, Craigslist, Indeed.com, Monster.com, TaskRabbit, etc.) - A referral program that pays users for signing contractors up with Thor Token  The ultimate goal of our B2B and B2C strategies is to work with the largest partners, companies like Uber, Upwork, Lyft, and TaskRabbit. The best way to close a partnership with these companies is not only with our core value proposition, but by demonstrating that we have a set of their contractors already on our platform. It is much easier to partner with a company like Uber if we already have 10,000 Uber drivers using Thor Token for healthcare.  Why blockchain: Blockchain records and transfers data that is transparent, safe, and auditable.  Because blockchain rests upon a distributed network, it is resistant to outages. Blockchain makes data and organizations that leverage this technology transparent, democratic, decentralized, efficient, and secure. Thor Token uses SHA256 encryption on all user information to ensure privacy and security. Smart contracts built on blockchain platforms allow for instantaneous pay and are not susceptible to the breaches of trust freelancers often experience when trying to receive payment. Together, blockchain-enabled currencies and smart contracts will be the secret sauce that makes Thor Tokens a revolutionary solution to the ailments of the Gig Economy.  According to a 2014 study, one in every two freelancers had trouble getting paid that year, and 71% of respondents cited trouble collecting payment at some point in their career. Even worse, they reported being shorted an average of nearly $6,000 a year. But moving freelancers and contractors onto a blockchain network will alleviate most if not all of these payment issues.  In the traditional economy, companies own and control all employee data, payment history, and reviews. They are also the gateways for workers to receive benefits like health insurance and retirement plans. This model creates friction for the worker and makes it challenging if not impossible to sustain coverage from one job to the next.  In the blockchain-enabled Smart Economy, Gig Workers own and control their employment history and reviews. They can maintain a single health insurance and retirement plan from gig to gig, because their place in the Thor Token network will remain constant even if their employment with a particular On-Demand company is not.  Additionally, utilizing blockchain technology will allow Thor Token to use Tokenomics for the financial benefit of its users, providing discounted goods and services simply for using and holding Thor Tokens. Furthermore, Tokenomics will allow Thor Token to manage the stability of the network, maintaining security for the users involved.  Why NEO: Smart contracts are the instruments that record data and store blocks of information onto the blockchain. As more and more companies seek to store data onto the blockchain, speed becomes an issue. But revolutionary platforms like NEO are circumventing the issue by allowing 10,000 transactions a second — all without a transaction cost. This is an important reason that we have opted to build Thor Token on the NEO platform as opposed to a competing platform such as Ethereum. Thor Token will be one of the first U.S.-based companies to utilize the NEO platform, but it almost certainly will not be the last.
