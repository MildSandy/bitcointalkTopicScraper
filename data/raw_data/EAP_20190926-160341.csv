EOS AUCTION PLATFORM is an auction platform based on EOS. EOS AUCTION PLATFORM connects the auction market to the blockchain and then we provide a solution that allows anyone to easily and easily participate in auctions and create pages that can be auctioned in an easy way.  The EAP Platform is under development with a total of six main functions.  Network Module = Mechanism for Connecting Users Chain Module = Mechanism for Blockchain Wallet Module = Mechanism for Payment Bid Module = Mechanism for Smart Auction History Module = Mechanism for Smart Price Producer Module = Access to Multiple Exchanges Through One interface  In order to meet the needs of users in a wide variety of markets and fast, convenient, we are in the process of developing the platform with the functions per module.   Problem of auction market The uncertainty of pricing information due to the pursuit of profit by auctioneers and low accessibility Excess fees due to the growth of the auctioneer (Auction broker) Unbalance of auction market due to enlargement of auction company  1. CLOSED PRICE     Some of the auctioneers (brokers) keep their existing auctions and the auction history privately in order to earn high profits without following the pricing of the economic principles and the supply law.  2. PARTICIPATION RESTRICTION     Some auctions are running a membership system to raise commodity prices. Due to the high membership conditions, the same opportunities are not available to everyone. There are also cases where auctioneers lose     confidence in the auction market due to false bidding for making membership information private and raising prices.  3. HIGH COMMISSION     The auction needs a charging fee because it costs a lot of money to proceed. However, adding a base 10% ~ 30% auctioneer's feeand some 10% ~ 40% Success Fees to some auction houses adds to the burden on all     participants in the auction market.  4. ISSUES OF LARGE COPRATIONS     Due to the large size of global auctions, problems such as price unification, massive buying, and capital attack on opposing forces appear in auction markets around the world as in other markets.   Solution plan Build auction history data using block chain technology and decentralize the auction market centered on auctioneer (intermediaries) into a transparent and efficient market based on open data  1. FREE commission     Utilizing block-chain technology, the EAP team charges 0% for the user in principle. We will charge a fee of 0.002% for users who generate some bulk traffic.  2. Decentralization     Decentralization is one of the key elements of the block chain technology, and we think it is the most appropriate way to implement a real P2P transaction method. The concept of decentralization itself is to allow users     to trade at their own chosen price without the need of brokers, and thus the unnecessary commission is reduced and trading market growth is expected.  3. Convenient direction     The goal of the EAP team is to achieve scalability on a user base. For this reason, our team is developing APIs and SDKs so that anyone can easily create a new auction site through user interface development and our     platform to provide the best web-based environment. Smart contract allows anyone to easily access the auction function.  4. Various platforms     Through the block chain technology of EAP platform, it can be linked to various partner sites automatically, and it is developed to be used in various mobile and desktop by creating a single auction page.   What market is being discussed? Our EAP team intends to develop platforms focused on these areas. By applying the characteristics of the Blockchain technology to the auction market (industry) rather than the growth figures, auction companies, auctioneers, and bidders build platforms to win-win all due to fair transactions and we will focus on increasing the amount of platform usage. The selection of key markets may change depending on market conditions, regulations, and partners.  1. ART Market The art auction market was $ 16.9billion dollars traded in 2016. The Asian art market accounts for 40.5% of the total, which is the largest in the world. We are preparing to focus on Asia market first.  2. WINE Market The global wine auction market is trading at an average of $ 300million dollars a year. The Asia Market is based on Hong Kong and is renewing its record every year. On our platform, we are preparing to apply a new wine register traceable system.  3. REAL ESTATE Market Most of the real estate auctions are administered by the government. It is centrally controlled from the pricing method. We want to selectively build platforms from decentralized real estate auctions through MOUs with Asian real estate specialists.  4. Other Market We plan to add new markets sequentially. We are going to develop the development according to the needs of each market. Additional tokens may be issued as market conditions and legal requirements arise.
