In a world where banks and payment gateways have the upper hand on their clients’ payments, achieving a fee free immediate transaction environment via seamless platform integration is key.  Saascoin further recognizes that buyers and sellers of virtual goods and services need a complimentary virtual currency that returns complete control of transactions to those transacting.  Traditional Payment Gateway Challenges   Efficient revenue collection is a vital process for any business, especially in the SaaS industry, where most businesses adopt a premium subscription model.  In these use cases, collection should be as simple as possible for both the consumer and the business.  Unfortunately, this is not the current reality.  Problems arise due to differing reasons. These include customer payment model prefer-ences as well as payment methods themselves.  An example is the Eurobond, where most transactions happen via direct debit cards, and not credit cards as is prevalent in the Unit-ed States.  Catering to these customer preferences can limit the expansion of a SaaS business.  If a business was focused on expansion into Europe, but unable to cater to direct debit on a recurring basis, customers would either shy away from subscribing or alternatively churn relatively quickly.  SaaS, in a globalizing world, is in need of a simple and dynamic payment framework that enables monthly recurring revenue collection irrespective of geographic challenges.   Solution  Saascoin is designed as a next-generation blockchain-based payment gateway.  It is genuinely tailored for the needs of SaaS businesses, powering these companies with a platform that solves most, if not all, of their current payment gateway obstacles.  Saascoin aims to disrupt the current payment processing industry by providing a trustworthy, transparent, safe, and reliable payment gateway platform, while also eliminating the pain points of payment gateway fees, chargebacks, and associated administrative headaches existing in the current relationship model with gateways.
