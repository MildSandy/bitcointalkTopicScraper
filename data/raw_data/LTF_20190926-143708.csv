Therefore, the name Letsfair refers to the fair practice of economic liberalism.  The goal of the Letsfair project is to build a shared economy network, which in practice, is a marketplace for many types of apps. Our biggest challenge is to promote a decentralized work organization.  To give you a better picture, imagine that an entrepreneur wants to perform a project, and that this will be possible with Letsfair: they can look for skilled professionals from many fields; check each of their reputations; assemble a decentralized work team; divide the property rights among the participants; make the payments, and at the end, have his project fully developed and completed.  This is our mission: to decentralize work relations.  The guiding principles for Letsfair are By using technology, we can assure that users take true control of their own data; Offer tools for the users to build a multidimensional reputation, which will measure many human features, enabling them to have a value; Enable the creation of work agreements between people for building commercial relations and decentralized projects; Establish guarantees for the right of digital property; Offer payment and negotiation tools, which is key to close deals.  Therefore, with all currently available and emerging technologies, such as blockchain, it is possible and feasible to build this project, ensuring that its principles fit into the free market, strengthening the establishment of shared economy, or in other words, “Uberization.”  Token Details Token Symbol: LTF Token Sale Model: NoICO Contract: 0x411A81C8Cd604941be13dBBD33B54e6f25d84683 Max Supply: 1,000,000,000 Letsfair tokens Release Period: 5 years (Jan 2018 – Jan 2023)  What is NoICO The Letsfair team has conceived a new concept to obtain investments, called NoICO.

It is the act of relying on analysis based on past experiences. However, it cannot be defined as something rational and predictable. Trust empowers people to connect securely with the unknown. Human beings are exceptional in giving votes of confidence. An example of this is the fact that we share our credit card information on websites. We rely on trust for our lives to work.  According to Rachel Botsman, a world-renowned authority on the power of collaboration and trust, technology is profoundly altering the trust-building model between people. In her presentation at TED in 2016 [1], entitled “We’ve stopped trusting institutions and started trusting strangers”, she stated:     Airbnb, Uber, BlaBlaCar and Tinder are just a few examples of mechanisms that allow its members to rely on strangers. A change is underway, the transition from “institutional trust” to “distributed trust.”  Republished from Letsfair Blog: https://letsfair.org/blog/trust-the-currency-of-reputation-economy/",False
