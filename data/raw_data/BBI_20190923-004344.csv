In addition to having live verifiable products and licenses, BELUGA’s acquiringbank is a financial institution with over $70B in assets""....its must be a JOKE, how can you take it seriously. On this post it says ""Beluga has a global, perpetual licensing agreement with Espiralapp.com"", and on their whitepaper roadmap it says that on 2017 Q3 ""Binding Letter of Intent signed between Beluga Foundation to acquire all assets and rights to Espiral’s team and technology""....a LETTER OF INTENT only, signed by a Foundation that DOESN'T EXIST YET. On the same roadmap it says that latter on it WILL establish the Beluga Foundation, a Swiss or Cayman Islands entity.

The distribution of ""Funds raised for the ico"" is only the other 40%. Your list only shows how that 40% is distributed, just like the first poster you made.

I didnt claim. i said ""I think"". Thats very different. You did never answear my question about revenue made in cryptocurrency. So how much is the revenue? The different between you and the other payment option is that you make payment through crypto currency available. But if no one uses that service it has close to no value. That is why I was asking. And you didnt respond, you deleted my post.  This is a forum where users can debate why/why not to invest in a certain company. It should be about that and not about you getting as much pr as possible.  Why would you lie about answearing my question when you clearly have not?  Kind regards Thomas",False

What you show there is 40% of the money raised being distributed that way. The other 40% you collect to your own pocket. And 20% goes to other operations. All i did was to question the amount of money being collected to private pockets. I think its a whole lot more than it should be for a company at this stage. Its just ridicoulus to value a company, that delivers payment option to 2-300 stores, at 100million dollars. And when you invest, 40% of the money you invest, goes to private pockets and not the company. Thats terrible in my opinion.",False

So they're basically raising a 100 million dollar minimum, thats insane for something that has nothing to show for. If ICO's ask for more as 10 million you should SERIOUSLY question whether it is still worth it cause chances are very likely this money won't be put to work. Team members taking high salaries or plain incapability of handling such large amounts.  100 million or more as that is just being greedy I don't care how big you want to market it or how ''expensive'' your devs are. You're basically giving a startup a 100 million dollar evaluation which is insane. Just monkeys & banana's.  You go to a private investors and ask for that money, they will laugh at you in your face. Why would anyone put such capital into a startup that is more likely to go bust then to become a global player.",False
