I was expecting to hear in deep explanations and was sure that I will meet people (developers, managers, marketers) from the team which will discuss all the hardest concerns but this was not the case.

That is why I started to evaluate Elyqd ICO but this altitude here and a few red flags which popped by research was enough for me to pass on this one.  Lately, I came back to check because this ICO should be already over but I see that is already extended until the end of December. What worries me actually is the lack of communication across all social media channels. I checked them and there are no updates from the team for a long time. Bounty for round one is not distributed and there are many angry people left with no answer in Telegram official chat and bounty channel.  Bounty managers are doing a great job and try to keep answer all questions but they can do nothing if there are no updates from the team or they just delay everything with no proper explanation for bounty managers.

After many suggestions from token holders and consultations with project advisors, we have decided that it is in the best interest of the project to extend the ICO by further 90 days commencing after initial end date on 30th of September 2018.  The recent fluxes in the crypto market took a toll on the value of Bitcoin, Ethereum and many other cryptocurrencies and the celebratory phase came to a major halt. This, following a series of other such unfortunate events, held the interested stakeholders from investing in the eLYQD ICO, which is denominated in fiat exchanges instead of cryptocurrencies. For example, 1 ETH is equal to 1000 tokens, but if ETH drops by 50%, you get only 50% of the estimated tokens.  The community and supporters of the eLYQD have brought this matter to light and eLYQD has taken note of the same. Given the current volatility in the markets and the increasing demand for LYQD tokens, the eLYQD’s management team has henceforth decided to extend the sale period.  We will restructure the token values from the beginning by giving an equal opportunity to everyone, who could not avail the tokens in the initial crowdfunding rounds due to the declining crypto market conditions.  The ICO will be extended by 90 days after the initial end date to have time to continue marketing & pursuing investments/partnerships.  As the market is gradually recovering from massive price declines that were experienced in Q3 2018 and investor confidence is slowly creeping in. We believe this extension in the current market uptrend will help us achieve the aim of the ICO.  New ICO end date = 30th December 2018, 23:00 PM UTC or until the hard cap is reached.  We say a big thank you for your understanding and support up until this point and beyond.  Regards, eLYQD Team  ",False

I see that ICO is extended until the end of this year which is common lately. Almost 75% of ICO extended fundraisings in the last half year.  The most important thing is a still falling price of ETH and BTC because Elyqd ICO is funded with this cryptocurrencies.  Such a long ICO's cause problems with correct token price assumption.

As you see we have already discussed this subject. That was my first question to the eLYQD team too  .  Just think you don't buy a new Mercedes on the open market or even universal dealership with a lot of different cars only by exclusive Mercedes dealer.  Vapor industry is new and growing very fast. I think the key to success is to be an exclusive marketplace like eLYQD because We have already Syscoin, Openbaaar, and many other open decentralized P2P marketplaces and I don't see any vendors or buyers there, despite they are open for everybody. If something is for everybody then nobody will use it, I assume. I see almost no listings on this marketplaces especially from big retailers, I see only a few listings from private people. This is not second Ebay for sure.  I think you have to read the eLyqd white paper to understand this subject better. The eLYQD marketplace will have a lot of tools which will make it safe and very easy to use. Escrow, rating system, delivery, buyers and sellers check, and many more.

Q. What is the benefit for the investor if he buys your token? A. We would love to say 'the sky is the limit', but let's be realistic. There isn't any product or service that hasn't been invented already. We are not trying to reinvent the wheel here. We analyzed the vaping industry in depth, used its performance data to better understand the market, the consumers, the products, the manufacturers and the pricing/transaction structure. We discovered the weak links in the chain and improvised and integrated the decentralized blockchain element into the mix and created a completely new business model. To make matters more lucrative, there isn't any other vaping industry marketplace out there in the crypto world. Hence, we can confidently say that this is the biggest benefit (incentive) for an investor when there is no competition out there.  Q. What will be the growth of your token? A. That's what it all boils down to at the end of the day really! If you are a long-term holder or a day trader, the green candles on the chart are a welcome sight. But who can predict if the value of the token price will rise or fall? We assure you that we can't foresee the future, but we are determined to make sure hard work will bear fruit in the end. There are many elements that control the outcome of an ICO from its initial launch to getting listed on an exchange. a) Token supply: Token cap, token buyback, token creation by 3rd party/project. b) Token demand: Services offered - logistics, loyalties, feedbacks, discounts, promotions, referrals etc. c) Market size: Projecting the growth of a business model is based on current numbers. The core of this estimation is taking a transaction (customer pays token, manufacturer provides service) and scaling it up. Let's process this via an example: A manufacturer showcases their product in the eLYQD marketplace, selling an e-liquid bottle for $10, and the customer has to buy it in ""LYQD tokens"", which they can exchange on any P@P exchanges. The manufacturer expects to sell at least 500 bottles of that e-liquid flavor per month based on the demographics. To determine the product market size, manufacturer calculates (items sold * price), so (500 *12 * $10) = a market size of $60,000 yearly for the first year on one product/flavor.  Coming back to the topic of 'Will the LYQD token rise in value after it's ICO?' Investing always has associated risks attached to it, and it will never be risk-free. Our ICO is a less risky project that has a disclosed market size bottom-up, with a product that is an in-demand commodity and favorable for crypto adoption.  We, at eLYQD can be as strong as you can make us become. Regards, eLYQD team",False

The Direct-To-Consumer movement. While it already began a few years back, these brands and entrepreneurs are now in every industry, changing the habits, preferences, and share of wallet of the most desirable consumers.  An underlying principle of e-commerce is to skip the costs and logistics of using a retail middleman to sell directly. Let's not even consider the benefits of eco-commerce, decentralization or blockchain yet. The Internet didn’t invent the idea of cutting out the middleman. But it has certainly facilitated the growth and practicality of the practice, and it’s popular. After all, the lack of a retail markup makes products less expensive for the consumer (and potentially more profitable for product manufacturers).  If physical stores are no longer essential to the customer experience required to market your products, you no longer need wholesalers to distribute your products—and retail locations no longer add to the cost for the end-user.  Hence, by having wholesalers or retailers marketing products that are not manufactured by them, completely defeats the purpose of what eLYQD is trying to achieve.  Skip the middleman. Buy direct.

However, this leads to some confusion about how privacy and transparency can effectively coexist.  The transparency of a blockchain stems from the fact that the holdings and transactions of each public address are open to viewing. Using an explorer, and equipped with a user’s public address, it is possible to view their holdings and the transactions that they have carried out. This level of transparency has not existed within financial systems before, especially in regards to large businesses, and adds a degree of accountability that has not existed to date.  It is in this way that blockchain gives large businesses a platform to act with genuine integrity towards their community and customers. However, blockchain has the potential to add transparency not only to the financial aspect of the business.  Rest assured, there are expenses involved to run an operation and being a blockchain marketplace, it's all transparent for you to see!  Regards, eLYQD team",False
