Provided our broad experience in blockchain technologies and an extremely talented technical team, we found a way how to benefit the whole blockchain community with something new, that will allow it to surpass existing challenges of blockchain adoption. The challenges, that oppress the Ethereum public blockchain and the whole crypto market.  PPR tokens will become core vehicle in Papyrus Network to access its bandwidth. Papyrus Test Network launch is planned for November 2018. Read more: 👉 https://blog.papyrus.global/meet-papyrus-network-c942a31a52e4",True

It might be a bit early to say much about it, since they seem to be on a quite early stage right now with no actual product to see (according to the WP their beta launch is planned on Oct. 2018). They aim to eradicate fraudulent traffic and bring transparency using blockchains and smart contracts, which sounds promising, but technically not clear - how all of the ad events would be processed using regular blockchains? Papyrus has released its specific solution for that in a form of blockchain scalability for such immense amounts of data. So as for now it seems they have strong emphasis made on eradicating fraudulent financial sources and financial control, while Papyrus has wider range of implementations with its full processing of all the ad events going through.

Despite this fact, advertising is one of the worlds most unproductive and opaque industries due to a variety of factors. One of the major reasons for its inefficiency is that all parties in the advertising value chain are continuously looking for new technical tricks to gain a competitive advantage at the expense of other players. To combat fraud, which costs advertisers approximately $51 million per day, and eliminate users’ growing frustration with the irrelevance, invasiveness, and obstructive nature of online advertisements, Papyrus has introduced blockchain based smart contracts to the advertising and publishing industry.  Papyrus, the world’s first fully comprehensive and scalable blockchain ecosystem for digital advertisers, publishers, and developers has launched its Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The innovative technology removes the inefficiencies and dramatic challenges of the industry and aims to develop a disruptive digital advertising platform using a combination of integrated technologies that transform and unite the entire digital advertising market into a single comprehensive ecosystem, offering unmatched transparency, fraud reduction, security and cost effectiveness. All calculations between advertisers and publishers are controlled by smart contracts with automatic restrictions on payments depending on the quality of results as verified by independent verification service suppliers.

Papyrus is the world’s first decentralized programmatic value management platform. Digital advertising market of $229B is plagued by fraud traffic, brand safety issues, excessive middleman cuts, and absence of supply chain transparency.  Papyrus is an open source scalable blockchain platform specifically designed to fight with these issues. Unlike other existing blockchains it has unique features that make it feasible solution for practical adoption: low transaction costs, privacy management, execution of smart contracts based on large volume of data. Our advertising ecosystem will significantly improve the whole digital ads market by giving it full transparency, trust, fraud reduction and other real benefits for all involved parties. The main Papyrus difference is that no other project has it’s own scalable blockchain solution for smart contracts execution on top of large data arrays, while Papyrus developed such solution and is applying it to digital ads market. Considering universality of Papyrus blockchain solution it can be applied to other industries.  We have successfully finished the TGE Round 1 and already built MVP in the form of an advertising network that demonstrates its capacity to solve scalability issue.  TGE Round 2 will start in a short time. For more info please visit https://papyrus.global/  P.S. We kindly ask you not to use this bot for spamming.

Papyrus: Decentralized Advertising Ecosystem,"Papyrus MVP Official Release  Papyrus is launching its MVP that consists of an advertising network using blockchain architecture to enable the transparent purchase of advertising inventory. All calculations between advertisers and publishers are controlled by smart contracts with automatic restrictions on payments depending on the quality of results as verified by independent verification service suppliers. The MVP is deployed on Ethereum TestNet Rinkeby and will be launched in Ethereum MainNet after the second Token Generation Event. The Papyrus Channel Layer is the key feature of the MVP, executing smart contracts over large datasets collected by network participants. The launch has made it possible to test the scalability of the Papyrus solution and prove its applicability to the programmatic ad market, where the number of ad impressions reaches billions every second. Scalability on data and low infrastructure costs are what differentiate Papyrus from other blockchain solutions. Later this year, Papyrus will launch its open-source blockchain network where the current MVP will be migrated. The Papyrus blockchain network will be an Ethereum fork, which will reduce the cost of smart contracts execution and ensure transaction privacy using dPoS consensus and zero-knowledge proofs. It is a necessity in the advertising market, as media buyers want to keep the structure of their spending confidential. The network will also provide Papyrus developers with a more flexible architecture for modification. Due to its data scalability and privacy protection capabilities, the Papyrus blockchain architecture offers an extensive range of use cases not only within the advertising industry but for all business applications requiring the secure execution of smart contracts based on large data sets and their analysis, notably with AI models. The potential market for the Papyrus network is enormous. In addition to improving the advertising ecosystem, it can be applied to build high-frequency trading solutions backed by smart contracts, automatic loan issuance based on dynamic scoring, and many other scenarios, including in the Internet of Things market. The launch of the MVP is a fundamental step in the development of more products using the Papyrus’ blockchain architecture.  The MVP consists of 3 main parts: Papyrus Advertiser Account and Demand-Side Platform (DSP) backend Papyrus Publisher Account and Supply-Side Platform (SSP) backend Papyrus Viewability Verifier to check if ads are displayed in the viewable area of users’ screen.  More info how does it work: https://blog.papyrus.global/papyrus-mvp-official-release-cd9628ca6c52   Papyrus gives everyone the opportunity to launch an advertising campaign with free test ERC-20 tokens tPPR, released in Ethereum TestNet Rinkeby.  The banner displayed in the Papyrus MVP already works on the main page of our absolutely new website — check it out https://papyrus.global!  To run an advertising campaign, you need to register an Advertiser Account, order free tPPR tokens to your wallet, and create an advertising campaign. The Papyrus team reserves the exclusive right to moderate and select advertising campaigns. If you are a publisher, you can use the MVP to experiment with the placement of ad units. Also, everyone can see what the advertiser’s and publisher’s dashboards look like in demo accounts.   The Papyrus MVP is the first step to many future Papyrus blockchain applications in the advertising market. Papyrus does not plan to develop its own advertising network as a commercial business but focuses on creating an open-source blockchain architecture that will complement all existing platforms and ad networks, providing them with transparent and secure settlements through smart contracts. The goal of Papyrus is to restore the trust lost between market players and significantly enhance the efficiency of the multi-billion dollar digital advertising market.",True

Papyrus: Decentralized Advertising Ecosystem,"One of the biggest problem for digital advertising is ad fraud. The price for that is quite clear — over $16.4 billion and it’s still growing. In digital advertising the transfer of value goes through the following axes: advertiser-publisher-user. Advertisers bid for ad placements, publishers accept the bid, the ad impression is delivered, the ad is filled and the user’s ID is matched with that ad impression ID.  As blockchain is essentially a decentralised storage for all the transactions, and it has proven efficiency in finance and multiple other industries, then it could be a great idea to use in digital advertising, so that the value can be saved and not wasted if we implement mathematical proof and decentralisation, right?  Actually, there’s some doubts that blockchain can change the situation. Recent article by Forbes presents some concerns regarding it. The argumentation is simple: up to this date blockchain technology is very slow to handle that much number of transactions. For instance, Bitcoin’s blockchain process 7 transactions per second, whereas Ethereum’s one — around 13 transactions per second. In case of advertising, a single transaction occurs every time as ad is viewed. With millions of as impressions being delivered every second, it’s just not possible for the current technology development to process that much information.  So the question is really important. Why the Papyrus digital advertising platform will be a game changer?  It’s true that large ad networks and publishers generate hundreds of billions of ad clicks and at least two times more ad impressions annually. Using current technology any attempt to execute smart contracts for digital advertising will generate excessive costs. Our solution utilises an extension of the technology called state channel that is capable of supporting these high loads.  The idea of a state channel is not new. It underlies the scale-up solutions for Bitcoin and Ethereum ( as well as Lightning Network and Raiden Network). Papyrus is one of the first to customize it for the specific needs of AdTech. The technology aggregates state logs from DSPs, SSPs, and auditors. So the realisation of payment is based on the constant log exchange among parties.  In the typical state channels system the transaction takes place when the critical mass of obligations occurs (e.g. Bob owes Alice an amount of $). In the case of adtech, such a system would be feasible because of the need for a revision of impressions/clicks by an external auditor that will come later on. In the Papyrus ecosystem the auditor takes a direct part in the formation of the payment. This system is more efficient for adtech as all parties receive payments after all verification procedures.  Here is an example:  - Participants make deposits in the locker (thereby fixing some of its state) and then directly exchange with each other payments in the form of appropriately drawn up and signed transactions of the relevant block. This changes the balance of deposits in favor of one or the other participant.  - Participants transfer the updated state of the blockchain (in the part related to their deposits) to each other and they can do this arbitrarily (of course, within the limits of deposits) without the costs of carrying out transactions in the detachment.  - The final state is recorded in the blockchain only once — when the channel is closed. Or if one of the participants finds the incorrect behavior of the other. Let’s say that the participants will send about 200 thousand micropayments (for a total of $ 200) through one channel. In our initial assumptions this gives several tens of millions of channel opening / closing transactions per month. This is not trillions of transactions per month, but still too much for immediate processing in a public blockchain.  Papyrus has another solution: we can develop the idea of direct transmission of updates to the state of the blockchain outside of it and apply this approach directly to the opening / closing logic of the channel (originally performed in the blockchain). Let’s look at the opening / closing transactions for the dedicated nodes that will exchange the calculated updates of the public lockdown state with each other only occasionally publishing them to the blockchain itself (to update the balance of payments between the participants). The work of such nodes can be organized as a highly specialized block based on the Proof-of-Stake consensus where the blocks consist exclusively of opening / closing transactions. Participants will make large PoS deposits in a public blockchain and will be penalized for improper handling of these transactions.  To ensure guarantees of invariability and verifiability a specialized blockchain can lean on a public block writing down hashes of its blocks of transactions. Suppose one block of a specialized blockchain contains about 1 thousand transactions of opening / closing channels — in our initial assumptions this gives several tens of thousands of transactions in a public detachment a month. It already looks realistic, for example in the Ethereum network the current daily volume is hundreds of thousands of transactions.  The use of state channel libraries in Papyrus will facilitate the opening and maintaining of a peer-to-peer state channels network. Leveraging the developments of Lightning Network and Raiden Network the Papyrus ecosystem will introduce state channels adopted for usage in decentralized RTB protocol. The overall idea under that is to enhance the scalability of the Papyrus ecosystem.  In the first half of 2018 we are planning to develop and test Papyrus Protostar Release with:  - Libraries for dRTB Event Log Storage  - Libraries for dRTB State Channels Network  - Libraries for Auditor integrations and more.  With 20 connected partners (at the moment) we will present a first approximation of our future digital advertising platform. This is about real work, our passionate and talented team, and the deep desire to make advertising better. Stay tuned!",True

Papyrus: Decentralized Advertising Ecosystem,"   Thank you for you question,  First of all, the main thing about Papyrus is that it is aimed at the whole market of digital advertising, in order to implement the comprehensive solution for its major flaws, such as fraudulent activities, poor advertisement supply chain transparency, brand safety violations and more. Papyrus platform is open and designed for swift integration into the ecosystem of digital advertising, providing pure and mutually beneficial experience for advertising companies, platforms and end-viewers. To deal with such challenges, we have managed to develop a unique solution, linked with blockchain scaling, capable of processing of billions of advertising events per day. There is no analogue solution yet created.  Ad Hive, on the other hand, is strictly aimed at very specific market section of native advertising of video blogging\streaming. It also uses blockhain technology - as a core for its ad supplier-influencer communication, however, we don’t find the goals, functions and purposes of their and our platforms easily comparable.  We are open to any cooperation with any market participants, if it is transparent and brings valuable solutions for the future of digital advertising industry.  The Papyrus team does their best to make our platform bigger and better every day, we are also happy to announce that major news coming in 2 weeks. Stay tuned!",True

Papyrus: Decentralized Advertising Ecosystem,"🔥🔥🔥 Long-awaited announcement on PRP/PPR conversion ratio  As many of our early token buyers have asked about the conversion of their PPR tokens, it is now time to announce our action plan on the adjustment of the PRP/PPR conversion ratio and our upcoming second token generation event (TGE).  First of all, our team is working hard right now to polish the Papyrus MVP and will release it in a few weeks on Ethereum testnet. The MVP will consist of a simplified ad network based on Papyrus technologies, where advertisers can run simple ad campaigns for tokens and publishers can set up ad placements and earn tokens, while Papyrus provides end-to-end transparency and manage payments through smart contracts.  The MVP will utilize Papyrus’ channel layer for data scalability, and everyone will be able to see our technology in action. We will start publishing updates on that process. After releasing its MVP, Papyrus is going to launch the private part of the second TGE.  We are also working on a Papyrus technical white paper that should be ready in a few weeks and will describe our technologies in more detail as well as provide an updated development roadmap.  We believe that our community is of greatest importance for the success of our project, and we want to make our PRP token holders and early supporters happy. That is why we are glad to announce an update to our policy regarding the PRP:PPR conversion ratio.  It was defined in our terms and conditions that the conversion of PRP to PPR would be based on an exchange ratio of 1:24. But since the end of our first TGE, there have been extreme fluctuations in exchange rates and, in general, the ETH and BTC rates have increased significantly. With that in mind, the Papyrus team decided to adjust the PRP:PPR conversion rate to account for the growth of the BTC and ETH rate.  To calculate the new effective exchange rate, we are going to take the closing rate of BTC and ETH (according to the open data from Cryptocompare.com) at the end of TGE Round 1 (November 2, 2017) and the closing rate at the beginning of the private part of TGE Round 2 (the exact date will be confirmed).  The effective exchange rate for PRP:PPR will be calculated by multiplying the ratio 1:24 by the growth of the ETH and BTC prices between the end of TGE Round 1 and the start of the private part of TGE Round 2 weighted in proportion to the volume of tokens purchased in BTC or ETH. The formula will be:   where  A = 75,7531531% (percentage of tokens sold for ETH);  B = 24.2468469% (percentage of tokens sold for BTC);  X1 — (closed ratio ETH / USD 2/11/2017);  Y1 — (closed ratio BTC / USD 2/11/2017);  X2 — (closed ratio ETH / USD on the date of Private part TGE 2 launch);  Y2 — (closed ratio BTC / USD on the date of Private part TGE 2 launch).  So, if BTC and ETH prices are higher than their closing prices on November 2, 2017 — the conversion ratio will be higher, and PRP buyers will be compensated for that growth. According to the formula, the exact exchange rate will not be lower than 1:24 even if BTC and ETH prices go down.  The Papyrus team believes that this is fair to all contributors. We put our contributors’ interest first as we consider them the most valuable source of inspiration and support.  We are glad to have you with us. Stay tuned for updates — there will be even greater news soon!",True

Papyrus: Decentralized Advertising Ecosystem,"Key trends for programmatic advertising in 2018  Programmatic advertising is a form of marketing automation that streamlines the ad buying process with data-driven, automated technology. Basically, it enables to buy and sell ad inventory through computers and algorithms and not just manually.  Mobile advertising will continue to grow  Mobile advertising continues its explosive growth, taking a more significant percentage of all digital and traditional advertising each year. In 2017, global spending on mobile advertising was $143.54 billion. In 2018, this will jump close to $185 billion.  Deep learning boosts targeting quality  Deep learning (a branch of machine learning based on algorithms that attempt to model high-level abstractions in data) has made significant strides in 2016, and it is now being used in many industries beyond software. Thanks to deep learning methods which are employed by innovative retargeting technology providers, advertisers will be able to predict user behavior, calculate the probability of purchasing, and measure value more accurately.  Constant battle for transparency  There are signs that programmatic advertising is entering a mature stage and that it is being cleared up with increasing transparency throughout. We can find evidence of this in many things: from visibility on 1st price auctions, adoption of ads.txt, as well as an increasing number of other attempts to eliminate fraud. To us, this is a huge indication of the strength of the channel and of better things to come in the future.",True

Papyrus: Decentralized Advertising Ecosystem,"Technical Roundup #7  During the last few recent weeks our team has been actively developing our product and is almost ready to launch the first real ad purchase through the Papyrus ecosystem.  We are now testing and improving the beta version of the Papyrus node. The Papyrus node is a set of components developed by our team that is responsible for interacting with the blockchain and providing a gRPC API. All existing software vendors such as DSP, SSP and auditors can interact with ecosystem through this API. In the development of the Papyrus node, our team was able to solve the very difficult issues of highload and scaling.  One of the important tasks solved by the Papyrus node is storing, retrieving, and exchanging data. We have already implemented a local file protocol and begin to test the interaction via IPFS.  A great use of the Papyrus node is in performing validation and the formation of the Papyrus blockchain blocks. Any participant in the chain, including the advertiser and the publisher, can setup the Papyrus node in order to validate the data.  It is with great pride I can say that our team has developed a whole framework for processing blocks that can be used even outside the advertising ecosystem.  In the near future we plan to open the source code of the Papyrus node and provide instructions for deployment on any server.  In order to show the capabilities of Papyrus, we made a small demonstration DSP, which allows you to purchase traffic through the Papyrus ecosystem.    In this DSP you can already create advertising campaigns. To check the correctness of DSP campaign statistics you can do it in a separate amazing software called Papyrus scanner, which we will release in the very soon. The Papyrus scanner is a kind of Etherscanner for the Papyrus blockchain that will allow any member of the ecosystem to check its purchase chains.  Recently we have been actively working on the SSP Gateway, which will allow purchasing inventory from publishers that are not yet fully integrated into the Papyrus ecosystem. We have achieved a lot of success so far, taking into account the support of several RTB protocols.  We are getting very close to the launch of advertising sales through Papyrus!",True

Papyrus: Decentralized Advertising Ecosystem,"53% of Internet users in the US doubt that sharing personal data with companies will enhance user experience. It’s hard to deny the fact that personal data is becoming one of the most valuable assets in the contemporary world. Just a few decades ago it was not as important, but now personal data is very valuable.  When it comes to our online activity personal data includes not only common socio-demographic characteristics of users, but also browsing habits, the content we share with friends, search history, and much more. This information is very useful for companies that want to know your habits, desires, and tendencies to better target and advertise their products and services. Raw data in itself isn’t that useful,- but properly collected and analyzed it becomes a valuable commodity.  As we use social networks, search engines, or allow companies to access our data in any way we generate a vast amount of useful and valuable information. Big companies like Google and Facebook are selling inflated user numbers and overhyped targeting opportunities to advertisers while collecting way too much information about users and cheating content creators out of their fair share of revenue.  Tech companies, publishers, and media buyers have begun experimenting with marketplaces built on blockchain (a digital ledger that records transactions using encryption for security and accountability). Industry organisations such as the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s Tech Lab and the Data & Marketing Association are taking notice. In fact, the IAB has developed a blockchain working group (we are proud to be a part of it) to explore how advertisers can use the technology.  Papyrus aims to provide users with the opportunity to control their own data and to earn compensation by sharing their interests and other relevant ad targeting information with advertisers. In the Papyrus ecosystem users are enabled to create their own advertising “policy”. This includes what ad topics will be allowed and the desired balance between ad load and compensation. Users can change these parameters either in a publisher’s dApp itself or in their Papyrus Account Manager dApp. In either case, these parameters are written as a reference to a user’s own Papyrus account.  In the Papyrus Account Manager users can: Register and receive a Papyrus ID; Configure a personalised advertising policy — what ads a user wants to see and with what compensation. Configure a personalised data policy — what impersonal data a user is willing to share with whom and with what compensation. Display statistics for ad and data interactions and receive compensation.  With Papyrus users will see only relevant, less intrusive, and less distracting ads. This environment will eliminate inappropriate ads and malvertisements. Moreover, with the proliferation of specialized reputation, antifraud, and identity management tools, the Papyrus ecosystem will ensure that users are participating in the sharing economy through consensual data sharing and their response to advertisements will be instantly improved.",True

Papyrus: Decentralized Advertising Ecosystem,"Papyrus will cope with blockchain scalability issue  It goes without saying that the blockchain is a fashionable trend in 2017. There are a lot of projects in adtech industry that aim to disrupt the way we interact with advertising. In a nutshell most of the projects claim that they will change the whole user experience regarding all the Internet, though these claims might be overvalued.  One of the biggest problem for digital advertising is ad fraud. The price for that is quite clear — over $16.4 billion and it’s still growing. In digital advertising the transfer of value goes through the following axes: advertiser-publisher-user. Advertisers bid for ad placements, publishers accept the bid, the ad impression is delivered, the ad is filled and the user’s ID is matched with that ad impression ID.  As blockchain is essentially a decentralised storage for all the transactions, and it has proven efficiency in finance and multiple other industries, then it could be a great idea to use in digital advertising, so that the value can be saved and not wasted if we implement mathematical proof and decentralisation, right?  Actually, there’s some doubts that blockchain can change the situation. Recent article by Forbes presents some concerns regarding it. The argumentation is simple: up to this date blockchain technology is very slow to handle that much number of transactions. For instance, Bitcoin’s blockchain process 7 transactions per second, whereas Ethereum’s one — around 13 transactions per second. In case of advertising, a single transaction occurs every time as ad is viewed. With millions of as impressions being delivered every second, it’s just not possible for the current technology development to process that much information.  So the question is really important. Why the Papyrus digital advertising platform will be a game changer?  It’s true that large ad networks and publishers generate hundreds of billions of ad clicks and at least two times more ad impressions annually. Using current technology any attempt to execute smart contracts for digital advertising will generate excessive costs. Our solution utilises an extension of the technology called state channel that is capable of supporting these high loads.  The idea of a state channel is not new. It underlies the scale-up solutions for Bitcoin and Ethereum ( as well as Lightning Network and Raiden Network). Papyrus is one of the first to customize it for the specific needs of AdTech. The technology aggregates state logs from DSPs, SSPs, and auditors. So the realisation of payment is based on the constant log exchange among parties.  In the typical state channels system the transaction takes place when the critical mass of obligations occurs (e.g. Bob owes Alice an amount of $). In the case of adtech, such a system would be feasible because of the need for a revision of impressions/clicks by an external auditor that will come later on. In the Papyrus ecosystem the auditor takes a direct part in the formation of the payment. This system is more efficient for adtech as all parties receive payments after all verification procedures.  Here is an example:  Participants make deposits in the locker (thereby fixing some of its state) and then directly exchange with each other payments in the form of appropriately drawn up and signed transactions of the relevant block. This changes the balance of deposits in favor of one or the other participant. Participants transfer the updated state of the blockchain (in the part related to their deposits) to each other and they can do this arbitrarily (of course, within the limits of deposits) without the costs of carrying out transactions in the detachment. The final state is recorded in the blockchain only once — when the channel is closed. Or if one of the participants finds the incorrect behavior of the other. Let’s say that the participants will send about 200 thousand micropayments (for a total of $ 200) through one channel. In our initial assumptions this gives several tens of millions of channel opening / closing transactions per month. This is not trillions of transactions per month, but still too much for immediate processing in a public blockchain.  Papyrus has another solution: we can develop the idea of direct transmission of updates to the state of the blockchain outside of it and apply this approach directly to the opening / closing logic of the channel (originally performed in the blockchain). Let’s look at the opening / closing transactions for the dedicated nodes that will exchange the calculated updates of the public lockdown state with each other only occasionally publishing them to the blockchain itself (to update the balance of payments between the participants). The work of such nodes can be organized as a highly specialized block based on the Proof-of-Stake consensus where the blocks consist exclusively of opening / closing transactions. Participants will make large PoS deposits in a public blockchain and will be penalized for improper handling of these transactions.  To ensure guarantees of invariability and verifiability a specialized blockchain can lean on a public block writing down hashes of its blocks of transactions. Suppose one block of a specialized blockchain contains about 1 thousand transactions of opening / closing channels — in our initial assumptions this gives several tens of thousands of transactions in a public detachment a month. It already looks realistic, for example in the Ethereum network the current daily volume is hundreds of thousands of transactions.  The use of state channel libraries in Papyrus will facilitate the opening and maintaining of a peer-to-peer state channels network. Leveraging the developments of Lightning Network and Raiden Network the Papyrus ecosystem will introduce state channels adopted for usage in decentralized RTB protocol. The overall idea under that is to enhance the scalability of the Papyrus ecosystem.  In the first half of 2018 we are planning to develop and test Papyrus Protostar Release with:  Libraries for dRTB Event Log Storage Libraries for dRTB State Channels Network Libraries for Auditor integrations and more.  With 20 connected partners (at the moment) we will present a first approximation of our future digital advertising platform. This is about real work, our passionate and talented team, and the deep desire to make advertising better. Stay tuned!",True

Papyrus: Decentralized Advertising Ecosystem,"Dear bounty participants,  The ultimate purpose of each bounty campaign is the widest distribution of the project news and updates, ICO information among live and real audience. Through this we are to receive future supporters and attract attention from all corner of the world.  Projects are ready to reward their tokens with real and useful participants according to their contribution. That's why more and more projects are resorting to the help of specialized audit companies to test bounty participation and execute FAIR allocation of rewards. According to our rules (https://papyrus.global/bounty/), one user can participate only with one account. In case that we note any double registrations, duplicate accounts (except the first one) will be permanently banned from the campaign. Any falsifications, attempts to wrap results and / or the number of friends / followers, double registrations, duplicate accounts (excluding the primary account), are forbidden and users will be permanently excluded from the campaign. We also stand for honest relationships and work, so we asked the audit company to make a review.  ""No page link"" This means that when you registered, you made a mistake and did not enter the correct link to your profile in the table, either you made a mistake in the link and it can not be opened, or the page has already been deleted for some reason. In our public table such participants are indicated. We give the last chance to send us your correct link to the page before December 4.  “Closed profile” or “didn’t participate” This means that you either did not participate in our bounty program and signed up for it erroneously, or have a closed profile on Facebook and we do not see either your participation (your posts about Papyrus are closed only for friends), or your friends are hidden, their number and we can not count your steaks. We give the last chance to open your page and send us a mandatory message by 4 December.  ""Double registration"" This means that for some reason you have registered your account several times. If several times you registered with identical data, only the original questionnaire is left for participation, duplicates are deleted. In case the profile is registered several times with different mail addresses and different ETH wallets, these actions are equated to attempts of falsifications and the participant is disqualified completely.  ""Fake"" This means that, according to the independent auditors' assessment of several criteria, your account is recognized as not a real personal account, and created / used exclusively for dozens and hundreds of parallel bounty campaigns, information about which applies to a fake / artificially increased audience.  The criteria for arrangement in the specific category are:  Lack of personal photos,full name, personal information and personal posts; Any mentions of “bounty hunting” activity, “mutual subscriptions”, “subscription for subscription” etc.; Only different bounty programs huge amount reposts every hour without any different  posts at all; Accounts have a substantial amount of contacts or friends/followers that are included into a well-known black-listed fake accounts lists (wrapping results to get much more stakes); Great number of friends/followers with the total absence of any activities, likes, shares, comments from their side (looks strange, isn’t it?). Lack of match between registered data and the page provided (name, surname etc.), or the use of other people’s pages.  These criteria is taken to automatically assess every contributor. We would like to reward all those who really contributed to the success of Papyrus. Some participants need time to correct their profile information. In several days we start the counting.

It is a rediculously small amount, taking into consideration that 2% of total PRP supply (>5M) was promised to be distributed in september's version of whitepaper. I might be making a mistake, but in August it was even 3%. But what's offered now as a bounty is 5 times less. If I have known it beforehand, I wouldn't bother participating. The other side is that not too much free tokens will be distributed, so this supply won't affect token price too much.  Very good news is that all 45% will be distributed after TGE2. In case of airdrop, one can get significant share of tokens proportionally to investment. This looks motivating to invest some extra cash. Hope you won't change rules this time.

Papyrus: Decentralized Advertising Ecosystem,"Technical details on how Papyrus will eliminate ad fraud  Non-human traffic have spread around every corner of online world. It’s almost 40% of digital display ad impressions on “vertical-focused” websites in China that were never seen by a human, but the problem also occurred in Europe. The recent survey mentioned in eMarketer shows that ad fraud is considered as the second widespread concern for app marketers (attribution issues take the first place). But at the same time it’s only 44% of app marketers that had a strong understanding of potential risks of ad fraud on their campaigns.  How Papyrus will beat ad fraud problems?  First, we include decentralized reputation and antifraud solutions into Papyrus ecosystem that will ensure the security of infromation base for advertisers to make educated decisions on ad bids. For instance, if a publisher has lower rates or appears suspicious, advertisers have options to bid with significant discount or not to bid at all.  Second, by using smart contracts, the Papyrus ecosystem reinvents market conditions for all involved parties: it creates a transparent framework for interaction in which honest participants will earn more revenue while dishonest will ultimately lose and stop their bad behavior. The structural security of the Papyrus ecosystem will be of magnitudes greater for advertisers than in traditional centralized adtech because of the openness and decentralization of the ecosystem and dynamic matching of economic incentives.  Third, Papyrus is open to include different implementations of ecosystem components, including SSPs, DSPs, DMPs, antifraud solutions, ad exchanges and many other adtech-related dApps. Developers of different components can establish flexible fees for the use of their resources under the governance of Papyrus DAO.",True

Official PRP token smart contract address: 0xCB95cA62AACdc3C608aA2E78057e918a1B180616  PRP token official registered information on Etherscan.io: https://etherscan.io/token/0xCB95cA62AACdc3C608aA2E78057e918a1B180616.  To summarize the PRP token generation:  ● 675,543.319 PRP tokens were sold during TGE Round 1 and distributed. A small part of them is on hold in a Papyrus multisignature wallet as we are waiting for KYC documents from some participants. This pool represents 80% of PRP tokens minted for TGE Round 1.  ● 168,885.830 PRP tokens were minted for the pool for our advisory board, bounty campaign, Papyrus partners, pilot integrations with ad platforms, and the founding team. This pool represents 20% of PRP tokens minted for TGE Round 1. From this pool 16,888.583 PRP is allocated to the bounty campaign pool that is 2% of PRP tokens minted for TGE Round 1.  ● 5,405,570.851 PRP tokens are frozen at the multisig wallet of the Papyrus Foundation for future token sale rounds and according to our rules Papyrus has an option to run additional rounds selling these PRP tokens to secure up to $5M capital with a limit for a maximum supply of 6,250,000 PRP. All PRP tokens will be converted to main PPR tokens using 1 PRP : 24 PPR ratio during TGE Round 2.  Future token sales update  1. In order to streamline the following TGE rounds and speed up the PPR token listing we decided to combine the remaining phases of TGE Round 1 (intended to reach $5M cap) and the TGE Round 2 into one single TGE Round 2. All the frozen PRP tokens will be burned and the corresponding number of PPR tokens will be distributed during TGE Round 2.  2. The price for PPR tokens for TGE Round 2 will be not be less than 0.055 USD. Therefore the minimum bonus for current PRP holders will be at least 32% in USD value. The final price of PPR tokens will be announced later.  3. TGE Round 2 will be organized in a form of private subscription. After all the orders are collected the maximum cap and PPR price will be defined.  4. PRP tokens won’t be transferrable in Ethereum mainnet before TGE Round 2 to avoid market manipulation that may affect TGE Round 2 performance. The Papyrus prototype will be tested in Ethereum testnet.  If you have any questions regarding the token distribution and future Papyrus plans, please contact us by email: info@papyrus.global.

Don’t worry, you received the best possible discount during public sale.  2) We are considering our TGE 2 preparation strategy now with our partners and will announce it. As we have really advanced technology, solid team, world-class partners and great product that can save billions of dollars to advertisers, we expect to raise additional funding during additional token sales (TGE 1.1, TGE 2 pre sale). We haven’t decided on the actual plan for these events yet, will update on it later.  3) You are right, 2% of the overall PRP token supply. We are considering how to vest tokens to bounty program participants in a way so it won’t affect interests of token buyers. Information on that will also be published later.

I agree that investors interests are paramount, however, hope that bounty participants' are also taken into consideration. Understand it's no simple feat to balance both, and that's particularly true when they are seemingly conflicting (and sometimes they may not). Appreciate the openness and frankness in such discussions. That is what attracts investors and talents to work with you, with clear communication, risks, and rewards which ensue our decisions.  When one decides to invest, s/he understands clearly the terms, risk profile, as well as the value. That I assume, includes token distribution and mechanics too.  Likewise, other participants also make informed decisions weighing all the above factors. And the way you communicate and deliver has been really helpful.  Let's keep the communication open.

Papyrus: Decentralized Advertising Ecosystem,"Papyrus successfully raised $500,000 at TGE Round 1  The first Papyrus token sale, TGE Round 1, is now complete, and it was a huge success!  The last few weeks have been really intense for our team. We worked 24/7 to prepare for the launch on October 12. Then, during the sale, our team went into overdrive — no, make that mega-drive — working without sleep for days on end, making sure every one of our valued participants was fully supported. Many participants asked us for help and the whole team worked together to make sure everyone was happy. Now we can relax a little, take a breath and talk about our results.  We’re very proud to report that our team easily handled all issues with top security. We did not doubt the safety and security of the collected funds for a moment. Even during peak load, our site was working, and was secure, and we were able to provide tokens to all comers.  Of course, the sale was not without a fly in the ointment. One episode showed that not all of our subsystems were ready for the real world: in the first hours after the sale started, some participants weren’t able to buy tokens because of undetected errors. Fortunately our team found the bugs and fixed them fast, and we learned a few invaluable lessons for the future. We’re now more confident than ever that we can pull off the next token sale without a hitch.  For TGE Round 1, we sold 676,899 PRP tokens, collecting 1,149 ETH and 19.59 BTC, which at current exchange rates is approximately $500,000 USD. This is a fantastic indicator that the market and community believes in Papyrus.  What’s next?  Tokens will be distributed to token buyers before November 23, 2017. As many readers already know, we have successfully deployed the initial prototype of the Papyrus ecosystem. Now we preparing live demo to key players in the ad market. Details on this process will follow. The dev team is actively working on the architecture of the decentralized log storage, which will make all the supply chains between ad market participants absolutely transparent. No less important is the continuing growth and interaction of our partnerships. In October, Papyrus joined the IAB’s Blockchain Working Group. During the next few months we will continue establishing new partnerships with industry players to promote our ecosystem adoption. We are preparing a private sale of Papyrus tokens to secure additional capital to scale the team and increase the speed of our product development.  That’s all for now.

Papyrus: Decentralized Advertising Ecosystem,"Technical Roundup #6  The last couple of weeks it’s been quiet here on the surface as we were all busy working out the details of integrations with the first partners; there’s still a lot to do, and this will apparently take some time. Meanwhile we started a new stream of work, now elaborating on the so far missing component of the Infrastructure Layer — the Event Log Storage. While in the initial prototype we focused on running the dRTB transaction between the participants, and logs could be simply written locally on the SSP/DSP gateways — the full-fledged log storage is a critical infrastructure pillar of the fully transparent advertising ecosystem, so now it is our next major milestone. We are currently in the midst of the design, focusing on the major requirements to the log storage solution:  Handle immense volumes of operational logs written in parallel by multiple participants; Provide data immutability and availability guarantees; Encrypt data in a granular manner so that its owners could later grant any new participants (appointed auditors) access to the selected ranges of logs; Efficiently handle data retrieval to support reporting for all the interested parties.  There are multiple options under examination for the key decisions on arranging individual log entries into large data blocks (the choice of grouping keys), data indices organization (to support data retrieval in the context of ad campaign, for example), dissemination of the data across storage nodes and how those nodes are incentivized.  For the first implementation we are focusing on the target data storing logic (encryption, pre-aggregation to facilitate subsequent reporting, data addressing and indexing), with only very basic nodes management services to orchestrate data replication, replicas monitoring and healing. Initially this may use some pieces of centralized services run on the Papyrus infrastructure, and subsequently will be elaborated to a fully decentralized mechanism (built by Papyrus or based on existing decentralized solutions, this is still an open question). More details to follow — stay with us!",True

Papyrus: Decentralized Advertising Ecosystem,"1) Can you explain how came that 661000 tokens were bought for $440000, which is roughtly 1 PRP for $0,66 (pretty much pre-sale price). * $200K were raised during pre-ico was 1 for $0,65. * Then $240K was raised at prices $0,8 to $1. Average should be around $0,75-$0,8. Ok, let's take your 250 PRP bonus into account, that'd shift the average down to $0,75. But no way it is $0,65. During TGE1, ETH price was around $300, so that's not an explanation. BTC raised, but 12 BTC were raised first day at a price around $5400 or even less if it was during pre-ico.  I feel it's unfair, because my ETHs arrived #2 after the launch on October 12. So I took all the risks of unclear future of ICO, but instead of early-bird reward I got ~2500 PRP less than average investor would get with same amount of ETH. My price was $0,785 for PRP.  2) How long can you keep the development of project going with funds currently raised? Taking possible ICO bubble crash into account, 2018H1 might not be the best time to start TGE2. What if you feel it's needed to postpone it to later, than how later can you make it?  3) About bounty. ~2% of TGE1 tokens were intended for bounty program. Since you raised about 10% of your initial plan, does that mean that bounty distribution will be around 20% of what was purchased? If it's so, than as PRP hit exchanges, people may start selling their free tokens, which may crash the price down to 0.",True

Papyrus is creating a transparent advertising ecosystem based on the blockchain technology, so that to ensure the lack of fraudulent activity and bot traffic. FraudScore is the largest mobile traffic analyzer that up to this moment has processed more than 257 million mobile application installations.  Fraudulent traffic is in the top 3 problems of the advertising market. Experts from Papyrus Foundation are confident that the use of the blockchain technology can help to create an automated and transparent market for auditor services and thus eliminate the problem. The joint work of the suppliers of antifraud solutions within the Papyrus ecosystem will greatly improve the effectiveness of combating fraud in programmatic advertising.  In the unified advertising ecosystem, each impression can be evaluated by consensus of the auditors. At the moment Papyrus has already deployed a working prototype of the system, so the connection of the first partner in the field of traffic evaluation is an important next step.

Papyrus: Decentralized Advertising Ecosystem,"Papyrus’s Market Adoption Strategy  What is our market adoption strategy? Glad you asked! Roughly, it can be broken down into several components.  Partnerships  As our product brings clear benefits for the existing market players, we are focused on finding the right integration models for their businesses to gain efficiency by leveraging Papyrus. We have already signed a partnership deal with the supply side platform AirPush, one of the largest mobile advertising platforms in the world with 300k+ mobile apps using its SDK, and are currently in talks with many other potential partners. Most of them are still in early stages, but a lot of these partnerships will be announced soon.  We are planning to actively participate in the IAB Tech Lab Blockchain Working Group and similar organizations in order to synchronize our efforts with those of other market players. Papyrus is also planning to create an alliance of friendly companies who also aim to disrupt the ad industry with blockchain. We have already agreed on strategic collaborations with AirPush, BitClave and Bancor, are in talks with AdEx and will continue striking new partnerships. Our advisory board provides tremendous support in this respect, bringing years of experience and a great network of top-level connections in the advertising market — among our Business Development Advisors are such world-class experts as Tim Brown, Director of Global Agency Strategy and Partnerships at SAP, and Rahul Chandra, VP of Corporate Business Development at Netcracker.  Automatic incentivization for early adopters  Our early adopters will be automatically rewarded with tokens for handling certain traffic volumes within the ecosystem. This will incentivize them to join earlier and to be the first to bring benefits and efficiency to their customers and to secure more Papyrus tokens in the process. The token incentivization program will be launched soon and then will be gradually phased out with the growth of the Papyrus market adoption.  Educating advertisers about the technology  After having integrated both supply- and demand side-platforms we’ll focus on educating advertisers about Papyrus and blockchain advantages. They will be the biggest winners of blockchain adoption as they will receive much more value for their money. But the technology is new and it takes time to develop a good command of it. Soon, we will be launching experiments with several big advertisers, who have already shown their interest.  Integrating with the big players  After having gained sufficient traction with larger amounts of traffic flowing through the ecosystem and having proven our market benefits we will start negotiations with larger platforms, including Google and Facebook. Since they also might benefit hugely from our technology and since we are an open-sourced and non-profit ecosystem, they might be interested in integrating with the existing working ecosystem on a win-win model rather than developing a competing model from scratch. When several big advertisers express their willingness to work with Papyrus-linked transparent platforms — this trend will speed up.[/list]",True

Papyrus: Decentralized Advertising Ecosystem,"Papyrus Prototype Deployment  The last few days just flew right by as the team was all busy making final updates, testing on the private/test networks and preparing for the initial prototype deployment. And now we are happy to announce that the prototype smart contracts have been successfully deployed on the Ethereum mainnet; and the prototype Core code successfully executed a series of dRTB transactions!  For our interested readers, here are some technical details: After passing the audit by Ambisafe, the prototype PRP token was deployed. The prototype Papyrus DAO with registries for all ecosystem participants (SSPs, DSPs, Auditors and Publishers) and payment channel management infrastructure was deployed. Accounts for test DSP gateway, SSP gateway and Auditor were created and debited with small amounts of PRP tokens (10 units each) minted for the testing purpose. Then test accounts were registered in the Papyrus registries with a PoS deposit of 10 PRP units each, resulting in DAO now holding 30 PRP units. The DSP gateway was credited 1 PRP to be used for payments, and created a payment channel to the SSP gateway with a 1 PRP deposit. 10 dRTB interactions were simulated between the gateways resulting in 10 micropayment transactions 0.1 PRP each sent through the channel, locked until Auditor’s signature is provided. Auditor’s signatures for 8 out of 10 micropayments were provided, the remaining 2 micropayments were not signed (emulating fraudulent impressions). The DSP gateway closed the payment channel, with its deposit of 1 PRP distributed between DSP and SSP gateways — 0.2 PRP returned to DSP gateway as unconfirmed, and 0.8 PRP transferred to SSP gateway as confirmed.  The Auditor submitted the fraud statistics for the closed channel, resulting in reputation update for DSP gateway.[/li][/list] Now the contracts remain operational on the mainnet, ready to support the coming registrations of new participants and integrations with our first partners. Meanwhile we continue working on the prototype core — stay tuned!",True

But even before we get there an important milestone will be passed — this weekend we are going to deploy our prototype contracts to the Ethereum mainnet! This will allow registration of the prototype ecosystem participants (once the prototype tokens are issued), and will enable us to start actual deployment of integrations with our first partners. In anticipation of that we worked on:  Making our last refinements in the prototype DAO and registries. Further strengthening payment channels implementation and improving reliability of persistence logic. And further improving the prototype core SSP/DSP gateways.  Once we deploy the contracts, we are going to register test SSP, DSP and Auditor accounts — and run test transactions across the actual working instances of the prototype core.

Papyrus: Decentralized Advertising Ecosystem,"Papyrus is nothing less than the world's first fully comprehensive and highly scalable decentralized ecosystem for digital advertising capable of processing billions of targeted adverts daily. It is new economy for future digital advertising that unites users, publishers, advertisers and developers of decentralized applications (dApps) in an efficient, transparent and mutually beneficial environment.                                      Currently Papyrus has no analogue in the world. Unlike other blockchain advertising projects, including BasicAttentionToken, Adchain, QChain, AdEx and others that have a focus on particular components for the digital advertising market such as ad exchanges or browsers, Papyrus is a single point of access, full-service ecosystem for all components, platforms and market players. Another challenge for projects in the field is limited blockchain scalability and absence of interoperability with existing adtech platforms. Papyrus offers decentralized real-time bidding (dRTB) protocol that is capable of handling vast amounts of simultaneous ad impressions and ad payments in real-time with built-in antifraud architecture that can be easily integrated into existing programmatic ad infrastructure.  The scalability and open architecture of Papyrus represents a truly global, decentralized platform open to all developers of new adtech solutions for continuous improvement and evolution based on fair competition and transparency.  The Papyrus decentralized digital ad ecosystem is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and its smart contracts, utilizing a network of state channels for bandwidth scalability and a reliable decentralized data storage structure. This enables Papyrus to minimize storage costs and maximize speed for handling large amounts of data.  Papyrus consists of four layers of architecture with the components of each layer developed as open source software. It employs blockchain-based identification and reputation management tools for ecosystem participants, as well as a dRTB protocol that will support dApps and instantaneous ad payments. This framework combines decentralization, capacity and speed.",True

Since our last update the team’s been busy fitting parts of the prototype together as our first integrations with the partners are just around the corner. Well, we are almost there — the progress we’ve made so far: The core of the prototype is finally assembled — the SSP/DSP gateways are integrated with the payment channel, now going through heavy testing and debugging. Payment channels are in the process of constant improvement — the conditional transactions tested, now adding some state persistence for reliability. Verification mechanism for publisher registration is now being tested, will be delivered soon. And we also rectified our approach to the forthcoming Token Generation Event Round 1. We continue working on the prototype core, meanwhile elaborating the design details for integrations with SSPs, DSPs and Auditors. Now, we would also like to announce our plan to deploy a Bancor Token Changer! Once the prototype PRP token is out, the Smart token changer contract will be created for a PRP/BNT pair, and will allow those Papyrus participants receiving PRP tokens for their services to easily exchange for BNT (and thus for ETH or any token connected to the Bancor network).  Similarly, those wishing to utilize services in the ecosystem (or to place a PoS deposit required from the participant) will be able to convert their ETH, BNT or other connected tokens. While we also plan to list on the major exchanges, the Token Changer once deployed will immediately create PRP token liquidity, facilitating trustless exchange free from the risks of centralized exchanges.  Details on the changer contract will be announced after the TGE Round 1 ends.",True

Since enabling transparency is the key goal of the new ecosystem we are building, we take it seriously as a team – and following our promises we’ve just made some of our repositories public! You can now check the code and docs on GitHub, the key highlights include:  Basic Papyrus DAO with participants registration logic, which is detached from the actual data (registries) and can be upgraded separately. Registries for ecosystem participants, with reputation tracking logic to be used when settling the payment channels and receiving fraud reports from the Auditors. Payment channel implementation comprised of smart contracts anchoring the channel on the blockchain, and channel node logic performing actual off-chain payments exchange – now with basic conditional transactions! Initial version of gateways to connect traditional SSPs and DSPs. The contracts for Papyrus tokens and wallet to support the Token Generation Event (which will be announced soon!) Some details on the proposed Papyrus architecture, including our vision on Auditors involvement and reputation tracking.  And now we focus on: Elaboration of SSP/DSP gateway logic, and integration of payment channels into bidding process. Finalizing conditional transactions support and overall payment channels testing. Integration with Auditors to unlock conditional transactions. Triggering reputation updates for SSPs and DSPs.  Papyrus will bring benefits to all the fair players along the advertising chain – but interaction between DSPs and SSPs with transparency enforced by Auditors’ participation is at the very core of the ecosystem. That’s why a major focus is on SSP and DSP gateways, and Auditor integration – once this is done we are going to connect our first partners!",True

Papyrus: Decentralized Advertising Ecosystem,"We are happy to Announce Token Generation Event Round 1 on 12th October  Papyrus Foundation Pte. Ltd. (Limited company incorporated in Singapore) is planning to use a milestone-based approach and schedule several TGE rounds to provide deterministic value for the tokens sold:   TGE Round 1: Launch on 12th of October 2017 after the deployment of the initial scope of the Papyrus ecosystem prototype in Ethereum network. TGE Round 2: The TGE Round 2 will be launched after Papyrus deploys permanent version of the ecosystem smart contracts and successfully launches pilot integrations with target external advertising platforms and partners providing benefits in real use cases. Papyrus expect this will take place in the next few months TGE Round 3: Tokens allocated for this event will be locked until 2019. TGE Round 3 will be launched no earlier than in 2019 after Papyrus achieves significant market traction, grows its user base and ad traffic volume within the ecosystem.  The goal of TGE Round 1 is to bootstrap the Papyrus prototype ecosystem and start pilot integrations with Papyrus partners, including antifraud vendors, publishers, SSPs and DSPs, as well as to attract early supporters of the project and accelerate the establishment and development of a Papyrus expert community.   Papyrus will be introducing two different tokens:   PRP – Papyrus Prototype Tokens that will be used in the ecosystem prototype. PPR – Papyrus Permanent Tokens that will be used in the permanent version of the ecosystem. These tokens will be generated during TGE Round 2 and will serve as the permanent tokens of the Papyrus economy during its long-term development and adoption on the digital advertising market.  All 100% of prototype tokens emission will be exchanged to 15% of overall permanent tokens emission after TGE Round 2. Papyrus plan to suspend support of the prototype ecosystem and continue with development of permanent ecosystem after TGE Round 2 is complete and the exchange of prototype tokens to permanent ones is opened. Both PRP and PPR are a ERC20-compliant utility tokens usable within the Papyrus for:   Making advertiser payments for ad campaigns; Compensation for publishers and users; Registration deposits (Proof-of-Stakes) for connected participants (Publishers, dDSPs, dSSPs, Auditors, Ad Agencies, Advertisers) to ensure fair play and secure Papyrus against fraud; Paying service fees to ecosystem participants, including dDSPs, dSSPs, Auditors, and others providers of specific services within the ecosystem; Governance of the Papyrus ecosystem, including votes for dispute resolutions, and votes for Papyrus protocol upgrade proposals, changes in basic fee limits and thresholds.  Each ecosystem infrastructure participant (Publishers, dDSPs, dSSPs, Auditors, Ad Agencies, Advertisers) needs to lock a specified minimum amount of Papyrus tokens as a security deposit (Proof-of-Stake) in Papyrus registry. This minimum amount depends on the volume of payments flowing through the participant, for greater volume participants needs greater PoS deposit. There is a default minimum for new registrants of each type. This ensures that demand for Papyrus tokens will grow with the growth of the amount of connected participants and volume of the payments  going through Papyrus-enabled components.  For example, assuming $1B monthly turnover going through Papyrus ecosystem (~5% of worldwide digital advertising market) and PoS deposits equal to 2-months turnover - there will be at least $2B value in Papyrus tokens locked as PoS deposits.   The TGE Round 1 includes sale of Papyrus Prototype Tokens PRP with hard cap of $5M. Any funds raised beyond this will be transmitted back at the cost of the contributor. The Papyrus reserves the right to choose a lower hard cap should it deem this reasonable.   Public phase of TGE Round 1 will start on 12th of October 2017 14:00 UTC and will end when any one of the following criterion are met:   When the hard cap goal is reached; When the designated TGE Round 1 public sale period of 21 days ends.  The PRP token allocation will have the following configuration: 80% will be sold during TGE Round 1; 20% will be allocated for advisory board, bounty campaign, Papyrus partners, pilot integrations with ad platforms, and the founding team.  PRP price is denominated in USD and is specified as follows: During first 2 hours of the TGE Round 1 period, the PRP price will be $0,8; From the 3rd to the 24th hour (both including) of the TGE Round 1 period, the PRP price will be $0,9; From 2nd to 7th day (both including) of the TGE Round 1 period, the PRP price will be $0,95; After 7th day and until the end of the TGE Round 1 period, the PRP price will be $1,00.  During public phase of TGE Round 1 any eligible customer can buy PRP tokens. Sale will be compliant with international regulations and could be restricted for some jurisdictions; also participants may require undergoing KYC checks for international anti-money laundering compliance.  All TGE Round 1 proceedings will be under the management of the Papyrus Foundation Pte. Ltd. (Limited company incorporated in Singapore with UEN: 201726387E) that has a mission to develop Papyrus ecosystem and promote it on the digital advertising market.   Approximate TGE Round 1 budget allocation: 50% will be used for Papyrus ecosystem marketing and promotion, hiring business developers and community managers in different regions around the globe, as well as in building relationships with expert advisors and companies from the advertising and blockchain industries, including making pilot integrations with ad networks, DSPs, SSPs, antifraud vendors and other ad market players. 25% will be used for research and development, including the hiring of development team employees. 5% will be reserved to cover infrastructure costs, such as hardware and office expenses. 5% is reserved for legal costs and counsel. 15% is reserved for motivation schemes for early project supporters and the project founding team.  Starting 15th of September 2017 Papyrus Foundation Pte. Ltd. opens private pre-order on Papyrus PRP[/b] tokens. Parties interested in buying PRP tokens for amounts of more than $50k are invited to participate in a pre-order program of PRP tokens with a special discounted token price. In order to participate all interested parties should submit requests via email: tokensale@papyrus.global  You could find the full description of Papyrus TGE in our official blog: https://blog.papyrus.global/ Additional details are provided on the project official website: https://papyrus.global  UPDATE:  As we got many questions about that, to simplify understanding of token swap between PRP and PPR we fix PRP token supply for the ongoing token sale with 5 000 000 PRP tokens and swap ratio with 1 PRP : 24 PPR. Unsold PRP tokens will be held by Papyrus Foundation Pte. Ltd. and may be offered during additional TGE rounds.  After Papyrus TGE round 2 (main ICO) these 5 000 000 PRP will be automatically exchanged to 120 000 000 of main permanent Papyrus tokens (PPR), which is 12% of total 1 000 000 000 fixed PPR supply.  Why conversion rate of 1 PRP : 24 PPR is beneficiary for token sale participants? According to our pricing policy 1 PRP token costs 1 USD without discounts. That means that to reach hard cap of $5M we need to sell at least 5 000 000 PRP or more in case that some tokens are sold with discounts. That means that the best case scenario conversion of PRP to PPR will be 1 PRP : 24 PPR according to initial terms. That is the case when we reach hard cap selling 5 000 000 PRP tokens for 1 USD each, issuing total 6 250 000 PRP (80% of PRP are sold and 20% are issued for advisory board, bounty campaign, Papyrus partners, pilot integrations with ad platforms, and the founding team, as stated initially) which are then converted to 150 000 000 PPR (15% of all PPR)). Papyrus team decided to fix conversion ratio at the best possible condition according to initial terms — 1 PRP : 24 PPR.  Also due to some technical issues during the launch of the token sale we decided to update discounts policy to be as follows, benefitting more participants of the token sale:  - During first 3 days of the TGE Round I, the PRP Token price will be $0.8; - From the 4th to the 7th day (both including) of Round I, the PRP Token price will be $0.85; - From 8th to 14th day (both including) of Round I, the PRP Token price will be $0.9; - After 14th day and until the end of Round I, the PRP Token price will be $1.00.",True

Papyrus: Decentralized Advertising Ecosystem,"Open Talk with Vitalik Buterin in Skolkovo  Yesterday, Vitalik Buterin arrived in Moscow to attend an event in the Technopark Skolkovo. Once announced, the tickets were sold out during minutes. The Papyrus team managed to get entry cards and headed to the venue to meet the Founder of Ethereum.    The conference hall was overcrowded. There were dozens of people eager to listen — an even touch — Vitalik Buterin. Although the venue was big enough to house all the attendees, the best places to sit were soon all occupied. However, our team was lucky to get right into the center of the conference hall.    The interest to blockchain and cryptocurrencies is fantastic. Also, many people seem fascinated by the ‘phenomenon of Vitalik’. We haven’t seen such an excitement on a proffessional event since long.    Alex Shvets, Product Director, and Elena Obukhova, Communications Director, were happy to be part of the event.",True

Papyrus: Decentralized Advertising Ecosystem,"Technical Roundup #1  Through the last few weeks the dev team’s been busy with designing and prototyping the key components to bootstrap the Papyrus ecosystem. We set the prototype goal for this month to start onboarding the first participants and to support a basic bidding/auditing/payment flow, with the focus on traditional web advertising and integration of existing SSPs and DSPs. So, the scope for this includes:  At the Core layer: The Papyrus DAO with initial governance logic The Papyrus token — the prototype will operate using PRP (pre-Papyrus token) The registries for SSPs, DSPs, Auditors and Publishers — will allow registration and placement of security deposits, with a simple challenge/verify validation Basic multi-dimensional reputation tracking — key dimensions to start with (amounts payed, amounts of recognized fraud), and more will follow  At the Scalability layer: Payment channels with conditional transactions (assuming both parties playing fairly, no conflicts settlement yet) — will transfer payments for individual impressions, rejecting those recognized as fraudulent by the Auditors  At the AdTech Infra layer: DSP and SSP integration gateways — will relay RTB messages from the traditional SSPs to DSPs and back, and will manage payment channels on their behalf, at the same time interacting with the Auditors to authorize individual payments  What we achieved so far: The token contract is undergoing security audit The registries for ecosystem participants with registration and deposit logic are being tested The basic payment channel implementation already supports setup, unconditional transactions and settlement The integration gateways already support connections to SSP/DSP and can relay and log RTB messages  And what’s next? Integration of payment channels into SSP/DSP gateway Support of conditional transactions in the payment channels (sunny day scenario) Interaction with Auditors Reputation tracking Overall governance with dispute resolution framework Verification mechanism for participants registration  Meanwhile, we are tidying up a bit, and will make our github repositories public soon!",True

Papyrus is a world’s first highly scalable decentralized ecosystem for digital advertising, which includes full stack of open sourced components for programmatic advertising in decentralized environment.  Mission Papyrus mission is to create global digital advertising ecosystem, which will unite users, publishers, advertisers and decentralized application developers by providing totally transparent, fair and efficient advertising value distribution. Papyrus strives towards accelerated growth of advertising market efficiency and everyone’s economic wealth and comfort.  Who Will Benefit From Papyrus? Users Users will be able to control what ads they see and what data they share with advertisers. There will be no abusive ads and malvertisements. Most importantly, users become full-fledged members of advertising ecosystem and are instantly compensated for sharing their data and responding to advertising. Thus users get new comfortable Internet environment at their service.  Publishers and dApp Developers Traditional web and mobile publishers and dApp developers will receive higher revenues by transparent advertising demand and benefit from instant payment settlements on blockchain. dApp developers will be able to easily create ad-based economies by utilizing ad monetization inside their apps. They will also have an opportunity to promote their dApps and token offerings via Papyrus ecosystem to the consolidated user base of existing dApps.  Advertisers Advertisers will benefit from the high quality traffic, as Papyrus decentralized reputation and antifraud solutions protect them from non-human and fraudulent traffic by an order of magnitude better than traditional solutions. All ad data is securely stored in scalable decentralized storages enabling traceability of all operations and eliminating fraud within ad buying intermediaries. Transparent environment with real-time advertising payments significantly reduce technology costs comparing to complicated traditional adtech solutions.  How Does It Work? These are the basic elements and technologies Papyrus uses: 1.   Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts. 2.   State channels network for transactions performance scalability. 3.   Secure and scalable decentralized data storage for event logs. 4.   Blockchain identity and reputation management systems. 5.   Decentralized real-time-bidding (RTB) protocol based on OpenRTB.  The architecture of Papyrus consists of 4 layers. Components of each layer are developed by the Papyrus team as open source software for the ecosystem growth and adoption. The Papyrus AdTech Infrastructure layer includes all components required to establish a complete digital advertising cycle within the Papyrus ecosystem and to create gateways with traditional adtech systems.  Layers scheme  Scheme of basic communications within dRTB cycle can be views as follows.  You can learn technical details about Papyrus in our Whitepaper!  How Is Papyrus Better Than Other Solutions? There are already several projects that aim to leverage blockchain technology in the area of digital advertising. Each of them focuses on a very specific subset of problems not transforming the existing advertising landscape strategically. The following table summarizes the key features of the projects in comparison to Papyrus.  View the table here.  PPR Token PPR is a utility token based on the Ethereum technology that is used as a unit of account between advertisers, publishers, developers and users in the Papyrus ecosystem.  Initial Token Sale Summary Papyrus will have several phases of the Initial Token Sale (ITA): * private and public pre-sale in Summer 2017 for early investors and supporters of the project; * public sale phase 1, which will happen in the autumn 2017 after Papyrus prototype is ready; * private sale phase 2 for accredited adtech companies, which will happen not earlier than in 2019 after Papyrus ecosystem get substantial traction on the advertising market.

Papyrus: Decentralized Advertising Ecosystem,"   Concerning AdEx, a bit moer info:  1) AdEx has no open source tech details, so for now, we cannot say what exactly (and how) will the AdEx team realize; 2) Papyrus has one more important advantage: it is the first solution with a scalable RTB realization (with the help of state channels). This means that Papyrus will be able to work with tramendous amounts of ad transactions in real time. 3) We are developing the first complex solution, which is an ecosystem for the advertising market, governed in a decentralized manner as a DAO by token holders. It is not a solution for just a couple of ad processes. It is a complex one.  Please refer to our whitepaper for further details: https://papyrus.global/static/whitepaper.pdf",True
