If a trader sells his or her cryptoassets within a year or more, all gains are also covered by tax exemptions.   🇩🇰Denmark  Denmark is one of the most crypto-friendly countries in the world, and no Bitcoin transactions there are taxable.

Do you want do buy or to sell crypt? Actually, there's no difference — the system is the same, anyway. Whoever wants to buy or sell the asset, places a bet (bid or offer) into the system. I saw Coinplace announcing hidden dashboards for bigger pool deals but here we're talking about the open part.  So, when there is a match between the two sides, i.e. buyer and seller, the deal is done. Technically, the one who has crypt on his/her hands, places it in a custody (escrow).

Other companies rarely launch ICO let alone Pre-ICO without MVP. Rather than offering our investors just an idea of a project, a blind bargain, we would like to present a fully functioning platform.   CTO of CoinPlace Alexander Sakagansky said, “Before launching Pre-ICO we unexpectedly discovered that we probably went overboard, and currently our service is not as easy to use as we would like. We ourselves do not like it when processes are too complicated as if they were designed for crypto geeks. That is why we made a difficult decision to postpone our ICO for a week and use this time to improve the service interface making it more user-friendly. So that anyone could figure it out in less than a minute, even if he is buying cryptocurrency or tokens for the first time in his life.”   It will take the team 4-5 days to improve the interface.     CoinPlace Pre-ICO will start December 5th at 6 pm GMT+3.   Follow our news and join us! You can already register as an early investor here: www.coinplace.info",False

Among other functions, it allows a customer to purchase digital assets for fiat currencies. CoinPlace also acts as a guarantor (escrow service) in transactions with cryptocurrencies, while operations are performed directly between the users.  Problems that we solved: crypto exchanges limit traders and enforce their internal conditions and timing. Coinplace will free holders of crypto assets from all limitations that crypto exchanges impose. Why: besides the traditional wiring system to assist crypto and token buy and sell, we offer our clients to set up private announcement boards where only you will decide what to sell, whom to deal with.   ________________________________________   Who benefits from CoinPlace Investors: they are buying cryptocurrencies fast and easy for real money and can pay with banking card,  PayPal or whatever way they want, getting much faster transactions than on crypto exchanges in return.  ICO initiators: they will register the project in days and can start selling tokens before the listing is paid,  unlike classical exchanges where listing is long and expensive.  Newbies: no need of initial registration on exchanges. Can buy tokens and cryptocurrency directly from sellers via CoinPlace. Pay them in fiat money the way they are accustomed to.   Token holders: those who have already invested in multiple tokens from different ICOs and currently got lost in exchanges. CoinPlace will bring all their assets together, with no need to jump between accounts, sites and apps.  CoinPlace platform is already running, however to step the business up, we need to strengthen our influence on the cryptomarket ecosystem,  and this requires more resources. We need to build up our products, expand into new markets and hire expert employees to develop our business – and those are tasks we will be pursuing. Funds to be raised via ICO will speed up growth of the platform.

Do you want do buy or to sell crypt? Actually, there's no difference — the system is the same, anyway. Whoever wants to buy or sell the asset, places a bet (bid or offer) into the system. I saw Coinplace announcing hidden dashboards for bigger pool deals but here we're talking about the open part.  So, when there is a match between the two sides, i.e. buyer and seller, the deal is done. Technically, the one who has crypt on his/her hands, places it in a custody (escrow). And the other side transfers fiat. When fiat is received, the ""crypt"" side unlocks the escrow.",False

I.e., it's a smart contract that is delivering to you upon confirmation of the fiat payment. It is interesting to see what happens if the other side is commiting a fraud and tries to escape without paying. First, they won't be able to get the crypt back, second, there's an arbitrary board that may decide to unlock the pledge in case you provide sufficient proof that the payment took place (like receipt or like that).",False
