I want to talk about the Tigereum project. It is a service for sending money to your relatives and friends in messengers and social networks. The huge advantage of this project is that it already works and has an alpha version of its bots. They are available for testing in telegrams and facebook.   A total of 20 million coins were issued. The price of 1 coin is now about 10 cents, i.e. total capitalization of only 2 million dollars. Huge growth potential. Projects with only ideas and promises have a capitalization of hundreds of millions of dollars, and the project with a really working product is still only 2 million. I expect that in the near future, as soon as many investors learn about the project, the price of a coin will grow several times (x5-x10-x50) and make you truly rich.   Tigereum is not a cut diamond.

In it, he acknowledges that encryption and crypto are 2 big issues he has to get his head around in 2018. He says that Facebook's core mission is to build decentralised communities: ""give people the power"". I sense in his post some frustration that scrutiny from government about some misuse of Facebook's tools has forced Facebook to centralise control in uncomfortable ways. He seems a little envious of the decentralised communities which are being built around crypto, while on the other hand being concerned about how people may misuse those communities too. I think it is great that Mark Zuckerberg has chosen these issues as priorities for his personal attention in 2018. Tigereum is building smooth solutions for crypto to be used on social media platforms like Facebook, so these issues are right in our zone. We all need to navigate through these issues sensibly to build sustainable decentralised solutions for people to interact how they want to, using the best technologies available to us. I hope that 2018 will be a good year for both @tigereumtokens and @Facebook. Darren Olney-Fraser  https://web.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104380170714571",False

Last month, TIG successfully completed a Token Swap for 20,000,000 tokens.  By integrating the Bancor Protocol, TIG token holders will gain access to continuous liquidity regardless of trade volume or exchange listings, through the Bancor Network, where any integrated token can be automatically converted to any other directly from any Web3 wallet, such as MetaMask. Currently integrated tokens include ETH, BNT (the Bancor Network Token), GNO (Gnosis), WAX, BNB (Binance Coin) and a rapidly growing list of additional tokens.  ‚ÄúWe anticipate having a large community of users, and significant demand for TIG tokens, so it makes sense for us to provide our users with as much liquidity as we can‚Äù said Darren Olney-Fraser, CEO of Tigereum. ‚ÄúIntegrating with Bancor will provide sufficient liquidity for everyone who wants to send crypto in an instant message on social media platforms.‚Äù  TIG will activate a Relay Token with 2% of its circulating token supply of 20,000,000 tokens. Users will be able to purchase and sell TIG tokens directly from any Web3 wallet at a formulaically calculated price.  About Tigereum  Tigereum is a decentralized platform that will enable anyone to send crypto to friends and family in an instant message. Tigereum is being designed to serve the 4 billion+ users of social media who connect everyday with their family and friends across the world. With a chatbot accessible on social media platforms like Facebook, Skype, Telegram and Slack (who currently support bots), friends and family anywhere in the world and across all currencies will use Tigereum to access blockchain trust and transaction verification to send value between themselves. For more information, please visit www.tigereum.io.  About Bancor  Bancor Protocol is a standard for the creation of Smart Tokens‚Ñ¢, cryptocurrencies with built-in convertibility directly through their smart contracts. Bancor utilizes an innovative token ‚ÄúConnector‚Äù method to enable formulaic price calculation and continuous liquidity for all compliant tokens, without needing to match two parties in an exchange. Smart Tokens interconnect to form token liquidity networks, allowing user-generated cryptocurrencies to thrive. For more information, visit the Bancor website www.bancor.network and read the Bancor Protocol white paper.

Olney-Fraser is Chief Executive Officer of cryptocurrency Tigereum.  ‚ÄúBitcoin is people-power pushing back against the established financial system, and it exhibits all the behaviours of a movement‚Äù he said.  Olney-Fraser says he is proud to be part of the Bitcoin movement.  What are the principles of the Bitcoin movement? They are decentralisation, distributed power, transparency, open source, and accountability to all users.  It is a trust-based model which relies on people in a network co-operating openly and transparently with each other.  These are the principles set out in the Whitepaper released by Satoshi Nakamoto which started the Bitcoin movement in 2008.  Mr Olney-Fraser says that the Bitcoin movement, kicked off by Satoshi Nakamoto, has achieved something quite remarkable: ‚ÄúA very sophisticated alternative financial infrastructure has been developed collaboratively by people across the world, and no-one owns or controls it‚Äù said Mr Olney-Fraser.  Bitcoin has unified people from every country, across political, cultural and demographic divides, who have worked together to achieve something which our largest, transnational companies are envious of and our governments fear.  Mr Olney-Fraser says the increasing value of Bitcoin this year is occurring as people realise the enormity of this movement, and what it represents, in an historic sense, about how our our financial systems is evolving beyond banks and government: ‚ÄúMarkets and investors have realised that Bitcoin is a movement which is here to stay, and banks and governments cannot control it any longer.‚Äù   Of course, governments will want to tax and regulate Bitcoin, and banks will lobby them to do so. However, this movement might well be bigger than governments can handle. The rules have changed.  This is global. This is people power. Bitcoin is going to be hard to kill off. ",False

Tigereum will help early-adopters of crypto send crypto to their non-crypto friends and family.  At the moment, crypto is a pretty exclusive club. Crypto is still the domain of early-adopters and tech savvy people. Most crypto transfers occur between crypto friends and business associates.  However, early-adopters of crypto do have non-crypto friends.  The point is, you shouldn‚Äôt have to go to your digital wallet, convert some crypto to fiat, transfer it to a bank account, and then transfer it again to your non-crypto friend‚Äôs bank account, just to send money to your non-crypto friends.  ‚ÄúExperienced crypto users may well have learned to navigate this process with ease by now, but there is a better way‚Äù said Darren Olney-Fraser, Chief Executive Officer of Tigereum. Tigereum is developing better ways for crypto people to interface more seamlessly with the fiat world in which their non-crypto friends and family live.  Tigereum‚Äôs offers a new way to easily and securely send crypto to non-crypto friends and family without you having to convert crypto into fiat, and without requiring them to get a digital wallet.  ‚ÄúWe aim to make it easier for you to securely send crypto to your non-crypto friends‚Äù said Mr Olney-Fraser.  Tigereum‚Äôs solution is based on a chatbot which will be available on all major social media platforms, starting with Facebook Messenger.  ‚ÄúWe will make it possible to send crypto to someone who doesn‚Äôt have a digital wallet, so that they can deposit it directly into their nominated fiat bank account‚Äù he said.  Tigereum‚Äôs prototype bot is available for testing, and feedback is welcome.  Tigereum keeps faith with the principles of crypto -  anonymity, encryption, blockchain and security ‚Äì in the design of its customer interfaces.  Tigereum believes its smooth customer solutions can also help bring more non-crypto people into the crypto work.   ",False

Tigereum released the prototype to showcase what it can do:   ‚ÄúI want to show the crypto community what we can do ahead of our Token Swap opening next week.‚Äù said Mr Darren Olney-Fraser, Chief Executive Officer of Tigereum.  Tigereum‚Äôs prototype bot is a smooth way to send crypto to a friend on Facebook.  You simply select your friend from your friends list, tell the bot how much want to send them, and which digital wallet you want to send from.  Your friend will receive a message from you showing the amount you sent, embedded with an image of the crypto you are sending.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs as easy as sending a photo to your friend on Facebook, but with crypto attached.‚Äù   You can send any of the major cryptocurrencies to friends and family on Tigereum‚Äôs bot, from Bitcoin and Ethereum to Litecoin and Dash.   One of Tigereum‚Äôs best features is that your friend does not have to have a digital wallet to get crypto from you. Your friend can simply convert your crypto into their fiat currency, and deposit it into their bank account, if they prefer.  ‚ÄúWe believe in giving people smooth customer interfaces, with options for users to choose what suits them best.‚Äù  You can try Tigereum‚Äôs prototype bot on Facebook for yourself (https://m.me/163277320931662).

I am an experienced company director and investor.   I have been a company director on about 50 boards, including 6 listed companies. I practiced law for 20 years (was Partner in a global law firm), and have been CEO of a listed funds management company for 10 years. I raised and profitably deployed over $200,000,000 over the last 15 years. This time I am raising about $15m in a Token Swap (founder lock-up included) and I would like to share it with you. We are developing a sweet solution to send crypto by instant message on social media platforms!  I would like to start this announcement thread by thanking this wonderful community which I have been following and educating myself with. I am proud to have finally opened a user account here. I always promised myself I will do so once I will have something real to contribute back.   Tigereum is an innovative decentralized messaging bot to securely message crypto to friends and family on instant messaging platforms. Our primary aim is to provide a secure alternative for cryptoholders to message crypto to their friends and family, so that they do not have to convert to fiat simply to message funds easily and for free. Our secondary aim is to build on all the benefits of crypto to make messaging crypto a better and more secure solution for messaging funds, especially across international borders.  Tigereum believes that crypto developers should be able to provide a better solution for messaging money than social media companies, big banks and international remitters. Crypto already has the answers to a decentralized, borderless, secure, digital, global currency which can be messaged around to anyone, anywhere.  Crypto‚Äôs competitive advantages should make messaging money cheaper and easier for everyone.  Crypto community should jump on the IM paradigm shift, and not leave messaging money to the social media companies. Tigereum will faithfully adopt the key principles of the crypto world: decentralization, encryption, security, anonymity and community.

I will expose everything in advance and also encourage potential participants to DD myself personally and the Tigereum project as a whole. In fact, I would like to cooperate and help you as much as I can in order to avoid unpleasant/unnecessary situations.  Due-Diligence FAQ  Q     What problem is Tigereum fixing? A     There‚Äôs no way to message crypto in an instant message   Q     What‚Äôs the solution? A      Use an AI chatbot to message crypto on all instant messaging platforms  Q     How will Tigereum Tokens be used in this solution? A      Tigereum Tokens will be the internal cryptocurrency for Tigereum‚Äôs instant messaging solution  Q     What blockchain will Tigereum Tokens use? A      Ethereum ERC-20 smart contracts will be used to create Tigereum Tokens  Q     How many Tigereum Tokens are being offered to participants in this Token Swap? A      40,000,000  Q     How many Tigereum Tokens do I get for my ETH? A      You get 1000 Tigereum Tokens for 1 ETH  Q      How will you use the ETH swapped for Tigereum Tokens? A      Your ETH will be used to fund Tigereum‚Äôs decentralized crypto messaging bot development, go-to-market, and for a treasury float  Q     Do I have to register for the 33% First Day Bonus? A     It‚Äôs not compulsory to pre-register for the 33% First Day Bonus (available on opening on 8 December 2017), but its best to make sure you don‚Äôt miss out  Q     What bonuses are you giving to Pre-swap Participants? A.     Pre-swap participants will get a special bonus, and priority access to buybacks. Pre-swaps must be agreed before 20 November because that‚Äôs when the Smart Contracts will be released.  Contact me if you are interested.   Q     Why would I want to send crypto by instant message, because I just use my digital wallet? A     Indeed, you can send crypto from your digital wallet now. But respectfully, digital wallets are for early adopters not the average person.  To become mainstream, crypto needs to deliver customer experiences which the average person can use, and which can interchange more easily with fiat.     Q     What if my IM friend does not want to receive crypto? A     Tigereum will exchange your crypto into your friend‚Äôs preferred currency when they redeem their funds.  This can occur at their cost without any hassle to you at the time you message your crypto.  Q     Which social media platforms would I be able to use Tigereum on to message crypto? A     We will make it possible for you to message crypto on all major social media platforms.   Tigereum‚Äôs solution is flexible, globally scalable, independent of any one social media platform, which means we can be quick to market.  Q     Will Tigereum‚Äôs messaging bot be secure on social media platforms? A     Tigereum will keep faith with the expectations of the crypto community by combining the best security features of encryption, blockchain, anonymity, crypto wallets and crypto exchanges into our solution architecture, so that messaging crypto is as secure as your digital wallet. We appreciate that many people in this community do not use traditional social media like Facebook, however many other people still do.  Q      Did you write your prototype bot code? A      No, I do not write code.  However, a prototype bot is being built to test our proposition in a simple and effective way until we complete the Token Swap and can begin a fully funded development.  Q      How can I test your prototype? A      Only pre-swap participants will receive a personal invitation to test the prototype  Q     What is Tigereum‚Äôs business model? A     Tigereum will earn its revenues from payments flowing across our bot platform. Based on existing price points, Tigereum expects gross margins in the range of 2-5%.  Q      When will your Buyback program begin? A      After the first 12 months  Q     Who will manage the Tigereum Project? A     Tigereum will be managed by Aero Cards Ltd (company number 09513556), a UK-based consulting and management fintech which I own. Aero will hold the Token Swap proceeds and audit Tigereum‚Äôs use of funds under the guidance of the Advisory Board.  Q      You are the sole shareholder of Aero, what about the rest of the team? A      All current and future team members will be paid a salary in Tigereum Tokens or ETH  Q     How have you selected the Advisory Board? A     I have put together an experienced and capable independent Advisory Board with strengths in fintech and crypto  Q     What about the 2012 regulatory proceedings against you by ASIC in Australia? A     I have been a company director on about 50 boards, including 6 listed companies. In 2012, one of the listed companies I was a director of had a regulatory dispute with the corporate regulator in Australia.  The Federal Court dismissed the case and found in favour of the company and its directors on all issues. http://www.smh.com.au/business/court-dismisses-asic-action-against-former-mariner-directors-20150622-ghu5mv.html  Q      What is the best way to contact you directly?

We will help bring the average person into crypto by developing smooth customer solutions which are more like the ones they use everyday on social media. Digital wallets are great for early adopters, and also for large crypto transfers where security is particularly important.  However the average non-crypto person is struggling to enter the crypto world because user interfaces are difficult for them. Our community needs to develop more user-friendly customer interfaces if we want cryptocurrencies to become  mainstream (which we do).

Tigereum is enabling small social payments between friends and family on social media, not commercial transfers. It can operate across all currencies of course (for example, migrant workers). But Tigereum is not for large, commercial payments, as they are better served by digital wallets and projects aimed at improving the integration of digital wallets into commercial environments, which is not us. Our target market is the ""normal person"" who does not usually use crypto, but who will give it a go if the customer interface is easier for them, and more like what they are used to with their everyday social media accounts. Tigereum's solution will also be very handy for the hard-core crypto user who wants to send small amounts of crypto to friends and family who are not into crypo, but who need a bridge between crypto and fiat without them having to get a digital wallet. We believe smoother customer interfaces for non-crypto types will help make crypto more mainstream, and eventually this will contribute to the mass adoption of decentralised currencies.
