We are sorry that some of you felt abandoned, but we came through many things since the Token Sale. We went through the loss of a team member, something you perhaps heard of, Parity attack (don't worry, our CTO virtuously dealt with it and kept the money safe), marketing frauds and many other things. However, we are still here, we are working on the project and will go public sometime soon on the Blockchain Conference Kyiv:  https://medium.com/@TIESNETWORK/blockchain-conference-kiyv-3a9a92a5151c. But let's go through everything step by step.  First of all, we never went fully silent, maintaining a constant presence at our Telegram channel: https://t.me/tiesnetwork. Our core team members are answering questions and sharing opinions time to time.  The second thing you may hear of is that Natalia Tokar is no longer with us. Although she is not a key person for the database development, it was a personal and unpleasant story for all of us, since she was more than a colleague, she was a friend. You can read Alexanders comments here: https://www.facebook.com/antifaust/posts/1740860065965572?pnref=story  Third, some of you were worried whether Parity vulnerabilities affected us. Like other projects, we had some hard time with security issues, but things to the quick reaction of Ties CTO, Dmitriy Kochin, all the money are safe and sound.  Last but not least, some of you look discouraged that we switched from the Network to the Database. This was a tough decision to temporarily froze the concept with cherished for so long, however, we did it for a good reason. As you may know, our Token sale is far from its hardcap and, keeping in mind how ambitious our tasks is, we have directed all the funds into the product crypto market craves for - the Database.  The work is going as planned, we are updating our Github and Alpha as to be expected on schedule - Q1-Q2 it is. Our work is mostly technical, and no time spared for media activities. However, we will do our best to keep ourselves public. We see great potential in this solution and naturally, it became a priority for us to deliver what we had promised - a decentralized, distributed database.",True

Here is our official position:  1. Do we have a right to extend the token sale? In fact yes, because according to our terms&conditions (that have always been public) we have a right to extend or shorten the period of the token sale. “Ties reserves the right to shorten, extend, postpone or change the timing or duration of the TGE.” 2. Why did we extend the token sale? Because there are VCs and crypto funds that ask us for more time to take a decision and they want to support the Ties.Network Database, which can be the next serious innovation since Oracle. 3. Why didn’t we tell you before? Because we understand that it’s not a good idea to extend the token sale, and we can see it by your comments. We hoped that all funds would have had the time to make their decision. Unfortunately, they ask for more time, so we had to make a decision to give them a chance. 4. Will we refund? Since we didn’t break any rules and acted according to our terms&conditions, there are no precedents for a refund. However, we respect your opinion and we want to do good for the community, and now we are accepting applications for a refund. Please send your applications to this email - support@ties.network. We will review all of them after the token sale is over, i.e. after October 26. Right now it is technically impossible to do a refund, because we can’t touch the funds until the official end of the token sale. 5. Will we extend the token sale again? No, October 26 is the deadline. We can assure you that we will close the sale on October 26 or if we raise the cap (whatever happens earlier). If we break this promise, we will refund everyone, and everyone will get their contribution back. 6. If the token sale is officially open again, it would be a discrimination to restrict some people from contributing. Why some can participate and some not? So we are officially opening it for everyone until Oct 26. 7. What if big whales buy our tokens now? Will it affect the token price? Will they dump them? No, we negotiate only with strategic partners and funds who believe in the product and want to support the development of the database. They are not going to dump the tokens the next day after the token sale. Such are our agreements with them. If we make the project happen, this will result in the growth of TIE token, which is good for everyone. Imagine you’re a serious fund. Would you drop the price of your asset? Probably not, because it will negatively affect your own situation. Big investors suffer more from this than small ones. That is why serious partners on board are a guarantee that the token will get stronger.  With Regards, team Ties.Network",True

No, because our token is a token issued on Ethereum blockchain, so you need to have an Ethereum address to receive and store your ICO tokens. You can use any Ethereum wallet: Ethereum wallet, Mist, Parity, MyEtherWallet.com, Jaxx or any other wallet where you have access to the wallet private keys. Do not deposit Ethereum to the TGE using the cryptocurrency exchange account!!! You don't own your cryptoexchange ETH address private key, so will not be able to access your TGE tokens!

As mentioned in the first half of my post most ICOs don't really go anywhere which is why they are working towards regulating them.  They didnt ban actually. US requires SEC filing where token falls under definition of security, and China takes time to investigate ICO cases. Both facts can be no way construed as ICO prohibition. We're not required to file with SEC since TIE token is merely utility one (according to famous Howey test). And the contemplated TGE will be non-us.

No, this is not an offering of shares or dividends. The ICO is a launch of the Tie, a utility coin for the Ties Network platform. The ICO allows interested parties to purchase the TIE coin at a discounted rate in advance of the full launch of the Ties Network platform, which allows you to search for business partners in crypto community, create projects and make business deals.  A utility coin refers to the fact that TIE is actually used for more than just speculation on the crypto exchanges but has a value that can be used for other purposes in the future such as mutual payments within the platform to business partners, who are also the members, and financing projects created on the platform.

No, because our token is a token issued on Ethereum blockchain, so you need to have an Ethereum address to receive and store your ICO tokens. You can use any Ethereum wallet: Ethereum wallet, Mist, Parity, MyEtherWallet.com, Jaxx or any other wallet where you have access to the wallet private keys. Do not deposit Ethereum to the TGE using the cryptocurrency exchange account!!! You don't own your cryptoexchange ETH address private key, so will not be able to access your TGE tokens!",True

Quote from: Abitcoinfuture on October 07, 2017, 05:55:23 PM Is it possible to participate in the ICO without the address Ethereums?  No, because our token is a token issued on Ethereum blockchain, so you need to have an Ethereum address to receive and store your ICO tokens. You can use any Ethereum wallet: Ethereum wallet, Mist, Parity, MyEtherWallet.com, Jaxx or any other wallet where you have access to the wallet private keys. Do not deposit Ethereum to the TGE using the cryptocurrency exchange account!!! You don't own your cryptoexchange ETH address private key, so will not be able to access your TGE tokens!

As mentioned in the first half of my post most ICOs don't really go anywhere which is why they are working towards regulating them.  They didnt ban actually. US requires SEC filing where token falls under definition of security, and China takes time to investigate ICO cases. Both facts can be no way construed as ICO prohibition. We're not required to file with SEC since TIE token is merely utility one (according to famous Howey test). And the contemplated TGE will be non-us.

You can use any Ethereum wallet: Ethereum wallet, Mist, Parity, MyEtherWallet.com, Jaxx or any other wallet where you have access to the wallet private keys. Do not deposit Ethereum to the TGE using the cryptocurrency exchange account!!! You don't own your cryptoexchange ETH address private key, so will not be able to access your TGE tokens!

As mentioned in the first half of my post most ICOs don't really go anywhere which is why they are working towards regulating them.      They didnt ban actually. US requires SEC filing where token falls under definition of security, and China takes time to investigate ICO cases. Both facts can be no way construed as ICO prohibition. We're not required to file with SEC since TIE token is merely utility one (according to famous Howey test). And the contemplated TGE will be non-us. That will be explicitly set forth in the TGE docs.    Quote from: florianuhlemann on October 06, 2017, 02:17:41 PM why are you doing 1 ico for 2 projects?

No, this is not an offering of shares or dividends. The ICO is a launch of the Tie, a utility coin for the Ties Network platform. The ICO allows interested parties to purchase the TIE coin at a discounted rate in advance of the full launch of the Ties Network platform, which allows you to search for business partners in crypto community, create projects and make business deals.  A utility coin refers to the fact that TIE is actually used for more than just speculation on the crypto exchanges but has a value that can be used for other purposes in the future such as mutual payments within the platform to business partners, who are also the members, and financing projects created on the platform.       Quote from: strideynet on October 06, 2017, 03:04:46 PM What is the pric.e? Are sharp downturns expected?      The price will be 0.24 USD / TIE and actual rate to ETH will be determined immediately before the Token Sale. Token distribution is starting in less than 2 weeks! Visit our website and sign up for our mailing list so that you don't miss it: https://ties.network  After the campaign is completed and the token is traded on the exchange, its value will be determined by the market ratio of supply and demand. The cost of the TIE token in BTC and ETH will vary depending on the market rate of these currencies.",True

Quote from: kenel on October 05, 2017, 07:06:32 PM explain to me what is Tise.Network? is this another social network? Ties.Network is an Ethereum-based business platform for the crypto community that allows one to quickly find professionals with proven skills worldwide. Users can strike deals utilizing smart contracts. One can create projects and teams, and conduct ICO’s due diligence with the help of an expert community.  Ties.Network is based on the public, decentralized, distributed NoSQL database, Ties.DB, that can be used by other projects. Ties.DB is Byzantine fault tolerant. Quote from: atariguy on October 05, 2017, 07:16:06 PM Is it possible to participate in the ICO without the address Ethereums? No, because our token is a token issued on Ethereum blockchain, so you need to have an Ethereum address to receive and store your ICO tokens. You can use any Ethereum wallet: Ethereum wallet, Mist, Parity, MyEtherWallet.com, Jaxx or any other wallet where you have access to the wallet private keys. Do not deposit Ethereum to the TGE using the cryptocurrency exchange account!!! You don't own your cryptoexchange ETH address private key, so will not be able to access your TGE tokens!",True

US requires SEC filing where token falls under definition of security, and China takes time to investigate ICO cases. Both facts can be no way construed as ICO prohibition. We're not required to file with SEC since TIE token is merely utility one (according to famous Howey test). And the contemplated TGE will be non-us. That will be explicitly set forth in the TGE docs. Quote from: florianuhlemann on October 05, 2017, 07:48:13 PM why are you doing 1 ico for 2 projects? Because Ties.DB is required to build Ties.Network. We'd like to use existing solution for data storage but there were no any. So we are pioneers to bring Ties.DB to decentralized world.

During the TGE, 70% of TIE tokens will be sold, 10% of the tokens will be reserved for the potential marketing costs, as well as for motivation of early users to join Ties.Network, and 20% of the tokens will be allocated among advisers, counterparties, project development partners and the project team.+",True

The ICO is a launch of the Tie, a utility coin for the Ties Network platform. The ICO allows interested parties to purchase the TIE coin at a discounted rate in advance of the full launch of the Ties Network platform, which allows you to search for business partners in crypto community, create projects and make business deals.  A utility coin refers to the fact that TIE is actually used for more than just speculation on the crypto exchanges but has a value that can be used for other purposes in the future such as mutual payments within the platform to business partners, who are also the members, and financing projects created on the platform.  Quote from: strideynet on October 05, 2017, 08:36:38 PM What is the pric.e? Are sharp downturns expected?

Visit our website and sign up for our mailing list so that you don't miss it: https://ties.network  After the campaign is completed and the token is traded on the exchange, its value will be determined by the market ratio of supply and demand.

The ICO is a launch of the Tie, a utility coin for the Ties Network platform. The ICO allows interested parties to purchase the TIE coin at a discounted rate in advance of the full launch of the Ties Network platform, which allows you to search for business partners in crypto community, create projects and make business deals.  A utility coin refers to the fact that TIE is actually used for more than just speculation on the crypto exchanges but has a value that can be used for other purposes in the future such as mutual payments within the platform to business partners, who are also the members, and financing projects created on the platform.    Quote from: Kracko on October 05, 2017, 12:54:22 PM  What is the pric.e? Are sharp downturns expected?     The price will be 0.24 USD / TIE and actual rate to ETH will be determined immediately before the Token Sale. Token distribution is starting in less than 2 weeks! Visit our website and sign up for our mailing list so that you don't miss it: https://ties.network  After the campaign is completed and the token is traded on the exchange, its value will be determined by the market ratio of supply and demand. The cost of the TIE token in BTC and ETH will vary depending on the market rate of these currencies.     Quote from: mika1977 on October 05, 2017, 01:00:49 PM How long will ICO last?

You can use any Ethereum wallet: Ethereum wallet, Mist, Parity, MyEtherWallet.com, Jaxx or any other wallet where you have access to the wallet private keys.

US requires SEC filing where token falls under definition of security, and China takes time to investigate ICO cases. Both facts can be no way construed as ICO prohibition. We're not required to file with SEC since TIE token is merely utility one (according to famous Howey test). And the contemplated TGE will be non-us. That will be explicitly set forth in the TGE docs.   Quote from: makemebeat on October 05, 2017, 12:23:15 PM why are you doing 1 ico for 2 projects?

The ICO is a launch of the Tie, a utility coin for the Ties Network platform. The ICO allows interested parties to purchase the TIE coin at a discounted rate in advance of the full launch of the Ties Network platform, which allows you to search for business partners in crypto community, create projects and make business deals.  A utility coin refers to the fact that TIE is actually used for more than just speculation on the crypto exchanges but has a value that can be used for other purposes in the future such as mutual payments within the platform to business partners, who are also the members, and financing projects created on the platform.

US requires SEC filing where token falls under definition of security, and China takes time to investigate ICO cases. Both facts can be no way construed as ICO prohibition. We're not required to file with SEC since TIE token is merely utility one (according to famous Howey test). And the contemplated TGE will be non-us.

You can use any Ethereum wallet: Ethereum wallet, Mist, Parity, MyEtherWallet.com, Jaxx or any other wallet where you have access to the wallet private keys. Do not deposit Ethereum to the TGE using the cryptocurrency exchange account!!! You don't own your cryptoexchange ETH address private key, so will not be able to access your TGE tokens!    Quote from: makemebeat on October 01, 2017, 11:54:03 AM Have you guys followed SEC regulation by filing the proper paperwork (or are you planning to be non-US?) So far I haven't found a single ICO that has. Also do you feel that China will fully investigate and approve your case before the ICO begins? As mentioned in the first half of my post most ICOs don't really go anywhere which is why they are working towards regulating them.    They didnt ban actually. US requires SEC filing where token falls under definition of security, and China takes time to investigate ICO cases. Both facts can be no way construed as ICO prohibition. We're not required to file with SEC since TIE token is merely utility one (according to famous Howey test). And the contemplated TGE will be non-us. That will be explicitly set forth in the TGE docs.   Quote from: Abitcoinfuture on October 01, 2017, 12:02:10 PM why are you doing 1 ico for 2 projects?   Because Ties.DB is required to build Ties.Network. We'd like to use existing solution for data storage but there were no any. So we are pioneers to bring Ties.DB to decentralized world.

You can use any Ethereum wallet: Ethereum wallet, Mist, Parity, MyEtherWallet.com, Jaxx or any other wallet where you have access to the wallet private keys. Do not deposit Ethereum to the TGE using the cryptocurrency exchange account!!! You don't own your cryptoexchange ETH address private key, so will not be able to access your TGE tokens!

As mentioned in the first half of my post most ICOs don't really go anywhere which is why they are working towards regulating them.       They didnt ban actually. US requires SEC filing where token falls under definition of security, and China takes time to investigate ICO cases. Both facts can be no way construed as ICO prohibition. We're not required to file with SEC since TIE token is merely utility one (according to famous Howey test). And the contemplated TGE will be non-us. That will be explicitly set forth in the TGE docs.    Quote from: atariguy on September 30, 2017, 04:55:35 PM why are you doing 1 ico for 2 projects?

No, this is not an offering of shares or dividends. The ICO is a launch of the Tie, a utility coin for the Ties Network platform. The ICO allows interested parties to purchase the TIE coin at a discounted rate in advance of the full launch of the Ties Network platform, which allows you to search for business partners in crypto community, create projects and make business deals.  A utility coin refers to the fact that TIE is actually used for more than just speculation on the crypto exchanges but has a value that can be used for other purposes in the future such as mutual payments within the platform to business partners, who are also the members, and financing projects created on the platform.  Quote from: getwork on September 30, 2017, 06:38:18 PM What is the pric.e? Are sharp downturns expected?

Users can strike deals utilizing smart contracts. One can create projects and teams, and conduct ICO’s due diligence with the help of an expert community.  Ties.Network is based on the public, decentralized, distributed NoSQL database, Ties.DB, that can be used by other projects. Ties.DB is Byzantine fault tolerant. Quote from: CryptoPromotions on September 26, 2017, 11:14:50 PM Is it possible to participate in the ICO without the address Ethereums? No, because our token is a token issued on Ethereum blockchain, so you need to have an Ethereum address to receive and store your ICO tokens. You can use any Ethereum wallet: Ethereum wallet, Mist, Parity, MyEtherWallet.com, Jaxx or any other wallet where you have access to the wallet private keys. Do not deposit Ethereum to the TGE using the cryptocurrency exchange account!!! You don't own your cryptoexchange ETH address private key, so will not be able to access your TGE tokens!

As mentioned in the first half of my post most ICOs don't really go anywhere which is why they are working towards regulating them. ""They didnt ban actually. US requires SEC filing where token falls under definition of security, and China takes time to investigate ICO cases. Both facts can be no way construed as ICO prohibition. We're not required to file with SEC since TIE token is merely utility one (according to famous Howey test). And the contemplated TGE will be non-us. That will be explicitly set forth in the TGE docs.""",True

The exact amount of deposit for running ties.db node is still to be determined. It should be significant enough to motivate the node to behave well and not too large so it can be affordable for node maintainers. We will calculate the amount during tests later. Let's make simple calculation. The hosting of capable enough node costs about 500$/month, so it should earn 750$/month. Deposit should be at least 6 months of earnings (at the beginning). So 1500$ is the minimum of deposit. If you buy TIES for this sum you will probably be able to run a node. Especially when TIE will go up.  With regards, team Ties.Network",True

Quote from: ianp on September 25, 2017, 08:54:32 PM explain to me what is Tise.Network? is this another social network? Ties.Network is an Ethereum-based business platform for the crypto community that allows one to quickly find professionals with proven skills worldwide. Users can strike deals utilizing smart contracts. One can create projects and teams, and conduct ICO’s due diligence with the help of an expert community.  Ties.Network is based on the public, decentralized, distributed NoSQL database, Ties.DB, that can be used by other projects. Ties.DB is Byzantine fault tolerant. Quote from: dermo on September 25, 2017, 09:04:44 PM Is it possible to participate in the ICO without the address Ethereums? No, because our token is a token issued on Ethereum blockchain, so you need to have an Ethereum address to receive and store your ICO tokens. You can use any Ethereum wallet: Ethereum wallet, Mist, Parity, MyEtherWallet.com, Jaxx or any other wallet where you have access to the wallet private keys. Do not deposit Ethereum to the TGE using the cryptocurrency exchange account!!! You don't own your cryptoexchange ETH address private key, so will not be able to access your TGE tokens!

As mentioned in the first half of my post most ICOs don't really go anywhere which is why they are working towards regulating them. They didnt ban actually. US requires SEC filing where token falls under definition of security, and China takes time to investigate ICO cases. Both facts can be no way construed as ICO prohibition. We're not required to file with SEC since TIE token is merely utility one (according to famous Howey test). And the contemplated TGE will be non-us.

No, this is not an offering of shares or dividends. The ICO is a launch of the Tie, a utility coin for the Ties Network platform. The ICO allows interested parties to purchase the TIE coin at a discounted rate in advance of the full launch of the Ties Network platform, which allows you to search for business partners in crypto community, create projects and make business deals.  A utility coin refers to the fact that TIE is actually used for more than just speculation on the crypto exchanges but has a value that can be used for other purposes in the future such as mutual payments within the platform to business partners, who are also the members, and financing projects created on the platform.",True

Quote from: dcl595 on September 25, 2017, 11:45:13 AM explain to me what is Tise.Network? is this another social network?   Ties.Network is an Ethereum-based business platform for the crypto community that allows one to quickly find professionals with proven skills worldwide. Users can strike deals utilizing smart contracts. One can create projects and teams, and conduct ICO’s due diligence with the help of an expert community.  Ties.Network is based on the public, decentralized, distributed NoSQL database, Ties.DB, that can be used by other projects. Ties.DB is Byzantine fault tolerant.   Quote from: code on September 25, 2017, 11:55:03 AM Is it possible to participate in the ICO without the address Ethereums?   No, because our token is a token issued on Ethereum blockchain, so you need to have an Ethereum address to receive and store your ICO tokens. You can use any Ethereum wallet: Ethereum wallet, Mist, Parity, MyEtherWallet.com, Jaxx or any other wallet where you have access to the wallet private keys. Do not deposit Ethereum to the TGE using the cryptocurrency exchange account!!! You don't own your cryptoexchange ETH address private key, so will not be able to access your TGE tokens!",True

US requires SEC filing where token falls under definition of security, and China takes time to investigate ICO cases. Both facts can be no way construed as ICO prohibition. We're not required to file with SEC since TIE token is merely utility one (according to famous Howey test). And the contemplated TGE will be non-us. That will be explicitly set forth in the TGE docs.   Quote from: spiceminer15 on September 25, 2017, 12:26:08 PM why are you doing 1 ico for 2 projects?

No, this is not an offering of shares or dividends. The ICO is a launch of the Tie, a utility coin for the Ties Network platform. The ICO allows interested parties to purchase the TIE coin at a discounted rate in advance of the full launch of the Ties Network platform, which allows you to search for business partners in crypto community, create projects and make business deals.  A utility coin refers to the fact that TIE is actually used for more than just speculation on the crypto exchanges but has a value that can be used for other purposes in the future such as mutual payments within the platform to business partners, who are also the members, and financing projects created on the platform.   Quote from: ahitman on September 25, 2017, 01:16:23 PM What is the pric.e? Are sharp downturns expected?

Visit our website and sign up for our mailing list so that you don't miss it: https://ties.network  After the campaign is completed and the token is traded on the exchange, its value will be determined by the market ratio of supply and demand.

Users can strike deals utilizing smart contracts. One can create projects and teams, and conduct ICO’s due diligence with the help of an expert community.  Ties.Network is based on the public, decentralized, distributed NoSQL database, Ties.DB, that can be used by other projects. Ties.DB is Byzantine fault tolerant.   Quote from: qberty on September 24, 2017, 03:29:17 PM Is it possible to participate in the ICO without the address Ethereums?   No, because our token is a token issued on Ethereum blockchain, so you need to have an Ethereum address to receive and store your ICO tokens. You can use any Ethereum wallet: Ethereum wallet, Mist, Parity, MyEtherWallet.com, Jaxx or any other wallet where you have access to the wallet private keys. Do not deposit Ethereum to the TGE using the cryptocurrency exchange account!!! You don't own your cryptoexchange ETH address private key, so will not be able to access your TGE tokens!

So far I haven't found a single ICO that has. Also do you feel that China will fully investigate and approve your case before the ICO begins? As mentioned in the first half of my post most ICOs don't really go anywhere which is why they are working towards regulating them.  They didnt ban actually. US requires SEC filing where token falls under definition of security, and China takes time to investigate ICO cases. Both facts can be no way construed as ICO prohibition. We're not required to file with SEC since TIE token is merely utility one (according to famous Howey test). And the contemplated TGE will be non-us. That will be explicitly set forth in the TGE docs.   Quote from: thisisnotmyltcusername on September 24, 2017, 03:50:39 PM why are you doing 1 ico for 2 projects?   Because Ties.DB is required to build Ties.Network. We'd like to use existing solution for data storage but there were no any. So we are pioneers to bring Ties.DB to decentralized world.",True

During the TGE, 70% of TIE tokens will be sold, 10% of the tokens will be reserved for the potential marketing costs, as well as for motivation of early users to join Ties.Network, and 20% of the tokens will be allocated among advisers, counterparties, project development partners and the project team.+   Quote from: BazkieBumpercar on September 24, 2017, 04:38:48 PM Those who participate will obtain some shares and/or dividends to provid capital for a startup?    No, this is not an offering of shares or dividends. The ICO is a launch of the Tie, a utility coin for the Ties Network platform. The ICO allows interested parties to purchase the TIE coin at a discounted rate in advance of the full launch of the Ties Network platform, which allows you to search for business partners in crypto community, create projects and make business deals.  A utility coin refers to the fact that TIE is actually used for more than just speculation on the crypto exchanges but has a value that can be used for other purposes in the future such as mutual payments within the platform to business partners, who are also the members, and financing projects created on the platform.",True

Users can strike deals utilizing smart contracts. One can create projects and teams, and conduct ICO’s due diligence with the help of an expert community.  Ties.Network is based on the public, decentralized, distributed NoSQL database, Ties.DB, that can be used by other projects. Ties.DB is Byzantine fault tolerant. Quote from: qberty on September 23, 2017, 10:28:18 PM Is it possible to participate in the ICO without the address Ethereums? No, because our token is a token issued on Ethereum blockchain, so you need to have an Ethereum address to receive and store your ICO tokens. You can use any Ethereum wallet: Ethereum wallet, Mist, Parity, MyEtherWallet.com, Jaxx or any other wallet where you have access to the wallet private keys. Do not deposit Ethereum to the TGE using the cryptocurrency exchange account!!! You don't own your cryptoexchange ETH address private key, so will not be able to access your TGE tokens!

As mentioned in the first half of my post most ICOs don't really go anywhere which is why they are working towards regulating them. ""They didnt ban actually. US requires SEC filing where token falls under definition of security, and China takes time to investigate ICO cases. Both facts can be no way construed as ICO prohibition. We're not required to file with SEC since TIE token is merely utility one (according to famous Howey test). And the contemplated TGE will be non-us. That will be explicitly set forth in the TGE docs.""",True

No, this is not an offering of shares or dividends. The ICO is a launch of the Tie, a utility coin for the Ties Network platform. The ICO allows interested parties to purchase the TIE coin at a discounted rate in advance of the full launch of the Ties Network platform, which allows you to search for business partners in crypto community, create projects and make business deals.  A utility coin refers to the fact that TIE is actually used for more than just speculation on the crypto exchanges but has a value that can be used for other purposes in the future such as mutual payments within the platform to business partners, who are also the members, and financing projects created on the platform.

We have two projects. First of them is business network - with integrated deals on smart contracts and reputation system based on deals. With this platform you can quickly find a skilled professional and strike a deal at once and pay with cryptocurrency. The second - is Ties.DB. It is a completely decentralized database with ability to store structured data and search through it. Ties.DB is aimed at all the decentralized projects, not only Ties.Network.  Citizens of any country other than US citizens can buy our tokens. And, in spite of the fact that our token is intended for use inside the Ties.Network platform, we decided to recommend that American citizens should refuse participation in the crowdinvesting campaign of our platform. We respect the laws of all countries of the world and the laws of the USA in particular.In order to avoid disagreements with the American regulator, we do not recommend American citizens to buy our tokens. This provision will be officially fixed in the offer of our service and, in addition, the promo page of our platform (including the private office) for the period of the TGE campaign will not be available for IP addresses from the territory of the United States. These restrictions do not apply to the use of the Ties Network platform itself, which will be available to citizens of all countries from the moment of the readiness of its prototype. At the same time, we will not start the crowdsale campaign until the prototype is fully ready. Citizens of any other state can freely buy TIE coins for mutual settlements within the platform and to support our TGE campaign.  With regards, team Ties.Network",True

You can use any Ethereum wallet: Ethereum wallet, Mist, Parity, MyEtherWallet.com, Jaxx or any other wallet where you have access to the wallet private keys. Do not deposit Ethereum to the TGE using the cryptocurrency exchange account!!! You don't own your cryptoexchange ETH address private key, so will not be able to access your TGE tokens!

So far I haven't found a single ICO that has. Also do you feel that China will fully investigate and approve your case before the ICO begins? As mentioned in the first half of my post most ICOs don't really go anywhere which is why they are working towards regulating them.  They didnt ban actually. US requires SEC filing where token falls under definition of security, and China takes time to investigate ICO cases. Both facts can be no way construed as ICO prohibition. We're not required to file with SEC since TIE token is merely utility one (according to famous Howey test). And the contemplated TGE will be non-us. That will be explicitly set forth in the TGE docs.   Quote from: DeeSome on September 23, 2017, 12:30:48 PM why are you doing 1 ico for 2 projects?

More people want to buy than sell. after each ICO we see that scenario. We completely understand why people do it, and we also understand why people see ICOs as risky - they don't understand the product and don't believe in it.

What gives your tokens value? Because today token is cheap. As we proceed to Q4 2018 it will grow. Consider Ethereum. It took two years to launch it. And Ether has grown 300 times. We are aimed at real product that is why we plan real roadmap. But real product increases the chances to multiply token value.

As mentioned in the first half of my post most ICOs don't really go anywhere which is why they are working towards regulating them.  They didnt ban actually. US requires SEC filing where token falls under definition of security, and China takes time to investigate ICO cases. Both facts can be no way construed as ICO prohibition. We're not required to file with SEC since TIE token is merely utility one (according to famous Howey test). And the contemplated TGE will be non-us.

No, this is not an offering of shares or dividends. The ICO is a launch of the Tie, a utility coin for the Ties Network platform. The ICO allows interested parties to purchase the TIE coin at a discounted rate in advance of the full launch of the Ties Network platform, which allows you to search for business partners in crypto community, create projects and make business deals.  A utility coin refers to the fact that TIE is actually used for more than just speculation on the crypto exchanges but has a value that can be used for other purposes in the future such as mutual payments within the platform to business partners, who are also the members, and financing projects created on the platform.

It allows you to get all the services on one platform, paying them with one cryptocurrency, without the need to purchase and maintain various cryptos.

Quote from: makemebeat on September 19, 2017, 02:07:56 AM Have you guys followed SEC regulation by filing the proper paperwork (or are you planning to be non-US?) So far I haven't found a single ICO that has. Also do you feel that China will fully investigate and approve your case before the ICO begins? As mentioned in the first half of my post most ICOs don't really go anywhere which is why they are working towards regulating them. They didnt ban actually. US requires SEC filing where token falls under definition of security, and China takes time to investigate ICO cases. Both facts can be no way construed as ICO prohibition. We're not required to file with SEC since TIE token is merely utility one (according to famous Howey test). And the contemplated TGE will be non-us. That will be explicitly set forth in the TGE docs.  Quote from: Abitcoinfuture on September 19, 2017, 02:16:36 AM hi! how can I buy tokens?  Hello!

The search results are presented as a list with filters (e.g., individuals, projects, connections, ratings).  Quote from: atariguy on September 19, 2017, 03:27:02 AM Those who participate will obtain some shares and/or dividends to provid capital for a startup?  No, this is not an offering of shares or dividends. The ICO is a launch of the Tie, a utility coin for the Ties Network platform. The ICO allows interested parties to purchase the TIE coin at a discounted rate in advance of the full launch of the Ties Network platform, which allows you to search for business partners in crypto community, create projects and make business deals.  A utility coin refers to the fact that TIE is actually used for more than just speculation on the crypto exchanges but has a value that can be used for other purposes in the future such as mutual payments within the platform to business partners, who are also the members, and financing projects created on the platform.  Quote from: Itcher on September 19, 2017, 03:39:16 AM why are you doing 1 ico for 2 projects? Because Ties.DB is required to build Ties.Network.

With this platform you can quickly find a skilled professional and strike a deal at once and pay with cryptocurrency. The second - is Ties.DB. It is a completely decentralized database with ability to store structured data and search through it. Ties.DB is aimed at all the decentralized projects, not only Ties.Network.",True

More people want to buy than sell. after each ICO we see that scenario.

What gives your tokens value? Because today token is cheap. As we proceed to Q4 2018 it will grow. Consider Ethereum. It took two years to launch it. And Ether has grown 300 times. We are aimed at real product that is why we plan real roadmap. But real product increases the chances to multiply token value.

No, this is not an offering of shares or dividends. The ICO is a launch of the Tie, a utility coin for the Ties Network platform. The ICO allows interested parties to purchase the TIE coin at a discounted rate in advance of the full launch of the Ties Network platform, which allows you to search for business partners in crypto community, create projects and make business deals.  A utility coin refers to the fact that TIE is actually used for more than just speculation on the crypto exchanges but has a value that can be used for other purposes in the future such as mutual payments within the platform to business partners, who are also the members, and financing projects created on the platform.

First of them is business network - with integrated deals on smart contracts and reputation system based on deals. With this platform you can quickly find a skilled professional and strike a deal at once and pay with cryptocurrency. The second - is Ties.DB. It is a completely decentralized database with ability to store structured data and search through it. Ties.DB is aimed at all the decentralized projects, not only Ties.Network.",True

Users who want anonymity can benefit from additional connectivity to the nodes where some of the nodes are published as TOR Hidden Service and access to them is only achieved through TOR. Quote from: kenel on September 17, 2017, 06:01:03 PM Is it possible to participate in the ICO without the address Ethereums? No, because our token is a token issued on Ethereum blockchain, so you need to have an Ethereum address to receive and store your ICO tokens. You can use any Ethereum wallet: Ethereum wallet, Mist, Parity, MyEtherWallet.com, Jaxx or any other wallet where you have access to the wallet private keys. Do not deposit Ethereum to the TGE using the cryptocurrency exchange account!!! You don't own your cryptoexchange ETH address private key, so will not be able to access your TGE tokens!",True

US requires SEC filing where token falls under definition of security, and China takes time to investigate ICO cases. Both facts can be no way construed as ICO prohibition.

The search results are presented as a list with filters (e.g., individuals, projects, connections, ratings).  Quote from: MyTimeCoin on September 16, 2017, 06:02:08 PM Will there be some kind of reputation system or ranking inside the platform?  Expert ratings are based on the real transactions and deals that have taken place in the past and are written in the blockchain. In many ways this seems like a great example of the new business use-cases built on blockchain driven technology that may help to deliver better, more reliable business for everyone involved. The idea is to leverage the fact that there is no easy way to fake your business history or rating on a blockchain system. Our irrefutable rating system ensures project owners and trustworthy contractors find each other. Once connected users can start transacting safely through smart contracts.  Quote from: nenelsparadise on September 16, 2017, 06:04:09 PM Those who participate will obtain some shares and/or dividends to provid capital for a startup?  No, this is not an offering of shares or dividends. The ICO is a launch of the Tie, a utility coin for the Ties Network platform. The ICO allows interested parties to purchase the TIE coin at a discounted rate in advance of the full launch of the Ties Network platform, which allows you to search for business partners in crypto community, create projects and make business deals.  A utility coin refers to the fact that TIE is actually used for more than just speculation on the crypto exchanges but has a value that can be used for other purposes in the future such as mutual payments within the platform to business partners, who are also the members, and financing projects created on the platform.  Quote from: CryptoPromotions on September 16, 2017, 06:14:32 PM why are you doing 1 ico for 2 projects? Because Ties.DB is required to build Ties.Network. We'd like to use existing solution for data storage but there were no any. So we are pioneers to bring Ties.DB to decentralized world.

As mentioned in the first half of my post most ICOs don't really go anywhere which is why they are working towards regulating them. They didnt ban actually. US requires SEC filing where token falls under definition of security, and China takes time to investigate ICO cases. Both facts can be no way construed as ICO prohibition. We're not required to file with SEC since TIE token is merely utility one (according to famous Howey test). And the contemplated TGE will be non-us. That will be explicitly set forth in the TGE docs.  Quote from: dermo on September 14, 2017, 09:54:04 PM hi! how can I buy tokens?  Hello!

Ties.Network is a business platform for the crypto community that allows you to quickly find business partners in crypto communities around the world with proven skills and competencies, and quickly make secure business transactions with the TIE crypto currency that is the basis of the platform. The Ties.Network platform, as well as the TiesDB (database), work on the TIE token, which is made for the convenience of our users and partners. It allows you to get all the services on one platform, paying them with one cryptocurrency, without the need to purchase and maintain various cryptos. At the same time, our solution is based on Ethereum, and therefore, the user will see in their wallet TIE, ETH and any other Ethereum based tokens that they bought, and will be able to produce any of the cryptos available to other platform users, as well as counterparties outside platform.

Ties.Network is a business platform for the crypto community that allows you to quickly find business partners in crypto communities around the world with proven skills and competencies, and quickly make secure business transactions with the TIE crypto currency that is the basis of the platform. The Ties.Network platform, as well as the TiesDB (database), work on the TIE token, which is made for the convenience of our users and partners. It allows you to get all the services on one platform, paying them with one cryptocurrency, without the need to purchase and maintain various cryptos. At the same time, our solution is based on Ethereum, and therefore, the user will see in their wallet TIE, ETH and any other Ethereum based tokens that they bought, and will be able to produce any of the cryptos available to other platform users, as well as counterparties outside platform.  Quote from: granathus on September 12, 2017, 01:32:03 PM Can TiesDB work on any blockchain?   While TiesDB currently only works on Ethereum, we are aiming at matching all platforms as they appear.

While the hugely successful Cloud storage offered on demand data processing abilities, the centrifugal point of control can invite risks involved with system failure. Plus, 100% authenticity can’t be guaranteed as someone will definitely be having access to your data.  Containing similar threats, Ties.DB augments the brilliance of Blockchain and Decentralized Storage, surpassing the lag caused by current Cloud Solutions and offering faster and more accurate computing results.  As an Open-Source, Public solution for structuring such data, Ties.DB works by partitioning a database into spaces of specific data as defined by an enterprise, the ownership can be moved without affecting the needed privacy and this is where Ties.DB takes the leap.  _______________________________________________________________  Ties.DB against alternative Blockchain enabled data storage solutions _______________________________________________________________  Beyond the traditional FTP services and the recent Cloud storage, a few Blockchain enabled decentralized storage solutions were pitched. However, they fell prey to the default cons a Blockchain setup comes with causing immutable, restricted and relatively slower performance.  While every bit of information across the Blockchain is stored permanently, the same goes entirely against the principles of Data Anonymity as expected out of dApps.  Ties.DB too supports unlimited number of node replicas and each can be a coordinator to prevent uncontrolled data requests and reduce network load.  Weaving a fine tuned version of both worlds, Ties.DB offers a comprehensive decentralized storage system that supports Blockchain projects entered the market.  _______________________________________________________________  How Ties.DB is changing the Game _______________________________________________________________  Critical to businesses of data, Ties.DB has facilitated the Ties.Network that allows first of its kind instant file fetching using the specific contents through huge volumes of dynamic data processed seamlessly.  Such high degrees of advanced search and data modification in real time goes in sync with the soaring need of dApps as accessed by the participants in the Blockchain community.  _______________________________________________________________  Decentralized Architecture _______________________________________________________________  Decentralization is at the heart of Ties.Network with each node fostered by the Blockchain competency. The nodes (servers) are interconnected but are not governed by a central host and that helps overcome any possibility of data fringe or system failure. Supporting different versions of Blockchain, the Ties architecture is extensible towards on demand network growth and enhanced speed.  _______________________________________________________________  Hyperboria Mesh Network — Up Scaled Security _______________________________________________________________  Taking a leap ahead of IP masking and encryption, Ties.Network (built on Ties.DB) encapsulates next level powerful processing with Hyoperboria Mesh network that follows the Cjdns protocol; a networking protocol that uses a public key cryptography for address location while a distributed hash table is implemented for routing. Thus, smooth extensibility and omnipresent security is assured. Not to miss, sluggish IP Masking and difficult server synchronization issues are efficiently resolved here.  _______________________________________________________________  Exponential Data Storage _______________________________________________________________  The ability to conduct accurate search through large volumes of structured data, Ties.Network empowers a stretch of complex tasks by drastically bringing down the response time.  Be it storing public data such as user profile information (social platforms, messengers etc) or analysis of articles, blogs and encyclopedias being shared in real time, Ties.Network covers up a longer stretch of routine processing an end user could think of. Not to miss, the tremendous in built encryption competency that can secretly store private information.  _______________________________________________________________  Dapps _______________________________________________________________  The future of data access lies with Decentralized Apps and Ties.DB has been conceived keeping the enterprise of future in mind. The platform supports seamless development of highly scalable third-party applications. _______________________________________________________________  Costing _______________________________________________________________  Since the user pays only for writing and changing the data and don’t have to pay for space and for the capacity, the operation costs in Ties.Network are hugely cheaper than any centralized storage provider.  The demand for decentralized projects will rise in years to come and absence of a reliable database could malign the overall significance unless the entire system is decentralized. Staying committed to the speculated business environment ahead, Ties.DB could help excel your project performance in the Blockchain while high returns are guaranteed.",True

Accountants may commit miniscule mathematical errors, leading to embezzlement. Operations managers may skim off funds to pay for costs illegally. And, business partners may turn on each other.  _______________________________________________________________  Fraud Amongst Partners Example. _______________________________________________________________  A famous case involving Chicago real estate development company, Joseph Freed & Associates, suffered partner fraud by the majority owner. Laurence Freed, 50% shareholder in the venture owning the development business, ultimately made the call to divert money from partnership bank accounts, without the knowledge of his partners.  A slew of other fraudulent activities occurred at the company, ultimately leading to the indictment of Mr. Freed. These include pledging the same collateral to two separate financial institutions, and abusing a tax financing system in the city of Chicago.  This is merely a real world example with significant notoriety. Countless other ways exist, in which one partner can commit fraud against other partners. Blockchain technology provides the most straight-forward of solutions: Smart contracts. Ties.Network is the vehicle for smart contracts to bloom.  _______________________________________________________________  Smart Contracts _______________________________________________________________  Unfortunately, these business dealings occurred in the mid-2000s — a time when more secure contracts did not exist. Prior to the dawn of blockchain, businesses were required to simply sign a contract and trust the other parties. Trust can easily be broken; thus, the concept of smart contracts arose. Nowadays, businesses may engage in both traditional and smart contracts.  There are plenty of business-related scenarios, from which to choose. But let’s focus on an example many people experience during their lifetime: Purchasing a house. Now, here’s how Ties.Network steps in.  A husband and wife put in a bid for a house, and it’s accepted. At that point, they create a smart contract on Ties.Network, bringing the seller on board, as well. The two parties set the terms and conditions of the contract. Then, the seller provides a wallet, and they agree upon a time by which the cryptocurrency will be sent. If the couple sends the funds before the specified time, it will execute an immediate transfer of the deed from seller to buyer. However, if the buyer does not send the funds on time, the contract will remain unverified, and the deed remains in the seller’s hands. This is otherwise known as an automated contract.  While this is a relatively simple example, let’s look at smart contracts in the context of Joseph Freed & Associates. Most obvious, is the use of a smart contract with both banks offering the company a loan. The first bank would have the collateral locked into a contract, which immediately stops it from use in a separate loan. Because it’s already been registered on the blockchain, it’s impossible to use an asset twice.  If Joseph Freed & Associates had created smart contracts with the Ties.Network, they would have completely avoided the headache that Laurence Freed created. Ties.Network is an innovative community in which blockchain professionals may connect, and work together on a platform built on trust.  _______________________________________________________________  Ties.Network _______________________________________________________________  An Ethereum-based platform for the crypto community, Ties.Network, allows one to quickly find skilled professionals worldwide. Users strike deals via smart contracts. A user can create both projects and teams, and conduct an ICO’s due diligence, thanks to an expert community.  Smart contracts on Ties.Network can have one of three purposes. First is the ability to outsource jobs. Conduct a search on the platform for a certain type of contractor, based on your needs. These needs can range from legal help, to website copy, and programmers. Once you connect with a contractor with whom you’d like to work, you will agree upon terms and conditions, that will be executed and regulated by a smart contract.  Second, is with teammates, contractual, or temporary work, whereby project details and terms are regulated by a smart contract. If you already have a business and you’d like to move your clients from paper contracts to regular ones, you can create contracts for a specified group of people. Ties.Network gives you the ability to pay team members via a wallet.  Last, is the ability to garner feedback from experts. Because the platform vets all transactions, any illegitimate or questionable data is immediately rejected. Each expert’s background is based on real business deals with smart contracts, which, of course, are written on a blockchain. Therefore, all skill sets are verified in a real world manner — rather than LinkedIn’s skillsets, whereby any user can endorse a particular skill. Ties.Network allows experts to speak freely about various issues on the network. While the platform allows you to choose your degree of anonymity, all advice is valid given said verification.  _______________________________________________________________  Real Life Applications _______________________________________________________________  Let’s say you’re a cryptocurrency hardware wallet store located in Los Angeles, and your supplier is located in South Korea. Without a smart contract, you’d have to place a ton of trust in your supplier. So, ask your supplier to set up a profile on Ties.Network. They will input information such as name, date of birth, current occupation, contact information, and more. From there, you and the other party will set the terms of the smart contract on Ties.Network. No more, “Yes, the shipment was sent!” Only to find out that was an utter lie.  Alternatively, it can be extremely expensive to hire an in-house writer. The benefits alone can eat you alive, thus making outsourcing the best option. But, one of the most frustrating things about the blockchain sector is the lack of talent. Since it’s such a new technology, there are few experts…and many of them live in very different areas of the world. With Ties.Network you can easily filter contractors, to find the perfect writer — no matter where they are located. And, if you’d rather just wait until writers find your project, you can upload all pertinent details and sit back. Once you find the right one, you can negotiate project terms, and a smart contract will regulate it through completion.  In the world of art, purchasing a piece halfway across the world can be downright terrifying. Fine art costs a pretty penny, and you’re putting a lot of trust into a stranger once you’ve purchased it. Rather than biting your fingers bloody, opt to set up a smart contract with the buyer on Ties.Network. In this case, you’d enter terms of the deal, such as the price, method of delivery, and required documentation. Once everything has been completed on all parties’ ends, the money releases to the seller. Art fraud no more.  These are just a few of the many real world examples you would encounter in everyday life. Smart contracts aren’t just for blockchain related companies — they’re for everyone who is seeking more security in their business dealings. Blindly trusting all parties is no longer innate to a business contract.  _______________________________________________________________  Conclusion _______________________________________________________________  Smart contracts are a digital extension of the paper contracts of old. They provide an exceedingly secure method to conduct business. The issue of fraud becomes moot with the implementation of smart contracts, no matter the industry, project, or company. Ties.Network is the vehicle that truly allows users of all kinds to secure their contracts. It’s an easy “yes!”",True

To encourage long-term data storage, especially if data are rarely requested, some sort of data storage incentive is needed. This piece on Ethereum Swarm describes the system of rewards for storage. Nodes enter into a data storage contract with the information owner for a period of time. The storage can be paid at the time of data storage (update) or after a certain period of time provided that the data is actually stored. In the event of a loss of data is detected during the duration of the contract, the node may be penalized, as each node requires an initial registration with a security deposit. When you store data, the node returns a receipt that proves that it has accepted the file for storage. This receipt then allows you to check the storage situation of the associated data and, if necessary, to initiate a legal smart contract to penalize the offending node. Since data is not static, a record with the same key can be rewritten several times. This means that not only can the original record correspond to the presented receipt, but a record with the same key that is newer to the timestamp can also correspond. When the user initiates a data deletion operation, instead of physically deleting data, the data is replaced with a special ""zero"" record. The record can be physically deleted after expiration of its storage contract.  Best regards, Ties community  What are revenue sources for nodes?  Ties DB gains its revenue from the following sources: Storing content on the node server Retrieving content from the node server  When the user places the content in the database on the node server, he or she pays the node's service fee for storing and processing content. The system does not only motivate node owners to utilize the process, but also prevents attackers from littering the database. Later the platform refunds user expenses in case users show no signs of malicious activity and there is no collusion between the participant and the node (for further information see further “Self-organization and motivation”). User costs for storage as well as for content retrieval come from the platform budget.",True

The best example of a decentralized application is the blockchain with its distributed ledger and the ability to perform transactions without the need of a central authority.  However, even considering the complexity of managing transactions in a decentralized way, the blockchain and the cryptocurrencies remain a very specific kind of application, with very simple requirements regarding the storage of transaction-related data.  With the introduction of smart contracts, blockchain projects have introduced new functionalities, without really introducing additional complexity and volume regarding structured data.  The challenge  The expectation of creating completely decentralized applications changes abruptly the situation.  A team that wants to develop a decentralized application has the choice of using current blockchain technologies for managing monetization or maybe user identity but must rely on centralized backend solutions to store the “real” application data.  With real “application data” it is meant the terabytes or petabytes of information, typically organized in table and documents, which make the application work.  The most common backend solutions are based on several database technologies like:  * Relational database management systems  * NoSQL (key/value) databases  * Document oriented databases  There are several competitors in the structured data storage world, most of them can master the management of petabytes or even exabytes of data.  However, none of them is decentralized. All of the existing solutions can be corrupted or even shut down by a government, a central authority or a malicious organization.  Does it make sense to build an application where only the monetization and smart contract part is decentralized if the application data itself is centralized?  The obvious answer is: no!  The solution  Ties.DB is the solution to this kind of problems. Ties.DB is the first distributed and decentralized database management system.  The Ties.DB public database instance consists of a network of nodes of different size that contributes to the storage and management of database tables. Everybody running a node will be able to insert, manipulate and query structured data in the Ties.DB public instance. This will be as easy as it is to enter data in common relational or NoSQL database management systems, with the advantage of not needing to care about redundancy, backup or high availability.  Data is stored in Ties.DB in an inherently redundant way. Data owners will not need to take care of backups and high availability like with on premise solutions and will not have to worry about a central authority, ownership of data itself or eventual access by government organizations like secret services like when hosting own data on cloud platforms. In addition to that, Ties.DB is censorship resistant, as data is encrypted using private keys controlled by the data owner.  A revolution in the way data is exchanged  Despite the huge advantages in security and privacy, Ties.DB offers indeed an extremely straight forward way of sharing data with other users or organizations.  As there is only a huge public instance of Ties.DB, all users and organizations are managing their data in the same database. Unencrypted data belonging to an organization is readable by any other user in the database network, but users and organizations can encrypt their valuable data. To make their own valuable data available to other organizations using Ties.DB, it is sufficient to give it the ability to decrypt the data, and the partner organizations need only to run a query on the granted data.  As a possible use case, imagine a company MyIM that offers a decentralized instant messaging and payment service and an E-Commerce company MyBazaar that sells items online using a decentralized e-commerce application. Both companies use Ties.DB as a backend for their applications. If MyBazaar wants to offer MyIM as a payment service to its customers, it just needs to buy the ability to decrypt the required data from MyIM.  Once the trade is completed, MyBazaar will access needed database objects without the need of complex data exchange procedures like using FTP servers or complicated ETL processes.  The same procedure could be used by insurance companies to access weather or traffic information from external services, or any company that wants to outsource its data science tasks to trusted specialized consulting companies.  For example, a company closes a deal with an analytics consultancy for some analysis on its data. Both the committer and the consultancy owns Ties.DB nodes. The company could just grant access to own raw data stored in Ties.DB to the analytics consultancy. The consultancy would elaborate complex analysis, store the results on Ties.DB and grant access to them to its customer.  Many examples like these are possible with Ties.DB.  A new economy of structured data  The economy of Ties.DB will be based on a system of rewards for users and organizations that hosts the nodes in the distributed database network. Organizations that simply want to store or query data without running a node will need to pay the network for the service. The currency used to buy and sell Ties.DB services is the TIE tokens.  However, another usage of the TIE token is the ability to stipulate trade deals over data usage through the Ties.Network.  Ties.Network is a professional social network for managing business transactions between organizations and IT professionals. Business transactions can concern work performed in a project or a team but also data usage in Ties.DB.  In the above examples concerning the right to access data owned by the different parties of the business deals, Ties.Network would act as the settlement platform for such deals.  In this way, a completely new economy would arise around structured data stored in Ties.DB.",True

Our recent posts caused this reaction because we compared different technologies that have different functions (Ties.DB is a database, IPFS is a file system, BigChainDB is a private blockchain). However, all three technologies are data storage solutions, and they can be compared if we are talking about public and decentralized storage of specific data. By “specific” we mean structured documents, where content is subject to change, and where there is a need to search within the content and quickly find information.  Below we provide a more detailed comparison of those technologies.  _______________________________________________________________  Ties.DB _______________________________________________________________  General information  Public and decentralized database. This means that its servers (nodes) are interconnected, but do not have a single center that controls them (therefore it’s public) or can cause a system failure (therefore it’s decentralized).  By “failure” we mean equipment failure or its incorrect operation. In case one of the nodes unexpectedly fails, its work will be continued by the others.  By “control”, we mean the possibility of one party to manage the entire network (including equipment and software) or its most critical part. In that case a decision made by this one party can lead to a complete malfunction of the whole network.  Here are the main characteristics of Ties.DB: it allows you to store large amounts of structured information and perform a quick search within documents. In addition, it is the first decentralized and public database.  What it is not:   * It is not a file storage solution (it is not designed to store large files, for example video or other binary files larger than 20MB).  * It is not a Blockchain (neither public, such as Etherium, nor private, like BigChainDB).  * it does not store the history of all transactions and supports data modification.  What it is intended for and examples of use-cases:   * Storing user profile information (social networks, messengers, business platforms).  * Storing large volumes of public information (news, articles, comments, blogs, posts, knowledge bases, encyclopedias).  * Storing non-public, encrypted information with the option to search by hashed keywords (for example, closed forums, groups, or projects in social networks).  * Storing product catalogs for trading platforms, including Information on articles available in warehouses, and inventory accounting.  * Music and video catalogues (not the files themselves, but the description and links to the files, for example — decentralized torrent catalogs).  * QUICK SEARCH FOR ANY OF THIS INFORMATION within the files.  * It is suitable for projects and applications that need full decentralization and should not depend on a single controlling center.  _______________________________________________________________  IPFS _______________________________________________________________   General information  File sharing. It is the file exchange protocol. It allows you to merge files on users’ computers into a single file system. The specifics of IPFS is that all users of the network are equal participants, and in order to download the file for the first time, computer of its owner must be online (as soon as the user turns off their computer the file becomes unavailable). Replication (duplication) of files will occur only in case the shared content is popular enough.  What it is not:   * It is not a database. That is, it’s just a number of files, and you can’t search for specific information within those files.  * It is not a blockchain. It does not use blockchain technology.  * It’s not a cloud file storage. We have to remember that the files are stored not in the cloud but on the OWNER’s computer in the FIRST PLACE. Files are replicated (duplicated) only in case they become popular (i.e. there are enough requests to share/download those files).  What it is intended for and examples of use-cases:   * it is an easy way to share your files.  * Common use-case is sharing video or music files.  * It is suitable for projects and applications that need full decentralization and should not depend on a single controlling center.  _______________________________________________________________  BigChainDB _______________________________________________________________   General information  It is a private (not public) blockchain for corporate use. It is limitedly public, but has a single point that controls the system (data storage cluster) and can cause system failure. It can allow arbitrary users to work with it, but it does not allow anyone to become a node because all nodes work with the one and the same data storage.  What it is not:   * It is not a general-purpose database. The structure of the data is fixed, i.e. users are not allowed to create their own tables. For example, it only contains tables of blocks, transactions, assets, polls, but it does not allow you to create a table with users’ profiles and search through it.  * It’s not public blockchain. Namely, there is a single point that controls the system (a cluster of data storage) and can cause its failure.  * It is not intended for projects and applications that need full decentralization and do not need one controlling center.  WhT it is intended for and examples of use-cases:  - Corporate (private) Blockchain and all possible applications.  Conclusion: WHY do WE COMPARE IPFS and BigChainDB with Ties.DB although IPFS is a file system, BigChain DB is a blockchain, and Ties.DB is a database?  Because all these systems can be used for storing data, but not everybody understands the differences. We are bringing a new solution to the market and we are comparing it to the existing technologies in terms of abilities to store structured data, because we feel it’s important to emphasize a unique and important function of our solution.  It is important to understand that Ties.DB is not a competitor to these technologies but can be used in conjunction with them. It can be used to store data that does not need to be immutable, but does require speed of reading, writing, and searching through it, as well as full decentralization. IPFS does not allow you to upload documents to the cloud and it also does not allow finding documents based on partial content (e.g. you can’t find a song if you remember one line from the song).

Ties.Network combines the versatility of an industry-grade networking platform with advanced technology that provides high security and anonymity in business transactions. It can be utilized for public and private sectors and across industries to serve a wide range of potential customers and fields of implementation.  Ties.Network solves the trust issue among crypto-community users, who do not know each other, by providing a safe environment following decentralized economy principles. In addition to being secure by design through the use of blockchain technology and smart contracts, the network also adopts “genuine rating” system, in which only those who had performed business transactions can publish their reviews. The reviews are resistant to tampering and deletion.  Ties.Network utilizes a public decentralized distributed NoSQL database Ties.DB, which is impervious to data compromise and supports replication and sharding. It also provides data modification and deletion, full-text search, and support for secondary indices features, which are usually only available on private NoSQL databases.  Overall, Ties.Network offers the following key advantages, which are tremendously useful in ensuring the success of business transactions:  * Decentralization * Stability * Optional anonymity * Privacy * Data storage * Scalability * Open-source * Democracy * Profitability * Speed * Expansion possibilities  1. Financial Services  The platform securely manages trade clearing and settlement workflows between parties, calculates settlement accounts, and automatic transfers of funds. In addition, it provides a system for bond coupon payments to be automatically calculated in order to pay bond interest payments and return principal upon maturity. In insurance claim processing, the platform provides an environment for clerical workflows and payout calculations based on claim types and policies. Across the following sectors and industries, Ties.Network can be used to serve a wide range of potential customers and uses. However, these are merely examples of use cases. As Ties.Network platform becomes more popular, its platform and smart contracts can be utilized in a variety of additional scenarios.  2. Health Care  The platform provides an environment for electronic medical records to be securely archived and accessed based on signature approvals between patients and health providers. Selected researchers can locate PHI (Personal Health Information) from record owners who participate in making their information available. Medical record owners can also grant access to chosen health care providers.  3. Other Industries  In P2P transactions, the smart contracts are designed to allow negotiations to occur between individuals and organizations. In the event of a dispute, expert mediators have been trained to remedy the situation. The immutable feature of blockchain technology also allows transfers and custody of products to be recorded permanently for originality.  4. Technology and Media Use  The immutable nature of blockchain technology and the use of smart contracts eliminates music and media piracy and guarantees the payment of royalties. It also provides security to valuable works of art in museums, galleries, and private collections with its clear title ownership.  5. Charities and Nonprofit Organizations  The platform allows charities and nonprofit organizations to initiate and record pledges and donations without involving paid employees that would add to operational costs. Moreover, they can provide follow-up information with automated updates.  Overall, Ties.Network provides revolutionary solutions to data storage and management, which will change how business is done. In the past, most transactions, trials, and research were performed in private networks, which limited the scope of applications. With a public NoSQL database, Ties.Network provides independent services to the public with security, convenience, cost efficiency, and transparency.",True

It empowers organizations and individuals to strike deals through the use of smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-validating and self-executing agreements that function independently. They are constantly checked by the blockchain to ensure terms of the contract are met.  In the context of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, smart contracts are computer programs which are stored on a distributed platform and are run by a network of computers that result in updates to ledgers such as cryptocurrency payments. In essence each smart contract is a program that performs an action based on other actions and are verified by computers in the network. They reduce the need for intermediaries. Smart contracts, executed through the blockchain can verify and maintain escrow accounts and reduce the role of the legal system in contract administration. Additionally, smart contracts facilitate, indeed play a crucial role, in allowing firms to outsource activities that can be performed more effectively or economically outside of the traditional business structure.  _______________________________________________________________  How Ties.Network uses smart contracts to help individuals and companies in outsourcing. _______________________________________________________________  As global business expands, smart contracts can operate without intermediaries or third party validation. This is particularly useful as terms and conditions can be made very specific. In general, any contractual situation that can be restated as computer logic (utilizing if-then logic) can be the subject of a smart contract. In the context of Ties. Network, smart contracts can be used for HR and project management including:   * Starting projects. Individuals in different locations and countries can collaborate on ideas to develop projects.  * Companies can post job listings to aid in recruiting employees.  * Businesses and individuals can take advantage of crowdfunding to fund projects from a variety of sources, reducing the need for traditional financial institutions.  * Employees, experts and freelancers can be recruited from a vast pool of international talent.  * Potential employees can post their CV’s, examples of work and reviews from previous employers.  * Freelancers can take advantage of Ties.Network to maintain anonymity but preserve ratings.  * The networking platform of Ties.Network allows individuals to establish contacts as either employees or employers.  * Crowdsourcing allows ratings of businesses, individuals and projects.   The smart contract capability of Ties.Network allows individuals to exchange goods and services within clearly defined terms. This aids IT experts, programmers, photographers, musicians, and other employees needed to help implement projects or further business goals.This also provides anonymity when needed, for example people who are exploring new opportunities and positions. Smart contracts within Ties.Network can consolidate international transfers of goods and services through approved credit and trade payment agreements. Contracts remove duplicate processes executed by the parties to verify each step. This monitors completeness and reduces errors. Ties.Network will offer the services of expert mediators to handle disputes between parties. Smart contracts are set to revolutionize the business world.

Think people _______________________________________________________________  Every day I read about another ICO.  Every day I get messages from people who are looking for a team to help them conduct an ICO.  Every month I meet people at blockchain events who are enthusiastic about investing in an ICO or finding partners to build ambitious blockchain projects together.  | No matter how ambitious and complicated the technology is, behind the technology there are always people. It’s people who develop the technology and do the ICO’s. These people want to connect.  Today they read about each other in telegram channels or search through LinkedIn to find those who are specifically interested in crypto, blockchain, and decentralized technologies.  People are looking for experts in ICO regulations. People are desperate for highly-skilled developers, especially from Russia and the Ukraine. People are looking for investors. Investors are looking for individuals who can tell what is a scam and what is real.  All these people believe in crypto, they want to deal with cryptocurrencies and are ready to accept cryptocurrencies for their work. They hate banking and political limitations which prevent them from paying people from other countries for their honest work. Because the process takes too long and banking fees are onerous.  We at Ties.Network are trying to give these people space, and we challenge you to step up and help us become the number one platform to help the global crypto-community connect and work together free from limitations.  _______________________________________________________________  What do I mean by limitations? _______________________________________________________________   We have been using Slack for our own projects. Since we hire people globally we were excited about the new feature that allows us to directly pay team via PayPal in Slack. However, there are serious limitations: both parties must pay commission fees, only limited amounts can be sent, and team members are not happy with these limitations and fees.  Why not pay people directly, instantly and the precise amount agreed upon? There is a way to make it better than “PayPal for Slack”, because transactions can be faster, more secure, commission free, and we could eliminate disputes. Blockchain technology allows this, and we want to make sure everyone benefits from this on Ties.Network.  It’s a very simple, yet a revolutionary idea — to pay people instantly in crypto — in a world which complicates the process of financial interactions.  Remember the Rube Goldberg Machine? It was an insanely complicated machine designed to execute something incredibly simple — like crack an egg or shut the door.  Don Tapscott says in his TED talk about blockchain that this machine reminds him of how financial services work in our society today. You just want to send people money, and it takes days… And you’re limited in the number of currencies you can send, or countries you can choose, and there are so many intermediaries that you end up paying a big chunk of money for the work that can be done in seconds if we use blockchain.  |Our idea is to introduce a new way of financial interactions for professionals in the crypto-community.   This is what it can look like:  1. Users find individuals to work with on Ties. Network (which is similar to LinkedIn, except these individuals understand and accept cryptocurrency).  2. Individuals agree upon terms of collaboration. Smart contracts are used to ensure trust between members and avoid disputes. Ties.Network will provide smart contract templates for any type of transaction or agreement to facilitate ease of use.  3. Every transaction is secured by smart-contracts. They self-execute after the work is done, simply and securely: you work, you get paid, directly, instantly. Smart contracts can be used to define how much each person in your team gets paid for work completed.  You can find business partners and build teams among people who are also inspired by blockchain technologies and hopefully are more experienced than yourself. Most importantly, they can prove it; every deal is registered on Ties.Network, and people can only rate you if you successfully did business together, not if they were impressed by your profile description.  You can pay your team and your partners immediately — in any cryptocurrency. You can instantly trade your services or goods for cryptocurrencies.  You can employ your legal advice or your investment expertise and get paid for that.  You can become a moderator on the platform and earn money making sure there are no illegal or suspicious transactions.  The platform will have a role and a place for everyone. We develop technologies, but we believe in people. It’s people who make the technologies happen, and it’s people who drive projects and businesses.  There is a whole new community, and it’s building a new decentralized economy based on trust and belief in people. We want to help this community connect and change the rules of professional networking.  You can also contribute. You can help spread the word and share this message. You can invest and help us make this real.  Author: Natalia Tokar (Business Development Partner at Ties.Network)",True

The platform uses a trustworthy “genuine” rating system, thus making sure all participants can focus solely on the business and benefits of the relationships, while leaving the verification and trust issues to the platform’s integrated solutions.  Ties.Network provides a secure forum for business and social networking, both inside and outside of the crypto-community. The network uses self-organization and motivation in their economy, which includes selected platform revenue sources, several moderator roles, and a referral system. The combination of three elements provides the stability required in this massive-scale anonymous platform.  _______________________________________________________________  1. Selected Revenue Sources _______________________________________________________________  Ties.Network platform makes profits from these sources: advertising, escrow tax, and currency exchange. In addition, underlying Ties.DB nodes generate income from placing and retrieving content. This means users must pay for storing their data on the database servers. When a user signs up for an account on Ties.Network, they must place a deposit fund on a smart contract “chequebook,” which is his paid registration. Whenever they use the database, there is a small fee involved.  Compared with other free networks, Ties.Network charges fees, because it is used for business and other money-making purposes. With the profits generated from the fees imposed on users, Ties.Network can continue to develop and maintain the platform for the future. Psychologically speaking, users who pay tend to be more appreciative to the community, which is key to maintain a trustworthy, safe, and secure environment.  The platform compensates all the user costs in the end of a period from its revenue provided that the user has fairly used the platform. Eventually, the platform is free to use.  _______________________________________________________________  2. Authoritative Content Moderators _______________________________________________________________   Content moderators are those with authority to delete content and ban users, in the event of illegal and unethical activities. In general, there are several levels of moderators: super moderators, moderators, technical developers, and ordinary users.  These moderators are assigned social and technical roles. Thus, each level has social and technical moderators.  Super moderators:  These are paid experts who investigate collusion between nodes and users, manage the budget, delete contents, and reject or fire users in the event of illegal and unethical activities.  Moderators:  They are paid experts who have been trained to handle disputes and resolve conflicts among users in transactions.  Technical developers:  These are technical experts who develop software and maintain the technical aspects of Ties.Network.  Ordinary users:  The platform covers the users’ expenses of fair use. These various levels of users/moderators provide a hierarchy in the network, which is important to create a sense of belongingness and security among users. Users will appreciate that they are being monitored and there are people with authority who will ensure transactions are legal and ethical.  _______________________________________________________________  3. Referral System _______________________________________________________________  This referral system is designed with the intention to motivate non-users to join the network as users. This system will be using affiliate scheme where registered users who have become members can invite other people through a designated link or channel with a specific invitation code.  When the invited individual joins the network, the member will receive a referral fee, which is automated. Without any initial investment, the new user can use the network immediately. The affiliate scheme is funded by the profit of the network. The budget is managed and monitored by the budget defense super moderators. The budget and the fees use TIE tokens instead of fiat money.",True

Ties.DB is a public, open-source solution that can be utilized by other dApps and decentralized blockchain-related projects to facilitate their entering the market and help them structure large amounts of data.       Ties.Network is a decentralized platform for traders, investors, developers, consultants and enthusiasts that allows professionals to find partners, employees and volunteers, sell their products or services, secure business deals via smart contracts, promote themselves and finance their projects. People can work individually or as teams to accomplish their objectives.    System of genuine rating and reviews (“crowdsourcing”) gives each participant maximum promotion opportunities, while also giving them the option to stay anonymity. All transactions on Ties.Network are 100% safe and secure.   At registration, each user receives a default rating based on objective observations of user activity in the crypto-community and based on provided documents. The community will modify this rating, based on the review of the deals that have already been processed on the platform, through impartial and decentralized voting.  _______________________________________________________________   Key features of the platform _______________________________________________________________  Ties.Network integration of smart contracts into a business platform lets its users do the following:  * Trade goods and services * Trade cryptocurrencies * Hire and recruit specialists * Participate in token generation events and blockchain projects * Receive feedback for startups or token generation events * Promote token generation events and network with startups  _______________________________________________________________   Ties.Network architecture _______________________________________________________________   Ties.Network, as a platform suitable for striking business deals, conforms to the following requirements:  * Decentralization * Stability * Anonymity * Storage of data * Scalability * Open-source soltuion * Publicity * Profitability * Speed * Expansion possibilities  _______________________________________________________________   Architecture layers _______________________________________________________________   At high-level we can distinguish the following layers of the platform.  * TiClient - client application * Ties.DB - public decentralized database * Smart contracts * Blockchain * Hyperboria Network  Users interact with Ties.Network from the client application TiClient. TiClient connects to Ties.DB and blockchain. Ties.DB is used to store and retrieve users’ data. TiClient and Ties.DB use smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain for financial transactions and to ensure stability of critical operations. All the nodes are connected through Hyperboria network to provide speed, anonymity and end-to-end encryption of all communications.   _______________________________________________________________   Ties.DB _______________________________________________________________   Ties.DB is a new-generation decentralized database with the following innovative interfaces:  * Distribution * Publicity * Resistance to the Byzantine Generals’ Problem * Sharding support * Speed * Ability to store structured data * Ability to delete data * Query language with an ability to conduct search using more than the primary key  _______________________________________________________________   Cjdns and Hyperboria network _______________________________________________________________       To realize the anonymity and privacy requirements, we use Hyperboria network. Cjdns (Caleb James Delisle Network Suite) is a networking protocol and reference implementation, based on the idea that networks should be easy to set up, protocols should scale smoothly, and security should be ubiquitous.   _______________________________________________________________   Node and client interaction scheme _______________________________________________________________          _______________________________________________________________   Platform revenue sources _______________________________________________________________   Profits come from the following sources:  * Advertising * Escrow tax * Currency exchange  Income for nodes comes from the following:  * Placing content on the node server * Retrieving content from the node server   Users must pay for storing their data on the database servers. That allows the network to sustain itself by making its support profitable. It also prevents flooding the network with garbage or malicious data. But such a model of networking is not very popular at the moment.   For example, Jim (hypothetical person) signs up on Ties.Network. Before he can do anything, he needs to place a deposit on a smart contract ""chequebook"". That is his paid registration. For ordinary social networks, where users just have fun, such a step would have meant the end of our network - why pay for something you can get free somewhere else? Since Ties.Network is different in that it earns you money, we feel justified in asking for an initial payment and commissions down the line to help us continue offering you this service.  Unlike centralized competitors who get their revenues from advertising or from using freemium models, Ties.Network belongs to the community, so its revenues must be spent on developing and maintaining it. One of the ways of how revenues will be used is for paying moderators and for platform maintenance.   Thus, the profit of the project will be distributed to pay for key individuals who support the project. These are:  * Content moderator (who has the authority to delete content and ban users). * Super-moderator (who investigates collusion between nodes and participants, manages the budget, and rejects, or fires, participants). * Moderators (who arbitrate disputes). * Technical positions that include Developers (who develop software for Ties.Network). * Ordinary users (covering fair user expenses)  The platform will cover the users’ expenses of their fair use of the platform making it eventually free to use. Fairness of the platform use will be observed by budget Super-moderators. Since the platform belongs to the community,  its revenues must be spent on developing and maintaining it.         _______________________________________________________________   Bitcointalk Newsblock _______________________________________________________________  AUGUST. 04/08 Ties.Network as a Solution for Blockchain Projects 07/08 Hyperboria Network as an Architecture Layer of Ties.Network 08/08 Interview with Natalia Tokar Business Development Partner at Ties.Network 09/08 Ties.Network presentation at CryptoFinancing conference in London on 7th July 2017 11/08 Ties.Network: Smart Contracts and Outsourcing 15/08 Think beyond technology, blockchain, or crypto.

The sale kicks off on September 21st at 12:00 PM UTC.   During its TGE Ties.Network will offer their TIE tokens for sale at the price of $0.24 in ETH equivalent, the price will be adjusted automatically once in three hours dependent on the Ethereum rate (Coinmarketcap) due to its high volatility. There may be some delays in the adjustment process in case the Ethereum network is overloaded. The amount of TIE tokens to issue for the BTC deposits will be calculated according to the current exchange rate of this cryptocurrency in Ethereum.  Tokens will be distributed according to the progressive bonus scale, which is beneficial for investors, as outlined below:      Ties.Network is the ONLY OFFICIAL website address of the project  Under no circumstances will Ties.Network ever use any other website or a mirror during the TGE. So in the unlikely situation of a temporary unavailability of the website, DO NOT GOOGLE FOR A MIRROR, or you will end up at a phishing address. Wait for connection to Ties.Network to be reestablished and use that website only. Check the spelling of the website’s address carefully and be aware of fraudsters taking actions to set up look-alike sites.  No community manager or social media official group administrator will post any other link.    Telegram is the only chat used during TGE  Ties.Network telegram chat https://t.me/tiesnetwork and TGE channel https://t.me/tiesnetwork_channel are the two ONLY communication channels during TGE.  There will be no TGE news posted on BitcoinTalk, Slack, WeChat, etc., due to their vulnerability.   _______________________________________________________________  Using ETH and BTC to donate _______________________________________________________________   Ties.Network uses ETH and BTC addresses for donations. For addresses, kindly follow the instructions at https://dashboard.ties.network. To make a donation, you need to enter the address of your existing ETH wallet (make sure you use an address you have the private key to).  We’ll never post any cryptocurrency address on Telegram, Slack, Twitter, Facebook or any other media channel. No community manager or Ties team member will send you a direct message with a cryptocurrency address or an invitation to invest in whatever manner.   _______________________________________________________________  Sending funds to purchase TIE tokens _______________________________________________________________   To purchase TIE tokens you should:  Register at https://dashboard.ties.network. On the Contribute page enter the Ethereum address on which we’ll send your TIE tokens. ATTENTION! Use only one wallet address to send ETH and to recieve TIE on it. You should have the private key to this address to be able to access your tokens. Do not use the address of cryptoexchanges wallets here! Once you have put your Ethereum address you will not be able to change it. Turn on Autoupdate to track your transactions. You have two options for buying tokens — for ETH and for BTC.   Buying TIE for ETH  Choose Ethereum tab — you will see TIE Token Sale smart contract address. Send some ETH from the address you entered at STEP 1 to the Token Sale smart contract address. ATTENTION! Use exactly the same address that you specified at STEP 1 to send ETH to the smart contract. Otherwise, you’ll get your TIE tokens to the address that you’ve sent your ETH from. Your transaction will be listed in the list of your transactions. You can check it on Etherscan. Your TIE tokens will be issued to your specified address immediately including your bonus.   Buying TIE for BTC  Choose Bitcoin tab. You will see Generate button. Click Generate button. You will get a bitcoin address. Send some BTC to this bitcoin address within 20 minutes. ATTENTION! If you fail to send BTC within 20 minutes to this address you will need to regenerate it. Do not worry, your transaction should not be confirmed within these 20 minutes — you just have to sign and publish it. Once you have signed and published your transaction you can track it in Your transactions list and check it at blockchain.info. As soon as there is 3 confirmations for your transaction you will get TIE tokens to the address you specified at STEP 1 including bonus at this moment.  You can repeat buying TIE for ETH and BTC any number of times in any combinations.  Please note that you need at least 3 (three) confirmations for BTC and 1 (one) confirmation for ETH. Kindly check it yourself using the transaction link before checking your balance.   _______________________________________________________________  Security above all _______________________________________________________________   Never send your login, password or destination address via any chat, direct message or personal email.

It is resistant to data compromise, and supports replication and sharding. With its ability to modify and delete data, ability to perform full text search, and support for secondary indices, it brings to the general public the features previously only available on a private noSQL database. Interest in applications of blockchain technology in the data processing world has grown tremendously in the past several years, resulting in various pilot projects for the application of this technology.  Ties.Network in particular can be employed wherever smart contracts might be applicable. Indeed, many major corporations are now investigating the use of smart contracts with blockchain technology. However feature-rich applications have a lot of other content besides smart contracts that should be stored somewhere. Ties.Network has the potential, being the only public network resting on a public NoSQL database, to bring these applications to a much wider audience. These are some of the areas currently being investigated for use with smart contract technology and fast and scalable data storage.  _______________________________________________________________  Financial Services _______________________________________________________________    * Trade clearing and settlement. Manages all workflows between parties, calculates all settlement amounts and transfers all funds automatically.   * Bond coupon payments. Automatically calculates pays all bond interest payments as well as return principal upon bond maturity.   * Insurance claim processing. Performs all basic clerical workflows as well as calculating payouts based on claim type and underlying policy.  _______________________________________________________________  Health Care _______________________________________________________________    * Electronic health records. Provides all necessary access to medical health records based on signature approvals between patients and providers.   * Population health data access. Grants researchers appropriate access to PHI (Personal Health Information) with micro payments made to patients who participate by making their information available to vetted researchers.   * Personal health tracking. Grants patients their permanent health records. Patients now have the ability to share their records with healthcare professionals and hospitals of their choice.  _______________________________________________________________  Use in Other Industries _______________________________________________________________    * P2P transactions. Ties.Network smart contract capability allows negotiation of contracts between individuals and organizations. The contract is executed according to terms set between the parties, and disputes are handled by trained professionals.   * Product and inventory history. Provides for documenting party and custody based on position in the production process. Users can keep track of inventory and products throughout the supply and production chain.  _______________________________________________________________  Technology and Media Use _______________________________________________________________    * Fraudulent downloads of music and media are eliminated and payment of royalties is guaranteed to the owner.   * Keeping track of works of art in museums and private collections to ensure safety and clarify title to the work.  _______________________________________________________________  Government _______________________________________________________________    * Negotiation of contracts, recording of real estate transactions and maintenance of tax records.  _______________________________________________________________  Charity and Nonprofit Organizations _______________________________________________________________    * Ties.Network allows users to initiate and record pledges and contributions without costly follow up by volunteers or paid employees.   * Organizations can maintain contact with their contributors updating them on the issues important to them.  The blockchain provides the single ledger as the source of authentic information. Smart contracts facilitate the ability to automate workflows and calculations that are traditionally prone to lag and error. This will reduce errors, contention, and time to settlement.  Most of the trials and research being performed are being done on private networks which severely reduces the scope of these applications. Ties.Network with a public, secure, and robust database can provide these functions to the general public much in the same way the Internet brought many of the functions of private networks to the public.",True

Reviewing our architectural layers, we have the client. The client utilizes smart contracts using blockchain technology. These three layers, client, smart contracts, and blockchain overlay Ties.DB. However, we need an interface between these layers and the public/private networks that Ties.Network can operate within. This is provided by the Hyperboria network which is a meshnet which utilizes the cjdns (Caleb James DeLisle Network Suite). This network provides a peer to peer network which is encrypted and utilizes IPv6 addresses. Cjdns can communicate using both ethernet and wireless connections, as well as tunneling over the internet. Instead of a central authority or server controlling the routing of messages, each node on the network determines how to route any messages it receives. This lack of any centralized routing mechanism enhances the privacy features of this protocol.  _______________________________________________________________  Advantages of the Hyperboria mesh network: _______________________________________________________________    * The network does not care how a host connects to its peers. The connection can be ethernet, wireless or over the internet.   * The network is encrypted end to end preventing eavesdropping by rogue nodes.   * Each node receives a unique IPv6 address eliminating the need for additional encryption configuration and provides a virtually infinite number of IP addresses.   * These addresses are not related to their location which makes it impossible to know the physical location of any node.   * The network has high processing power.  _______________________________________________________________  Disadvantages of the Hyperboria mesh network: _______________________________________________________________    * Communicating nodes know each other’s IP, but not those of other nodes which they are not directly connected. This drawback is circumvented because nodes connected to the network communicate only with trusted nodes. Additionally, Hyperboria’s own intermediate node is created, linking it by the tunnel to the system.   * Traffic is conducted by the shortest path, so all intermediate nodes know which ones communicate, but do not know what and where they are. This drawback can be reduced by altering IPv6 identifiers and the key pair of one’s own node.These drawbacks aside, Hyperboria is compatible for linking Ties.Network nodes into a network because real IP addresses are only revealed to trusted nodes or to a trusted third party Hyperboria node.  Users desiring anonymity, can utilize additional connectivity to the nodes where some are published as TOR Hidden Services and access to them is only achieved by TOR (The Onion Router). A further degree of anonymity can be achieved by coupling TOR with VPN.",True
