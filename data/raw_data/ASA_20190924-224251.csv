I am a gamer and a blockchain believer and because of this i got scammed in the world of battles ico (https://coinidol.com/scan-for-scam-keep-money-safe-investing-in-ico/) fortunately for a very low amount, after that i've studied very hard to improve my knowledge about ICO investment and i can assure that there are too many tasks not clear in this project. I'm listing some of this to help the community to not lose money:  - CEO and COO have a linkedin profile that seems opened yesterday and they are ""confirming skill"" each other.  - Company's linkedin profile have just 3 member https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetCurrentCompany=%5B%2213691848%22%5D CEO, COO and a unknown ""linkedin member""  - NO Linkedin for other team memeber and advisory board, the photos in these boards on their website seems taken from the same ""source"" (there a so many sites that sell o are a free source of close-up photos), we cannot verify if the team already exist or not.  - No bounty manager, no social media manager infact all social interations seems only powerd by the bounty program user and not managed.  - Telegram channel have 8k user and all of them are bounty hunter, same of twitter. You can see the comments and interaction are just like bot, people in these social group just ask for bounty program info but not seems interested in the project development. The timeframe of messages are to long for a 8k ACTIVE telegram group. You can see that the user and follower are not genuine because they opened first the bounty program for growing social account (25/02/18) and after that they announced the ICO (24/04/2018)  - The claim to be powered by twitch and other big companies, but that's not true at all.  - No lawyer in the team board, how can you think to open a company and be compliance with regulation?  - No multilanguage whitepaper  - No MVP (minimum valuable product), how can you show us if you are developing or not? Are you asking for 12M with no company organization, no product, no preparation at all? Just like ""give us some money and then will start""?  - No github for the token. ICO is starting in less than 1 month e no token is created, give us some proof.  - From whitepaper ""(e) You agree and acknowledge that ASA tokens do not constitute securities in any form in any jurisdiction;"" They claim that their company is opened in New Zealand, and why it seems that they don't know that in New Zealand ALL ICO token are considered securities. From which else whitepaper do you copied terms of agreement and disclaimer? lol  - Is claimed that from the 1st 2018 quarter will be available the betting platform, but without a complete platform how regulators can verify it and give you gambling license? However they will not give you any gambling license because in NZ your business proposal is prohibited!!! and all investor can verify directly from this NZ government link: https://www.dia.govt.nz/Services-Casino-and-Non-Casino-Gaming-Prohibited-Gambling?OpenDocument#one  So here's why people you should avoid this and put your money in other projects. Just think twice before invest in it!  P.S. I'am a member for more than two year but i've created an other account because the last time i've unmasked a scam ICO i was flooded in pm mailbox from the scammer.",False

I hope I can answer some of your questions here.  1. Let me start off by clearing this issue, we can assure you our Linkedin accounts are not newly established, however it's very true that it's only been recent that we've put more emphasis on Linkedin simply because it's not a popular if not extremely hardly used social platform in NZ.  2. Refer to above, same reason, the only reason we even bothered to create a Linkedin company profile was because our Marketing Team suggested it. Obvious as it is, it's empty, it's not hard to add details in, add people in, but it's our focus.  3. There's no Linkedin links on our Team on our landing page because our web team has not had the time to update it, or rather, their priorities are elsewhere, but on a few ICO listing sites we have linkedin our team members. At least for our NZ based team members. Linkedin is not accessible in China, so for our Chinese based team members, unless you would like for us to create profiles on their behalf, they simply don't have it and have never needed it. A few of our Advisors are also easily searchable via Google, I believe that would be more credible than Linkedin right?  *Another thing I'd like to add about Linkedin is how easy it is to create fake profiles, even ones that ""seem"" aged, extremely well connected and what not. I don't think Linkedin is a trustworthy source right? We have the names of the team members and their prominent work places of the past listed, so a simple email or phone to those companies can confirm anyone's doubt as long as they are willing to go that extra mile. **For credibility, we've actually posted photos of team members being together on some of our social media platforms, you may have missed them.  4. Our Bounty is managed by g0blin. They're quite a famous team.  5. We do have bounty members in our Telegram, but it's an extreme overstatement to say they're all bounter hunters, we have between 1k-1.5k bounty members in our 8k+ Telegram. And no one talks about bounty in there, so I don't know where you got your information from.  6. I don't think you understand what ""powered by"" means? We utilize Twitch's streaming capabilities to power our entire Tournament streaming. And we will be utilizing Alibaba Cloud for many data storage.  7. My personal Legal Advisor is Linda from DLA Piper, a personal friend of mine, and she has been giving me advise on the side. However it's out of our respect that we didn't list her. Did not know that would be a problem for you.  8. Multi-language coming soon. We haven't even started ICO yet.  9. Like I said above, ICO has not even started, our demos will be online for all to experience before it starts.  10. Our smart contract is on our github, again, I don't know where you get your information from.  11. Anyone that has conversed with us in Telegram knows we operate out of NZ, keyword: operate, we're also registered in Curacao for the eGaming License and in the midst of application for Malta. And we're also registered in China as a company too. The companies registered in China and NZ are responsible for tax and employee salaries.  12. Anyone that closely followed our progress in the early stage would know that we DID have a ver.1 Demo online that featured our betting platform, however it was pulled down by my request because I wanted a UI re-design, and wanted it to be re-released together with the greater part of the platform. It's coming very soon, and like I said, our ICO hasn't even started yet.  *To further shed some light, an extract directly out of the link you provided: it is not illegal for someone in New Zealand to participate in gambling over the Internet if that website is based overseas.   All in all, I'm not sure if you're just trying to spread FUD. But if you were really concerned and were interested in our project, you could've directly asked us many of these questions in our Telegram and we would've happily resolved them for you. However it doesn't seem like it that way.  Anyone with questions are more than welcome to join our Telegram and ask: https://t.me/asuracoin   Kind Regards, Peter S.  CEO of Asura World LLC",False
