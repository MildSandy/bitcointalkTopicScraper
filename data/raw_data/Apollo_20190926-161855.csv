The ADF Group works directly with 54 African Nations at the presidential and ministerial level to provide funding and sustainable development on a range of commercial and non-profit ventures. In addition, the ADF Group offers a comprehensive suite of financial consulting services to governments, specializing in wealth management, infrastructure projects, and more.  The ADF Group originated as an investment company focused on Africa, but has since expanded its reach on a global scale as an international fund management and private equity company with interests across Asia, Europe, and Africa.  In an official letter dated May 30, 2019, ADF Group CEO, Mr. Anthony Mokhele states the following:  ""We as the ADF, with our mandate of facilitating funding and solutions for the upliftment of Africa continuously investigate emerging technologies that will enable our vision to create wealth within Africa.  ""It is for this reason that we have identified Apollo Currency Africa as the only and obvious choice with regard to cryptocurrency and its application in an African perspective, to form a partnership and integrate into our involvement in the African continent.  ""Because of Apollo's independent blockchain and endless features we are endorsing its use and adoption to any of the fifty-four (54) African countries we have relationships with.""  Apollo has made tremendous strides over the past 12 months by developing innovative solutions to longstanding challenges, namely the issues of speed, long term sustainability, privacy, and high transaction fees that plague some of the more established blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Apollo, on the other hand, has managed to develop Sharding, a breakthrough technology that allows for hyper-efficiency, and subsecond transaction speeds. While other cryptocurrencies tend to “bog down” as more users join the network and begin sending transactions, Apollo does effectively the opposite, increasing its efficiency as more users join the network.  According to Steve McCullah, director of business development for Apollo, ""Sharding and adaptive forging make Apollo the most sustainable blockchain on Earth. Our goal is to realize sub-one-second transaction speeds and TPS capabilities in the multi-millions before the end of 2020."" Mr. McCullah goes on to say, ""It's crucial for developers to stay ahead of the curve, and to consider upcoming trends in their organization's strategic planning. The Web 3.0 economy is evolving fast and it's important to match developer competence with vision and prudence. Blockchain use-cases are leading to tectonic shifts in how people and merchants do business, and we want to prevent future issues that are avoidable. This approach makes the technology scalable and sustainable.""  The implications of this technology are massive when considered against the backdrop of many of the challenges facing the continent of Africa today, where over 70% of the world's mobile money transactions occur, according to GSMA 2018 statistics. This presents a challenge if even a small percentage of these transactions were to move to a less advanced blockchain infrastructure. If a nation were to attempt this without Apollo's next-generation technology, the network efficiency would suffer as the number of transactions increased. Not so with Apollo. Thanks to Apollo Sharding, Adaptive Block Generation and Fast Apollo technologies, the Apollo blockchain is capable of 1-2 second settlement speeds, making it one of the fastest cryptos on Earth. Utilizing the Apollo platform means that increased network volume does not have to come at the cost of efficiency, enabling a predominantly digital economy to transition with greater ease and effectively breaking down yet another barrier to mass adoption.  Mr. Mokhele had this to say regarding the application of the Apollo platform in Africa: ""I believe that Apollo currency is the best way to create wealth for the African people and the best solution to Africa's biggest problems."" Apollo (APL) all-in-one privacy currency combines features of mainstream cryptocurrencies in a truly private and unregulatable platform. With two-second block speed, APL is one of the fastest cryptos on Earth. The privacy platform lets ""Apollonauts"" transact and send data anonymously via Encrypted Messaging, Private Ledger, Decentralized Exchange, IP Masking 2.0 and Coin Mixing.

This release was featured across the industry.  Yahoo Finance PRNewswire WRCBtv MarketsInsider   What is The ADF Group? (African Development Funding Group) The ADF is an international investment company with a rapidly growing asset base.  ADF has developed a number of wholly-owned operating companies to undertake specific execution activities in select geographies.     These have been structured into the classical Primary, Secondary and Tertiary economic sectors.  Primary: Investments in the retrieval and production of raw materials through the following vehicles;  ADF Mining Ltd ADF Agriculture Ltd ADF Manufacturing Ltd Secondary: Investments in products and service transformation processes through the following vehicles;  ADF Construction Ltd ADF Estates Ltd ADF Plant Lease & Hire Ltd Tertiary: Investments in services to consumers and businesses.  ADF Technology Ltd ADF Health Ltd ADF Security Ltd ADF Retail Ltd ADF Group was originally founded as an investment company focused on Africa. As part of its expansion strategy in 2013, the head office was established in Hong Kong and its scope of operations transformed to include other developing regions of the world, and also specific advanced markets in order to fully exploit international investment strategies. ADF Group has since grown and evolved into an international fund management and private equity company with interests now spanning Asia, Europe and Africa. - Information Provided by https://www.adfgroupltd.com     Apollo Features Private Transactions Public Transactions IP Masking Monetary System Coin Shuffling Alias System Asset System Multi-Signature Accounts Encrypted Messaging Decentralized Exchange Decentralized Marketplace Phased Transactions Voting System Allows 3rd Party Plugins Authentication System Balance Leasing Smart Contracts File Transfer Data Cloud Transaction Fee Dividends Safe From 51% Attack Sharding Sustanability Adaptive Forging Decentralized Applications (Dapps) Transaction Speed - The Worlds Fastest Blockchain   Our Take Africa has been leading the way for mobile money customers since 2018, accounting for over 45% of all registered users. This trend will continue with the adoption of a cryptocurrency in their region. The biggest opportunity for mass adoption within the blockchain industry is to give the unbanked an opportunity to create and store wealth. To my understanding most of these locations have little to no banking services available in their region but they are heavy on mobile payment adoption. People in this region haven't been taught to use a banking system so there is no need to allow time for a financial transition in these locations. A better way to explain this is, these people are learning about finance from scratch. Therefore, most of the people in this region will only ever identify ""Finance"" or ""Money"" with a ""Cryptocurrency"" such as Apollo.  Apollo could potentially become the only currency some in this region ever identify with. There are 1.2Billion people in the Continent of Africa. This is extremely good news, not only for the Apollo project but for the entire cryptocurrency & blockchain industry. This partnership alone has the potential to expose 1.2Billion people to cryptocurrencies. To put this into perspective, there were only 34,660,975 blockchain wallet users in total at the end of the first quarter of 2019. That's a whopping 34 times the amount of total blockchain wallet users in the world right now. Take a second and think about that...   Moving forward, I can think of a thousand different ways Apollo Currency can be implemented into the different industries the ADF GROUP is involved with. Let's make a list..  Manufacturing - Product ID's & Worker Identification can be stored on the blockchain with multi-level verification available for each product produced. Health - Medical records for this entire region can be stored on the blockchain data cloud, encrypted & masked using Apollo's privacy features. Security - High level security could be verified using a blockchain signature to enter or leave a facility, they could also use blockchain privacy for file transfers. Retail - Entrepreneurs in the region could use the Decentralized Marketplace to sell goods and services. As you can see, there are many different opportunities this partnership provides for both parties. Only time will tell how they will implement the Apollo Blockchain.",False

Too little (or none at all) will lead to a barter system, and decrease in productivity: Manufacturers won’t produce goods because they won’t get paid in a desirable commodity and/or valuable currency. The Spanish Price Revolution 300–450 years ago showed that even too much money harms the economy: The Conquistadors mined gold and silver in the New World, and shipped it back home. The result? High inflation in Western Europe for 150 years. When everyone’s got money, merchants charge higher prices for a limited supply of goods. The Promise and Peril of Africa Africa is a case study of bad currency (e.g. Zimbabwe), monetary mismanagement, and colonial theft (e.g. Malawi gold). These are mostly the result of centralized actions. But therein lies the promise of cryptocurrencies, as Africans can benefit financially from decentralized systems. Lagos, Nigeria (population 21 million) in early 2019 ranked as the top African city for online searches of Bitcoin (BTC). Other tech hubs are big cities in Kenya, South Africa, Ethiopia, and Ghana. Apollo all-in-one privacy currency (APL) gives adopters the advantage of a crypto that lets them stay anonymous — that’s powered by blockchain, and which operates on unregulatable platform. (It’s obvious why that’s helpful in the context of local bureaucracies.) African freelancers who provide outsourced services (e.g. writing, research, programming, web development, etc.) can get paid online via cryptocurrencies without coercion or hassle from a middleman. A few things need to happen. They’ve got to be educated about how the innovation works (such as wallets and passphrases). Be courageous in adopting tech that can make them prosper, especially retailers. Leverage the local mobile infrastructure to transact. Spread the word, and gain network effects. There was an age when Europe (before the Industrial Revolution) was a poor continent. Poverty, whether national or individual, doesn’t have to be permanent.
