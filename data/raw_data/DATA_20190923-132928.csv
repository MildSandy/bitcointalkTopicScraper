Currently, the valuable data you produce is at the mercy of large corporations. In the Streamr network, it’s yours to use and sell as you wish, and travels through a decentralised peer-to-peer network controlled by no one and incentivized by the DATAcoin token.  Let’s consider a self-driving electric car. For optimal operation, it needs data from other machines, such as traffic congestion information from other cars, electricity prices on nearby charging stations, weather forecasts, and so on. Streamr provides a single interface for real-time data delivery and payment, making data streams tradeable using the DATAcoin token  The car can autonomously get the data it needs and pay for it. In turn, the car can sell the data it produces, such as traffic data to other cars, road condition measurements to a smart city, location and battery level to advertisers, and so on.
