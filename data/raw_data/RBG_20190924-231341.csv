RankingBall is not a gambling site. It is a strategic skill game where users play against each other, not the house. Essentially it's a Peer-to-Peer game.  Those who play on RankingBall are all subject to the same rules and scoring system, which is posted on our site, which creates a level playing field. We base our scoring system off of real sport or esport game stats, which can not be manipulated. Also, those who work at or are affiliated with RankingBall are never allowed to play on the site, gameplay is only open to the fans.  Our token makes it so that every transaction and contest is transparent and recorded on the blockchain. So it's all out there for everyone to see where the tokens are going.  One of the goals of RankingBall is to bring the power back to the sports and esports community. We want a have fun and safe environment for all of those who play.",False

RankingBall has developed its own skill-based game using real-time data from live sports and esports events to merge Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) with Bingo. This gameplay allows fans to put their skills to the test while also leveling the playing field on the blockchain.  The RankingBall platform allows users to participate in DFS Bingo contests while watching real live matches, have fun by competing with other players, and to earn rewards based on their performance. RankingBall‚Äôs ecosystem is also rewarding by allowing users to earn RankingBall Gold (blockchain token) by playing their favorite online video games, or even use RBG to support their favorite streamers, pros, and developers. With these features, RankingBall is ready to create a unique gaming platform and lead the world of sports and esports entertainment.          Real-time Data  Our first unbeatable advantage over competitors is data. Real-time sports and esports data comes in many different forms and from many different providers. We‚Äôve spent years working to ensure that we can reliably integrate real-time data feeds into RankingBall, making play-by-play skill-based sports betting possible for the first time.  Minimum Media Latency  We also spent significant time tuning our platform so that it is synced with the 20-40 second broadcast delay, which varies by broadcaster. We spent two grueling years attending sporting events to develop and test solutions to the latency issue.  Bingo Game Logic  Another unbeatable advantage we are implementing is the way players engage with the sports they are watching all within one app. By combining all of the best elements from existing fantasy sports websites and adding our unique bingo like card format we can add more excitement and competitiveness to the way sports are viewed.  Global Partnerships  In our home market, Korea, we already have partnerships and have run tests with three major sports networks. Globally, we are in talks with ESPN, CBS, NBC and FOX, who like how RankingBall encourages more engagement with live broadcasts. In the world of esports, we‚Äôre already working closely with Player Unknown‚Äôs Battleground, which will kick off this year. We‚Äôre also working to offer other popular titles like LOL, DOTA2 and CS:GO.             RankingBall‚Äôs blockchain platform will act as a bridge connecting gamers, sports and esports media, game developers and publishers, so they can create and share new value. We will issue our own blockchain-based currency, RankingBall Gold (RBG), which improves convenience for players and makes games more fun, while also increasing the efficiency and security for our platform.  RBG is a decentralized ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables us to develop a new and innovative cryptocurrency ecosystem within the platform, using smart contract technology.  Token Objective  RankingBall has developed an innovative gaming platform which will disrupt the traditional sports and e-sports gaming industries. This comes at an ideal time, coinciding with the emergence of blockchain technology and the crypto economy, which are acting as disruptors across a wide swath of industries. Until now, gaming companies have spent enormous time and money to comply with local rules, regulations and licensing requirements related to gaming, payments, KYC and AML before they can launch their businesses.  By issuing our Ethereum-based RankingBall Gold (RBG) token, we solve many of the issues related to regulations across multiple regions. This allows us to create a new player contest system with an entry fee and reward structure. In addition to the in-platform token economy, RankingBall offers a loyalty program in partnership with external platforms with token economy. We believe this will allow RankingBall to not only lead the sports/esports gaming frontier, but also create a whole new ecosystem that connects gamers, sports/esports media, and game developer/publisher.
