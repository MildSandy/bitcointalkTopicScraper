I'm going to do my best to answer them for you.  #1. We never publicly considered the minimum cost of completing the project (softcap)  We think it will 500k to make and distribute as needed. many other factors will calculate this and will follow up with a closer number share to twitter.  #2. the buy minimum is $1 usd or 10ript minimum sale. The bonus is offered to any investors starting at just .1eth, its very low amount and goes as high as 1eth with a 60% Bonus. BONUSES END MAY 17TH. The first thing to remember is how limited the amount of RIPT available to the public is! We only have 6 1/2million ript to offer you all.  The higher amount bonus was set up so the lower amount investors will have the chance. Its a challenge for us to get them to as many crypto investors as we can in the world.  We think it will make easy to get coins with this limited investors BONUS amount. The lower limits will take away from the availability for the average investor. More chance to give other average investments a chance at the coins before they all go to larger investors wallets for bonuses.  #3. In this time of data collection in the world wide web we decided to post our legal names and titles, as well as our telegram info for you to all contact us for any information needed. We welcome you all. Yes inturn we of course, all have personal social media accounts unconnected to the project. We just kindly ask the community to message the team on the provided platforms to inquire about our personal accounts all will be happy to share!",False

The project, spearheaded by the P2P Organization, was started out of necessity. Riptidecoin gives patients and collectives safe banking and transactions options. Customers and patients in high-risk areas or situations will benefit from this.    Riptide System will give business owners ""Seed to Sale"" tracking and accountability options. The software platform itself exists in the Beta phase. The RiptideCoin is a community currency token, made for use in the MMJ industry.

The platform will grow as we add new Licensed partners in legal jurisdictions. We have been publicly and privately working with exchanges. The Creator of this project stands behind his role as we work 18 hours a day with members and potential partners from around the world. The team is doing what is needed to succeed in this evolving marketplace. Simultaneously, we are very actively knocking on doors of larger sized exchanges with high traffic.
