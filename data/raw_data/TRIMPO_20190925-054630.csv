We will have a free rate plan which will allow our users access to the whole functionality of the platform, but with a limited number of product listings. Please find descriptions of plan rates below:  Rate plan Welcome is free of charge, you can list up to 10 products. Rate plan Lite (5$ per month) allows to list from 10 up to 500 products. Plan Medium (20$ per month) allows you to list on sales channels up to 5000 products. And with Premium (40$ per month) the number of products that can be listed is unlimited.  Listings are counted together, so if for example, you are selling on two marketplaces and have plan Medium, if you list 350 products on one marketplace, you can only list 150 on another. All of the platform’s features are available no matter which rate plan you use.  Please visit our Pricing page for more details and terms of payment.

As a rule, a merchant has to dedicate substantial amounts of time and money to market their new online stores and maintain its operation. It would be much more effective to divert these resources towards developing and expanding the business.  It is especially difficult for a small-batch manufacturer to gain a foothold on the international market as it requires investing considerable resources into the business on both the initial stage and further down the line to cover monthly upkeep expenses. One other difficulty lies in bureaucratic aspects and transactional expenses that businesses have to face when accepting international payments.  All of the aforementioned issues considered, not every small business today can afford all the expenses and risks tied to international trade and putting your products on new markets. To change this situation we have developed Trimpo. Thanks to our product every merchant will be able to easily and successfully start selling product on the biggest global marketplaces!

In 2017, retail e-commerce sales worldwide amounted to $2.3 trillion.  According to the e-commerce report by Global Ecommerce Report 2017, 50% of the global e-commerce revenue came from Asian countries. Asian e-commerce market shows the highest growth rates of +20%. Considerable growth is also demonstrated in Europe (+19%), South America (+16.5%), Africa and the Middle East (+11%). E-com market’s growth in North America, however, only shows +9% indicating its relative slowdown compared to other regions.  Interestingly enough, the e-commerce market today continues growing and developing despite the situation where there is no comprehensive solution for entrepreneurs to enter this market. In essence, this means that every market player develops this solution independently from each other, building it from singular elements. To help the e-commerce market grow further we are working on creating a solution that will be able to integrate all the suppliers into one ecosystem and provide it with maximum flexibility and loyalty features.  Our ultimate goal is to create an ecosystem that would unite clients, merchants and suppliers in one place and offer different interfaces for partner programs with various service suppliers, including in the logistics, marketing and financial sector. The Trimpo platform will become a one-stop-shop solution for entrepreneurs that allows them to sell their products on multiple e-commerce platforms at the same time, while using one interface thus saving time and money.

The platform also provides information on creation of accounts on the chosen marketplaces and what is required to start selling effectively.  2. Time Not all merchants have the luxury of spending time to organise sales on marketplaces, some of them prefer outsourcing this to an agency. In this scenario the agency puts the products up for sale on their behalf. The merchants fulfils the order for the customer, and the agency sends the money to the merchants minus the commission fee for its services.  3.

That's not the maximum yet!  Informational and marketing technologies keep steadily moving forward and online stores are projected to grow their reach to 2.14 billion people by 2021! Such explosive growth will make it reach 4.88 trillion US dollars in 2021.  The increase in reach of online stores has made them the natural part of the strategic growth plan of any business. The fast technological progress and the spread of mobile devices both demand a lot from the e-commerce market and force it to comply with all the modern trends and fads.  How to run an online business the right way?  1. Be everywhere, always For shopping the internet users of today utilize multiple platforms simultaneously so limiting yourself to only one or two most popular websites won't be enough. Besides, platform users prefer to have access to the seller through social media which forces the latter to be online all the time.  2. Keep an ear to the ground To make the right and timely decisions in your own business you have to have full and genuine performance statistics. Using multiple platforms simultaneously usually makes compiling analytics rather difficult, as a rule this information remains on the platform while existing reports prove to be incomplete or misleading.  With Trimpo running a business has become much easier! You can now unify all your existing accounts within one platform and regularly receive genuine performance statistics about your business.

The total number of Trimpo tokens created is 500,000,000, and we plan to distribute them as follows: All the tokens sold during our pre-sale (15.05.2018 - 15.07.2018) and Main Sale (15.08.2018 - 01.11.2018) will constitute for 60%. Further token allocation will be counted the following way:  Ø 10% of tokens will be allocated to the team, unlocked as the project moves along the Roadmap milestones (the first part of its share of tokens the team will be able to use no earlier than one year after the Main Sale);  Ø 20% of tokens will be allocated to the Trimpo Fund, which is necessary for the functioning of Trimpo’s ecosystem, fund will only be unlocked before the launch of Trimpo Marketplace. Fund’s tokens will be used for cashbacks for customers, when they make purchases on Trimpo Marketplace. Fund will be replenished due to receipt of tokens from merchants and suppliers, who will pay commission and service fees;  Ø 5% of tokens will be allocated to the Bounty program and to the project's advisors.  Ø 5% of tokens will be allocated to the project's early investors.  We deem this distribution system to be optimal for achieving the project's goals as well as its sustainable growth with investors' interests in mind. What do you think?

The past few months were rather difficult for crypto. Prices were unstable and trends were mostly downside. However, it seems that now we are looking at a market reversal! A clear upside trend is visible which means it’s time to look for investment opportunities. We would like to remind you that Trimpo Pre-ICO starts May 15!  Let’s talk numbers first. Over the last seven days all the leading coins were showing positive price action. Bitcoin has risen from $6000+ to the current $8326+ per coin while ETH has climbed from $400+ to $650+ per coin.  Other cryptocurrencies are also showing good dynamics. It’s very important that the rise has been slow and steady with no sharp hikes. Stability has always been important to serious investors who are more interested in supporting valuable and reliable products instead of speculating on token price! Trimpo fits the bill as our service is poised to become highly demanded thanks to the broad functionality of the platform that is at the same time easy to use!
