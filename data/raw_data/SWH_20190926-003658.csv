They win at the 9th places on CITY OF ZION DAPPS COMPETITION < https://cityofzion.io/dapps/1 > lead by:  RavenXce, Henrychua, Jackyeu as Co-creator & Steven Pang as advisor aims to be a truly decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the NEO platform while still providing for a superb user experience. It allows for the trustless exchange of NEP-5 tokens and may expand to other cross-chain tokens in the future.  ADVANTAGE  There are many benefits of trading on a decentralized exchange. A few examples are  A decentralized exchange does not hold trader's funds, so you maintain full control over your funds while trading. Tokens traded appears in your wallet as soon as the trade is complete (and funds withdrawn from the trading smart contract). Trading on a decentralized exchange ensures anonymity, as your information is not stored by the exchange. SWITCHEO more advance then NEX Exchange?  According to them: ""At this moment, NEX is focused on the NEO ecosystem and improving it as a whole, while Switcheo Network has a stronger focus on user experience and aims to be cross-chain compatible as quickly as possible; Work on the Qtum blockchain has already begun.  Switcheo also believes that there is space for more than one DEX per blockchain in the ecosystem. The winner in the DEX race will likely be the one with best usability and marketability, rather than pure technical superiority.  It is also possible that the DEX with lower liquidity will eventually combine order books, which should be possible due to the decentralized nature of the exchanges.""  ""We cannot comment about other technical or usability differences as there is no product demo yet for NEX.""  For now on whitepaper not yet release but Switcheo MVP Demo already developed since Dec 2017 and presented during CITY OF ZION DAPPS COMPETITION.
