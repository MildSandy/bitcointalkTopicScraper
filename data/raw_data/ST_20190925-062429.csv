Here's an update from our CEO:   Quote from: Denis Zyryanov We start the project as a social network for scientists and IT specialists, so that they have a comfortable environment for communication and work, where they can gather in teams, come up with and discuss new ideas, replenish their portfolio and share it with people.  After we gather a large number of users within the platform, we will launch the functionality in the form of tender and crowdfunding systems, as well as provide a knowledge base and a wallet for crypto-transactions . As soon as this issue is closed, we will begin to attract business representatives to use the platform's intellectual resources through the publication of tenders, thus we will begin to attract private investment for the development of new technologies and research.  With the help of crowdfunding system-users will be able to attract funding for the implementation of their ideas from like-minded people or business representatives (who are interested in this technology).  Tender and crowdfunding systems are based on blockchain and use smart contracts, which are backed by our ""Science-Token (ST)"" based on Ethereum.  Each user will have their own crypto-wallet with our token.  In order to publish a tender - business representatives or just customers - it is necessary to purchase our token on the internal exchange from other token holders and reserve it in a smart contract, after which the tender can be published, and our algorithm for selecting personnel of the necessary qualification will gather the necessary performers for the implementation of the project.  All transactions within our platform are made in our token, however, we plan to work in the international arena and plan to create a holding company legal entities in each jurisdiction that would be people from the traditional financial segment was convenient to use the platform as an intermediary, for the purchase of our token from other users (not all countries allow you to buy cryptocurrency directly from your current account on the exchange , in this case, we will be your agent, as a legal entity. We will conclude contracts and receive investments in the current account of our company in the jurisdiction where crypto purchases from the Bank account are allowed. We will buy the necessary amount of tokens from our users and in the future we will give them to the customer for further use within our system.)  We will also guarantee the legality of the platform and users within the platform - we will have a database of each user and personal data. In case of fraud, the platform will provide the user's contact details and provide legal protection to the injured party on its own.  We plan to become a single international center for communication of the entire scientific and IT community, which would significantly accelerate the introduction of new technologies in everyday life.  We do not pursue the interests of any state, but are fully focused on the development of science.  In the future, as soon as the platform is internationally recognized, as soon as we get licenses and a large number of users-we will start implementing a patent system on the blockchain in the jurisdiction of each country, we will defend the interests of scientists by providing them with legal protection of our platform, under the auspices of the "" International Science Hub""  ↗️ ISH Rating: icobench.com/ico/international-science-hub trackico.io/ico/international-science-hub/ icomarks.com/ico/international-science-hub icoholder.com/en/international-science-hub-22242 neironix.io/ru/ico-rating/ish_international_science_hub  🔗 Links: Site: ish.earth WP: ish.earth/wp.pdf Email: ceo@ish.earth Linkedin: linkedin.com/company/ish-earth/ Twitter: twitter.com/ish_earth Telegram ANN: t.me/ish_earth github: github.com/wisdman/science-token reddit: reddit.com/user/ISHearth/",False
