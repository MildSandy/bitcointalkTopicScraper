We are cooperating with the Norwegian Financial Supervisory Authorities, major banks and tier 1 law firms in ensuring compliance and optimal tax structure. The values in the Norwegian social-democratic society of transparency, trust, one of the lowest scores on the Word’s social inequality index and a long tradition for protecting Intellectual Property, freedom of speech are in our view favorable and synonymous with the values of the Blockchain community. Norway also benefits from having no foreign debt and no secret laws which can be used to put pressure on Friend Network AS. By doing the Friend Network ICO in Norway, we hope to set the standard for other projects to follow. Private companies in Norway have to disclose more information than public companies in countries such as the UK or the US. We see this as a great advantage for FRND Token holders. Furthermore, Norway has a special legislation that ensures all private tax information (on an individual level) is available to the public . Thus, the 3 FRND Token holders have further assurance that Friend Network AS and the team behind Friend are transparent with the highest business ethics in mind.",False

However, Friend does not attempt to replace existing operating systems; it runs on top of them, providing a powerful, unified interface to a new world of blockchain-ready apps. Friend can be accessed from any computer (or mobile) in the world - just open a new tab in the web browser. Think Google Chromebooks without the Google part. Friend will be a neutral alternative: an autonomous Cloud Computer owned and controlled by its users. Talking about resources, in order to track the sharing of resources, and enable fair trading between computers, we have chosen to integrate Ethereum into the core of Friend. It will soon be possible to share storage and computation resulting in lower cost, anonymous, cloud computing.

Thank you for your question! No, we are registered in Norway. Why Norway? We are cooperating with the Norwegian Financial Supervisory Authorities, major banks and tier 1 law firms in ensuring compliance and optimal tax structure. Also, the values in the Norwegian social-democratic society of transparency, trust, one of the lowest scores on the Word’s social inequality index and a long tradition for protecting Intellectual Property, freedom of speech are in our view favorable and synonymous with the values of the Blockchain community. Norway also benefits from having no foreign debt and no secret laws which can be used to put pressure on Friend Network AS. By doing the Friend Network ICO in Norway, we hope to set the standard for other projects to follow. Private companies in Norway have to disclose more information than public companies in countries such as the UK or the US. We see this as a great advantage for FRND Token holders. Furthermore, Norway has a special legislation that ensures all private tax information (on an individual level) is available to the public . Thus, the 3 FRND Token holders have further assurance that Friend Network AS and the team behind Friend are transparent with the highest business ethics in mind. ",False
