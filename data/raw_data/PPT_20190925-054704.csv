Total invoice market size worldwide was in year 2012 3trillion usd. (a number with 12 Zeros: 1.000.000.000.000 - we speak about the american Trillion)  Expect the invoice market to be 5 Trillion in 2019 (included new smaller SMEs which will have for the first time the chance to get loans because of Populous-System)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Every PPT Token grants access to the Populous Liquidity-Pool (LP) to finance invoices.  This means PPT Token will grow with the size of the LP, for every % market share Populous gets from invoce market LP size and PPT Price will grow.

By this way Populous can offer for both sides low cost(Invoice-Seller) and high interest (Gold-Token buyer), which is a perfect WIN-WIN.  Invoices is clear, what is doing this XAUp Token(Crypto Gold-Token)?    XAUp Token buyer bring in there liquidity (Money, in USDC) and buy a Goldtoken backed by phyc. gold with a delivery time of 12months.  Here comes the great part:      XAUp buyer get upfront paid 9% interest and at payment date the invest plus any gold gains in the 12 month timeframe.      XAUp has price protection to the lower side (you get always at minimum your invest back and take the gains of gold when it has climbed higher in 12 months.     The result of this deal is like buying 9% fixed income bond backed by gold plus gains of gold in the 12month timeframe.   XAUp is a ERC-1255 type Token (it has its own unique Serial_Number and Identity). You should not send it to MEW(it does not support it).  Best place is to leave it at Populous Wallet or send it to a ERC-1255 compatible Wallet (like Enjin Wallet to name one)  Currently you can do, to my knowledge, only privat deals if you want to sell it earlier or and this will be the standard way as today let in with Populous-Wallet then you get the payment plus any gold gains back after 12 month or delivery of one physical ounze of a best quality Gold-Coin bought for 9% less.  There will be in some months a dezentralized Populous-Exchange called P.DEX, there it will be possible to sell/buy XAUp earlier if wanted. At this P.DEX you can expect to find gold-buyer which hope to get a good deal to buy crypto or physical gold cheaper as at the goldcoin shop next door.   ###################  An here comes the funny part for speculators:  Lets think you bought  10 x XAUp Gold Token ** at market low and with a 9% discount  (Market low for Gold was for example 1200usd and you bought it for 1010usd) 8 weeks later Gold had a good run and your XAUP-Gold is now worth 1390usd. You sell your 10 x XAUp at P.DEX for 1390 (may some % less). In 8 weeks you made 380usd x 10 = 3800usd. Cool ? Now ""rinse and repeat"" you buy again Populous Gold etc etc etc.  What happens if Gold goes down while you invested in XAUp, nothing, you wait until the 12 months period is over and get your money back.   What does Populous thinks about it, if you use XAUp for pure speculation ? Welcome, they simply love it because you bring liquidity to Populous.   What does Populous thinks about it, if you get very greedy and buy 1000 x XAUp  for pure speculation ? Same answer like above    ** XAUp Token comes out limited and in tranches, and sells out fast once it is established in the market place. If XAUp is sold out, price of ""young"" XAUp Token in the secondary markets will rise and XAUp will become a seller market, and upper price limit will be the physical price of gold. ""old"" XAUp Token will always orientate torwarts the physical gold price, specially near and at the payback time.",False

Don't forget he had 2 if not 3 great opportunities to do a buy back. First at 20 $ (drop from 80) than at 12 (drop from 30). He's probably one of the early investors with over 100.000 coins. So he's is accumulating and selling every time the market recovers. He already did most of the damage.  That last dump at 12$ was the most humiliating and now everyone are moving away from the project. This is how human psychology works.

The whole crypto market is in a bearish trend at the moment with bitcoin leading the way, the good news is that strong projects with good fundamentals will survive, and the pressure from trolls/FUD should weed out whales which should, in theory, spread the supply out into the market so more people have a chance to get ahold of some cryptos at a better price.   This is an interesting time indeed, but I think its a healthy correction that we needed to have eventually, now we can all come back down to earth instead of being overly confident assholes in every project this market has to offer.  it was just too easy for everyone to make money last year, which distorts everyones perception of what value really is Yes you can be depressed (like me sometimes lol) thinking about missing the oportunity to sell at the ATH back in January and the amount of money we could have made, but this should also put a smile on the faces of those who want to stock up on more of their favorite cryptos whatever it is.   Most people don't know about populous yet lol, most people still think bitcoin is the only crypto in existence. and that every other crypto is some shitcoin that wants to be bitcoin, they have no idea of the actual underlining technology which can be adapted for many different applications (like invoice factoring for instance).  this is why PPT will explode (again) because holders will be making easy money in a market where people are searching desperately for easy money. Why did bitconnect ever get to the top 10 in the first place? because people wante that passive income. when people realize this brings you passive income its going to go nuts.

The stuff about how its difficult to make a sizable investment without knowing how much of a stake you will have is all valid and true, but the really important point for me is that an uncapped ICO makes me think the developers dont know how much money they need : they just want ""everything they can get"" and figure it out later. I would much rather invest in a project with a determined budget, where they have a good idea what they can do with X amount of money, rather than raise it all and figure it out later.  It betrays a lack of business acumen and savvy and makes you look a bit more like you jus want to raise as much as you can get, rather than what you NEED.  The stuff about wanting as many people to take part has some validity, but its equally open to everybody even with a cap, and the token swill be trad-able immediately so people can get involved whenever they want, so I dont think thats a good argument  The arguments of a) it does not look good to potential investors : makes you look simply like money grabbers without a specific plan for doing X with Y raised, and doing Z if W is raised, etc b) It makes it much more difficult to make a large investment in the early rounds because you dont know how much is going to be raised so therefore cant evaluate it properly (as an investor)",False

London — 29 May 2018  About a month ago, the team at Populous World celebrated a monumental achievement where the Populous invoice discounting platform successfully launched a crowd sale where sixteen participants managed to purchase an invoice collectively on the blockchain.  Fast forward to today, Populous World are proud to announce that they have received the repayment for the invoice which signifies the closing of the very first invoice sold on the blockchain.  With the repayment of the invoice, all participants of the purchase will now automatically receive profit Pokens prorated to the group bid placed. Pokens are the credits given in return for the Populous Platform Tokens, (PPT’s) that are utilised on the platform.  Each of these Pokens are pegged to a major currency, in this case GBP. The GBP Pokens will be withdrawable from the platform by the participants who receives the profit Pokens, and can be stored in any Ethereum wallet as they are ERC-20 tokens. With seamless integration to the platform, Pokens that are withdrawn can be deposited into the unique Ethereum address provided to each user.  While these Pokens can be redeemed as fiat currency, withdrawn as ERC-20 tokens or be used to settle withdrawal fees, they currently cannot be used to purchase new invoices on the platform.  Populous World is an invoice discounting platform built on the blockchain. The blockchain serves to increase transparency of invoices sold, the accuracy of bids placed and global participation. With the first invoice crowd sale closing successfully, we look forward to welcoming many more invoices and users on the platform.  END  Lou Chan  Head of Marketing, Populous World.",False

The study, conducted by Wall Street strategy firm fundstrat global advisors argues that that the ratio between the bitcoin price and miners’ breakeven cost (P/BE) has proven to be a “reliable long-term support level” for the flagship cryptocurrency and that current and future mining infrastructure development will “underpin bitcoin price appreciation into year-end 2019.”  “We expect the mining economy to grow over the next several years, and project a BTC price of ~$36,000 by year end 2019 based on the historical average 1.8x P/BE multiple,” Fundstrat quantamental strategist Sam Doctor wrote in the report. Doctor added that although $36,000 is the most likely target for the bitcoin price according to this analysis, it could end up anywhere in the $20,000 to $64,000 range depending how the landscape develops over the next 18 months.  Even the lower end of that range represents a 113 percent increase from the current bitcoin price, while the more optimistic target represents a 583 percent surge. At the time of writing, bitcoin was trading at $9,375 on Bitfinex. As CCN reported mining firms have been rapidly scaling up their operations following last year’s prolonged bull market. Bitmain, the world’s dominant mining hardware manufacturer, is said to have made as much as $4 billion in operating profit in 2017, and Canaan — its largest competitor — is preparing to hold an initial public offering (IPO) that it believes will provide it with a $1 billion valuation.  Fundstrat has long been bullish on bitcoin. Founder Tom Lee has argued that, among younger investors, cryptocurrencies are rapidly replacing gold as the most popular “store of value,” and the firm has published a number of analyses that suggest the ecosystem will experience sustained long-term growth. at $25,000 for 2018 and has previously said that bitcoin could rise as high as $91,000 by early 2020.

And since Populous controls over 50% of the PPT, they might actually be able to control the price of PPT somewhat. But when a bear market hits, all that is thrown out the window.

After months of work, and a compelling team effort, Populous goes on live beta to showcase invoice financing on the Blockchain.  The team at Populous are humbled by the support of the community where almost a thousand strong came to sign up to participate in the first ever invoice to be financed on the Blockchain. Despite the overwhelming support, Populous decided to allow a handful of participants to ensure a smooth transition from their beta test network.  The invoice was sold within a few hours, where more than fifteen participants came together to form a group bid that amounted to £190,000.00. On the Populous platform, users can bid on invoices individually or form a group bid to offer the best cash flow solutions to businesses that require invoice discounting.  The live beta launch comes at a time where the invoice financing industry is becoming increasingly fast paced where SMEs that are looking for alternative financial solutions.  The team behind Populous are proud to have the first invoice financed on the Blockchain in their live beta platform which has strengthened their resolve to always put the security of the funds and user experience as top priority on the platform.

Over the summer I believe we will hit new ATHs.  This moment in time is really a gift for everyone who missed out initially.  Once this starts running it will be a freight train.  When the platform is live and people are making real passive income, it will moon because it has to.   Worst case scenario, if PPT price stays low or flat, which is not likely imo, you will have a token that pays you a very high yield and for that reason alone it wouldn't make sense for this token to remain low.  If you can earn 10-15% per month on your tokens that is 120-180% annually.  Now that might be aggressive but even purchasing invoices at just a 5% discount per month will yield you a 60% return. You still hold your PPT and that doesn't even factor in any increase in the price of PPT.  When we go live I will be a bit conservative and see how the platform functions.

It did and that didn't make me get a big head. I didn't start dumping either because I have morals. There's a high probability of figuring out what these markets are going to do if you have been following along, so I award you no points. It wasn't that long ago that populous went from $2 to $8 then back to $2. Everybody was screaming it's a big fraud.  Now everybody is doing the same thing again when the beta has increased functionality over the past week. 1. It signs you out after a few minutes to eliminate the hacker trying to take your stuff over. It already had 2fa for this 2. dashboard shows an overview of invoices you personally have bought 3. fake ppt added for people to try out.  This is on top of everything else there already was like: group bidding, creating an invoice, individual bidding, currency exchanger. We didn't come here for something really complicated. We need something that will work. Maybe the kids here have lost sight of what's important.  So when you look at the fact that you can see the z-scores and people can buy and sell invoices YOU CAN use this thing already. They are just being professional and not releasing it yet, so this stuff about the due dates should stop.  So while you've been sitting there looking at goldman's sach and talking about the benefits of usury i've been focusing on the value that this thing will provide and why i invested in the first place. It already has brought value because it's taught a lot of people about factoring and how the platform works. People can use it in a testnet to simulate funding businesses. It has a couple important safety features. That's what we came here for. Now they have a $200,000 bug bounty out to see if something's still wrong.  Final Edit: Go and find bugs on the platform or glitch out the smart contract. They will give you $200,000 for doing something valuable. You can make money providing a valuable service instead of navel gazing. This is what's wrong with society and cryptos. Everybody wants easy money for no work.",False

This pattern happened 3 times when it punched the $70 mark twice and now moving from $17 to 23.

Our marketing strategy is neatly crafted to create the perfect storm in several promotional mediums at once and an avalanche of BIG things will take place altogether.  And no, if you wonder if the Debitum partnership announcement was the juicy news that we had to share the answer would be no. Our sweet PayPie is being baked to perfection and a lot will happen once the time comes. It looks like Christmas will arrive earlier this year! About a Beta launch, we don't have a confirmed date yet but the development is going as well as expected and Beta will be released on time.  On another topic, we're happy to announce that Derrick Liu, CPA, joined the PayPie team as our newest advisor! He will add tremendous value to future partnerships development and he represents a financial stronghold in Asian markets. Here's a short bio of Derrick:  ""Derrick is the principal partner of Keyway Group, a regulated corporate service provider advising over 10,000 companies since its inception in 1979.  Derrick is an early investor in Bitcoin and through his group’s investment arm, has invested in numerous startups in the crypto space while often assisting them as a regulatory and tax advisor. He is a frequent speaker at various investment events and he is a fellow at the Hong Kong Institute of CPA and member of CPA Australia. ""  And now without further ado let's move onto the sweetest news of the day - PayPie has officially joined the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance! The EEA opened its doors for PayPie to figure among its global reputable members such as Microsoft, Deloitte, Bancor, Accenture, Cisco, Dash, Intel, ING, Santander, Ledger Wallet, and CreditSuisse. Check it out!   PAYPIE JOINS THE ETHEREUM ENTERPRISE ALLIANCE  VANCOUVER/BC, CANADA – March 2, 2018 – PayPie announced today that it joined the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), the world's largest open source blockchain initiative with over 400 member companies. PayPie joined EEA to enhance its contributions as a trusted leading enterprise in the blockchain industry and to support the adoption of Ethereum-based technology in the enterprise world.   As a member of the EEA, PayPie will collaborate with industry leaders to help spread the benefits of trust and transparency brought by the blockchain to industries worldwide. EEA’s membership represents a wide variety of business sectors from every region of the world, including technology, banking, government, healthcare, energy, pharmaceuticals, marketing, and insurance, as well as a number of fast-growing Ethereum startups. The EEA’s wide range of vendor-led, industry-specific application layer working groups and committees are committed to increasing the adoption of Ethereum technology in the enterprise.   “We are always searching for new ways of strengthening the blockchain technology community as a whole and of growing our own partnerships ecosystem with organizations that bring new synergies to the platform. The support for blockchain improvement and adoption must be constant to enable fintech companies like PayPie to expand and bring value to an ever-growing business audience eager for credit disruption,” said PayPie’s CMO Yohan Varella.   About PayPie  The PayPie platform brings ultimate trust and transparency to the business lending by introducing the world’s first blockchain powered credit risk assessment based on business accounting. The platform challenges Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion’s status quo by assessing businesses credit risk profiles through a built-in algorithm that accounts 150 data points from near real-time financial data-based risk scores hashed on the Ethereum blockchain, hence building a faster, safer, and smart contract-powered credit scoring for banks, lenders, and financial institutions. Furthermore, the platform will introduce its own invoice factoring marketplace in which SMEs and invoices will be rated by PayPie’s unique credit risk score for a trustworthy decision system. PayPie has launched its conceptual Alpha version in January 2018 and has scheduled to launch its Beta version at any time before the end of April 2018. Website: https://www.paypie.com/   About The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance The EEA is an industry-supported, not-for-profit established to build, promote, and broadly support Ethereum-based technology best practices, open standards, and open-source reference architectures. The EEA is helping to evolve Ethereum into an enterprise-grade technology, providing research and development in a range of areas, including privacy, confidentiality, scalability, and security. The EEA is also investigating hybrid architectures that span both permissioned and public Ethereum networks as well as industry-specific application layer working groups. EEA will collectively develop open industry standards and facilitate collaboration with its member base and is open to any members of the Ethereum community who wish to participate. This open-source framework will enable the mass adoption at a depth and breadth otherwise unachievable in individual corporate silos and provide insight to the future of scalability, privacy, and confidentiality of the public Ethereum permissionless network.

The point to be made is that a crypto based invoice factoring company, operating within the U.K does not *yet* need a FCA license to operate, emphasis is on 'yet'. Does anyone really expect a multi-billion dollar company, supposedly handing billions of dollars per year in invoices will *not* be required to operate under a license in the near future ? I would place this in the 'very unlikely' category.  If you don't believe it is likely that FCA licenses will be required, then carry on buying PPT, that is the risk you take for the reward. If you however agree that you will need an FCA license in the near-future for said crypto based invoice factoring then the purchasing decision for PPT hinges on whether you think Nico and the team can obtain an FCA license to operate.  I would expect that the FCA would not grant PPT a license to operate with the present team in place.  This is all speculation and it needs to play out however, nobody should be blind to these risks and they should be discussed openly and in a balanced manner so if people get burned there is less pressure on the PPT team.  As it stands there are people who bought at $60 and were not entirely in the clear about all of this and are thus, very unhappy to see the price tank to the $2x range.

I've asked about this with Hive's Community Manager. This is what he had to say about the allegation:  The allegations made regarding copying and plagiarism clearly have no basis.  I don't even know why this is being raised.  We won at CoinAgenda Barcelona. Yes Hive, has won first price for best ico in 2017!  We were scrutinised in great depth by the panel of judges, and our white paper was dissected and discussed thoroughly. If any allegations of copying could have been substantiated, they surely would have been then.  Now, pls stop your fud about copying white paper's. Stop your PPT propaganda. Hive is populous 5.0  and populous can't even stand in Hive's  shadow.  Maybe it's better you  focus on your CEO who is a habitual lying convicted criminal for Wire Fraud.

Hive already has a working up and running DEMO since 21 December!  Maybe Populous will be transparent 1 day. Hive has always been transparent and you can ask any question you'd like. You can join Hive's telegram at any time you wish. You will not be kicked out like in the PPT telegram for asking serieus questions.  Hive has a real deal with an ERP provider named Adacta and more to come. (The Adacta integration  commences in Slovenia, our first target market, before rolling out to Germany, Russia and the other countries covered by that deal. Hive also has letters of intent in place covering Turkey and Latin America)  What does Populous have? Oh yeah, wait Populous had a deal with Luxure Global Citizen. But it got cancelled! Which you promoted btw. as a 1 billion dollar company which  isn't really worth 1 million dollar. Also PPT talked about it as if they would recieve all of  their invoices when it was only 10%. Wow, another lie!  Now, I can keep going on and on,  how much better Hive is than Populous ,because the list goes on and on. But DYOR and see by yourself. All I want to say is Hive delivers and delivers and every time on time. And Populous every time isn't!  Hive doesn't mind competition :  It even feels  to be beneficial to raise awareness of how blockchain will revolutionise the world in the same way as the Internet has done.  This is a quote of Hive's Community Manager Oliver Muldoon a real gentleman who is always ready for all of your questions. So is our great community btw!  Anyway good luck with your PPT.

United Kingdom Main laws and normative acts Credit Unions Act 1979 and the Industrial & Provident Societies Act 1965 Description: Credit Unions must register under the Industrial & Provident Societies Act 1965, which gives them corporate status and limited liability and their activity is governed by provisions of the Credit Unions Act 1979. A Credit Union may only undertake those activities for which there is an express or implied power in the Credit Unions Act. Loans may only be made to natural persons, who share a common bond. However, some of these loans will be used by sole traders for business purposes. There is currently an interest rate cap on loans (2% per month). Credit unions are regulated by the Financial Services Authority under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Before they can do business, they need to be authorised by the FSA, which makes rules about their operations.  Community Development Finance Institutions (CDFIs) may register either as companies regulated under Company law; or community benefit societies registered under the Industrial & Provident Societies Act 1965. They are not subject to the provisions of the Credit Unions Act. CDFIs which register under the Industrial & Provident Societies Act may invite retail investment of withdrawable share capital ('WSC'). WSC is risk capital which carries no guarantee of repayment, and so takes the CDFI outside of European Banking legislation. CDFI's lend for both personal and business purposes. Investment applied to their business lending may, if qualifying criteria relating to the spread of loans is met, attract a tax relief which is the equivalent of 8.33% to higher rate tax payers under the Community Interest Tax Relief scheme ('CITR'). Where investors are paid a return, it is usually paid as a percentage of the investment, rather than a dividend.",False

You don't give an SME your PPT tokens, the SME will get pokens,  Pokens are pegged to the British pound right now. So businesses don't need to worry about price volatility.  So again to clarify for you,  If you are an SME you will be getting pokens, not PPT....    You also forgot to mention that as the PPT price goes up this means you'll be able to get more pokens, (meaning larger interest/returns). Which is what makes this project the best passive income opportunity in the market. imo  Yeah, it could go down but the only thing that will make it go down is an abundance of supply without the demand to match kind of like what we are seeing now.   Right now all you can do is sell your PPT... which is what is driving the price.  But once live invoices are on the platform no one is going to want to sell their PPT, the supply on the exchanges will dry up as soon as people are able to use their PPT on the platform. Couple that with the fact that more people are learning about cryptos as time goes on and eventually they'll stumble across Populous and see the live platform    _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  So naturally, the supply vs demand will drive the price up, and I think it'll just continue to grow because so many people want an asset that brings them a form of passive income.  Doesn't matter where the price moves right now.. it might be going up, down or sideways who cares.  I'm pretty sure as the full platform launches you will have less and less people that will want to sell PPT because they will want to use it on the platform.  So really the obvious outlook for PPT is just constant growth. As people continue to hoard it and use it for passive income. More people are going to want it. So yeah do the math. the future of Populous looks incredibly bright and it has huge potential to become one of the best current use cases for the Ethereum platform.  Project's like populous are what will drive Ethereum to 10k and beyond.    So I have to ask you Kufut, why are you here? you obviously don't like Populous, so why waste your time here? You haven't bothered to read the white paper so what makes you qualified to even talk on the matter? you clearly have no idea what you are talking about. Or you do and you are just pretending to be stupid. Which is a recurring trend with FUD makers.   So what's in it for you? what do you gain from being here?

So if populous goes to 2 billion it will make it 66x more expensive then debitum, which is only 100% profit from today prices..     https://debitum.network?a_aid=icobuy   Then really if you want a good lending platform for lending business loans and invoice market ""Globally"", and see 10x return minimal, then debitum would be the better choice as PPT is way over values and hyped without having a single customer.. when the ICO of debitum is completed it will have first customers coming within a month that have been waiting.

While banks, large financial institutions and independent invoice finance companies dominate asset-based lending and factoring, Peer-To-Peer (P2P) invoice finance platforms have recently entered the industry. Similar to traditional invoice finance providers, these platforms provide solutions that allow SMEs to get immediate funding on monies owed to them by their customers, rather than waiting for customers to pay invoices within a 45 to 90 day period which usually causes a strain on the cash flow of the SMEs  FACTS ABOUT THE MARKET  1. Last year alone, over $3 trillion was traded through export factoring and invoice financing, it is an industry which has been growing in many sectors for the past 5 years.  2. 50% of SMEs account for the UK's total turnover £3tn.  3.

The only reason to steal 10's or 100's of millions (vs just a few million) is if you expect to be able to enjoy the money, which means living large with mansions, fancy cars, etc. Does someone like Nico think they can run a scam like this and escape prosecution and death? How does someone pull off a high profile scam like this and expect to get away with it and enjoy the spoils? As noted earlier, simply taking the ICO money and running is a lot more plausible as you can live a lifetime on a few million dollars and hide without attracting attention. 2. Why make such an aggressive initial beta schedule? Why not add a few more months to the schedule to buy more time? 3. Why lock the tokens up for a year if the intent is to cut an run?",False

Why is this still a big challenge for you to do?  You said: Quote The easiest ICO scam is to raise funds and then disappear with the funds. Nico did not do this. And that's very fucking stupid. You implied that Nico did not do this, and thus he is not a scam. Huh, what? So pray tell what is the hardest ICO scam?  You take offense when I suggested you to meditate for enlightenment, but that's exactly what you are supposed to do. Most of your comments reflect your ignorance, but you never realize it.  Update: You talked as if you are some expert with industry experience in scam operation, when in fact you are not. How a scam should or will proceed to be, is not for you to judge. You don't go around telling people how a scam should be like. There are multiple ways a scam can be carried out and end up. ""I don't think it can be done."" - I don't think you can even think.  Update #2: Here's another point for you to meditate on until you reach enlightenment: Ask yourself why do you keep giving Steve Nico 100% of the benefit of the doubt?  To be sincere and honest with you, I sincerely and honestly do not see why such a behavior of yours can be considered rational. I don't remember ever seeing even a single comment from you questioning the credibility of Steve Nico ever. $1 bil Luxure deal? Great! $1 bil Luxure deal off? No problem! Airdrop of free worthless token? Great! Past conviction for fraud for several years? No problem! And many other problems? What problem? I don't see any problem. I only see greatness everywhere.

It's not enough to take a few elements of doubt and create a whole narrative about fraud and scams unless the other pieces of the puzzle fit. If PPT is a scam it is a well thought out one. Scams in general are pretty simple in concept, but to pull one off you need not only to execute the scam itself but engineer an exit and a way to enjoy the spoils.

The biggest and best schemes littered down history had no exit plan, they just keep on going until there is an 'event'.  Taking a risk based approach to investment you could argue, if the supposition in the steem video is correct (and it has not been proven that it is), that the risk of such a future 'event' is far higher for PPT than it otherwise should be.

I said an ICO scam was the easiest scam and you disagreed and suggested that a ponzi Bitconnect scam is easier. Now you are changing the discussion to short and long term? Can't you even follow the discussion? Come on, please explain how a Bitconnect ponzi scam is easier/less effort than an ICO scam.  Regardless... Your questions are fine and legitimate, but they don't answer anything with certainty. They are indicators but they are not evidence. People with criminal records are hard to trust but that doesn't mean they can't go and be legit. It also doesn't mean they can't run a project to success. Many great and legit ICOs have a lot of hype and conviction - that means nothing. Most ICO founders have attempted to hype or boost their price - this does not make an ICO a scam. You can choose to invest in companies with founders with these backgrounds - that is your choice. It makes the investment/company risky, but it does not automatically make it a scam.  You're a big fan of logic but you've chosen not to use it because if you did you'd have to look at the angle of, 'what is the goal and execution of the scam?'  The ICO generated $10M+ in funds and they could have generated more due to the fast sellout. I guess you would say that they 'only' raised $10M because they didn't expect the success so they set their sites low - that's plausible. Of course, $10M of ETH from then is worth about $30M today. To say that PPT is a scam is to suggest that the $10M in ICO funds was not sufficient for the founders and that they wanted more. So rather than take the $10M and disappear, they have decided to go through all of the extra effort to spend 8 months and considerable funds and effort to launch a platform while remaining very public during the process to make even more? Sure, $100M or more is better than $10M or $30M, but anyone running a scam like this needs to disappear forever. And if you're going to disappear and be low keey, any more than a few million dollars can't be used or it draws too much unwanted attention. Being rich is no fun if you can't enjoy it.  So I ask again - what is the angle of this PPT scam if the implied allegations are that $10M wasn't enough and they are pumping the scam for more?",False

The FCA would expect firms that are required to assess the fitness and propriety of staff being assessed under FIT to have regard to substantially the same factors as those outlined in ■ FIT 2.  In the FCA's view, the most important considerations will be the person’s: honesty, integrity and reputation; competence and capability; and financial soundness. In assessing fitness and propriety, the FCA will also take account of the activities of the firm for which the controlled function is or is to be performed, the permission held by that firm and the markets within which it operates. A relevant authorised person assessing the fitness and propriety of staff being assessed under FIT should consider: (1) the nature, scale and complexity of its business, the nature and range of financial services and activities undertaken in the course of that business; and (2) whether the candidate or person has the knowledge, skills and experience to perform the specific role that the candidate or person is intended to perform.""  Hence, I will stick to my original hypothetical conclusion that if indeed a CEO or Managing director of a company had been placed under her majesty's pleasure for 4 years for fraudulent money transfers and was then put in charge of a $1bn USD listed company which primary function is money transfers then, yes this would be perceived to be a major governance issue.

The populous press release that LGC was going to setup its own currency and not use PPT tokens for their invoice factoring. They also failed to mention they would only handle 10% of those invoices. Further to this LGC said the press release from August was unauthorised from populous but at no stage made any effort to rectify any information in the press release.

Populous is to implement Beta v1.0 at 1750GMT today.    What is Beta?  All types of computer products, from operating systems to computer games are usually beta tested before general release, to test performance and identify any issues.  In fact, many software publishers and developers will have beta tester application forms that can be submitted online.   Allowing beta testers to try out software and provide feedback to the developer is a great way for the program to get some real world experience and to identify how it will work when it is out of beta. Beta testers are usually asked to give as much feedback as they can about the beta software - what sort of crashes are occurring, if the beta software or other parts of their computer or device are behaving strangely, etc. In a nutshell, Beta helps the platform to find bugs and security risks.   So what is Populous releasing?  Version 1.0 entails Populous’ latest build progress containing both new and existing features, and will be released as a progressive build, with changes being made and updated frequently. V1.0  will be released with limited functionalities of the software such as creating crowd sales, (auction for invoice), receiving and withdrawing test pokens from admin.  Initially, the beta is not set to be released until the end of February, so users should not expect this to be a finalised version, but it will give users the opportunity to first hand experience the software and explore the different functionalities of the platform.  However, version 2.0 that will be updated in one week, is set to release the functionalities of bid on invoices via individual and group, it will determine winners at the closing of the auction and demonstrate the flow of pokens from the winning bidder(s) to the invoice seller.  V2.0 will also include the ability to view all participants in a crowdsale.  The main purpose is to test the functionalities of the software that we are relating on Beta, users should be advised to not send real PPT, fiat or real KYC data as this is a testing platform.  https://medium.com/@BitPopulous/beta-version-1-0-is-open-today-1031bcafca63  from telegram group.",False

Why wasn't this communicated 8 days ago? when the agreement was terminated on 01-02-2018. Finally this scam leads to an end.  Also got this nice read from the Reddit pages. Not my words ,but something to make you think about.  Even in the slight off chance that the Populous invoice trading platform is real and legitimate, AND that Steve has the business experience and acumen to make it happen properly.... Gosh this is a huge stretch of the imagination!!  ...Even if all that, Institutional investors, General public, smart investors will not give any money to Populous because the CEO is a convicted criminal who did time for IDENTITY THEFT and FINANCIAL THEFT. He admitted it himself. Him being a Nigerian with a sole Nigerian lawyer (surname also Williams) as the company's legal team probably won't help him gain trust from big money either. There is no way that anyone will give him custody of any amount of money to create a liquidity pool, and or whatever is needed to make this work.  So, even if a small group of deluded people somehow manage to keep the price afloat, there will be no liquidity in PPT being traded on the market if you ever wanted to cash out.  Companies and businesses and smarter-than-you investors will never give money and sensitive identification documents to Nico and group of Nigerian scammers.  The biggest concern now is that people might still upload their ID docs to complete KYC, which is completely out of the ordinary. Nico (nickname of the CEO - Darren Stephen Williams.. or whatever he goes by) is asking people for a scan of their bank statement as well as their passport or drivers licence.  This will allow fraudsters to steal your ID and borrow money as you! Please warn others and stay away.  Get off this sinking ship and report the CEO to scamalert and to the authorities.

I really feel sad for you.  Update: The reason why XBRL token is issued and airdropped NOT because Steve Nico wants to make things easier for stupid people like you. It is because airdrop token seemed to be a good hype to pump the price at that time. At that time some ICOs were mooning because of promises to airdrop free tokens. And so Steve Nico was following that footstep.",False

Cryptos can provide electronic banking to anywhere in the world with electricity. The current banking system can only do 20% of the population. Invoicing is similar given that the banks are so bloated and charge way too much to people that actually do things. The inefficiencies of the banks skew the ability for people to pay back the loans. They have no competition so they can charge an arm and a leg. They make people pay a big fee to even sign up for the factoring. A lot of companies would be more profitable in a fair, transparent system. Populous is just the first mover probably because they're smart and have a good idea of what they're doing.

My goal is to make money, so it's in my interest to be careful.  I have to admit the claims concern me a little, but they happened a long time ago and it doesn't appear that they were ever convicted of anything. All the other small red flags are nothing individually, but I agree that they are concerning in aggregate.  That said, I really do believe that the platform is built out and beta will launch very soon. I also think it's really one of the best ICO models I've seen so far.  My biggest concern is what volume of invoices they'll have when the platform launches. I'm actually in the minority when it comes to price. I believe that token value is HIGHLY connected to invoice transaction volume and the high prices we've seen recently mean that you need crazy invoice volume to support it. Without that volume, a lot of token holders won't have invoices to invest in and the price will go down until we hit equilibrium (with some marginal premium for speculators).  So I'd rather see beta release into the FUD while prices are depressed and see an upward trend as invoice volume grows.

Not my words ,but got this from the Reddit pages. It blew my mind ,but DYOR.   WAS PPT CEO CONVICTED OF FRAUD IN 2008? - DYOR  After all the FUD that has been circulating regarding PPT, I decided to conduct my own investigation. I set out below the results of this investigation.  I have nothing against PPT, i thought it was an amazing idea and I hope the platform and the idea is big enough to live on beyond this scandal. However the criminals running it need to be exposed before investors loose their money completely.  I have provided all the relevant links so you can DYOR.  With the help of my accountant to navigate through Companies House to Research Steve Nico Williams business interests past and present as per his Linkedin profile, a few tips from a detective friend and several other concerned investors we uncovered the following:  Steve and David Williams were born Stephen and Samuel Adeyemi on 15 September 1979 and later changed their names to Darren Williams (Steve) and David Williams.  Darren Williams is the CEO of Populous World according to Companies House documents. https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10458726/filing-history  He and David have had a variety of other Companies, all of which have failed to submit Company accounts for reporting procedures and these Companies have been struck off.  Together with his Brother David and as per his linkedin profile, outlining that he is a publisher of Tramp Magazine, they appear to have dealings with Knight Capital Limited / Zloader – David Williams is the Director. This appears to be some sort of Equity Investment Company. However the website will lead you nowhere as all the links lead back to the home page. http://www.knightcapital.co.uk/#  Ok, lets go back to Populous World. On 23rd January 2018, they were given a First Gazette notice for compulsory strike-off. https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10458726/filing-history  Here is what my accountant emailed me after a few minutes of research: Ok basically a compulsory strike off is not good news and is in line with Directors walking away from Companies leaving it with a mass of debt. Looks like David and Darren Williams are the boys behind this.I spent literally 5 mins on the Companies House Register and find they have connections with Upward Capital OC 415936 a partnership,Olympus Research ,Bellaface ,Zloadr, Populous Data Analytical and if I had the time could probably find a lot more..All Companies except Zloadr have been struck off with no accounts ever submitted but Zloadr is strange and could be where they sort away their funds as it has a capital base of £317K on the last accounts but mostly made up on intangibles assets whatever they are with just 17K cash . Knight Capital Ltd has just become a Director of Zloadr !!  Anyway overall they are not operating as responsible directors should and there appears to be a deal of camouflage behind what they are upto.  So why, when a Beta platform was due to be released that week, did this strike off threat occur? Ask yourselves this? His accountant, if he had one, would have been on top of all Company filings and would never allow this to happen.  That concludes some of Darren Williams aka Steve nico Williams recent work history and provides some history into the successful businesses he has run in the past.  Ok, so lets move onto the article from the City News report dated January 2007 that was posted on Reddit a few days ago. We spoke with the journalist and they confirmed that the article was genuine, but he was hazy about the details as over 10 years ago.  So lets dig a little deeper. The News Report mentioned Reading Crown Court! An email was sent to Reading Crown Court, which was then forwarded to Oxford Crown Court due to the case being moved (maybe due to the severity of the case) and Certificate of Conviction was emailed back to us stating that Darren Stephen Williams, born on 15 Sept 1979 was sentenced to 42 months in prison on 4 March 2008 for Fraud.  An extract from the sentencing certificate is below, however for purposes to expel any further FUD on this matter and to enable you to DYOR I have left details of who to contact at the court directly so you can get your own certificate emailed directly to you. I might add here that the severity of this fraud was such that it took over a year to come to trial.  ---------- Forwarded message ---------- From: ""Oxford Crown, Enquiries"" enquiries@oxford.crowncourt.gsi.gov.uk Date: 8 Feb 2018 10:19 Subject: RE: Case of Stephen Adeyemi and Samuel Adeyemi  Dear Sir Your Email was sent on to Oxford as this case was transferred from Reading Crown Court to Oxford.

Scammers nowadays want to make their scam last, that's why we see Bitconnect is so well organized to be long-lasting. It wouldn't be down if not for the court order to stop the whole operation. I suspect the same can be said of Populous's github repos; real enough to make the scam last, but not real enough to have any real product. Nowadays many things can be done through 3rd party just for visual show, and unless we see the real thing (like Veritaseum, which I am very confident is very very legitimate), we cannot be dead sure it will certainly be real.  The business model works and the invoice financing industry is lucrative. But I have the opinion that while the project is promising, the team behind it may be not.  Like I said, I suspect Populous is a scam (not 100% sure, otherwise things would be too late for everyone) based on their past conduct in trying to pump up the price through various hypes. Their intent reveal their intention, obviously.",False

This guy reads my mind.     People who are invested in PPT are acting like the people who invested in Bitconnect loans. They all WANT TO BELIEVE and are quick to dismiss any negative allegations. Do your research and you will quickly find that there is no office, and no core team. The team members on the website are all freelancers, or 20 year olds with no experience, or Nigerians that either have no experience or are 20 year olds. These kids would be happy that they have a job and are getting paid some coin. In other words, they might not even know that theyre working for a scam. The CEO has no successful business experience, and is not public with his words nor presence. All messages in Slack are not permanent and the chat history disappears with every new line of chat. This is the only place that the CEO says anything.  Don't take everything said on Slack as truth. There are people who are paid to continue to convince others that PPT is a great investment and that retirement is around the corner. There are paid shills in all corners of the cryptocurrency space so beware!  I would be very surprised if this turns out to be a successful project. But I highly doubt it. If this invoice trading platform is such a great idea, a proper team with real business experience will likely come up and take the spotlight. My research tells me that this is the job of a conman. Do your own research into the legitimacy of the company and team before starting to FOMO about the intricacies of how a real Populous platform will make you money.

Did you hear that as the beta release was delayed once again, people were told that it would come out in just ""a few hours"" again and again and again. Until it became a joke on telegram and slack. This would be a great scenario for the CEO to cash out and sell his stack bit by bit at inflated prices. All the while, we now know that there was no intention of a Beta release by 31st Jan the entire time. Just lies and deceit. Now, investors are told that the beta will release within a month. How many times do you have to be fooled to realise that the CEO is a dishonest man. Think with your head screwed straight, without greed clouding your thoughts, like the investors of bitconnect then, the truth will leak into your mind also.  Authorities and journalists have been contacted to expose this scam. This could end up being another infamous crypto scam that will affect about 10k people who are holding a serious about of PPT in hope of something that won't ever happen.",False

Invoice discounting is a type of loan/financing that does not involve a transfer of title. The only exception in the world is the UK, where invoice discounting/financing is basically the same thing as factoring. Here is a quote from Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factoring_(finance)#Reserve_account:  Factoring is the sale of receivables, whereas invoice discounting is a borrowing that involves the use of the accounts receivable assets as collateral for the loan. However, in some other markets, such as the UK, invoice discounting is considered to be a form of factoring, involving the ""assignment of receivables"", that is included in official factoring statistics. It is therefore also not considered to be borrowing in the UK. In the UK the arrangement is usually confidential in that the debtor is not notified of the assignment of the receivable and the seller of the receivable collects the debt on behalf of the factor.  Now if you tell me that Populous is going to focus only on the UK market, which represents less than 4% of global GDP, then the transaction steps they've outlined make sense. In the rest of the world, which encompasses more than 90% of the global opportunity, the transaction as described by Populous will not work. In the USA for instance, non-notification factoring represents only 12% of the total pie, and is only available to larger companies under long term contracts and based on a pool of receivables (never one-off transactions). In addition, the due diligence that invoice sellers are put through under non-notification/confidential factoring is akin to bank lending; it's thorough and complex, thereby expensive to do.  The way that Populous imagines these transactions is completely ridiculous, and provides no protection for the invoice buyers. You mentioned that under the Populous model, the sellers will pledge corporate assets while company directors are to give personal guarantees... do you really think that Populous will pay the costs involved in international litigation to recover against sellers based outside of the UK? I doubt they will do that even inside the UK, as enforcement of these types of pledges is very expensive from a legal standpoint, and wouldn't work for any facility of less than $150,000-200,000. Again, for these transactions to work, the buyer of the invoices needs to take control of the repayment from the ultimate customer. Under Populous' current model, there isn't even a notification mechanism for the invoice buyer to be informed when the invoices have been cashed out... how then is the buyer supposed to know whether non-repayment is caused by debtor default (so that credit insurance can be invoked) or by the seller's non-compliance (so that legal action can be taken against the pledges) It makes zero sense.",False

It would be silly for them to run the process the way you are describing it when there are more ""protective"" options, so I'm not sure why you automatically assume they are just going to take the weaker approach.

You are not addressing my main point; that the transaction as you have described cannot be a true sale of invoice (factoring) as long as the seller of the invoice is the one that receives payment from the customer (debtor). Even in ""non-notification factoring"", the buyer of the invoice (factor) assumes the identity of the invoice seller, and recovers money directly to an account controlled by them. Again, the idea that the seller should cash out on an invoice is the very antithesis of invoice factoring.  The object of credit insurance is to insure against default by the customer (debtor) who is liable on the invoice, not the risk of non-repayment by the seller. Credit insurance never insures against the moral hazard that the invoice seller refuses to repay the invoice buyer, simply because factoring transactions don't require this type of coverage when they are structured properly (not the case on Populous platform).  The next two defensive mechanisms you have outlined are typical in recourse factoring, however Populous is not a factoring platform, so again you are mixing up concepts. At best, Populous offers invoice discounting without the protections that are typically seen in those types of transactions.  If you are still insisting that Populous does offer factoring solutions (and true sale of invoices), I challenge you to find a single public internet source where factoring is described in such a manner that the 1) invoice seller is advanced funds by the factor when the invoice is sold and 2) the invoice seller recovers funds from the customer in their own bank account and 3) transfers the money to the invoice buyer's account.  If you type ""How does invoice factoring work"", here are the first 10 results that appear:  1) https://www.comcapfactoring.com/blog/how-does-invoice-factoring-work/  Most factoring companies purchase invoices in two installments. The first installment – the factoring advance – covers about 80% of the receivable (this amount varies). The remaining 20%, less the factoring fee, is rebated as soon as your client pays the invoice in full. (this clearly implies that the invoice buyer receives the funds since they rebate the 20% balance, less the factoring fee  2) https://fitsmallbusiness.com/how-invoice-factoring-works/  Step 4. Your Client Pays the Factor Your client will pay the factor within 90 days according to the terms of the invoice.  Step 5. The Factor Forwards You the Remaining Balance (Minus Fees) After receiving payment from your client, the factor will give you the remaining balance of the invoice, called the reserve amount, minus their fees.  3) https://www.cit.com/thought-leadership/how-does-factoring-work/  Step 3: Factoring Company Collects from Retailer At invoice maturity, the factoring company collects from the retailer and credits the supplier's account. The factor fully manages the accounts receivable including the lock box, cash application and collection of past dues. Retailer deductions or disputes over delivery terms or product are reported to the supplier. The factor maintains the accounts receivable ledgers and provides this information to the supplier electronically via Internet reporting capabilities.   4) http://www.rtsfinancial.com/guides/what-factoring  Factoring is a transaction in which a business sells its invoices, or receivables, to a third-party financial company known as a “factor.” The factor then collects payment on those invoices from the business’s customers.

It's intentionally different. I understand your point about how the seller will receive cash from both sides, but I don't think it's accounts that they control. I don't know the mechanics for certain, but there are a couple of simple solutions that make sense so that's how I expect it to work out. It's not that hard of an issue to deal with so I'm not particularly worried that Populous is just going to leave open the risk that the Seller takes money from both sides and disappears.",False

I interpret the process differently than you do and see it as a sale with the transfer of cash being addressed through accounting entries.

So an invoice may be worth $1000 and the borrower may sell it for 10% less of it's value which is $900. This will rewarded the invested with $100 profit.  - If the borrower/invoice seller sells his invoices through Populous, they will receive Pokens from the sale which they can send to us and we will transfer them fiat currency equivalent or they can keep the Pokens and do what they want with them. The invoice seller can transfer Pokens outside the platform to his/her wallet or sell even sell on other exchanges. Pokens are worth the same as the fiat currency the inovice was sold in.    To offset the risk of default for any invoice sold by a invoice seller, There are three main things ppt do but this is on cases by case basis.  1) Credit insurance: Which is for large invoice amounts. 2) Charge on the invoice sellers company. Which is often known as a debenture registered a against the invoice sellers company. 3) Directors personal guarantee.  By taking out credit insurance the insurance company basically says they will cover the value of the invoice if the invoice sellers customer does not pay. A debenture will allow the assets of the invoice sellers company to be legal taken to settle the debt should the invoice not be paid. Directors personal guarantee would allow recovery of the debt in a worst case scenario by selling property of the invoice seller, such as his or her house.  These are used as recovery options and which are installed in the process of risk management of the invoice sale. Prior to that PPT carry our a full check on both the invoice seller and their customer in order to not get to the stage in which there would be a default.",False

It is pretty clear from the above that the invoice seller is the one who is ultimately repaid by the customer, which is the very antithesis of an invoice sale or factoring transaction. You can clearly see in the process above that the invoice seller gets paid twice, once by the invoice buyer (in Pokens) and once by the ultimate customer (in fiat). The reason real factoring transactions don't work like this is that they are structured in such a way as to avoid the moral hazard of seller non-compliance. In real factoring, when an invoice is sold, ownership of the invoice is transferred to the buyer, so that the buyer recovers directly from the customer. That is the very essence of factoring/invoice discounting.  This same process is explained in further detail on page 16-17 of the Feb 2017 Whitepaper https://web.archive.org/web/20170606070843/http://populous.co/populous_whitepaper.pdf:  If the auction is successful: 1.6.9. The beneficiary of the auction receives the funds from the investor group, which has won the auction. 1.6.10. The investors from the other investor groups are refunded their bids. 1.6.11. When the borrower cashes the invoice, which he has auctioned, he sends the money to the platform. 1.6.12. When the funds are received, the investors from the investor group, which has won the auction, receive their winnings. Each investor receives dividends propor-tional to his bidding contributions.  You can see clearly above that invoice ""seller"" is paid funds once by the investor group (paragraph 1.6.9.) and then a second time by the customer when the invoice is cashed out (paragraph 1.6.11.). From a functional perspective, this cannot be a ""sale"" of the invoice, because in such case the ""seller"" cannot be repaid directly by the customer, the right of repayment having been transferred to the buyer. Now, when you take away the right of direct repayment from the invoice ""buyer"", then this becomes nothing more than a simple loan, or an ""IOU"". There is no collateralization or other defensive mechanism protecting the invoice ""buyer"" from the seller's eventual non-compliance. In fact, there isn't even a way for the invoice ""buyer"" to know whether the invoice has been repaid/cashed out.  You should really be asking yourself whether it's a good idea to invest in a team that can't even properly explain how a factoring transaction works... perhaps this is because they have absolutely no experience in this field.",False

It is not offering invoice factoring or discounting, but rather a loan from the invoice ""seller"" to the the invoice ""buyer"", with the faint promise that the loan will be repaid once the invoice ""seller"" is paid by the ultimate customer. This makes no sense at all. In real factoring/discounting, the sale of the receivable transfers ownership of the receivable to the factor (i.e. the buyer of the invoice), and the factor obtains all of the rights associated with the receivables. Accordingly, the receivable becomes the factor's asset, and the factor obtains the right to receive the payments made by the customer for the invoice amount. In other words, the buyer of the invoice should be the one repaid directly by the ultimate customer, not the seller. Otherwise the seller is being paid twice for the same invoice (once by the invoice buyer and once by the customer); this goes against the very essence of what a factoring transaction is. It is also possible to structure a collateralized loan transaction that uses the invoices as collateral for the ultimate repayment of the loan, but that isn't what Populous is doing. In fact, the transaction that Populous is envisioning makes no sense at all.",False

I think you are right in the fact that Populous is not well known, but considering that there already is strong demand for PPT means that when the platform is about to go live and Populous begins its marketing campaign this project is going to absolutely explode.  It is actually really good to see that most of the PPT holders didn't panic sell through this market crash with ETH dipping below 1k and BTC dipping below 10k.  Goes to show that everyone here knows what they are holding. And that is really good!  It must really suck to be in all of the other hyped coins right now, like Ripple Tron and Cardano lol. They've gone down harder than ETH and BTC have because most of the people in those projects have no idea what they are holding or why, they just want lambos lol, I bet you half the people holding cardano or tron have no idea what it is.  And the slightest bare market shakes them back to fiat   Populous really does show its strength in these bare market cycles,  majority of the holders didn't even flinch at this.... AMAZING... If anything demand has only grown for PPT which again is another really good sign.  Don't let the whales and their giant walls scare you, Take note that as soon as you eat into those walls thewhales pull them down because they don't actually want to sell you any PPT they are trying to fear you into selling to them so they can acquire more at a steady price instead of trying to buy it all in one go (which would push PPT to well over $100)  And the whales would rather not pay that much lol.... Don't feed the whales, eat their walls, they hate it lol",False

""oh its overvalued""   few months later it's over 1k lol  In terms of being overvalued that's up to each and every person to decide on their own. My opinion is that PPT is actually undervalued. Populous is rank 26 right now on CMC, which is still very good! But Tron doesn't deserve to be in rank 13,  Heck,  Bitconnect doesn't deserve to be ahead of Populous in the rankings but it is.  Are these projects really worth more than Populous?  Again i'm going state that Populous is undervalued in my opinion. Simply because there are so many other useless projects valued at 10x or more than what populous is valued at,  you could also just say everything ahead of populous is overvalued,  but will the market agree with you?    Populous to me is worth alot more than these projects.   Pretty sure this is a token that i'll be able to pass down to my children. Business invoice factoring will be here forever. Populous are the first to bring this to the blockchain. And they are serving a market that will never stop growing.   PPT is priceless to me. Because i don't plan on selling it... Ever.   My local Cafe love's crypto's,  they accept Bitcoin and Ethereum as a method of payment, They were already interested in populous before i'd even mentioned it to them, They really want to try out the Beta i don't know if they'll get in or not but they are much happier to be financed by Populous which goes toward helping someone like me,  a PPT holder, than deal with the banks,  I think this gives you an idea of just how ready business's are to jump on board    If you want to talk overvalued just look at Tron. or Ripple for that matter. Multi billion dollar market caps yet they don't even offer anything new, Tron has its competitors, And people can just use Bitcoin instead of Ripple. In terms of actual ""intrinsic value"" Tron and Ripple don't offer anything new  Populous on the other hand are about to launch the the first invoice financing platform on the blockchain. They have no competition in the blockchain space. Giving PPT a value that is truly unique  Tron may be a good project but they are still a very long way from achieving their goals, and the ""value"" that TRX has to offer will never match PPT's   The fact that PPT has managed to keep a $40+ evaluation for so long only goes to show that the market itself does not see PPT as being overvalued",False

Easy. Populous are the first movers to bring invoice financing to the blockchain and they have no major competition.  This is an extremely niche project, that serves a multi trillion dollar market. A market that will always need a platform like Populous.  Business's will always need to be financed. Out of all the other projects i have invested into i believe Populous will be here forever.  Instead of speculating what the price will be in just afew months try imagine what a single PPT will be worth in the next few years as Populous becomes the largest invoice factoring platform in the world.    I believe it will be the largest because it is just way more efficient for a business to be financed by populous rather than the traditional system, It is much cheaper, faster and easier, which makes it a no brainier for business and enterprise to choose Populous.   I believe PPT could even be upward of $500 by the end of the year.

I'm going to take a stab. I appreciate comments on my ramblings and rough math:  For example, if you can buy a share/token for $1 and earn 3% per year, what will an investor pay for that stock plus $.03 annual earnings? 10x earnings is probably not unreasonable, so probably about $.30 give or take.  We'll ignore a supply/demand imbalance in the auction which would presumably also affect the interest rate and assume we can earn 2% monthly interest (24% annual interest)reliably. Let's also assume that you can use 80% of the current PPT market value to buy an invoice. For example, an $8k invoice would require $10k of PPT.  PPT is about $46 at the moment. 24% of 80% of $46 is $8.80.  Using a Dividend Discount Model with a Discount Rate of 2%, the calculated value per ""share"" is $440.  The interesting thing is that as the value of the token increases, the value of the earnings increase at the same rate. So a $440 PPT token would supposedly yield $88 annually. This then yields a token dividend valuation of $4408. So there is no limit to what PPT is worth except the actual ability to actually earn 2%.  The ability to earn 2% monthly interest depends on the supply of invoices and auction conditions achieving a consistent 2% monthly interest rate.  Not enough invoices, lower interest rate results in lower returns. Too many invoices results in higher returns.  The DDM doesn't take into account additional value due to anticipated increase in token price.  There are 37M tokens, so to achieve a $1000 token price, each token needs to be able to earn $19.20 interest annually. This requires a supply of $3.7B of invoices available that you can earn 2% monthly on.  That isn't to say that the DDM is accurate of valid, just one attempt at valuing PPT. Once people are able to see what real returns look like, and if they are close to these assumptions then $1000+ is no problem.",False

Because the amount you earn increases with price of the token, you can't really use a DDM approach. As you said, the constraining factor is the volume of available invoices.  So the market cap of the tokens should be approximate to the volume of invoices available. It'll be interesting to see what happens if there aren't enough invoices available, but my guess is that it'll result in some sell pressure so the token market cap doesn't ever go significantly above the invoice volume. There are some other factors at play, but that's the primary driver in my opinion.  That leads to the question of how much of the factoring market can they capture, as well as how much larger will the market grow now that more small businesses will have access to this type of financing.  I published a valuation model in the Telegram group that allows you to play with various assumptions, but that's the approach I used. I can see it going as high as $684 by the end of 2019 under the right circumstances.  Please keep in mind that this is not investment advice, so please do your own due diligence.",False

Just finished reading the latest Whitepaper, however several questions remain unanswered. Was hoping someone has already looked into this with the team:  1) According to the Whitepaper, once an auction is completed successfully, the invoice seller receives funds from the winning buyer or group. Then once the invoice seller receives payment from his customer, he deposits the money with Populous and makes payment to settle the loan. That means that the seller will be paid twice for one invoice - once by the winning buyer (group) and once by the customer. My question is what mechanism on Populous platform will exist to oblige the invoice seller to make the payments to settle the loan, and prevent him/her from double-dipping? Usually, in factoring transactions, the factor (invoice buyer) always gets paid directly by the customer precisely to avoid this potential problem (see for example step 4 of the process described here: https://fitsmallbusiness.com/how-invoice-factoring-works/). Why is it different on Populous platform?  2) There is no mention in the Whitepaper of the verification process Populous platform will use to ensure that the invoice is valid (i.e. a real product/service has been provided and the client is happy). This is very puzzling, because invoice verification is arguably the most important part of factoring. See for example link here: https://www.comcapfactoring.com/blog/why-are-factoring-verifications-necessary/   Does anyone have any idea what process will be used to verify the validity of invoices, if any?  3) Another question unanswered by the Whitepaper is whether the factoring on the platform will be recourse or non-recourse (http://blog.factorfunding.com/blog/what-are-the-differences-between-recourse-and-non-recourse-factoring/)? If there will be recourse against the invoice seller in case of a disputed transaction, does Populous platform offer any mechanism to aid invoice buyers recover from sellers directly? Or rather, will invoice buyers have to pursue legal action in traditional tribunals? If there will not be any recourse against invoice seller in case of a dispute, then the invoice verification process will have to be very solid... (which goes back to question 2) above)  4) Finally, how will Populous will ensure that an invoice has not already been financed with another factor prior to being auctioned on the platform. I understand that tokenization will ensure that ay given invoice is sold only once on Populous platform, but what mechanism ensures that it has not been sold outside the platform to a third-party?  Would help a lot to have answers to these questions!  Thanks   ",False

The way I understood this is that the invoice seller (borrower) will receive Pokens from the invoice buyer (investor). Pokens are issues in different currencies such as USD,GBP, etc. they are pegged to fiat currencies so that 1 GPB poken = 1 GPB or 1 USD Poken = 1 USD.  On the investor side (invoice buyer) the investor for example wants to invest 100 PPT. Let say the price of PPT is $40 so the 100 X 40 = $4000. Therefore the maximum that investor can lend is $4000 X 80% = $3,200 USD. Basically investor receives 80% of secularized PPT (worth $4000) in $3200 USD poken. He then lend these pokens to the invoice seller.  At the end of the month, invoice seller returns the pokens with interest to the invoice buyer. Invoice buyer returns those pokens with 0.5% fee to the PPT platform and the platform releases his PPT and he keeps his interest earnings.",False

The whales have been holding strong and consuming more through the dips you can actually watch their account balances/activities on the blockchain.  Populous is a very solid project, you can tell because there are always fudders like you trying to knock down the price,  I've seen this many times with plenty other great projects before. Honestly it sounds like you are freaking out because the beta is close and you know the price will sky rocket.  I've been in your position before, It sucks to miss the pump dude i know but trust me you haven't missed anything yet. I wouldn't be surprised to see Bitcoin closing in on 100k this time next year. And if you think Ethereum and Populous are just going to sit still you are wrong. Ethereum will be well into the thousands by then, that alone is going to bring up populous's price.  $1000 per PPT is very realistic.  Have you looked back 12 months ago on Ethereum? Ethereum's ico was less than a dollar too, your perception of value is obviously distorted if you cant see why PPT is already valued so high.   Crypto's in general are still pretty low key. As mass adoption continues we will see everything rise with the tide, but the true winners are the ones stocking up on projects like Populous, seriously go and watch all of the major holders of PPT on the blockchain they're not selling. And that's how you know this is a good project. The whales are holding strong.    You'd be stupid to sell PPT right now, the platform hasn't even launched yet.  That's like selling your shares in Apple before they even got out of the garage. Or buying 2 pizzas and a coke for 10,000 bitcoin. You don't want to be that guy.   Have patience.

Think equifax replacement.  Populous is the first mover in invoice trading that means you buy and sell business loans/invoices to provide businesses with the cash they need to function. A paper iou for the businesses' employees doesn't help them buy their families groceries. Accountants have to process a transaction thus the need for populous.  Hive is the 2ND mover on invoice trading I don't know as much about them.  Populous tokens are redeemed for pokens on the populous platform you then get them locked up after buying the invoices. When the invoice period is over you get pokens pegged to fiat and your ppt populous tokens back.  If you try to use cash your bank will want to know what you're doing. Process is much easier through crypto token populous. Liquidity pool donaters are people that don't like being scammed by the bank and see this as a better solution for passive income.,False

I'm at a loss to work it out. Total market cap of 1.5Bil. Late on their beta release, no customers, no revenue. No one even knows if it will work.  To me this seems to be dramatically overvalued and almost a indication of where crptocurrency market is sitting at the moment. As a long term trader, none of this makes sense to me. The price is rising despite they being late releasing their beta. So far all i can see is a pretty basic website. With a system that doesn't even seem close to working. Call it FUD but help me understand why I'm wrong. With pure facts. I would be interested in speaking to anyone who has tried out the beta release?  Then there is some questions relating the founders of this coin. Found numerous people complaining of not being paid by the founders of populous from an assortment of of businesses that have their name on it   I found www.twillion.co.uk which had links to the developers            Sew capital also claimed to have been a seed investor - however from what i could see sew capital had only ever invested in two company's both related parties to the original developers of this coin. Sew capital website doesn't exist along with twillion.  Then there was Zloadr: ZDR seems to be another one of their ventures couldn't tell if it was active or not.  then there is 484group.com - website gone seems to be another business venture no longer continuing.  www.samenrico.com goes to zloader seems to be gone  https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sew-capital - my advise is to look at this website and have a look at the related entities and you'll see the links.    I found a number of other businesses no longer active. Most of the business seem to related to the ""social elite"" very similar to Luxure Global Citizen. Its also interesting to note none of these businesses appear on steve williams linkedin profile yet given the information linked to these companies they are clearly him. For me this if nothing else appears deceptive at best. I would be steering clear of this one.  if all this isn't enough, my advise is have a look at the invoice from luxure global citizen.

Populous have released only an alpha version which basically is a login page and a fairly simple website.  steve nico actually said it would be release by November and it wasn't so you not high on credibility. No indication things where off track.  Populous has backing from business consults because, if you take their word as to what they can achieve. This project looks awesome. Problem with cryptocurrency is its completely unregulated so when you start using tokens like a security. You can claim whatever you want without any requirement that you can actually do these things.  So credibility is far more important then with a traditional security. Problem is credibility of these guys is shaky. Most regular securities in this position you wouldn't see a substantial rise in the price when they are late delivering technology. Because of the inherent risk that the technology won't work. I would expect a sizeable haircut to the price if the technology isn't ready and release by the end of the year.  Even if you look at their projections they suggest they will turn over just 3 mil in their first year. Given this A 1.5bil valuation just seems to much.

Now, Populous will merely host the peer to peer market, so you would have to bid against other PPT HODLers to get that contract. Let's say you win the invoice (s) and secure $40,000 investment on a $45,000 invoice(s).  The invoices are roughly 90 days, so you'd make 12.5% in 3 months. You would loan your tokens, which would be used for collateral against a $40,000 loan that was given to the seller of the invoice, and the $45,000 invoice - once paid - would cover the loan, the locked PPT and fiat-based-interest would be then deposited into your account.  I'm assuming there would be an auto repurchasing option, so the fiat would be used to buy more PPT, and lending would resume.

But is the 12.5% ours completely or does PPT take a percentage from that 12.5%?  When you really think about it, 12.5% isn't that much on a 40k loan.  That is only 5k over 3 months or roughly 55$ a day for 90 days.  You could take 5k and invest in other alts for better returns or even bet on BTC. The passive income is great to have but I thought it would be more lucrative.  Maybe it's because the example was too small.  Of course when your talking millions, that's different.

Long term is defined as being over a year I believe. There's no problem just greater incentive to not kill the golden goose. I bring this up because I think most people are unaware. You also get the benefit of further clarification over time.  It's possible that with crypto clarity that capital gains goes down. We are still in a gray area where we are forced to take the conservative approach and do 15% on all tax events. A tax event is defined as any trade. It's possible that the irs clarifies and that won't be necessary though.  This situation is bringing more legitimacy to the cryptos and with that higher valuations.  Overall I believe it's wiser to hold the asset because pump and dump gives you more tax. Also I don't want to hear about populous sellers getting attacked by irs. It's an additional consideration in our decisions.  Finally more people will move into populous space increasing value of the asset that gives you even more ability to deal with the legal issues.

There are very few good passive income platforms available in the space. PPT token value represents the strength and leverage of earning potential without having to liquidate the main asset to obtain a return.

You need to have populous and value based cryptos in your portfolio. The Internet of Things is becoming the norm with apis from Amazon to accept cryptos.

People need to see it in action. We need to see what kind of interest rates we can get and what the risk really is. If the rates are great and risk is low, word will spread and the price will rocket - no promotion needed. Also depends on supply of invoices and overall demand. The market will achieve an equilibrium for probably what a comparable stock would give as a dividend. As much as 30-50x annual earnings potential perhaps, whatever that ends up being. If risk is a bit higher maybe only 15-30x. And this can happen literally over just a few months. Exciting times.  What's also exciting is the prospect for PPP and HVN.

BCH was also a buy rumor sell news scenario. S2X was never intended to go through, it was purely a manipulation move to have BTC go down in value so other could get in, it's been in the works since June/July. So....what is your point?  All coins go through the ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" scenario. Always!! You have already missed the cut in half version at $4.00-$5.00...you missed that a week ago! Do you even realize the value Populous has and what market they are getting into?  What market is BCH getting into besides being a bigger block size? Eventually, BCH will have to scale to a bigger size block, currently it's just a bandaid. Hence why BTC didn't skip a beat...yea it went down, so what, all coins go down. Where it BTC at today right back where has been.  It was time for a correction on BTC, which, in my opinion, was healthy for BTC.  I've been a half a year long bagholder ever since the ICO and will continue to hold.  Populous will outperform BCH percentage wise in the long run.  Your comment...""Doubt 5% of PPT holders will even send in their coins to use the platform."" Oh really...are you delusional? Why are people even in PPT?  Do you even know?  It's called PASSIVE INCOME...oh wait, sorry, BCH doesn't provide that for you.  People are in Populous because they believe in the project and passive income is another advantage to this platform, so before you go rattling your mouth, at least understand the project first.  People are clearly aware that you need to lock up your tokens for 30, 60 or even 90 days! I'm aware of it and intend to take full advantage of the passive income ability and the returns I will make on my money.  Oh and also, do you get to keep your sold BCH forever?  With PPT, you never lose your tokens, EVER!!! They may convert into pokens at some point, but you will always have the PPT you started with.  BCH doesn't provide you that!!  I agree Populous' success depends on millions of ""fiat"" dollars to buy invoices on the platform.  But your also forgetting that institutions want a cheaper way to run their business. Banks charge 30-33% for this service, do you not realize that Populous can do this for a fraction of the cost.  Everyone wins in this scenario.  But your too busy stuck in BCH tunnel vision and can't see the big picture.  The media...lol! You really are brainwashed! Their job is to tell you what they want you to know! You keep watching your news and following the media...while we take part in the greatest wealth transfer in the history of this world.  PPT holders will be millionaires...the price prediction for this coin is $1000-$1500 by next summer..yea its speculation...just like you think BCH will soon be $5000.  BTC will never be overtaken...Hence why it's currently 1.42x more profitable to mine BTC than BCH.  Oh...and don't forget its dominating the crypto space at 52.6%.  Where is BCH....ah down at 10.3%...LMAO!!  Dude get a life and FUCK OFF! ",False

You were asking questions about PPT when it was priced at $5 and people were saying it's a strong buy.

Until I keep digging into these PPT tokens. They are not Stock. They are not Equity. In fact, it seems to me that they are a ""gift"" to investors in the ICO. Populous will hopefully ""reward"" these investors later by assigning a ""value"" to the PPT token that would be satisfactory to initial investors.  Now what does that exactly mean? If the PreSale ICO price was 30 cents, Populous could just assign any value greater than ICO and that would return more than initially invested. Could that be 1 dollar? 3 dollar? 10? Who knows. It is not dependent on the entire market cap of Populous as a whole. I believe Populous will be a phenomenal company. Only problem is the way these PPT tokens exist and the vague mention of them makes one kind of question their value. And also, the way the buyback is worded, it seems Populous just wants to buy them all back so they don;t exist anymore, as to not clutter the platform with too many tokens. Of Course Populous could just come out and say they will value the PPT token at 20x respective poken. Which means if you have a PPT, whatever your respective currency Poken is, you can claim 20x. So 1 PPT = 20 USD Pokens. Or, They could also just say 1PPT = 3 USD Pokens.  See what I am getting at here? The wording in their business plan states they will just assign an arbitrary value to PPT at a later date. The value could be good to those that bought low, and bad to those that bought high.",False

Anyway SemiSeriousInvestor - 5.2 ""The exact value that is unlocked by the PPT will be announced in a future announcement."" to possibly share my take on the PPT white paper section and most likely over-simplify the nature of the concept I have about it...  It seems possible the PPT ""token"" could have a reference value (poken exchange value) assigned to it for serving a function on the platform itself without necessarily translating that same value outside the system. Maybe the PPT could have a small/minor leverage advantage? This is just a guess but it would be possible (it's crypto after all) that pokens converted via PPT have a different translatable value outside the system but an advantage within when utilized for the purpose the platform is created for. Pokens obtained via fiat could potentially have a different conversion value back into PPT so as not to backdoor into PPT cheaper and still honor the equivalent fiat value at purchase. I think it's great that the platform is not closed to only PPT, and this gives me confidence in inherent future value of the token alone. Seriously though - this is just a guess. These guys are way smarter than me.  However, I believe the intent of Populous is to serve a function that mutually benefits both borrower/lender and the intent is for the main revenue to be generated from invoice factoring and not the speculation of the token. The tokens and platform are the mechanism for many little guys to realize the benefits from both directions for the sake of good business. I believe it will serve users even better the larger they can grow their lending ability if they are not whales at the start.  As for your other concern - 5.2.1 Buyback mechanism... The way I take that is the people which envisioned this entire ecosystem have the vision to see the future of this platform. It strikes me that they already believe in it's potential and knew the capital it would take to ensure it's success. Additionally that they see the long term potential - not just a few years. They state upfront a unique business methodology of regaining the golden tickets from the open market (not destroying) which is the exact opposite of share dilution. If the PPT is on the open market nobody will know who is buying - or if that PPT will ever return to the market. I personally don't think the platform will suffer with less individual lenders though - and I bet the invoice factoring will grow steadily. There is probably a price at which I will sell mine - dunno yet - but not now. Without this platform I would never have the access to play in this sandbox. I am very eager to watch it evolve and learn as I do it.  Anyway guys, it was great to see good discussion going on. I hope my contribution is useful in some way.",False

It's been a while since I looked at the whitepaper, so I'm not sure if this is contradictory at all. I'm basing my comments on what the team says now since things may have evolved.  To that point, the more your PPT increases in value, the more Pokens you should be able to buy. So you could buy $1,000 worth of PPT today and if it doubles in price, you'll be able to use the tokens to invest in $2,000 of invoices. This doesn't really answer your question about how PPT tokens derive value, but it's still an important point because it encourages people to hold on to their tokens. Also, the purpose of the buyback program is to reduce the number of tokens in circulation. PPT tokens have an advantage over fiat in the system, so there is real utility. As long as there are invoices to available to invest in, there should be demand for the tokens. Reducing the supply should increase the price per token.  So, it's a combination of the supply of invoices and size of the liquidity pool that should drive value because that's what drives the utility. Now recall my earlier point that PPT value isn't tied to the value of fiat or tokens. Even if you pay twice as much per token as the last person, you're still able to invest at the value you bought in at. For example, let's say Person 1 (P1) buys PPT at $1.00 per token and Person 2 (P2) buys PPT at $2.00 per token. Each owns 1000 tokens. They will both be able to buy $2,000 worth of invoices. P1 is advantaged because he bought in earlier, but it doesn't come at a disadvantage to P2 who is still able to also buy $2,000 worth of invoices (the same amount he invested). It's not a zero sum game, but there are benefits to being an earlier investor.  Again, this only works if there's enough of a supply of invoices, so you have to believe that the team can successfully attract invoice sellers.  I hope that makes sense...",False

FOr instance if Populous declares PPT has conversion value of 5x USD pokens, then what? Anyone that bought PPT below 1.50 is ok, anyone that bought above is screwed. ANd then after Populous declares the value of PPT, the PPT token is basically done. THere is no reason to hold it cause it can't go up more than the declared value. One is better off just holding Bitcoin and then parking it at Populous whenever one wants to earn passive income. Alot of people think PPT is some type of stock or equity and I thought that initially as well. But there is noone PPT ca act like stock the way it is structured. It is better with Populous was a public company and we just bought stock in Populous. Holding PPT seems like a gamble on what Populous will eventually declare the value to be.  One example is the recent FUEL ICO. The team says they will sell the FUEL token on their platform for $1. It is currently trading at 3 cents. You cannot just assign some arbitrary value to a token and expect the market to go along. It has to be backed by something. So everyone that thinks when Populous becomes a Billion dollar company and PPT goes to say 100 might be in for a huge suprise because Populous already came out and declared the value of PPT",False

Again, I'm makng my decision to buy/hold based on what they've said post-ICO. They could decide to change their mind and say the PPT/Poken ratio will be a fixed number, but that would screw over all of their supporters as well as liquidity pool investors.  They don't really have an incentive to screw us though. You made a point earlier that keeping the price low is to their advantage because they can buy tokens back at a lower price, but that's not really true.  First, the entire point of the buyback program is to support/raise the PPT token price by taking 10% of their profits to burn tokens. If they wanted the price to be fixed, spending 10% of their profits to burn tokens is literally a waste of money.  Second, they are spending 10% of their profits regardless. Whether that buys them 1,000 tokens or 1 million tokens is irrelevant because they are getting burned anyway. 10% is 10% regardless of token price.  I acknowledge that the team could buy 100% of outstanding tokens more quickly at a lower price, but I'm willing to take the chance that they don't want to intentionally screw token holders. If their business is successful, which I think it will be, they've got a lot to lose by ruining their reputation.",False

From the discounts issued in the Pre-ICO, there is a total of 41 million PPTs in circulation currently, with a limited supply of 53 million. PPT will also allow access to the Populous platform, serving as an avenue to exchange Pokens and purchase invoices. The exact value that is unlocked by the PPT will be announced in a future announcement.    It states that what a holder of PPT can actually do with a PPT token will be announced at a LATER date. Uh, say what? What exactly does this mean? Does this mean that Populous team can just assign some arbitrary value to PPT token in the future? Does this not concern anyone here? What is to stop Populous team from assigning the value of PPT to be EXACTLY equal to Pre-Sale price?  Also there is the issue of PPT Buyback as stated here:  5.2.1 Buyback mechanism The buyback mechanism serves a few purposes. Firstly, the buyback mechanism acts as an indicator that the platform has generated enough working capital to repurchase the tokens and utilize a portion of the cash and cash equivalent. Upon the buyback, there will be fewer tokens available in circulation, which enables easier transactions with the PPT in the platform as there will be lesser congestion in the network.  -If Populous were to buy back these PPT tokens and Populous will assign the value of a PPT token at a later date, Isn't it in Populous best interest to assign as low of value as possible so it's easier to buy them back?  I find these unanswered questions quite concerning. I believe in Populous and believe that it will be a HIGHLY successful company, however I am very suspect in the value that a PPT token will have.  Basically, market price of PPT token at present could be totally off from what Populous team says later on. Please can someone clarify. Thanks",False

I'll tell you what I know, but I guarantee that it will won't completely answer your questions.  The most recent twitter post from populous features them replying to a comment: ""clif high discussing #PPT overtaking #ETH in value by mid 2018."" Whomever runs the populous twitter responds ""it's scary to know @clif_high knows how we think."" Now if you're like most people you probably want to take that w/ a grain of salt because it's PR people talking. However: even if populous is doomed for success it's not a good idea to hurt the investors after posting how their tokens are going to go up. If your investors can't trust you, why should anyone trust to use the platform? I don't think they're going to run us over like that after we helped them make their company. That's just bad business.  A PPT essentially is stock in the populous company. I find it hard to believe that populous would want to tank the value of their stock on purpose. Populous have done good faith things for their investors that would lead me to believe they don't want to screw us. For instance: xbrl airdrop for token holders. They have delivered on the promises to get this platform going and website. Furthermore I couldn't tell you how many companies have legitly screwed people that just came into existence after populous came out then blew up before today.  Populous doesn't need to scam investors to be successful and in fact they're not nor ever have! They airdrop you tokens for holding the stock/initial token. Additionally: invoice finance is a very profitable business model especially if it can be globalized. They're going to make much more money bringing people together around their model. If they anger investors that would only fuel would-be competitors.",False

Nonpayment will void use of the platform (I would think). People can look at the xbrl data to determine if they believe that the company will pay it back before loaning. A company with more risk will probably net you a higher percentage risk vs reward.  You purchase insurance that lets you at least recoup the majority of your loaned tokens.  I wouldn't loan money to a company unless I see their business model, a history of payment on invoices, and that they are in a regulated country (ie receive punishment for nonpayment).  If it's the company's first time on the platform, I'm probably not going to be willing to loan that much. They have to get our trust. Ripping people off for $50000 doesn't bode well for your business's future, they can face wrath from regulators, and probably fold because you can see on the blockchain records they don't pay their bills. Lawyers will jump at this opportunity to make money prosecuting them.  The cost of losing the whole business isn't worth it. Do I want to keep making money or scam $50,000 and end up in legal troubles, lose access to the platform that saves me money, and destroy my good history I had to get on the platform in the first place? Probably not.  How would you dispute in court that you paid if a public leger that is black and white that people understand more each day says you didn't? That's just easy money for lawyers no matter who you are or where you are. Time for some prison time your $10 million business didn't pay $50000.",False

Since the XBRL airdrop is a bonus reward to PPT holders it is also the discretion of Populous how many XBRL tokens are distributed. There will be conditions and criterias that Populous will have to help them make their decision but keep in mind the XBRL token is a bonus and everyone should be happy to receive something.  Populous could have raised more capital by doing another ICO but instead chose to airdrop the XBRL tokens instead. THIS IS COMMITMENT BEING SHOWN BY POPULOUS TO PPT HOLDERS. I have not yet encountered others that have demonstrated the same commitment to their token holders as Populous have done to date. You are definitely in safe hands when investing in PPT tokens.

I know that EtherDelta is actually linked to a real ETH address etc etc but that's another story, so for the sake of keeping it easy, just take them safely back into your own wallet (for security sake too) and to definitely not miss the airdrop.  They haven't released the date yet but will right before.  It doesn't matter if you moved the tokens around to other addresses etc... it is all based on the snapshot of the whole blockchain they take at any given moment in time. This snapshot will show every PPT out there and the airdrop will be sent to wherever your PPT is at any address the snapshot saw your PPT at. So don't worry - it doesn't have to be at the address you bought the PPT from originally.  It's my understanding that anyone holding any PPT at the time of snapshot will get the free airdrop but don't quote me on that - I may be wrong but I think that is how I read it. In other words, if you missed the pre-ICO but bought some on an exchange then as long as the snapshot is taken sometime after that then you should get the free airdrop.... but again, that's just my understanding of it, correct me if I am wrong.  You don't have to ""do"" anything to get the airdrop except hold the PPT in your wallet. When the airdrop happens then the Populous team will announce it and how to ""see"" them in your wallet (ie: add the token). Easy!",False

Firstly, the buyback mechanism acts as an indicator that the platform has generated enough working capital to repurchase the tokens and utilize a portion of the cash and cash equivalent. Upon the buyback, there will be fewer tokens available in circulation, which enables easier transactions with the PPT in the platform as there will be lesser congestion in the network.  Illustration of the buyback mechanism The buyback mechanism is illustrated with the following simplified example: Imagine there is 10,000 PPT in circulation where you own 100, each valued at 1$, giving market cap of $10,000. Assume that every 100 PPT lets you generate $10 per year for investing in invoices and every year from Y2 onwards, 1000 PPT is bought back and destroyed.

I do agree with the main point though, I'm really tired of hearing every single thread for every single project not listed on Bittrex or Polo or Binance just bitch and bitch about not getting on exchanges with more liquidity.  It typically helps projects get exposure and raise the volume but history shows that it rarely causes the project to explode like everyone expects it to.  Look at when BAT was listed to Bittrex, it was dumped harder than any coin dump I've ever seen!  Then let's look at Monaco being added to Binance, it went from 3$ to 25$ only to normalize at 8$, there is sometimes a FOMO rally but it almost always settles back down to natural values.   That being said, what having bigger exchanges does help with, is when there is big news announced and major milestones that are reached having the exposure to more traders will help the price rise in real time.

So, most PPT holders are holding because we see a genuine product just weeks/months away. Many sh*tcoins on these exchanges are just a bit of fun where traders can trade phantom money in the form of these pointless tokens. It is an industry unto itself and just a bit of fantasy, but good money can be made if you are great at it. Most aren't. But due to the fact people are willing to let these tokens go easy provides liquidity to the exchange so they can hoard them for their own local liquidity needs and thus provide a market for them.  However, some tokens are actually good, as in, they have real promise and the working product is very close. VERI and PPT are two examples. These are in the minority. So, people who got into the ICO's (and people buying now) just won't sell them unless their lives depended on it. So the liquidity is small, and so the exchanges like Bittrex cannot accumulate, and so cannot offer the market.  Simple really.  But take comfort all you PPT (and VERI) holders: if the token you hold falls into this category I have stated above, then you are holding a GOOD token long term. This is a good indication you have backed a winning horse.  You don't want exchanges to let people just ""speculate"" on things as good as PPT, VERI etc... you want to be part of the elite group who hold such tokens and support the companies involved. I don't want day traders gambling with my precious investments!!!! I want sensible, serious and professional progress from these companies and then the value will be reflected in the token price. So I am glad Reggie offers private sales of VERI to big players, and I am glad PPT is quite hard to get hold of in size right now.

The funny thing is that you can actually use the exchange without the website. I believe you can just interact with the smart contract, because that is basically what the website is.  So if you were to write your own interface you could interact with the contract itself, that would be true decentralization.  Who knows maybe in the future they could publish a desktop app to interact with the contract.  I also think that you can run the website locally, by downloading the source code and running it from 127.0.0.1, but I am not sure on this.

Let me know if you agree or if you have conflicting views.  1. [RE: Team = meh] It looks like Steve Nico Williams has a bit of bat rep. There are a couple of sites that say he is not an honest business man and may be a scammer. I don't believe this but hey.. I don't know how to disprove this either. I think the team on the website is not true and that they must have hired a company with NDA to do development and coding for the platform. Would really like confirmation. The excuse or reason for the non-transparency is because of fear that competition will try to rip off their concept and business. It would be nice to know if they have contracted another company for dev. I want to know the number of staff working on the various arms of the Populous Platform business, and milestone updates, even if details are hidden since it isn't an open source project.  2. [RE: Website = meh] It is in the middle of an update but still could use a revamp in terms of visual design and investment into UI/UX is always worth it, as seen by iPhone's success.  3. [RE: Marketing = meh] They apparently contracted with a marketing company. I would like to know the scope of this engagement and what the marketing company's job will be and what we could expect from them.  4. [RE: Communication = meh] Could be better. I would like for a communication manager to be added to the team to constantly engage with and grow a community.  I still think that this company will have a working product quite soon and there is potential of something really good and profitable. It is similar to Bitconnect, but they have a transparent revenue stream unlike the mysterious trading bot for Bitconnect. However, I have so many ""hopes"" for Populous. I hope the website and UI will improve. I hope they become transparent with staff members. I hope their marketing team is worth the money. I hope they keep adding invoice sellers.

Nico even said in an interview that he was not going to patent this idea so there isn't much to keep secret about what they're doing and 2) they don't seem to care if others do the  same. Before they took down the website you could see the team - nothing amazing to be honest. They have one developer who also works in another company doing some programming. I would like for a new startup company who don't even having a product yet to have a dedicated development team and not just one guy who works on Populous while he's not working his normal 9-5 job - that is amateur. Nico himself has a degree in Philosophy so that doesn't add very much credibility. Once the website is up once again you will see for yourself that the team is like a normal bunch of guys and some advisers who don't reference populous on their linkedin pages at all.  The website is also amateurish, look at all the good projects out nowadays and they have state of the art websites, the populous website and alpha were something I could have literally developed myself after 3 months into my computer science degree - they could have easily hired a professional to do this website from the get go like everybody else.  Don't care about the marketing company, we will have to see where that goes and as for the communication - it needs to be improved so much. The last we heard from populous was ""1 billion dollar company"" and hitBTC and boom gone for weeks.  Populous idea is good, but not sure I would invest any money again in hopes it will be successful.  The hate may also start to poor in with the usual crap i.e You're a newbie account, nothing you say is true, FUD - you want to push the price down to buy no (no thanks), you're mad because you didn't get in in the ICO etc etc but whatever haha.  Once the beta is released and I see active invoices and I see quality of this project improve thus improving investor confidence I would buy back into populous but right now uncertainty is a no go. And when investors see ""FUD"" on here they like to shout and scream but why do they act like that?

Nothing really can be protected, if the idea is really good. The ""best"" that could happen is to be the first to patent the idea, and then discover a bunch of others doing the same, and then having to sue all of them in court, spending a fortune in the process where only the lawyers make all the money, and you may ultimately win the case. And before you know it, many years have gone wasted trying to protect the patent.  Steve needs to realize winning the competition means he needs to continue improving the platform, continue to close deals around the world, and continue to provide great services to the customers (i.e. the business owners that sell their invoices and the investors that buy the invoices).  Ultimately the one that will really beat the competition is the brand and the impression it conveys (not patent).  Steve should go full force and destroy the competition by 1) having a commercially-workable invoice trading platform, 2) close deals throughout the world (but starting in the UK first to make his mark), and 3) provide great service support to all the users of the invoice trading platform. His only challenges is to do a very good job in all the 3 things above. If he succeed, then competition would be nothing. Otherwise, nothing matters.

No you don't get it, Etherdelta offered a decentralized trustless exchange, and that means personal responsibility.  In HitBTC there is a middleman, which means there is counterparty risk (exchange hack, DDOS, owners running away, who knows?)   A decentralized trustless setup is more secure, and people have to be responsible. I am really sorry for your loss, but this is really like a learning experience for people to be more careful.  I myself have also lost like about 0.7-1BTC in the past since I sent stuff to the wrong address. I just learned to be careful. I don't need a bank or middleman to process that transaction for me.  It's the convenience vs sovereignty argument, which one is more important for people?      Has no basic phishing protection   Of course they do, they have HTTPS certificate, signed by a CA.  Most scammers don't have HTTPS certificate, how should they know ahead that scammers will buy HTTPS certificate.  Actually how the fuck did those scammers get a HTTPS certificate in he first place, doesn't these CA's scan for similar links and not let people use similar looking links? I dont understand how this works but isn't the CA liable too which gave out the certificate to the scammers?

PPT tries to tap into the invoice market which is trillions of $ worth.  If we only get 10% of it, which is a severe underestimation i think that would mean a market cap of 100,000,000,000$  Currently the market cap is 164,289,132  meaning that we have a potential ROI of x609  If we buy like 1000$ which is really something somebody can afford to lose for such huge gains.

The whole blog article situation was triggered off after we realised an error in how the article bounty was presented. Article bounties should have been in the same payment structure as whitepaper translations and the main thread translation. We only noticed this after the bounty program was coming to an end, we had not finished counting of how many articles we received in when those who wrote articles starting suggesting they were the only ones who had participated and were in titled to the whole bounty allocated.  When then realised what was going on and moved fast to correct the error. Now I must admit that there is some blame on our part for not acting fast enough sooner as we introduced the article bounty last of and at last moment, we then decided to correct the issue further by handing up to 1000 - 2000 PPT for article bounties which we thought right. instead of handing out article bounties which should have been starting around 60 PPT per article. After all, translators did a lot more work but received far less. Everyone agreed to the new fee structure and have been paid since.  We initially decided to award everyone for their effort in the Populous bounty scheme regardless of how good or bad their articles were but then decided to review all articles subject to our initial criteria, we did this because we saw the greed in those whose copied and pasted content directly from our website and were demanding bounties. If we handled the article bounties bad that is our fault but to suggest we are scammers is totally without fact. We have archived messages from article bounty participants who have since been paid but still continue to spread FUD, those know themselves and we will soon publish private conversations between ourselves and them. This communications includes wallet address and proves they have received PPT.",False

POP introduced already into there Alpha-Software a feature called group-bidding where you can invest with a group of investors in a single invoice with small number of PPTs. Do this on 20-50 group-biddings and you have minimized your risk, if one borrower can not pay you loose only a fraction of your invest and the other 99% invoives which pay-back plus interest will pay back what you lost.  But there also other precautions you can take (together with that what POP will provide on top) :  Take 1) Borrower which is well known on the platform to pay back in time 2) Borrower which has good reputation 3) not a new Borrower 4) Borrower from a ""good"" industrie(Pharma-Industrie is better than as Nigthclub,  a little craftsman business is better than a newly opened webdesign office, etc ,etc 5) A invoice with > 25% interest  is also not a good sign...

One of which is attitude problem in tackling the challenges that hamper its success. The right attitude is everything. That's why I bring up the question on the formal education that Steve received. Because from my observation, people with high education level have completely different attitude and personality vs those that don't. And when the attitude and personality is not right, that puts an undesirable challenge to any success. Someone mentioned Jahigrant giving the face palm, for example, and to me that is highly unprofessional treatment to a person that contributes to the project. A sign of disrespect. The attitude problem determines how well the team will handle challenges going their way. And how well they handle the challenges determines the level of success (or failure) that Populous will be heading to. You get me?  Edit: The most desirable attitude I would love to see is the team responding positively to comments and feedback like, ""Yes, thank you for pointing out the mistakes/errors. We will correct them within 24 hours."" And thereafter I see the mistakes/errors get corrected.  No, it won't work if they say ""Yes, thank you for pointing out the mistakes/errors. We will correct them within 24 hours."" but the mistakes/errors still linger for days if not weeks.  It is still acceptable if they say, ""Yes, thank you for pointing out the mistakes/errors. But we are currently doing a revamp of it and it will take some days to get thing right."" Instead, they act like a bunch of mute guys, keep quiet about it, and let people wonder what the fuck is the problem. And they only explain things with face palm and insulting/undermining statements (as if the team is so smart and everyone else is stupid, considering their level of education in comparison for a start) when people start making noises and complaining.  Attitude problem? I say yes.  Edit: The team should have tested the version themselves and solve the silly glitches first before releasing it. Then we would be discussing more on how to improve the features or make it even better instead of lots of reporting on the glitches and less on how to improve it. The glitches should be solved before the release. Yes, there will still be some glitches but persistent login glitch is a BIG problem that shouldn't even be there.  By right we should be talking more about how to improve the features, not reporting the glitches. But because the glitches is too plentiful (I can't even login after many tries), I believe many of us can't even make any suggestion to improve any feature available. Yeah, I don't want to keep complaining. I want to make good suggestions on how to improve the platform better. But how the fuck can I do that if I can't even login? And assuming if I can, but keep facing different glitches here and there, then how will I be able to make any suggestions? I would have to keep reporting the glitches. Do you get me?",False

Are you telling me your team never test the Alpha out before releasing it for public testing?  Come on, man. Give me a break.  Just because it is an Alpha does not mean it is okay to have lots of defects.  Edit: It's not Populous' fault that Clif High made a wrong statement. It's Populous' fault that the Alpha version has so many errors that by right should never be there in the first place. The fact that users cannot even login successfully indicates the team never test the version out themselves. If so, that lead me to wonder if the team really cares about what they are doing.  Imagine a house in Alpha state, in the process of construction. Then you invite a public tour inside the house. But the door is not even there. So the public cannot even get into the house!

Ethereum cannot be brought down, it can lose popularity. But as long is it's mined, and facilitates tokens, the network will probably grow. 2. You can convert your pokens to any digital commodity you like, be it dollars, yen, btc or more PPT at it's current market value. After the contract ends. 3. Don't invest based on rumors. Follow the project on twitter to stay updated on any new information.  Also 2 other startups are building an invoice financing system using tokens on the blockchain.

Grow up.  If you thought you would get rich in 72 hours because you bought into an ICO then you are now getting your learning curve. If you want to make instant money, bet on the horses instead.  If you can see past the end of this year, or even the end of your nose, you will be able to see an upward move in the price of QUALITY tokens like PPT. Yes there are many crap coins out there from ""companies"" who have no product. Populous is NOT that. Nor is VERI.  Sorry, but you won't be millionaires by Christmas 2017. Now it's time to go back to your day job.  However, if you have invested enough money and bought enough PPT at these low prices and are willing to let the company tweak the alpha, roll out the beta and then go live over the coming months then you should make nice passive income by invoice factoring when the time comes. Then you can think about how you can quit, or cut down, that day job.  Then if the PPT itself is worth multiples of today's price, which I believe it will be, you can make a decision whether you want to hold for passive income or sell them for profit. Hint: long term, passive income is worth more to your quality of life.  If you really thought you were gonna flip the PPT so soon after an ICO then you know what? Actually go ahead and do that BECAUSE you are still in nice profits from the ICO, right? So go sell them at $4 on ED and take your winnings - a nice profit really when you think about it.  But if you have any common sense and investment skill then you will know what to do. Four letters beginning with ""H"".  Also, a traditional IPO on the stock market would take loads of time to make even the small ICO returns and would take years and years to hit the kind of returns you are moaning about not having yet. This isn't a computer game; realise that. This is real money, real wealth, real opportunity and will come with the real disappointments for some and the real dreams being made for others. Did you think you could just click a mouse on myetherwallet, send a few ETH to some ICO and a month later be buying that big house you always wanted? Wake up, grow up. The dreams will come.... LATER... but I really doubt many on here have the stomach to just sit and wait for realistic progress and organic asset growth.

Long term PPT will hit multiples of current price AND it will hold those levels, not just pop. Those levels are required as the business builds up with the platform over time. You probably will see triple digits $ on the PPT price one day, so anything down around these prices are, in the long term, an absolute steal.  Of course, the higher price goes the more we can all make in the utility of the token (invoice factoring) rather than selling them. Who wants to sell a perpetual-passive-income-generating token anyway...??!  Right now it is silly little games in the market and means nothing... and there are lots of people invested who are way too emotional and way too inexperienced so they are watching every little move and getting happy on every little jump up and getting cynical on every little push down. This is the hallmark of a market noob. People were no doubt doing the same when BTC was $10 LOL!! Just hold tight and do not sell if you want to generate passive income months and years from now (as well as the ability to sell one day years down the line for MASSIVE gains - and I ain't talking 10x here... I'm talking BTC from $10 to ""today"" kinda returns).  Of course, I have to say this is all valid IF the company succeed with these plans and frankly, I think they will.

(Smartcontract & Standard-Wallet has the advantage if Populous is down, the smartcontract will be valid for ever, also the PPT is protected by the standard wallet on the crypto chain) - imho   Also I could find that PPT as promised by Populous will be used to buy Poken/Invoices, I could not find a hint that Fiat or other Crypto can be used for that    Not a joke but this combination of functionality is the first time ever in the world (welcome at fintech) a company did this, this is groundbreaking and totaly new.

Its not important anymore for me if price will react in August or September because in December PPT will be anyway at 0.5 to 1.5Ether. Why so high ? Because most PPT will be on the trading platform(earning money), investors who want to buy PPT (attract by the high passive income) will fight for the leftover PPT which are on EtherDelta or other Cryptomarkets to find, driving price into the stratossphere.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFlGdiMXiiU https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2BQpljuWHY",False

The wallet page will be released shortly, this will basically be the way to send PPT to Populous and view PPT collateral positions. -populous tweet 7/26/17  BTC Consultant said Steve responded to him on slack saying everything is explained in the tweets regarding the use of PPT...Well, I've reviewed the tweets and yes they do reference articles such as ""secret sauce"" etc which explains a lot but not the specifics...  I read the tweet shown above that mentions the new wallet page coming soon and we can see there the ""PPT collateral positions""....that means to me that PPT tokens will be used to collateralize the purchase of invoices (loan). So, here's my thoughts on the meaning...I'm guessing that the FIAT buyers enter the platform as an example and bids on say a 1M invoice for 30 days...In order for the FIAT investor to complete the buy, there must be 1M worth of PPT(pokens) put up by us PPT holders in order to complete (collateralize) the purchase. Without us (PPT), no purchase. So, whatever the price of PPT is at that time and that can be set by Populous within the platform in order to meet demand....Once there are 1M in PPT (either pool of smalls or large PPT holders)and 1M in investor $ the purchase is complete. So, essentially both PPT holders and FIAT imvestor are buying the invoice but without the PPT (collateral) it doesn't happen and thus the NEED for PPT as Clif says...  After 30 days the FIAT holder makes his return (.5% or whatever) and PPT holders get their PPT back plus 4% (or whatever) profit and then we do it all over again.  Obviously still guessing but this would make sense as to how it could work.

BTC Biz Consult though got a response from Clif saying that PPT is absolutely essential to entering the platform and utilizing the invoice purchasing through Populous.  I also referenced the Clif/Steve video where Steve is so sure about the demand/price of PPT to rise in the future....etc..  So, I was thinking about these things and the following started making sense to me why PPT is needed....(just my thoughts)  Steve (populous) has and outstanding supply of about 16M PPT tokens I believe and not sure what they are designated for in the future but...  Steve said in his interview with Clif that it is so important to use the high market capitalization to back the margin invoice trading done by PPT holders.  Well, here's the 2 options and it makes sense to me but what say you....  Option #1 - Allow both PPT holders and Fiat holders to buy invoices on their own essentially competing with each other for invoices.  As an example for every say, 1M in fiat holder invoices purchased, the Populous company would make 1% as a fee as the example they gave us.  So, they would make a whopping $10,000 from that fiat purchase.  That's peanuts.  Also, the demand for PPT might go up slightly because PPT holders can make money as well buying invoices but if PPT wasn't necessary the price might rise to $20+ per PPT in the end.  Overall, Steve's PPT outstanding PPT would be worth 16M X $20 so $320M as an example and they would make and additional 1% on total invoices.... Market Cap for Populous would be $1B (53M tokens X $20)  the real money comes into play below for Populous in my opinion....  Option #2 - Allow fiat and PPT holders to invest, maybe PPT holders are renting coins who knows exactly how it works etc...but if PPT is required to purchase the invoices (as Clif said) then the demand for PPT would skyrocket as the PPT holders and their PPT are NEEDED by the FIAT buyers and there is LIMITED supply and lower supply with the Buyback.  As an example, If the crypto invoice market is .5% of the total invoice market of 3 Trillion dollars so 15B and Populous gets 80% of it as an example then that's 12B....If there are say 30M PPT available to use on the platform then the dollar amount per PPT must be $400 per PPT to equal the demand.    What does this mean for Populous if #2 is the case....?  Sure they still make 1% of the invoices as a fee but what is 16M PPT that Steve has times $400. *6.4 Billion dollars!! And the total Market Cap for Populous would be approx. $21.2 Billion. ($53M Tokens X $400)  So, do I think it would be a better idea to allow all fiat to buy on their own and not need PPT to enter the program.....Hell no!  320M vs 6.4B for Steve and a market Cap of 1B vs 21B. I think the ""smart guy"" Steve goes with option 2.  Just my 2 cents and the numbers I used were just possible examples only.  Populous stands to make an unbelievable amount of money and so do all the holders of PPT  that Steve ""wants to reward"" as he said in the interview.  I would love to hear your thoughts....Way off base? Makes sense?  Obviously been thinking probably way to much on this but it's exciting and hopefully pans out like this.  Smitty",False

So if only PPT can be used for buying invoices, then the price will certainly skyrocket like no tomorrow, and create unwarranted extreme volatility.  I think buying PPT for the invoices over fiat is better in a sense that profits from invoice investing will be partially distributed to PPT holders as an addition to investment profits.

For the record I'm heavily invested in PPT and want it to succeed. If you listen to Cliff/Steve video and start at 55 min and listen for 6 min, Steve only talks about PPT holders doing the invoice buying and the fiat pool used at a financial backup support to cover the PPT holders' invoices they are buying. He said he expects demand for PPT to go way up due to the buyback and for the demand to do invoice factoring. The white paper does say though if u put 1 fiat in you get 1 poken in the platform. We are definitely missing something....do PPT holders get first rights to the invoices before fiat buyers are needed, are fiat buyers only participating in the ""buy"" of invoices by being the pool of funds backing up PPT holders and making a small return (.5% monthly i.e.) while PPT holders make the 4% like the example they've given us? Both of those scenarios would indeed increase demand and the cost per token. But, if u can simply buy invoices with fiat just like PPT holders then it's different. If that's the case, then are there enough invoices for all of us (PPT holders and fiat) to go around?  I don't know...

I re-read the whitepaper again. It mentions a smart contract that will hold your PPT and convert to pokens to buy a contract. The PPT is released back to you when invoice is paid, and you will get your profit in pokens.  But it stands to reason that if you have pokens already you can buy invoices without having any PPT. And since you can sell your pokens for fiat, I'm sure you can buy pokens with fiat. Thus I conclude there is no NECESSITY or benefit to have/hold/use PPT.  So when Clif says, ""The fiat pools are misunderstood in how they work,"" I agree. Someone please explain how they work.    Please explain the leverage. If a PPT is worth $10 and 1000 PPT lets me purchase a $10k invoice, there is no leverage.",False

It makes 35% of profit for banks in generel Populous will break with there business-modell the dominance of banks in invoice sector!!!        They are the first ones.

The platform is userfriendly and build also for noobs not coming out of crypto world. Pegged Token -> POKEN will be used to do sale and buying its a opposite Crypto-Currency build to be stable and not having value fluctuaction. It can be used outside of Populous where a stable payment token is needed.(do not trade it for gains it will not move...) (Worldwide Market)Populous can be used anywhere in the world.

Most ICO issuers put a disclaimer out there that US persons are not allowed to participate, but I think they are allowed to buy second hand in exchanges.  From what I've heard it looks like on that front it's ok, unless some US citizens have participated in the ICO using VPN or whatever.  But there is also an aspect that the guys above have said. The invoice stuff.  If it will involve USD and other cash invoices then the regulatory might will come down on this. They will need all sorts of licenses for that. If it will involve only cryptocurrency based invoices, then who knows what kind of tax liability or other could still apply  So it's still a gray area from a regulatory standpoint.

That might be easier for me than some since I sold for what I bought at.  Anyway...  Social media icons on their page: Facebook - No link Twitter - No update on Twitter since the 15th when supposedly a whale was selling. Reddit - No link Telegram - ""There is no account with that name"" Slack - locked down, no user input Instagram - No link GitHub - Project has not been updated since Apr 21st  Steve William's Twitter - No new news since Jun 27th. https://twitter.com/iamstevenico/with_replies  Apparently they had to change the contract address for the tokens after the ICO because the escrow company changed it?  Sounds odd.  Maybe that happens and I don't know it, but it makes me wonder.  There are bounty complaints on this forum. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2014751.0  What has been posted about all this since the drama occurred?  All I see are a few ""fake Amazon review"" style recommendations of the token. https://steemit.com/ico/@awakend/populous-token  Who is Stephen Williams?  What has he done before?  What do we know of any accomplishments?  Why haven't we heard from him since the debacle?  How do we know that he is going to actually create Populous or that he even has the skills to?  Is his team really as small as what is on the website?  How could they pull this off?  Are they hiring?  No news to answer this valid concern.  And the warning video by ""Silver is the Antidote"" sounded sincere.  Many are blaming him for killing PPT but he explained in his video that he did most of what he is vilified for doing.  And that is that he did a lot of work helping people in relation to PPT and he asked for a very large bounty.  Call that what you will but he fully admitted that.  So either he's honest, or he's a good liar and a very bad crook.  And during that video he talked about how he was in the Slack channel and Williams comes in desperate trying to get a buyer for a huge amount of PPT being dropped by a whale.  If true, why did Williams know the whale?  Were they some sort of necessary investor?   That said, he did delete all his YouTube videos and his Twitter.  So maybe he is a crook, who knows.  But what did he stand to gain?  What was his motive in dropping the price?  To purchase low?  Revenge?  Seams flimsy. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClAAuvHzeMTFrOuk2ftMBNw  That said, populous is a great idea.  If it goes through then this token will make the hodlers very wealthy.  I'm not trying to scare people out, I still have 12% of my small portfolio in PPT.  I just think that concern is more than valid.   Edit:  Now their Indeed.com profiles are gone too.  You can still see William's picture but the other three have removed their pictures and none of them are accessible.  I'm lowering my stake more.  If PPT turns out to be a success I'm going to cry like a little b**** but man, shadiness is in full effect.",False

You already delivered the answer, if that is true, he was looking for a big investor to buy the big position (he did not have but another big whale who want to sell). This a very professinal doing of a CEO, instead customer dumbs all PPT to EtherDelta, he help to find another big Investor who want to buy, and of course this deal would not go over EtherDelta or other Exchange it would be a over the counter deal in which two party exchange PPT and Dollars. So anything good with that, this was simply what a good CEO would taken care off like in this case.  And if I was beeing the CEO I had also possible closed the Slack-Channel there came in so mucht FUD and SCAM, which could negativ influence a company in the build up.

Now with the experience gained by the Populous team, anyone trying to pull off the same stunt as silvertheantidote will be disappointed from the very start. A lot of Youtubers publish themselves and ""volunteering"" some help is just thinking ""what's in it for me?"" all the time. Mike B appears to be helping the team now. I do not suspect he will continue. I suspect he will make an excuse that he is staying off the drama/conflict. I don't think it's really because of the drama as we all know it is being gradually resolved satisfactorily, but because he is doing it for free. We will see if what I say here is true.

The invoices are secured with 3 things; credit insurance, director's guarantee, and company debenture.  That can be interpreted as listing only invoices that are top credit quality, like investment-grade stuff. And in case of default, there is an extremely high chance of recovery. Participation as investors of the invoices will entail very low investment risk.  Edit: In case you think (you may be a business owner) there will be shady invoices getting listed for investors to participate, and then incur default/NPL and the investors suffer losses, nope. The invoices to be listed will naturally be top quality stuff mainly because it is secured with insurance, director's guarantee, and debenture. So in case you are a business owner and you think you have a platform to unload all your toxic non-performing invoices to gullible investors, you may be dead wrong.",False

Some greedy guy looking to extort the team with his youtube influence just because he thinks he made a video that made a world of difference to Populous. Very typical of human nature, I say. By extorting the Populous team, this guy is literally crushing his own reputation.  Edit: Additionally I also watched a video about this OX fina ICO. The white paper isn't comprehensive, and rather very vague about its product/service offered and any associated economic values involved. And it appears to do what Veritaseum and Populous can do. I am not touching this OX.  Edit: A lot of ICOs ongoing and a lot more upcoming; I just want to give some cheap advice to all that just because we can buy some ICO doesn't mean we should buy without much question. The potential of any ICO depends on the project's economic values, realistically, above everything else. Veritaseum, Populous (and Rialto.ai that I bought into) fits this basic initial criteria. The first has $1.6+ quadrillion total potential. The second has $70+ trillion total potential. The third has ~$500 billion growing potential. If you buy some ICO just because it has some huge social values, that may not going to be profitable to you because the project needs to make big money too. And the related token must be directly linked to the profit potential. If an ICO has little to no economic value (or even fake, made-up value), then your participation may turn into a money-losing experience, regardless of how big is the project's social value.",False

Link above  Populous Tokens (PPT) Go Missing From CryptDAO Exchange yesterday thedesignflaw25 in cryptocurrency Dubbed ""the next Veriteseum"",  Populous (PPT) is an Ethereum-based smart contract invoice and trade finance platform token that has had so many trying to get their hands on it, it never made it out of the pre-ICO phase. In fact the original scheduled ICO date is still days away from this writing. But surprisingly, on July 10, cryptocurrency exchange CryptDAO tweeted that by the next day PPT would be de-listed. An odd move, to put it mildly, that has some scratching their heads and others wondering where their PPT tokens are.  Not surprisingly, however, the first tweeted question was a simple, ""Why?""  The answer: ""4 PPT made confused"".  As you might imagine the responses after that showed some legitimate concern.  As days passed, Twitter followers hammered this post, desperately prodding for information as to the whereabouts of their missing tokens. Unfortunately they have, as of July 14th, not received a response from CryptDAO. The twitter post is littered with calls of ""scam.""  One fed up victim, Eric Kittell, has even gone so far as to tweet out a link to report the exchange for fraud.   Unfortunately, without any further explanations, tweets, or the refund of BTC/PPT, there is plenty of oxygen in the room for damning theories to bloom. After all, it is rather interesting that such a sought after crypto would be the one that gets de-listed and disappears from user wallets. To add more fuel to that theory, major blocks of PPT were dumped for a low price on EtherDelta recently.  Just another lesson that cryptocurrencies are still very much in the Wild West phase... Keep your head on a swivel and only buy what you can afford to lose.

Just watched a video on PPT, and got the gist of the PPT poken deal. PPT will be very expensive by year 3 because of the compounding effect. If holders allow their pokens to roll over, with out converting them into Fiat. Depending on the PPT price, say 3k PPT at $30 could have a poken value of 180k. That will force the $30 value up on those tokens. Most investors will for go cashing out the monthly income to achieve an compounding economy of scale. 3k PPT @ $30 =90k 50% income rolled over 3 years 180k.  That will force the $30 token price way up, for more than one reason.  Would you sell a token making you 90k a year for 1 to 1 value? Hell no maybe 4x the yearly net, most likely more than that because its almost 100% passive and almost guaranteed. Nobody sells a magic money machine.

It was the last bounty that was setup and writers were meant to be paid per article. After all the work for one article should not be more than the translation of the whitepaper or the thread due to the length of work done. Furthermore most of the articles were not original content but I decide out of kindness not to reject them.  I awarded all article writers because I believe everyone played apart in the project and this is how I am rewarded. Branding me a scammer because I have a twin brother and questioning my credibility is something else. Now that we have settled the issue in our Slack.  I will offer the rest of the article writers 1000 PPT but those who wrote non original content will now be removed from the list for trying to bully PPT out of me.

If bloggers like you can earn the same (or more) ppt as the contributors thru the bounty program, then this would not be fair to all, except you. If copycat bloggers like you can earn similarly thru the bounty program alone, then I would have lost trust in the management. Then you try to defame the CEO. I say, you are a scum. And a person like you should be made known to every other upcoming ICOs so they may stay away from including you into their bounty program.  Edit: I have yet to read anyone's blog (except for one that is totally unrelated to Populous), but if it was up to me, I would pay such blogger ZERO if his/her blog is found to be copycat and/or unrelated to Populous. For a blogger to post something not original and/or unrelated to Populous and expect/demand to be paid a bagful of PPT, is itself a scam to cheat the team of its token. And if anyone wants to bring this up, I would (assuming I were in charge of my ICO and face the same troublesome bounty hunter blogger) publicly reveal all information about this blogger and his/her shitty + fake blog and stand resolute against such blogger scam.",False

Mistake happens. Veritaseum got criticized too for not paying enough some twitter (not even a blogger). The fact is, a lot of people expect to be paid exorbitantly for as little work done as possible. I think, it may be better for any ICO in the future to state the bounty reward in $ dollar term so that token needed to for the reward will be based on that dollar value. This I think will be very helpful because: 1. If the token price appreciates, then far less token will be needed for the bounty program, and 2.

Honestly theyre offering an awesome much needed unique product to the marketplace rather than other ico's creating credit/debit cards like tenx. I'm not knocking tenx, infact I think its awesome what they did, but its only a matter of time before someone else recreates the wheel...again.. but improves it even further.",False

Populous is in the factoring business and Pokens are used as the flow of funds within the platform. So PPT holders will benefit from the fees and services that the platform receives. The platform charges a basic fees for administering the whole auction/crowd-funding process. Additional fees from the cashing of third party Poken holders.  Because of the structure of the business we cannot give dividends but will buy back PPT from exchanges which will decrease the overall number of PPT in circulation and increase the value of PPT at the same time. The PPT brought back will be destroyed, we will use the profit from the platform to achieve this.  Yes we will aim to list both PPT and Pokens on all major crypto exchanges.

Populous works in a similar way. Basically it is not possible to identify real-world identities of Poken holders via the internal or external wallet. The legal contract containing all parties to a successful invoice sale are hashed to the auction/crowdfunded smart contract and stored via IPFS.  Only the investor and invoice seller have access to the actual physical legal contract. It would be more like looking for a needle in a haystack if you were to try and piece together the identity of a borrower from a Poken trade without knowing or being apart of that trade. Plus you will still not be able to access the legal contract containing parties of the invoice sale. Secondly external wallet addresses are created by users themselves so we have no why of really knowing who owns an ETH address.  But if a user wants to cash out of his/her Pokens via Populous then identification is required at this point our KYC and AML policy come into place. Only transaction history of the flow of funds from the auction/crowdfund contracts is public. We built our system in a way that if an investor wants to remain anonymous through the auction/crowdfunding then that is possible, so long has they original enter the platform in an anonymous way i.e deposit funds via bitcoin or Ether.

What are the sources of profit for the PPT holders? Is it transaction fees for secondary trades, or do they make money in the primary market by assuming risk?

Are there details available on how profits will be shared? e.g. paid out in ETH every month or something along those lines. 3. I still don't fully understand the utility of doing this on a public blockchain.

Not from trading of     investors funds collected from the ICO.      b) There will be an 0.5% charge to external users who wish to exchange Pokens for fiat currencies via Populous.     We will by no means use funds invested from the ICO to trade invoices internally.  2. Profits are returned to investors in a way of repurchasing tokens and burning them, overall reducing the number of outstanding tokens in     circulation. At some later date we will introduce other methods of distribution of profit for token holders.  3. The benefits of doing on the blockchain are:      a) Cost- Overall reduction in cost associated with invoice finance and passing that on to both borrowers and investors.      b) Efficiency - The whole process is automated to an extent i.e our smart contract auction/crowd-funding process. Which impacts the speeding up     and processing of payments.      c) Barriers to entry  - Using the blockchain allows for example: An investor from India with bitcoin or ether to trade invoices with        someone from Denmark. This also allows investor to keep their anonymity which is one of the fundamental reason of building the platform on        the blockchain.     d) It is the choice of the Poken holder where they want to exchange their Pokens for fiat or any other crypto currency. The can do it with Populous        or use any exchange of their choosing. We are not an exchange or try to be.        We are not an exchange but an invoice platform but we are obliged to offer a service for borrowers and investors to convert Pokens back to       fiat in their local currency.      e) Transparency - Some investors or borrowers may want to prove actual events occurred.          f) Duplicate invoicing fraud. By maintaining public ledger of asset transactions, this enables others in the industry not to refinance invoices that have currently being financed on the Populous platform     4. In the near future we see Pokens being used for other various eCommerce and financial use cases and not just invoice trading. Currently at the     moment I see a major use case for pegged tokens as an crypto token that offsets the volatility associated with other non pegged crypto tokens    hence why we are able to create an invoice finance market place on the blockchain, but this can be extended to other types of short term property    financing deals.",False

The two primary sources of income will be -  A. Commission charged to borrowers and lenders on the platform B.

This will range from 1.5% for a blue chip company who has a clear history of paying it suppliers, right down to 3%. There will also be an additional charge of 0.5% levied on investors who successfully win bids on invoices.  We will return all profit to PPT holders. If circumstances change that require us to retain funds for operational expense then we will inform PPT holders before hand.  No ICO funds will be used for buybacks.

Two things are however to be clarified:  - PPT holders have no guarantee that business profits will be solely used to buy PPT coins back. You could envisage issuing a share certificate of the underlying company for all PPT holders and leave yourself the possibility of buying back those shares/PPT. Other solution, consider PPT holders as convertible bond holders with a detailed schedule of repayments and interest paid.  - The price of buybacks transactions.

So Pokens are not the same as ICO tokens. ICO tokens are called Populous Platform Tokens 'PPT'. Pokens are the flow of funds within the Populous Platform and are issued only to investors on the Platform who wish to trade invoices.  1) Investors will get PPT in exchange for their investment. 2)Poken prices will always be the same as their fiat currency equivalent. Populous Platform Token 'PPT' on the other hand will over time increase in value.  3) Borrowers or invoice sellers sell their invoices at a discount depending on the risk credit rating calculated. So an invoice may be worth $1000 and the borrower may sell it for 10% less of it's value which is $900. This will rewarded the investor(s) with a profit of $100.  4) If the borrower/invoice seller sells his invoices through Populous, they will receive Pokens from the sale which they can send to us and we will transfer them fiat currency equivalent or they can keep the Pokens and do what they want with them. The invoice seller can transfer Pokens outside the platform to his/her wallet or sell even sell on other exchanges. Pokens are worth the same as the fiat currency the inovice was sold in.  ",False

This could be anything from 2% up to 10%. The reason being for the change in percentage for each invoice seller invoices would depend on the borrower/invoice sellers customer who they issued the invoice to. In some cases the invoice sellers customer may be an higher risk than others, therefore the higher the cost to finance the invoice. Invoices sold generally at lower than market rate by the borrower is because the borrower does not want to wait 30 - 90 days to before their customer actually pays the invoice. So this way the investor buys the invoice at a discount.",False

Which is often known as a debenture registered a against the invoice sellers company. 3) Directors personal guarantee.  By taking out  an credit insurance the insurance company basically says they will cover the value of the invoice if the invoice sellers customer does not pay. A debenture will allow the assets of the invoice sellers company to be legal taken to settle the debt should the invoice not be paid. Directors personal guarantee would allow recovery of the debt in a worst case scenario by selling property of the invoice seller, such as his or her house.  These are used as recovery options and which are installed in the process of risk management of the invoice sale. Prior to that we carry our a full check on both the invoice seller and their customer in order to not get to the stage in which there would be a default.

It is a global invoice trading platform built on Blockchain's distributed ledger technology.  Invoice discounting is a form of funding that instantly unlocks the cash tied up in outstanding sales invoices. Business owners allow invoice buyers to buy invoices at a discounted rate in order to unlock their cash quicker. Once invoices are paid by the invoice debtor, the invoice buyer receives the amount previously agreed upon.  Populous uniquely connects business owners with invoice buyers on a global scale by leveraging the security, transparency, and speed of Blockchain via XBRL data, Altman Z-score formula, smart contracts and stable fiat-pegged tokens. We will disrupt the traditional invoice discounting system by eliminating the need for third parties or financial institutions by connecting businesses with global invoice buyers directly.   For Business  Sell invoices and get instant cash flow.  We provide a secure, transparent and modern solution for businesses to get immediate funding from invoices waiting to be settled by their customers. In other words, if you rely on credit to sell your products or services, invoice financing will provide you with faster payments, helping you to maintain and expand your business.
