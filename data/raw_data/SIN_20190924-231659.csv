Each user will be able to exchange fiat to SIN, SIN to CRYPTO, CRYPTO to SIN, SIN to fiat with no fees using the Sint Platform. This unique functionality will make it a desirable trading tool among both large market participants and small players. The platform guarantees speed, scalability and security of processed transactions thanks to its proven and extremely stable foundation in the form of the Ethereum network on which the token will be based. As the perfect tool for making profits of arbitrage, it will be an irreplaceable intermediary currency for transferring money between exchanges. All traders will additionally benefit from listing the SIN token on as many cryptocurrency exchanges as possible. The only way to distribute SIN is an ICO, during which 82% of all tokens will be distributed.  The SIN token is not subject to inflation. Conversely, the virtual currency is deflationary, because the number of coins in circulation is predetermined and will be defined in our Smart Contract. Sin transactions are anonymous – when you pay for the exchange service on our platform you make a regular transfer like in the case of any other cryptocurrency. Fees for sending Sin between different wallets are symbolic – you pay the so-called miners, who make their connections available so that the virtual coin can be sent to the recipient. In practice, this is only a few cents – less than in the case of a traditional wire transfer. The fee may not be charged at all but paying the fee will give you credibility and speed up the transfer. Transactions are carried out in real time, almost immediately – no matter where you are sending your funds. You do not have to use any intermediaries – Sin transfers are free from expensive and usually unfavourable currency conversions. Each payment is guaranteed by an entry in blockchain algorithm, so you avoid the risk of losing money. Your account cannot be blocked, thanks to the peer-to-peer network. Only you are involved in the transaction. The system is very secure – it has been proven that it is practically impossible to break into your wallet if, of course, you follow the standard security rules. Sin is the simplest way to become an investor – you are the master of your finances.  You can read about the command on the site, in the team section.",False

Two-factor authentication requires an additional component, which makes accessing your account very difficult for third parties.

Each time you enter your Sint password, a window pops up, and you have to enter the code generated by the Google application.

Arbitrage transactions comprise the purchase of goods, securities or other instruments, such as cryptocurrencies in one market while simultaneously selling the purchased goods / securities / other instruments in the same amount in another market where its price is higher. The trick to making arbitrage work is simply to notice the price difference of an instrument in two different markets. If the price difference is higher than the transaction costs resulting from the opening and closing positions on both markets, the investor achieves a risk-free return. This is because the assets are bought at a lower price on one market and then sold at a higher price on another market, which means that the profit can be realised as soon as both transactions are completed. The key to success in arbitrage is that both transactions have to be made at the same time, but this creates some technical difficulties... Does arbitrage pay off? The simple answer to the question is – yes. However, there is a rather serious catch. Price differences in individual markets are minimal, and this means that in order to make a good profit on these differences, as already mentioned above, you cannot incur high transaction costs.",False

During that time, they have generated significant profits for all the investors who decided to locate their assets in the cryptocurrency market. A cryptocurrency exchange account is mandatory for every investor in order to participate in trading. The largest cryptocurrency trading companies, such as Binance, Poloniex and many others, do not provide the functionality of crediting an investor’s account with traditional fiat currencies at all. This raises a fundamental problem for investors: the inability to transfer funds seamlessly between assets. A provisional solution, which investors are forced to use, requires depositing fiat money in smaller cryptocurrency exchanges. Such transactions are often subject to high fees and unfavourable exchange rates. At the end of this difficult road, the investor has to transfer their cryptocurrencies to the target exchange, which in turn extends the execution time. The obvious result of this state of affairs is the need to create an integrator connecting users with all cryptocurrency exchanges at the same time.  This is how the idea for the Sint Platform came to be.",False

Arbitrage transactions comprise the purchase of goods, securities or other instruments, such as cryptocurrencies in one market while simultaneously selling the purchased goods / securities / other instruments in the same amount in another market where its price is higher. The trick to making arbitrage work is simply to notice the price difference of an instrument in two different markets. If the price difference is higher than the transaction costs resulting from the opening and closing positions on both markets, the investor achieves a risk-free return. This is because the assets are bought at a lower price on one market and then sold at a higher price on another market, which means that the profit can be realised as soon as both transactions are completed. The key to success in arbitrage is that both transactions have to be made at the same time, but this creates some technical difficulties... Does arbitrage pay off? The simple answer to the question is – yes. However, there is a rather serious catch. Price differences in individual markets are minimal, and this means that in order to make a good profit on these differences, as already mentioned above, you cannot incur high transaction costs.",False

Each user will be able to exchange fiat to SIN, SIN to CRYPTO, CRYPTO to SIN, SIN to fiat with no fees using the Sint Platform. This unique functionality will make it a desirable trading tool among both large market participants and small players. The platform guarantees speed, scalability and security of processed transactions thanks to its proven and extremely stable foundation in the form of the Ethereum network on which the token will be based. As the perfect tool for making profits of arbitrage, it will be an irreplaceable intermediary currency for transferring money between exchanges. All traders will additionally benefit from listing the SIN token on as many cryptocurrency exchanges as possible. The only way to distribute SIN is an ICO, during which 82% of all tokens will be distributed. The SIN token is not subject to inflation. Conversely, the virtual currency is deflationary, because the number of coins in circulation is predetermined and will be defined in our Smart Contract. Sin transactions are anonymous – when you pay for the exchange service on our platform you make a regular transfer like in the case of any other cryptocurrency. Fees for sending Sin between different wallets are symbolic – you pay the so-called miners, who make their connections available so that the virtual coin can be sent to the recipient. In practice, this is only a few cents – less than in the case of a traditional wire transfer. The fee may not be charged at all but paying the fee will give you credibility and speed up the transfer. Transactions are carried out in real time, almost immediately – no matter where you are sending your funds. You do not have to use any intermediaries – Sin transfers are free from expensive and usually unfavourable currency conversions. Each payment is guaranteed by an entry in blockchain algorithm, so you avoid the risk of losing money. Your account cannot be blocked, thanks to the peer-to-peer network. Only you are involved in the transaction. The system is very secure – it has been proven that it is practically impossible to break into your wallet if, of course, you follow the standard security rules. Sin is the simplest way to become an investor – you are the master of your finances.  You can read about the command on the site, in the team section.",False

Two-factor authentication is another option that will help you make your account secure, and when you enable it, nobody else will be able to log in using only your password. Two-factor authentication requires an additional component, which makes accessing your account very difficult for third parties.

Each time you enter your Sint password, a window pops up, and you have to enter the code generated by the Google application. This is a great way to secure your account because it requires a separate device – even if someone breaks into your computer, they will not have access to your phone and they won’t be able to log in. E-mail codes A simpler method that does not require downloading Google Authenticator app to your phone. Every time you log in, you will receive a confirmation code in an email that you must enter into the pop-up window after you have filled in your password.

In practice, this is only a few cents – less than in the case of a traditional wire transfer. The fee may not be charged at all but paying the fee will give you credibility and speed up the transfer. Transactions are carried out in real time, almost immediately – no matter where you are sending your funds.

Each payment is guaranteed by an entry in blockchain algorithm, so you avoid the risk of losing money. Your account cannot be blocked, thanks to the peer-to-peer network.

Each user will be able to exchange fiat to SIN, SIN to CRYPTO, CRYPTO to SIN, SIN to fiat with no fees using the Sint Platform. This unique functionality will make it a desirable trading tool among both large market participants and small players. The platform guarantees speed, scalability and security of processed transactions thanks to its proven and extremely stable foundation in the form of the Ethereum network on which the token will be based. As the perfect tool for making profits of arbitrage, it will be an irreplaceable intermediary currency for transferring money between exchanges. All traders will additionally benefit from listing the SIN token on as many cryptocurrency exchanges as possible. The only way to distribute SIN is an ICO, during which 82% of all tokens will be distributed. The SIN token is not subject to inflation. Conversely, the virtual currency is deflationary, because the number of coins in circulation is predetermined and will be defined in our Smart Contract. Sin transactions are anonymous – when you pay for the exchange service on our platform you make a regular transfer like in the case of any other cryptocurrency. Fees for sending Sin between different wallets are symbolic – you pay the so-called miners, who make their connections available so that the virtual coin can be sent to the recipient. In practice, this is only a few cents – less than in the case of a traditional wire transfer. The fee may not be charged at all but paying the fee will give you credibility and speed up the transfer. Transactions are carried out in real time, almost immediately – no matter where you are sending your funds. You do not have to use any intermediaries – Sin transfers are free from expensive and usually unfavourable currency conversions. Each payment is guaranteed by an entry in blockchain algorithm, so you avoid the risk of losing money. Your account cannot be blocked, thanks to the peer-to-peer network. Only you are involved in the transaction. The system is very secure – it has been proven that it is practically impossible to break into your wallet if, of course, you follow the standard security rules. Sin is the simplest way to become an investor – you are the master of your finances.",False

Arbitrage transactions comprise the purchase of goods, securities or other instruments, such as cryptocurrencies in one market while simultaneously selling the purchased goods / securities / other instruments in the same amount in another market where its price is higher. The trick to making arbitrage work is simply to notice the price difference of an instrument in two different markets. If the price difference is higher than the transaction costs resulting from the opening and closing positions on both markets, the investor achieves a risk-free return. This is because the assets are bought at a lower price on one market and then sold at a higher price on another market, which means that the profit can be realised as soon as both transactions are completed. The key to success in arbitrage is that both transactions have to be made at the same time, but this creates some technical difficulties... Does arbitrage pay off? The simple answer to the question is – yes. However, there is a rather serious catch. Price differences in individual markets are minimal, and this means that in order to make a good profit on these differences, as already mentioned above, you cannot incur high transaction costs.",False

The platform guarantees speed, scalability and security of processed transactions thanks to its proven and extremely stable foundation in the form of the Ethereum network on which the token will be based. As the perfect tool for making profits off arbitrage, it will be an irreplaceable intermediary currency for transferring money between exchanges. All traders will additionally benefit from listing the SIN token on as many cryptocurrency exchanges as possible. The only way to distribute SIN is an ICO, during which 82% of all tokens will be distributed. The SIN token is not subject to inflation. Conversely, the virtual currency is deflationary, because the number of coins in circulation is predetermined and will be defined in our Smart Contract. Sin transactions are anonymous – when you pay for the exchange service on our platform you make a regular transfer like in the case of any other cryptocurrency. Fees for sending Sin between different wallets are symbolic – you pay the so-called miners, who make their connections available so that the virtual coin can be sent to the recipient. In practice, this is only a few cents – less than in the case of a traditional wire transfer. The fee may not be charged at all but paying the fee will give you credibility and speed up the transfer.

We monitor suspicious activity in real time. Two-factor authentication is another option that will help you make your account secure, and when you enable it, nobody else will be able to log in using only your password. Two-factor authentication requires an additional component, which makes accessing your account very difficult for third parties.

Each time you enter your Sint password, a window pops up, and you have to enter the code generated by the Google application. This is a great way to secure your account because it requires a separate device – even if someone breaks into your computer, they will not have access to your phone and they won’t be able to log in.
