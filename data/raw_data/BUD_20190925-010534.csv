It's a decentralized development platform which offers both: development automation and development environments (for testing, staging and previews).  When it comes to what makes it automated, I will use an example. Let's assume that there is a company called Rentcherry. Rentcherry is an example of a Decentralized Home Rental Platform. It leverages blockchain technology to provide seamless rental experience.  The platform stack consists of: Node.js for the front-end page Spring Framework, Java, for the back-end logic Truffle, an Ethereum development framework, for their smart contract which handles trust logic of multi-party rental agreements Slack for team communication Sentry for error tracking DigitalOcean droplet for front-end page hosting Amazon Elastic Beanstalk for back-end application hosting Amazon S3 for large media files such as tutorial videos Ethereum Blockchain which runs their smart contract IFPS for storing data that requires an immutable distribute data store  Rentcherry uses several pipelines to handle their development workflow, each for development, staging and production. In this example we will analyze their staging pipeline.  Rentcherry Staging Pipeline    Steps Description  Slack Notify the Team that a new staging release has just been initiated Node.js Build and test the front-end application with an npm test Gulp Minify CSS, optimize images and encode videos to an optimal format S3 Deploy all static assets to the Amazon S3 bucket & invalidate outdated CloudFront objects (optional) DigitalOcean Deploy the Node.js app to the DigitalOcean droplet Maven Run Maven to build and test the back-end Securify Run Securify analysis—an example of how continuous security testing can easily become a part of a proper Continuous Delivery pipeline Truffle Run truffle compile in a preconfigured Truffle environment, launch a TestRPC & execute truffle test. Once finished, kill the TestRPC Rinkeby Deploy the smart contract to the Rinkeby Testnet for staging. This action also passes the address of the deployed contract to the next action Amazon Elastic Beanstalk Push the artifacts from the Maven action to Amazon Elastic Beanstalk with the previously deployed smart address set in the back-end configuration file Verify Compare the smart contract’s source code from the repository with what has been actually deployed to the blockchain (additional safety check) IFPS Deploy legal documents such as terms of service to IFPS (only if changed)  This pipeline, with all its steps, is executed on every push to the stage branch, meaning that the application is ready for final testing and is close to production release. This is what makes it automated.  Also, the platform itself maybe called automated as it has auto-scaling features: pages 60 & 62 in our whitepaper.",True
