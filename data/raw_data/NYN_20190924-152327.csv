The Incubator Program will provide tokens, tools, expert guidance and other resources to assist creators and developers of apps, bots, templates and other digital goods and services. Projects should enhance value for users and strengthen overall economic activity and sustainability of the NYNJA ecosystem. Individuals or companies submit their project proposals through the NYNJA Incubator app, including scope, budget, milestones and information about the team. All NYNJA users are able to review projects and to stake NYN tokens on those they want to support: 1 NYN token = 1 vote. The top 3-5 projects with the most votes win. Once a project is approved, the voter has the option of having their staked NYN tokens returned to them after 3 months from the time of voting or contributing it to their project (in addition to funds awarded by NYNJA). In this way voting is ultimately free, but if you want to influence the choice and help friends get their project approved, you prove your confidence and support for the project by having your NYN tokens frozen for 3 months.   Bringing in this voting support aspects for project will also work as a proof of concept and enable NYNJA to benefit from the additional user base that these projects bring in. We believe this is a democratic way to ensure the best projects are chosen, because the community interested in the project is willing to back their vote with a temporary loss of purchasing power.",True

Just curious if anyone else here is still going to invest?  There are several reasons why we’re extending the pre-sale. The first reason is due to partnerships that we have made and announced, and that are soon to be announced. The first of those is a partnership with AMGOO Telecom to distribute the NYNJA vOS on their handsets to millions of users in Latin America; we wanted to have this ready as we went into the public ICO to benefit the community with a genuine proof of concept and align our ICO date with the closed beta launch of the platform. We felt that given how close these dates were, that we should align all three: The launch of our partnership with AMGOO, the launch of our closed beta where contributors and serious users can access the platform after applying, and the ICO.  Finally, we are adapting our token economics to better align with the expected growth of the platform to provide long term benefit to our contributors and our users.

They can then take tests to earn NYNJAcoin and get qualified in a field of their choice and can start taking on jobs through out freelance platform, some of which we will provide. NYNJA will be running a pilot program shortly wherein new users will be able to purchase data with their airdropped NYNJAcoin. We’re working with a prominent carrier and mobile manufacturer on this program to deliver the application and the airtime to the user in Latin America. Stay tuned, there will be a press release going out shortly that will reveal more information.

Using the app and the wallet users will be able to purchase: 1) On demand freelance services such as translation, design, virtual assistant, copywriting, bookkeeping, etc... Basically any virtual service such as those you buy on UpWork and other freelance marketplaces but without the friction. 2) Apps that are built using the NYNJA vOS... We are opening up our platform to the development community with SDK's and Open API's. We are also planning and budgeting for building a robust developer community in our roadmap. Just as there are app marketplaces for traditional operating systems (Google, Apple, etc) we expect to have a number of innovative and unique apps and services within our app marketplace.
