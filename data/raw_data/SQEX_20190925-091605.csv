The platform will provide control over the funding of construction process via oracles at decentralized crowd-building program, which is balanced, operates based on smart-contracts and belong to the community.  THE PROBLEM WE SOLVE In many countries up to 80% of construction market is controlled by large development companies. Such corporations build in an outdated paradigm of low quality and high price realty. Due to a lack of transparency in construction process, quality of realty often does not meet one declared in the project.  PRICE OF A SQUARE METER NOW CONSISTS OF: -loans, that construction company pays to banks; -excess construction costs caused by fictitious counterparts, for example excess intermediaries in a supply chain of construction materials; -delacosts, that can account for up to 30% and in some cases up to 70% of construction cost; -real estate developer and agency profit; -actual cost price of construction.  XXth century lifestyle: up to 80% of world population rent housing or own apartments in economy-class buildings with unattractive architecture while expensive elite realty of high quality and beauty is affordable to very few.  AN OPPORTUNITY WE CREATE Fair construction: a decentralized ecosystem for real estate development based on blockchain and smart-contracts that is owned by the community. Buying real estate at a very early stage during Initial Square Offering: no delay cost, developer’s profit or loans that corporations pay to banks are included in the price. Quality matches with one declared in the project, as a consequence of transparent supply chain. High liquidity of square meters of premises as a result of tokenization and high demand. Security of transactions for buyers and backers.  PRICE OF A SQUARE METER IN SQUAREX ECOSYSTEM: -auditors/curators (community fee); -margin of land owners and architects; -actual cost price of construction.  XXIst century lifestyle: high quality real estate affordable for everyone. Modern architecture in harmony with environment as a natural choice of community. Beauty and prosperity in the world architecture as chosen by the community.  WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM SQUAREX ECOSYSTEM? - Buyers who will be able to acquire real estate up to 70% cheaper cost per square meter - Construction Contractors who will gain access to the  smart-contract database of construction works and the reliability of construction processes - Real estate Creditors and Backers with up to 70% more advantageous acquisition compared to traditional crowdfunding mechanisms - Traditional Developers and Land Owners with significant time and cost savings  HOW DOES IT WORK? The platform is based on decentralized initial square offering and decentralized real estate development process. SQUAREX will provide control over the funding of construction process via oracles at decentralized crowd-building program, which is supported by smart contracts and belong to the community. We offer you a crowdbuilding platform with reliable mechanisms of initial square offering – ISO.  HOW IS SQUAREX BETTER THAN OTHER SOLUTIONS? SQUAREX uses all the emerging opportunities of smart contracts to deliver flexible and transparent interaction options in real estate development. The SQEX token is the useful and flexible part of a decentralized network enabling transparent, cross-border settlement mechanism for all buyers and backers. The platform will enable buyers to save up to 70% of money they need to buy house or flat. And it will help to control funding of construction process directly via blockchain and smart contracts by ISO.

We would be glad to answer your questions related to the project.  As far as I understand, you asked if it is possible to buy only a few tokened metres using Squarex Ecosystem and then hold them so no one could buy the whole apartment later. In short, no.  In more details, it happens like this:  1. The user selects a favorite object (apartment) in the building and tows it; this freezes the number of tokens less (if there are not enough tokens), or equal to the number of tokens in the apartment (set in advance). One object can attract a lot of users, therefore, there is overbooking on the platform. 2. After some period of time, the sale of apartments on the platform takes place (the status of the project on the platform - “available for sale”). For booked objects, platform is offering to buy back the objects for the users who have put the largest number of tokens into them. 3. The user who contributed the most tokens for the object is given a few days to conclude a contract with the developer; if during this time he enters into a contract - the user's tokens are burned, and the rest of the participants are returned the booked tokens. 4. If during the allotted time the user does not enter into a contract, then he/she returns tokens (minus the fee for hold (similar to the fine)), and the platform offers the next on the list to buy an apartment. 5. The user who booked the object, but was not the first in the queue, can exit the booking without paying a fee (but no more than a few times-after which the platform does not allow you to remove the booking) 6. User who has the tokens can at any moment stand in the queue to book in advance, starting with the status “Available for booking” to the status “Sale”. 7. When the project enters the “sale completed "" state, the tokens of the buyers that have not been used are burned, and the amount of invested funds + the bonus in SQEX tokens is returned to them.",False
