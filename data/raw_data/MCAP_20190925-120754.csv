We would like to explain few scenarios which lead not to auto credit MCAPs in your account:  1.) Short Paid: When you make the transaction for the specified amount shown in the invoice, few wallets send less amount to us after deducting the transaction fee which in turn mark the payment as Short paid & it doesn't map with the invoice & hence no auto credit of MCAPs in your account.  2.) Paid after time-out: We keep an invoice live for an hour duration, so if any payment made after the expiry time will mark the transaction as ""paid after time-out"" & hence no auto credit of MCAPs in your account. This can occur sometimes when a user made the transaction after the expiry time intentionally or they use some wallets which send out the transaction after some time.  We hope that above points might help you in understanding for not having the MCAPs in your account even after getting confirmation on the blockchain.  We would like you to request that if any such cases are there, please send an email to support@bitcoingrowthfund.com with the following details:  BGF username: Invoice id: Transaction id: No of MCAPs:  This will help support team at BitcoinGrowthFund to address your queries with the minimum possible time.

I sent BTC to the address given and the transaction was successful but no MCAPS.  Though they have gotten back to me but they are being very vague and keep asking me for the BFG Transaction ID #.  I keep telling them I was never given one but I have the BTC Transaction ID and address the Bitcoins were sent to. Im not sure if this is a scam and they are only periodically communicating with people like me so as not to be exposed or if they are just in over there heads and are trying to work out the bugs.  There could be a language barrier too so things are getting lost in translation.  Hard to say which one it is but Im not very hopeful this is legit.  It seems to me that if they have the transaction ID it shouldn't be hard for them to trace the BTC and fix the issue.  My investment was not very big because i was a bit suspect from the beginning but I'm going to be very upset if this was a scam!

Here is what I can tell you all. I did have an issue with over 730 MCAP not funding and it scared the crap out of me. After a lot of noise, I was finally able to get the attention of what appears to be an insanely small team. They finally fixed the problem. I then heard from many, many others writing me asking why I got my money and not them. The ratio of tickets to investors was about 20% a few days ago. Meaning that over 1000 investors went through the same panic that I did.  This concerns me as a current investor in MCAP because I don't want those 1000 people writing negative reviews EVERYWHERE about MCAP! That could really hurt its future. So may I make some suggestions to MCAP.  First of all, establish an easier way to communicate with your investors! Let me say that again and maybe it will hit home. ESTABLISH AN EASIER WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR INVESTORS! Here is a link to a VERY good messaging app that will help you accomplish this, ""www.smartsupp.com"". You can even see an implementation of this app working at www.prusa3d.com. They are selling 3d printers like crazy because YOU CAN TALK TO THEM! Secondly, make a youtube video of the team communicating with the world about your product. This would allow us to put a real face to the project. If you are more transparent then its very difficult to be accused of bad things.  Hopefully, you will see that I am truly trying to help you with things suggestions (and myself) (and everyone else).",False
