(a totally wrong statement, by the way)”. So, to avoid any further misunderstandings, let's get to it and clear things up!  Fluz Fluz is a consumer cash back network that operates in Colombia and will launch in the United States, while Fluzcoin is designed to be a retail cryptocurrency that solves the problems of speed, cost, compliance and excess volatility in payment process. It is a separate business with a wholly independent management team. Fluz Fluz will serve as one of the first promoters of Fluzcoin.  More specifically, Fluz Fluz will use Fluzcoin as the central cash-back unit to be obtained from consumers participating in its daily consumption based cash back model. Thereby a natural demand for Fluzcoin is generated. In Fluz Fluz network cash-backs are calculated on fiat basis meaning Fluz Fluz will issue Fluzcoins based on the most current Fluzcoin / USD rate.  Fluz Fluz will gradually draw the rewards in Fluzcoin from a reserved lot of 6.30% of the initial Fluzcoins. This process adequately reflects the supportive but not decisive role of Fluz Fluz for Fluzcoin. Once this initial coin lot is entirely drawn, Fluz Fluz will purchase the necessary Fluzcoins at a market rate equal to other Fluzcoin holders and allocate the coin for its members’ consumption.  So, Fluzcoin and Fluz Fluz are two completely different projects. That said, Fluz Fluz will serve as one of the first promoters of Fluzcoin https://medium.com/@fluzcoin/fluzcoin-relation-to-fluz-fluz-ae42274bd3a",False
