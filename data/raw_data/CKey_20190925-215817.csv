Rentberry – Long-term apartment rentals are a blockchain startup in the rental industry, and one of their major unique selling points is that they allow for crowdsourced security deposits on their platform. To find out the exact details of how their system works, jump onto their Telegram channel and chat with their admins: https://t.me/rentberry  To try to cover some of your question myself though, their platform is being developed currently so that security deposits are collectively made between a number of holders of their cryptographic token, BERRY. BERRY is transferred and held using blockchain for the landlord to know that they have access to it, if for example property damage occurs. However, because the security deposit is held in the system it protects against landlords being able to maliciously hold security deposits without reason after the lease is up.  As a side note, token holders can also earn 7% passive income from funding security deposits using this model. As far as I’m aware, no-one else has even considered trying to disrupt the security deposit aspect of the rental market yet - keep an eye out for more from Rentberry, they currently have thousands upon thousands of properties listed across the US and are expanding to other markets such as Europe and Australia later this year.",False

Massive adjustments in exchanges also occurred recently with the strong SEC crackdown which created strong downward momentum pressure on all Altcoins.   Regardless of the public ICO and financing, the CryptoBnB team achieved tremendous progress through project milestones, and continue to develop its product and sign global technology partnerships.  The team exceeded the projected business plan for the next 5 years by acquiring more than 1.4 million rooms to be listed on the platform globally.   However, the current regulatory uncertainty is creating many unknowns and unforeseen risks to the current contributors, therefore the team has decided to stop the ICO and revert to self and equity financing for at least two years.  This will allow time for countries' regulations to develop and eventually give stability to cryptocurrencies markets and exchanges. In turn provide better direction for cryptocurrencies based projects. Yet project development will not stop and the team will work towards generating cash flows and execute its MVP product to the market.   Eventually, CryptoBnB will consider to reevaluate going to the public and allow crowd contribution.   Accordingly, the team has started the process of refunding contributions back to its owners.  We ask you to allow for 7 business days from today for your ETH to be returned back to your wallet.  If after 7 working days still you didn’t get your refund then we ask you to contact us on waqas@cryptobnb.io.  Upon getting your refund, we ask you kindly to return the CKey tokens back to our wallet within five business days.   Our actions to refund contributions is to maintain integrity and reinforce that we are dedicated to a successful ethical project where we care about all our contributors.  We look forward to you joining us in the near future on the next project stage. Thank you for your support.     Regards,  CryptoBnB Team   Copyright © 2018 Cryptobnb, All rights reserved.

CryptoBnB will be built on the already functioning short-term rental model but with the introduction of advanced technology based on blockchain power, AI and big data. These features will allow our marketplace to catapult to success with growing demand, new acquisitions and novel products and services within the sector. This innovative approach to short-term renting will make CryptoBnB a leading competitor in the short-term rental market. CryptoBnB is developing a unique proprietary application called CryptoDNA™ (patent pending), a feature that traditional hotels and rent-sharing sites such as Airbnb, HomeAway, Room Ram, FlatClub, and Wimdu.com are not currently using. The following schematic shows how CryptoBnB will address the current technological gaps of existing platforms.

It is a content-addressable, peer-to-peer hypermedia distribution protocol.  Smart contracts are used to immutably track and transfer value and safely manage sensitive information. The information in a public blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) is 100 percent transparent and can be seen by anyone. With sensitive information, there is a need to protect it from being altered and to prevent theft and fraud. Smart contracts can hash information into illegible strings by creating what seem to be random numbers and letters that are approximately 32 characters long. The ability to hash information used in combination with the Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) will create what is known as Permissioned Blocks. Only users with the blockchain address and key to the hash will be able to access the information or allow others to access the information either in part or in its entirety.  Traveler preferences such as accommodation types and the proximity to theaters or sporting venues, airports, and tourist attractions will be specific to each traveler and documented in the secured filing system that will be implemented using Permissioned Blocks and IPFS technology.  uPort technology will be utilized to perform identification protection and validation activities to maximize the user experience for both safety and ease of use. The IPFS data will need to be secured similar to methods within the blockchain, but because there will be a growing amount of data with the addition of each user and the continual updating of user information, the data must be stored in another way, not on the blockchain, thus requiring the integration of the IPFS and Permissioned Blocks.",False

CryptoBnB’s use of blockchain technology will create an improved marketplace for the short-term rental market by reducing significant challenges that currently exist in the market, including inefficient searching, high fees, fraudulent identification, fraudulent representation of properties and fraudulent reviews. Reducing these challenges will also increase the return on investment for the host. CryptoBnB will be the first platform to combine the “power of three”: blockchain(smart contracts), artificial intelligence (AI) and big data. This will generate an intelligent hospitality service marketplace that benefits property owners and travelers by providing more accurate matches between travelers and properties. The platform aims to increase the return on investment (ROI) for hosts and service providers through enhanced matchmaking to the right traveler who is looking for that particular property or service.  CryptoBnB is not only a concept we already started working on it & developing a unique proprietary application called CryptoDNA™ (alreday filed patent in US Patent & TradeMark Office ), a feature that traditional hotels and rent-sharing sites such as Airbnb, HomeAway, Room Ram, FlatClub, and Wimdu.com are not currently using.  The CryptoDNA™ will keep getting smarter over time, learning more about its owner with each use of the CryptoBnB platform by tracking user preferences. CryptoDNA™ will have the first blockchain-based digital identities and trust ratings wallet. CryptoDNA™ captures the “DNA” of each user as follows:  Traveler: CryptoDNA™ will log the traveler’s identity, preferences, history, rating and token balances. Host: CryptoDNA™ will log the host's identity, property access rights, property details, preferences of targets, history, rating and token balances. Service Provider (SP): CryptoDNA™ will log the SP’s identity, business license information, service details, preferences of targets (host/traveler), history, rating and token balances.  Whole CryptoBnB Technology will b up-running in maximum One & Half Year & will surely benefit host ,travelers & Service providers .  .

To address inherent limitations within blockchain technology such as scaling, CryptoBnB will employ a strategy developed by one of the Plasma, Raiden or 0xProject teams. The strategy to deal with the scaling challenge is to perform off-chain transactions in a safe and reliable manner, then record these transactions in the EVM at a later time. The Ethereum road map includes plans to address this challenge, and once that plan is widely accepted in the EVM we will adopt that solution as it becomes available, but to fulfill our roadmap will build on an already existing solution.

If you've got a few minutes, have a read and tell me what you think!   People are talking about CryptoBnN  This article, published on November 30, 2017 on Express.co.uk, gives readers an accurate and objective introduction to CryptoBnB. In the article’s headline, CryptoBnB is described as “an AirBnB alternative promising a smarter blockchain alternative for better travel.” The article goes on to briefly explain the benefits of using blockchain technology for hosting and purchasing short-term rental properties. The bright future of CryptoDNA is also discussed. Some balanced quotes from CryptoBnB CEO Tariq Al Wahedi are included, adding to the article’s credibility.  In order for any new technology to be adopted by a large user base, a buzz must be created and people must become interested. This is even more true for cryptocurrency-based technologies than most other technologies. Simply put, the market is saturated. New platforms promising greater things are being launched every day. Regardless of how impressive a platform’s features are though, it will not succeed without press, exposure, and word-of-mouth.  The article run by Express.co.uk is sure to give CryptoBnB a significant boost in interest from the general public. Even though it delves into complicated technology, it is concise and easy-to-read. It’s also crucial that the article is not a “fluff piece.” There is no bias in this article; “pie in the sky” sentiments are avoided, and the language used by the author and (even more impressively) from CryptoBnB Tariq Al Wahedi is objective. When read from an outside perspective, it’s clear that the article is comprised of facts rather than advertisements.  CryptoBnB clearly has the makings of a successful new platform. Its technology is cutting edge, its value proposition is convincing, and perhaps most importantly, it’s easy to understand why an individual would want to use CryptoBnB. And now. with publications like Express.co.uk showing interest, it seems like the odds may just be stacked in favor of CryptoBnB.",False
