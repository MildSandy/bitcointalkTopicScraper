The very first question is: From the site:""Kaspersky could catch up Wannacry, but it had still damaged more than 300 000 computers in 150 countries."" - the problem was that specialists from Kaspersky didn't know about the treat from the beginning, it takes some time to catch the new source of the virus. SO, How fast professionals from the Levelnet can react to the new listed cases of the possible Malware, cause u cannot just ban all the soft that ppl are complaining about.",False

LevelNet includes almost all of today's anti-virus technologies, forming a simple, accessible intuitive application. This system allows users to exchange information about threats regardless of location. Thanks to this, the whole system is considered to be more intelligent and faster, surpassing other security systems. LevelNet extends the capabilities of each user's anti-virus SOFTWARE. If the client does not have any security applications on its own computer, LevelNet begins to function as a separate independent application SOFTWARE. The capabilities of the new PC security systems are quite limited. If one leading developer finds a threat, sometimes it takes a huge amount of time for the threat data to penetrate all elements of the system. Modern malicious applications use this time window to infect more devices. Thanks to LevelNet formed a holistic, global and operational system. It makes it possible to destroy many malicious programs much faster than other security systems. The main goal that allows you to attract financiers is the development of the Level Net project, its launch. Level Net allows each participant to get a completely free application that protects the device. In addition, LevelNet enterprise customers can apply paid subscriptions at any time that allow them to use the API and SDK. Level Net offers their customers also benefit from the subscription plan that you can apply to the owners and to sell to others, as well as the following additional models of the application:  Level Capital. Customers who have tokens and use ICO can use the services provided by Level Net. In addition, people have the opportunity to use the intellectual property of the common system. Level Net Fund. People with LVLS, become shareholders. They have the right to profit from shares. Shareholders can also choose the management Committee, the Board of Directors, the main areas of expenditure and investment of the Fund.   https://levelnet.co/   https://www.facebook.com/levelnetwork/  https://twitter.com/LevelNetwork  https://t.me/levelnet_ico",False

Reducing the hard-cap does not affect the division of funds into funds, it only removes the dependence on the volume of the tokens sold. The number of tokens issued corresponds to the amount of funds when a hard cap is reached.

In the our software itself, the blockchain is not needed. There it wasn't and will not be. And we repeated this fact many times and everywhere.  We'll use ICO as a way to attract investments. It's logical, right?   Blockchain used for creating own tokens. There will be two types of LevelNet tokens issued.  Иelow is more information about what is it for and how it will work.  1. Utility token LVL Token owners will be able to use LevelNet services, the LevelNet ecosystem, and all its products, in addition to receiving use of intellectual property rights. Possession of the token gives access to the Buyback Fund and MoneyBack funds secured by a smart contract based on Ethereum. It will be possible to exchange tokens for crypto shares in the second phase of the project. Phase 1: Non-Investment LVL Token Details Holders of LVL tokens have a membership status that provides access to LevelNet services and software. LevelNet offers participants in the non-investment phase the following options: ● Business API and premium services.

It searches and identifies malware using a database of signatures the provider has to compare to. Files with executable code are analyzed, and their threat level is determined using a heuristic analysis method. These heuristic decisions are made using a previously developed algorithm, which is frequently left lagging in updates. Standard signatures are not used with the heuristic method. A more advanced method of protection is code emulation. Here a virtual machine (VM) simulates the CPU and memory management systems then executes the code on the VM in order to look for unintended or unaccounted for effects. This enables one to test and observe the effects of malicious code without making the non-virtual machine vulnerable. Additionally, with behavioral analysis technology, one can evaluate entire sequences of actions from the malware, thereby significantly increasing the efficiency of the anti-virus software. These measures may be sufficient for prevention of known cyber threats, but they are are not adequate for emerging malware. Virus protection often requires prompt and regular, regardless of particular software capabilities or which method they employ. Otherwise, the risk of security breaches increases significantly.",False

Utility token LVL  Token owners will be able to use LevelNet services, the LevelNet ecosystem, and all its products, in addition to receiving use of intellectual property rights. Possession of the token gives access to the Buyback Fund and MoneyBack funds secured by a smart contract based on Ethereum. It will be possible to exchange tokens for crypto shares in the second phase of the project.  Phase 1: Non-Investment LVL Token Details Holders of LVL tokens have a membership status that provides access to LevelNet services and software. LevelNet offers participants in the non-investment phase the following options: ●   Business API and premium services. Participants exchange tokens for subscriptions to LevelNet services in case they have more tokens than the required amount. The possession of tokens in this required amount will significantly reduce the costs of a corporate plan. ●   Lifelong use of the LevelNet application and any LevelNet services for ordinary users, without additional payment for premium features. ●   Option to participate in Phase 2. ●   Access to the ""Buyback"" and ""Money Back Guarantee"" funds, secured by a smart contract. ●   The possibility of receiving an LVLS financial instrument upon a successful KYC / AML procedure (see Terms and Conditions).   2. Equity token LVLS  Owners of LVLS will have ownership and profit sharing rights, owners will have rights to be chosen in supervisory committee, to nominate the members of the Director Board, to choose the Fund's main investment and expenses directions.In this order to implement this we hired a team of Legal and finance and investment experts to design a second phase of our strategy. LVLS Token Details  LVLS is a financial instrument, which in Phase 2 offers the following: ●   Access to the fund’s profits; ●   Access to the register of fund shareholders; ●   The opportunity to nominate a representative to the Board of Directors; ●   The right to call an extraordinary board meeting.  The Exchange of LVL Tokens for LVLS  ●   LevelNet Capital plans to establish an investment fund or obtain a license to carry out investment activities. ●   All LevelNet assets will be in the fund balance. ●   LevelNet Inc. will issue up to 40% of shares and, under the option agreement, will transfer them under the management of the fund. ●   After registration, the fund immediately begins to issue LVLS tokens (a financial instrument that gives the right to receive a share in the fund). ●   Only LVL token owners can obtain the right to own LVLS tokens. ●   Only LVL token holders can exchange them for LVLS tokens. For participants, up to 40% of fund ownership will be available. ●   The exchange of LVL tokens for LVLS tokens will be carried out through the investor's personal account, which is accessible via orderbook.io ●   All qualified LVL token holders will have the preemptive rights to purchase non-distributed LVLS. (in the USA only “qualified investors” can get LVLS tokens)  ●   All LVL tokens exchanged for the LVLS token are subject to cancellation. All exchange provisions are regulated by the Terms of Token Offering and cannot be changed.

And one thing: the system itself is not based on blockchain technology. This is our own development. Blockchain, or, more precisely, created on it tokens, will be used for processing payments and distribution interest of investors in the future. For this we will issue two different types of tokens.  Brief info: ITO Key Deal: - Level Capital is the manager of the LevelNet community and guarantor of participant rights. - LeveL Capital issues «LVL» tokens, which will only be distributed during the TOKEN OFFERING. - Level Capital will create buyback funds and will use them to redeem tokens no later than 60 days after the date of the TOKEN OFFERING - Level Capital will invest assets received during the TOKEN OFFERING in operations and infrastructure development for the final completion of LevelNet End-Point Security and its commercial launch - LVL Tokens will be sold on CrytpoShare exchanges  As the operator of the LevelNet project, Level Capital will at determined intervals redeem the tokens in exchange for cryptocurrency, quoted on cryptocurrency exchanges The investment phase of the project will be implemented in accordance with the road map. - LevelNet Capital will create a British Virgin Islands investment fund with the possibility of raising funds and protect the rights of token owners. Once the fund is created, all holders of the LVL tokens will be able to exchange them for LVLS. Note! Ownership of LVLS will allow participation in the sharing of the fund's profits starting in 2021. If the profits are not distributed or there are none, then the option will be given to increase share participation in the fund at an optional discount. - During the second phase, LVLS will provide shares in the LevelNet project. LVLS can only be redeemed using LVL tokens. - The financing needs in this phase (product release) ITO soft cap-$1.5M, hard cap aprox. $55M. The project is evaluated by the ""Development and Implementation Fund”. - LevelNet Capital will maintain a register of token holders.",False

Here is our answer.  In connection with the fact that all collected funds during the ICO are divided into money funds and part of the funds is sent back to support the liquidity of the token. We made a hard cap to limit the amount of money collected, which are directed to the development and implementation of the LevelNet project, as well as to protect the interests of investors and maintain the liquidity of the token. In order to understand the formation of funds, let's look at their purpose. The purpose of the funds: - Buyback. To increase the interest for the community members, as well as to foster equitable spending on product development, we created a smart contract. This contract, using the funds from the ""Buyback Fund,"" will regularly buy back tokens from the market using the algorithm described below. Buybacks will be carried out on CryptoCurrency exchanges. The buyback algorithm is built on the Token Offering results, i.e., on the total number of tokens sold. Depending on the ""Return Fund,"" the smart contract algorithm redeems tokens automatically from exchanges on which it trades. Returned tokens are destroyed. - Money Back Guarantee.In order to increase the investor interest, we created a smart contract that provides an opportunity to receive a reward for participation in the LevelNet project. Depending on the amount of token, the payment is made in the form of money, the smart contract algorithm automatically calculates and sends a one-time payment to the investor from the ""Money Back"" Guarantee Fund. The tokens in this algorithm remain in existence. - Development & Implementation Fund.This fund is the development, administration and management of the LevelNet project. A more detailed description of the fund's expenditure can be found here  For example: If the hard cap is collected then the distribution will be as follows:      Those. as you see on the development and implementation of leaving a smaller part of the money, and the rest of the money will be sent back to the market to support liquidity.  Conclusion. Hard Cap is in our case this is the maximum capacity of ICO. The capacity was chosen not accidentally, in order to valuation the project in a fair way, the method is described on page 23 of white paper. The valuation is based on the volume of Development & Implementation Fund. And the value of the Hard Cap ICO is made to set the valuation cap of the LevelNet project.

And I have a lot about Pavel Shiklaev and project. In the first after a very long work, he deceived me for a large sum of money. I strongly relied on this money, because it would very much help me buy an apartment. But Pavel deceived me. He has no conscience. From the former employees with him no one is working anymore because he deceives people. All employees represented on the site have long worked in other companies. He does not have a team.  I want to warn people not to deal with this scoundrel!   At the expense of the arguments for the project. My arguments are logical and there is no connection with whether I want to take revenge or not. Any expert who values his reputation will confirm my words!  1. Malicious software uses a morph or cryptor. This means that the sum of the file on each system is different. This means that the database will be empty for all malicious programs. And there is no sense in the fact that this malicious program was detected on another computer, because the client will not be able to recognize it and identify the threat reports.  2. No super nodes and so on can not weed out fake reports. Since everything that the client makes is left can be repeated automatically. His statements about super nodes and signatures are fraudulent, to give at least some sort of response to an unsolvable problem.  3. I made the assumption that you will check the reports on the server using anti-virus software, because you said this earlier, but you generally do not want to check them and it makes it very easy to manipulate statistics from the outside.  4. I said that in a few days, then if you checked the files on the server. Connections of the peer-to-peer do not provide a second reaction. BitTorrent is arranged differently, it has a central user directory. However, data transfer by peer-to-peer means transferring data between the CHARGE of nodes, and not directly. It says that Pavel do not even own the technologies that he claiming.  For example schema of peer-to-peer network: https://i.imgur.com/BqYC1XL.jpg  5. No antivirus company will allow you to use their software for commercial purposes, even on the client side. If you think otherwise, you could write a letter at least to one of the antivirus companies with this issue and officially publish the answer on the site. You did not, so you already know that you are prohibited from using their software in this way.  6. ---  7/8. Antivirus companies sell each other's bases is a well-known fact. And the antivirus is able to recognize the threat through algorithms that have been developed for many years. Strong proactive defense systems are developed. But you seriously argue that this is not necessary and for security it is enough just to compare the hash sum of the file  The fact that the company is officially registered does not deny that this is a scam. They will simply launder money for example through non-existent salaries. In Russia, this is a common practice for paper wages is one, but the employee is paid several times less.",False

It controls not only the launch of programs as in levelnet, but also network connections, access to the registry, to autostarting, access to memory and much more. It also has a security policy based on the reactions end-point of the users and the trust of the publisher.  It's really not enough to compare the hash sum of the file. I agree with the arguments of Angel117. Malicious programs have a unique hash amount, so the antivirus response to a file on another computer can not be attributed to a malicious file on another. In this case, the any antivirus is easily recognized due to heuristic analysis. It turns out that reports of reactions any antivirus does not make sense, because this information can not be used and displayed to another user.  And do you have confirmation from antivirus companies that they allow you to use the work of their product for commercial purposes? You need to make a request to each antivirus company and publish their responses on the project website.",False

Our hard cap is $ 55M and soft cap $1.5M in a crypto currency equivalent, including all discounts and bonuses. And it is important to say that this amount is divided into several funds, which are aimed at maintaining liquidity. For example, part of the collected funds goes to the Buyback Fund, which can be up to 40% of all collected funds, depending on the number of tokens sold during the period token crowdsale. This fund is regulated and provided with a smart contract, the purpose of which is to regularly and automatically buy back tokens from crypto currency exchanges by creating a market order. The hard cap was chosen not accidentally. when it is reached, another development and implementation fund will be formed in the amount of 35% of the total amount of attraction, and this will allow to implement the development, implementation and marketing strategy for 2 years.   -----------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------    To date, we see the situation: Projects collected money from investors.

Tokens after listing on stock exchanges are falling in price, as there is no product, no news, no volatility. Investors are upset and lose faith in the project and ICO.

Here’s our assessment of this situation:  Our hunch is that Angel117 is an aggressive former employee, who was removed from the project some time ago. While it would be easiest to discredit this attempt at harming our project as being mere trolling, we don’t want to leave any of our followers in doubt as to our projects merits, or the sincerity of our intentions.  Regarding his accusations towards the project  and the CEO, we believe his main motivation is for revenge (towards the project, the leader and individual people employed in the project). We believe that anything he would say will be aimed at discrediting us.  However, we feel it is important to provide the community with our answers and clarity on the project.  Regarding his statement that it is impossible to implement some functionality in the project means that a person does not have knowledge in the field of development management. We are not aiming to do everything at once, but move gradually from MVP to RTM.  Once again, here are our answers:  1. File Hashing is used to quickly search for KNOWN objects. This is the key to the speed of the algorithm that excludes trusted software from the need of any additional analysis. Detection of the same harmful objects, including those modified with the help of ""morphers, cryptors and packers"", is carried out through white lists. 2. Reports about malicious objects from LevelNet client applications are not sufficient for making these objects into the category of malware. This decision is made on the intermediate super nodes, the messages from which, in turn, are signed with a security key. 3. The author does not fully understand the principle of the work of LevelNet algorithms on super nodes. Dynamic analysis is not performed either because of the impossibility of automating such a process, or because it is not necessary. In this case, the white list is responsible for filtering. 4. In the speed and efficiency of information dissemination within p2p networks, each user can be convinced by the example of p2p file clients (ala bittorent), allowing to exchange huge amounts of data. The competence of the author in this matter raises special suspicions, in particular, at the expense of unsupported ""report can be checked in a few days"". 5. LevelNet does not use antivirus software, but only analyzes the reactions of its users. 6. For the functioning of the LevelNet network, there is absolutely no need to collect any personal data. All objects are represented exclusively by their hash-sums, according to which, as is known, it is impossible to restore the contents of the object or its belonging. 7. First, antivirus products do not exchange databases with their competitors. Secondly, the speed of updating the anti-virus database is estimated in hours; they use client-server connection protocols in which client devices do not contact each other, especially client devices with different antivirus products. 8. LevelNet does not perform heuristic analysis and preactive protection for one reason - no need. It is worth reminding the author that LevelNet is not yet another antivirus with all its inherent flaws, such as inefficiency of malware detection algorithms, slowdown of the device, serious resource consumption, etc.   Conclusion: Due to the fact that we are aware of the motive of his messages, we will ignore future communication with him.We adhere to the rule ""Do not feed the troll"". We ask the audience to pay attention to the character and emotional tone of his posts where accusations and discreditations are going on in each post. We will be grateful to all who can help us back our claims about this user.

As for the technical part. There is no question of any dynamic and static analysis of speech. Confirmation of a false request from the user is also described in the algorithm for assigning the level of risk. Read carefully how the threat level is set. Reputational base formation A novel concept of weighting certain attributes for the determining the Risk Level of potential software packages. This Risk Level is evaluated by the LevelNet system automatically based on the value of a set of factors listed below in descending order of importance: ● antivirus solutions reactions from end-point users. ● level of trust that its publisher has ● prevalence within the network ● the number of cases when this software was added to the list of exceptions end-users The number of antivirus solutions can be obtained both from users' devices and from the internal servers of the LevelNet network. The process of monitoring previously unknown software.  Also read about the database of trusted publishers, you most likely missed it or just did not know it.  If the object (the new hash) does not satisfy the conditions, then it is considered dangerous, thus all manipulations with the cryptor and morphing are reduced to zero due to the fact that the object previously did not meet with users and there are no trusted publishers in the database. The algorithm is specified in the answer number 1. In addition to this algorithm, the number of requests from the user is checked. In reality, if the user sends many requests, it is blocked due to the fact that this is not a real behavior. Because sending a lot of requests from the user in reality does not happen. 2.1 We do not check each file, we use the algorithm specified in item 1. The source of information is user devices and the database of trusted publishers and their files. We do not use dynamic anti-virus scanning on our side. 3. It's not the number of devices, but the speed of delivery of verified information. The data transfer rate is very high today. There's really no verification on the video on the reliability of the request received from the device on which an antivirus is installed, which is able to cope with the threat. Validation test A request from a user for an identified threat does not take much time. We do not analyze the set of anti-virus engines in our in the cloud, but we operate the information with information obtained from other users and sources of re-checking the information. Verification of the request is not based on either dynamic or static analysis, which you specified in paragraphs 1-8.

You are going to use the result of the work of third-party antivirus software for your own commercial purposes. No antivirus company will allow this.

We gathered the most interesting questions and statements in our opinion. In addition to these answers, you can find the answers that interest you in our FAQ: https://levelnet.co/faq.html   1.Have you lost it and have no other ideas to launch ICO with it?? imagine now with this new thing cyber security on blockchain, what if a group of hackers find a way to defeat your system? then every body in the network is screwed. since this is the first time I see a project in this area we should wait and see the other competitors, this isn't about how many transactions are processed in a second and with so many coins doing more than Bitcoin we see it's dominance over them, this is about real threats and real time protection on wide network of users.  Answer: Code: Hi and stay calm =) LevelNet technology is not built on the blockchain protocol. We have our own protocol. If you are interested in the technical part, pay attention to the FAQ: in section About LevelNet: https://levelnet.co/faq.html If you are interested in how it works from a deep technical point, you can read our patent document: https://levelnet.co/files/LevelNet%20Tech%20Patent.pdf If you have any questions, do not hesitate, we are ready to answer and tell you more about our technology.  If you read more carefully our white paper, you will be able to understand the objectives of ICO. We propose the following exit strategy for LVL tokens holders issued by LevelNet.   We took into account interests of diverse user groups and contributors and provide three exit strategies.  1. Short-term (up to one year) The growth of the token in the price on the crypto currency exchanges due to the provision of liquidity by a smart contract that performs the function of a buyback with the help of funds from the Buyback Fund. Smart contract automatically redeems tokens from the market by creating Market Order. Smart contract algorithms actually indicate to market participants that they can always sell tokens at a market price without delays, creating a demand for tokens. The buyback fund is formed at the expense of funds received during the ITO and the buy-back runs till the funds are exhausted in the fund.  2. Long-term (one year and more) Tokens owners who have not sold their tokens in a short-term strategy receive a preemptive right to exchange a token for a stake in the fund whose purpose is to acquire local cyber security companies with the subsequent integration of LevelNet technology into their products. The Fund provides for a gradual decrease in the equity participation of founders and transfer to participants, who invested in the following phases of ITO. Owning a share in the fund opens the possibility of participating in the distribution of profits. Payout Structure A smart contract allows token owners to receive payment from the Money Back and Buyback funds starting from the 60th day after the offering.  3. Output in the product (year and more) Tokens owners get access to using the LevelNet project software. Besides opens the ability to exchange tokens for subscription to use the API and SDK for corporate users. This, in turn, allows tokens owners to sell subscriptions to corporate and business users.  2. How can you attract many investors to this project because there are too many ICOs for this month. Answer: Code: The attraction strategy: We create a unique mechanization with guaranteed liquidity. Today, all ICOs suffer from the fact that the increase in the value of the token is a problem. In our case, we decided it and did something that nobody previously did. You can read more here: https://medium.com/@LevelNetwork/exit-strategy-for-lvl-tokens-holders-issued-by-levelnet-2b22ae7946c3 Well, of course: marketing + PR + bounty. We also sell our tokens via Ambisafe and have access to the investor database via Ambisafe exchange orderbook.io  3.Hey team, is there a specific target for this project? like the Korean market or US or for IT companies? I am curious who will be the main target for the use. Answer Code: Hi, From the point of product, there are 3 initial market strategies: - The US market - The Indian market - Countries of Eastern Europe  From the point of ICO, we see 4 main markets: - United States - Canada - Countries of Western Europe. - Countries of the Persian Gulf  We are now preparing a series of videos from our CEO where it will be told about our plans and product. If the video will please the audience you we will release them on a regular basis. The description of the plan for the market strategy still is commercial in secret and we would not really like to publish it ahead of time. When we reach our ICO goals, we will work with our community and share our plans  4.I have a question, don't you think that an accent on the buyback mechanism sounds 'scammy'? You basically say ""I don't think we could build a business that will support the price of the token on the initial level"" Sorry if that sounds aggressive, I'm not so good at my English. Answer: Code: No problem.This is a good statement. And here is our answer. No business can be successful right away. Business needs time to develop, market, capture the market, etc.  To support the cost of the token can 2 things:  - Underwriter - Market Maker  This is a standard practice for stock exchanges and for IPOs.If the underwriter on classic exchanges did not have the mechanisms similar to ours, then no stock growth would be ensured. For example, the task of a market maker is to create liquidity in creating buy and sell orders.  The current situation with the various ICOs looks deplorable: Projects collected money from investors. The majority of investors need a quick income (Exit Strategy Short) due to speculation deals with tokens. Tokens after listing on stock exchanges are falling in price as there is no product, no news, no volotility. Investors are upset and lose faith. The projects did not think about liquidity at the beginning of the creation of the ICO and did not answer the main question: Why the token will grow in value as long as the project develops.  Regards  5.As in, you place a buy order at the ICO price on an exchange? Answer: Code: Yes correct. Smart contract places a market order (buy) for purchase volume on the exchange  6.Just to summarize some of the cool stuff in the whitepaper.    Special thanks to user: Darkoth89  Code: - Tokens are multipurpose.  They can be used to pay for premium subscriptions (Home and enterprise) as well as dividends and voting rights. - There we be both Free and Paid versions of the product. - Any detection on the network, will be shared to all other endpoints in realtime - Total number of tokens is 70,000,000, with any unsold ones being destroyed when the ICO ends. - Funding requirement: Soft Cap $1.5M, Hard Cap approx $55M - A smart contract has been created that will use the funds from the ""Return Fund,"" to regularly buy back tokens from the market an algorithm. - Contract address: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5d78d89d4a90b7db17821d36599de1c78c7bda28#code - Contract source: https://github.com/Ambisafe/etoken2  7. And what if a user from an already infected device connects to the system?  Answer: Code: Functions will be available in the second version of LevelNet. the treatment of active infection is highly dependent on malware. At the first stage of development, the main goal that faces LevelNet is a preventive measure, that is, Do not allow the device to be infected.  Option 1: Your system is infected with malware with a function (kernel level rootkit / self-defense module). antivirus or our solutions removed malware objects are installed by the malware protection module after uninstallation.  Solution A: Our solution overloads the device in debug mode (before OS boot) and deletes objects. Solution B: Our solution proposes to install an antivirus package of the company that can heal the device. It installs it in a silent mode then initializes the function of treating infected objects or deleting them.  Option 2: Your system is infected with a malicious program without a rootkit or a user-level rootkit. Solution A: Our solution overloads the device in debug mode (before OS boot) and deletes objects. Solution B: Similar to option 1  Option 3 *: Your system is infected with a malicious program that is executed in memory, i.e. Does not have objects on the disk and it is launched through shell code of exploit. Solution: suspend and kill processes, reboot the device.  * In fact, this threat is not removed by any antivirus package and they are all silent about this fact, or they kill the process in which there is malicious code. This is due to the fact that the projected code in memory is hard to update by signature.  8.Did you have a working demo? it looks very promising Answer : Code: Now we are at the stage of a functional prototype. During the year we tested various functionalities using Google Cloud and MS Azure. We can make you a private demonstration, because. the product is not ready for scaling. Watch the video so we will show it to you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLfvA9EqNU When watching a video, imagine that each virtual machine is users in different parts of the world  9. Cyber security is a huge threat on the other side of the coin, it could a billion dollar market. I read about rivetz and many platform trying to find a solutions to issue of security online! What special advantage does your token has over others. Answer: Code: Hey. In addition to the fact that the token gives us the use of our services for life and for free, we did the following:  Advantages that we do not see in other tokens.  1. Token has guaranteed liquidity and is provided with a smart contract that automatically and regularly buys tokens from the market at the expense of ""BayBack"" Fond, thereby performing the functions of a market maker. 2. In order to increase investor interest, we created a smart contract that provides an opportunity to receive a reward for participation in the LevelNet project. Depending on the amount of money, the money is in the form of money, the smart contract algorithm automatically calculates and sends a one-time payment to the investor from the ""Money Back"" Guarantee Fund 2. As described in the Business model overview, LevelNet's API and SDK for corporate clients, LevelNet provides not only the free distribution of an endpoint security application, additionally. Similar subscriptions are estimated at $ 50k per year. LevelNet will allow for token owners to exchange the tokens during the Token Offering for a subscription plan, which then can be used by the owner or sold to others. 3. LVL the first phase token can be exchanged for the second-phase LVLS token. LVLS is a financial instrument, which in Phase 2 offers the following: ● Access to the fund's profits; ● Access to the register of fund shareholders; ● The opportunity to nominate a representative to the Board of Directors; ● The right to call an extraordinary board meeting.  The second phase of the ICO is the opportunity for the participants to become a full-fledged owner of the fund. The purpose of the fund is to absorb small regional antivirus companies and integration of LevelNet technologies into their products.  It will also be useful to read :Exit strategy for LVL tokens holders issued by LevelNet: https://medium.com/@LevelNetwork/exit-strategy-for-lvl-tokens-holders-issued-by-levelnet-2b22ae7946c3  Regards,LevelNet",False

First, the organizer of the project, Pavel Shkliaev, made his capital on carding(banking fraud). He steals from people money from bank accounts with the help of malicious spyware. This already says for what purpose this ISO was created.  The idea of the project is stupid and carries a number of unavoidable technical and legal problems:  1. The malicious file in this project is determined stupidly by the hash of the file. Any malware uses a cryptor, a morph or a packer, which makes each file unique, which means that each file has a different hash amount. For this reason, the project itself is meaningless.  2. It is impossible to check whether there was a real report on the infected file or this report is fake. Anyone can create a program that will send millions of false reports including for legitimate programs.  If they will check each file on the server with all possible antiviruses by analogy with virostotal.com, then there will not be enough computing resources for this. In addition, the detection will not be a few seconds as a demonstration, but a minimum of 10 minutes, provided that there are free computing resources. And this will only be a static analysis, which is easily handled by the simplest cryptor. For dynamic analysis, you need many times more time and resources. In addition, until now no one has implemented a stable dynamic analysis on the set of antiviruses, because there are many difficulties in this.  3. The reaction time is only on the video demo in a few seconds because there are only 4 virtual machines connected to the local network. And this does not verify the real report or not. In real-world conditions, the time costs for transmitting through a peer-to-peer will be at least a few minutes. And if you check the report with the file on the server, it will take an indefinite time. If all resources are very busy, then the report can be checked in a few days.  4. In order to use third-party antivirus programs both on the client and on the server, you must obtain legal permission from absolutely all anti-virus companies. This is impossible, because no antivirus company will help the competitive product.  5. The client without the user's consent will download files from his computer, which is a violation of confidentiality and may lead to the leakage of important information for the user. In addition, the executable file is stupidly pumped to the server completely, and its size can be hundreds of megabytes and even a few gigabytes.  6. Even if you completely download the executable file and try to perform a dynamic analysis on the server, it may simply not start due to the lack of necessary libraries.  7. Antiviruses and so quickly exchange antivirus databases between each other, so making such a proxy does not make sense.  8. This project will never replace a full-fledged antivirus, since this antivirus has heuristic analysis and proactive protection, which allows detecting suspicious threats or actions.  9. I am familiar with this project, as they tried to offer to various investors during 2016-2017 and no investor agreed to invest money in it, because it does not pass the audit by an independent technical auditor.  Based on all of the above, I'm 100% sure that this project is a scam!",False

In addition to the fact that the token gives us the use of our services for life and for free, we did the following:  Advantages that we do not see in other tokens.  1. Token has guaranteed liquidity and is provided with a smart contract that automatically and regularly buys tokens from the market at the expense of ""BayBack"" Fond, thereby performing the functions of a market maker. 2. In order to increase investor interest, we created a smart contract that provides an opportunity to receive a reward for participation in the LevelNet project. Depending on the amount of money, the money is in the form of money, the smart contract algorithm automatically calculates and sends a one-time payment to the investor from the ""Money Back"" Guarantee Fund 2. As described in the Business model overview, LevelNet's API and SDK for corporate clients, LevelNet provides not only the free distribution of an endpoint security application, additionally. Similar subscriptions are estimated at $ 50k per year. LevelNet will allow for token owners to exchange the tokens during the Token Offering for a subscription plan, which then can be used by the owner or sold to others. 3. LVL the first phase token can be exchanged for the second-phase LVLS token. LVLS is a financial instrument, which in Phase 2 offers the following: ● Access to the fund's profits; ● Access to the register of fund shareholders; ● The opportunity to nominate a representative to the Board of Directors; ● The right to call an extraordinary board meeting.  The second phase of the ICO is the opportunity for the participants to become a full-fledged owner of the fund. The purpose of the fund is to absorb small regional antivirus companies and integration of LevelNet technologies into their products.

And what if a user from an already infected device connects to the system?  Good question!  Functions will be available in the second version of LevelNet. the treatment of active infection is highly dependent on malware. At the first stage of development, the main goal that faces LevelNet is a preventive measure, that is, Do not allow the device to be infected.  Option 1: Your system is infected with malware with a function (kernel level rootkit / self-defense module). antivirus or our solutions removed malware objects are installed by the malware protection module after uninstallation.  Solution A: Our solution overloads the device in debug mode (before OS boot) and deletes objects. Solution B: Our solution proposes to install an antivirus package of the company that can heal the device. It installs it in a silent mode then initializes the function of treating infected objects or deleting them.  Option 2: Your system is infected with a malicious program without a rootkit or a user-level rootkit. Solution A: Our solution overloads the device in debug mode (before OS boot) and deletes objects. Solution B: Similar to option 1  Option 3 *: Your system is infected with a malicious program that is executed in memory, i.e. Does not have objects on the disk and it is launched through shell code of exploit. Solution: suspend and kill processes, reboot the device.  * In fact, this threat is not removed by any antivirus package and they are all silent about this fact, or they kill the process in which there is malicious code. This is due to the fact that the projected code in memory is hard to update by signature.",False

This is not a classic antivirus. Let me explain to you and you will understand that the comparative table can beonly after scaling.  It's just like an antivirus, but it's not an classic antivirus. It is a network for exchanging antivirus protection between users. For users it is end-point protection solution app. LevelNet allows to protect users against the latest attacks that occur on the Internet about which antivirus vendors have not managed to secure their users. LevelNet client application receiving information from other users of the network,protects the device from attacks that were fixed by users with the same application.  For example: User #1 was susceptible to an attack on the Internet and Avast was installed. Avast blocked this attack. User #2 was also susceptible to attack on the Internet and it had NOD32 installed. Nod32 could not block the virus. User #3 does not have an antivirus. Result: Users #2 #3 was infected with a virus.  If users #1, #2 and #3 had LevelNet app, then users #2 and #3 would not have been infected with the virus since. The LevelNet app will block the virus.  For better understanding of the video. Imagine that virtual machines are different users who are in different parts of the world. Please look through until the end I answer some important questions at the end of the video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLfvA9EqNU   Now we have a version of the functional prototype and we can do a demonstration for you, let us know how you like to do it.",False

And here is our answer. No business can be successful right away. Business needs time to develop, market, capture the market, etc.  To support the cost of the token can 2 things:  - Underwriter - Market Maker  This is a standard practice for stock exchanges and for IPOs.If the underwriter on classic exchanges did not have the mechanisms similar to ours, then no stock growth would be ensured. For example, the task of a market maker is to create liquidity in creating buy and sell orders.  UPDATE:  The current situation with the various ICOs looks deplorable: Projects collected money from investors. The majority of investors need a quick income (Exit Strategy Short) due to speculation deals with tokens. Tokens after listing on stock exchanges are falling in price as there is no product, no news, no volotility. Investors are upset and lose faith. The projects did not think about liquidity at the beginning of the creation of the ICO and did not answer the main question: Why the token will grow in value as long as the project develops.

We have our own protocol. If you are interested in the technical part, pay attention to the FAQ: in section About LevelNet: https://levelnet.co/faq.html If you are interested in how it works from a deep technical point, you can read our patent document: https://levelnet.co/files/LevelNet%20Tech%20Patent.pdf If you have any questions, do not hesitate, we are ready to answer and tell you more about our technology.  If you read more carefully our white paper, you will be able to understand the objectives of ICO. We propose the following exit strategy for LVL tokens holders issued by LevelNet.   We took into account interests of diverse user groups and contributors and provide three exit strategies.  1. Short-term (up to one year) The growth of the token in the price on the crypto currency exchanges due to the provision of liquidity by a smart contract that performs the function of a buyback with the help of funds from the Buyback Fund. Smart contract automatically redeems tokens from the market by creating Market Order. Smart contract algorithms actually indicate to market participants that they can always sell tokens at a market price without delays, creating a demand for tokens. The buyback fund is formed at the expense of funds received during the ITO and the buy-back runs till the funds are exhausted in the fund.  2. Long-term (one year and more) Tokens owners who have not sold their tokens in a short-term strategy receive a preemptive right to exchange a token for a stake in the fund whose purpose is to acquire local cyber security companies with the subsequent integration of LevelNet technology into their products. The Fund provides for a gradual decrease in the equity participation of founders and transfer to participants, who invested in the following phases of ITO. Owning a share in the fund opens the possibility of participating in the distribution of profits. Payout Structure A smart contract allows token owners to receive payment from the Money Back and Buyback funds starting from the 60th day after the offering.  3. Output in the product (year and more) Tokens owners get access to using the LevelNet project software. Besides opens the ability to exchange tokens for subscription to use the API and SDK for corporate users. This, in turn, allows tokens owners to sell subscriptions to corporate and business users.",False

It's just like an antivirus, but it's not an classic antivirus. It is a network for exchanging antivirus protection between users. For users it is end-point protection solution app. LevelNet allows to protect users against the latest attacks that occur on the Internet about which antivirus vendors have not managed to secure their users. LevelNet client application receiving information from other users of the network,protects the device from attacks that were fixed by users with the same application.  For example: User #1 was susceptible to an attack on the Internet and Avast was installed. Avast blocked this attack. User #2 was also susceptible to attack on the Internet and it had NOD32 installed. Nod32 could not block the virus. User #3 does not have an antivirus. Result: Users #2 #3 was infected with a virus.
