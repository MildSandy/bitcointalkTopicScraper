ModoView will offer an innovative Mixed Reality (MR) framework for companies interested in easily creating their own MR applications, training courses and enterprise level solutions that can be fully compatible with common MR hardware (e.g. Microsoft Hololens). The blockchain solution can be implemented and integrated in the applications when requested by clients (e.g. in-app micro-transactions).  The idea is to develop a framework where enterprises can leverage an easy to use capability of quickly developing virtual and augmented reality applications. Rather than creating virtual and augmented reality through complex engineering, videography and design, we want to bring the ease and speed to the enterprise for MR. Our team has developed a simple framework structure where organizations can independently develop MR capabilities.  The framework will be geared towards reducing overall costs of trying to solve complex business problems through MR, giving those enterprises the independence to develop MR on their own while also having the option of having a full professional services team available from ModoView.  Our framework will include drag and drop features to quickly create modules, chapters and navigation around the MR application. It will allow easy positioning of augmented reality objects and sensory customization in immersive mixed reality settings.  ModoView understands that each market has a different business need. We are going to create tailored demos for various market segments like Medicine, Entertainment, Manufacturing, Retail, Education and Energy. Each market has massive potential to use MR. Medical markets will want to design custom VR solutions for medical procedures, Manufacturing will want to have augmented reality solutions for engineering of new products and testing, Retail will change the game by having virtual fashion shows and stores to purchase clothing and Energy will increase safety in high risk environments.  Our ModoView token (MODO) will be offered on the Waves Platform. To participate in our ICO, buy the MODO tokens on 1st October 2017 using the Decentralized Exchange (DEX) of the Waves client.   Bounty Program All the prizes will be transferred to the contributors from the tokens balance retained by the ModoView Team. The tokens transfer will take place at the end of ICO. Please find all the details in our White Paper.  Logo Contest Prize: 5000 MODO Description: If you are a designer, it’s your moment to propose a logo for our project! It will be used for every communication (internal and external) regarding ModoView.
