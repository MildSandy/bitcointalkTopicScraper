To upload a photo, a user must have their identity verified. Then each uploaded photo is cryptographically hashed into a relatively small code, and this hash is permanently linked to the user who uploaded it. This link forever exists in the blockchain, through the DCC. Each image will have its own unique hash, but if I were to upload the same image twice, it would have the same hash as the pixels of the image are what are used to create the hash.  A trail of ownership is set for every single photo that passes through the platform, based on this hash and its link to the owner.  Then each uploaded image, by every photographer, is scanned against the DCC for copyright infringement, to see if the hash is the same.  As for preventing a buyer from re-distributing the works. As blockchain records and timestamps every transaction, it is always possible to trace who has legal ownership of an image's license and who doesn't. In the case where an image is discovered where the user doesn't have rightful licensing, this is copyright infringement and is illegal!  At this point copyright law comes into place and the user has the possibility to pay huge fines and many other penalties. For Photochain also, our recent copyright partnership with Copytrack.io should help us to further enforce copyright rules off the Photochain platform.",False

The images in the demo can be downloaded freely and they are 800 px on the long side which is more than enough for the most usage cases. Basicaly they are easy to be stolen. This was one of the main reasons many pro photographers refused to upload to 500px. #2: Are you going to accept editorial images or just commercial like Fotolia? #3: Can I use a pseudonim as a seller? I know I need to upload an ID to the site like every other stock site. But if want to stay anonymous (not knowing my real name) for the buyers do I have this option?

Blockchain allows instant payments in a matter of seconds. In many existing platforms, you are paid once per month for all the licenses sold during the month.  Blockchain also allows better copyright protection services. In current stock photography platforms, a manual team of people and compare if photos are copies of each other. However, this is time consuming and expensive. Blockchain allows each uploaded image to be analysed and compared to each other image in the decentralized database in a few moments to check for copyright infringement. A decentralized digital chain of ownership is maintained and therefore any image uploaded not by the indicated owner is immediately known.  All this improvement in services is what allows fees charged to photographers to be reduced from as much as 90% down to as little as 5%. Blockchain essentially automises, transfers data more efficiently and helps keep track of ownership much more effectively than existing systems can.",False

To upload a photo, a user must have their identity verified. Then each uploaded photo is cryptographically hashed into a relatively small code, and this hash is permanently linked to the user who uploaded it. This link forever exists in the blockchain, through the DCC. Each image will have its own unique hash, but if I were to upload the same image twice, it would have the same hash as the pixels of the image are what are used to create the hash.  A trail of ownership is set for every single photo that passes through the platform, based on this hash and its link to the owner.  Then each uploaded image, by every photographer, is scanned against the DCC for copyright infringement, to see if the hash is the same.  As for preventing a buyer from re-distributing the works. As blockchain records and timestamps every transaction, it is always possible to trace who has legal ownership of an image's license and who doesn't. In the case where an image is discovered where the user doesn't have rightful licensing, this is copyright infringement and is illegal!  At this point copyright law comes into place and the user has the possibility to pay huge fines and many other penalties. For Photochain also, our recent copyright partnership with Copytrack.io should help us to further enforce copyright rules off the Photochain platform.",False

So the most prominent thing about blockchain is that it allows transactions to be peer to peer. The problem with current stock photography platforms is that by uploading a photo to them, you are in fact giving your right of ownership over to them and then they have the rights to sell at their own price, decide on licensing type etc... With our p2p platform you keep the ownership of your own images, thus being able to set your own pricing and your own licensing type.  Also blockchain allows speed of payment. In many existing platforms, you are paid once per month for all the licenses sold during the month. But why? Again this comes down to you no longer having ownership, so you are in fact invoicing the stock photography platform for a royalty fee. Blockchain allows instant payments in a matter of seconds.  Blockchain also allows better copyright protection services. In current stock photography platforms, a manual team of people and compare if photos are copies of each other. However, this is time consuming and expensive. Blockchain allows each uploaded image to be analysed and compared to each other image in the decentralized database in a few moments to check for copyright infringement. A decentralized digital chain of ownership is maintained and therefore any image uploaded not by the indicated owner is immediately known.  All this improvement in services is what allows fees charged to photographers to be reduced from as much as 90% down to as little as 5%. Blockchain essentially automises, transfers data more efficiently and helps keep track of ownership much more effectively than existing systems can.",False

The new sale structure is as follows:  ICO Main Sale I “Community ♡ Sale”, for 3 days: (open sale, non-capped within hard cap but with smaller individual maximum transaction amount)  Start date: 06.04.2018 at 00:00 am CET End date: 08.04.2018 at 23:59 pm CET  Time based discounts for tokens price during the Main Sale I Event: Day 1 to 3: -30% discount => 1 PHT = 0.084 USD with optional (voluntary) vesting period of 12 months: -40% discount => 1 PHT = 0.072 USD  Maximum transaction amount: 25 ETH  ICO Main Sale II “Braveheart Sale”, for 30 days: (open sale, non-capped within hard cap limit)  Start date: 09.04.2018 at 00:00 pm CET End date: 08.05.2018 at 23:59 pm CET  Time based discounts for tokens price during the Main Sale II Event: Day 1 to 10: -30% discount => 1 PHT = 0.084 USD with optional (voluntary) vesting period of 4 months: -35% discount => 1 PHT = 0.080 USD Day 11 to 30: -20% discount => 1 PHT = 0.096 USD with optional (voluntary) vesting period of 6 months: -25% discount => 1 PHT = 0.090 USD  Maximum transaction amount: 10,000 ETH  ICO Main Sale III “Remnant Sale”, additional 20 days: (open sale, non-capped within hard cap limit)  Start date: 11.06.2018 at 00:00 am CET End date: 30.06.2018 at 23:59 pm CET  Time based discounts for tokens price during the Main Sale III Event: Day 01 to 10: -10% discount => 1 PHT = 0.108 USD with optional (voluntary) vesting period of 8 months: -15% discount => 1 PHT = 0.102 USD Day 11 to 20: -5% discount => 1 PHT = 0.114 USD with optional (voluntary) vesting period of 10 months: -10% discount => 1 PHT = 0.108 USD  Maximum transaction amount:10,000 ETH  FULL DETAILS HERE: https://medium.com/photochain/important-positive-structure-changes-to-main-sale-77060478434b",False

In 1984, at age 10, he had developed and sold his first video game. Four years later he began an entrepreneurship career when, authorised by Italy’s court for minors, he opened his first IT company. In the formative years of the Internet he expanded his business reach into the online world and quickly found his services in great demand.  Roberto, specialised in Lawful Interception systems and big data analysis, is also a consultant to law enforcement agencies. He moved to Asia a decade ago, Roberto is now a renown Blockchain expert, associate of the Nxt Foundation and the first to apply Blockchain technology to supply chain and trade finance.

Many other projects have not done this and offer no extensive way for photographers to guarantee copyright protection. This was one of our main pillars from the start and today, as you can see across our channels, we have announced a very strategic partnership with Copytrack, a company that has existed in the copyright market for several years now in order to amplify our copyright protection 3 - our team consists of professionals with a wide background in many different areas. these expertise all come together and cover all skills that are needed in order to run a success ICO and business. 4 - in addition to number 3, our advisors include some very experienced individuals, covering all aspects of the project's needs both pre-ICO and post-ICO. On this front, later this week we will announce our latest advisor, a very well known name in the blockchain space who sees our potential too. 5 - we are advised by Swisscom Blockchain. They are a very well known, very professional Blockchain advisory service. They picked us to for them to work with us, not the other way around. They see the potential in what we plan to offer that they don't see in other projects. 6 - we won 3rd place at the Blockchain Leadership Summit. Our product offering (by showing our Demo) is miles ahead of what anybody else has and the judges (who were very experienced blockchain individuals) agreed completely. 7 - ask the photographers. We have received the backing of the photographers over other projects as we put their needs first. More than a hundred photographers have registered their interest in taking part in our alpha and we have plenty more in the pipeline. We expect this number to grow exponentially as we finalise our product. 8 - since we've announced we've seen our competitors pivot in order to copy our offering. i won't name names, but there are a few out there for sure. 9 - our development team consists of some of the best developers available in smart contract solutions. you can check them out yourselves via our website. 10 - our focus. competitors often focus on too many things. our offering is simple - we are creating a platform for trading photography, whilst giving the power and the protection to the photographers.",False

Because the photostock industry is overdue for change. The industry is controlled by only a few very big players, which makes things harder for photographers to make a decent living from their work 2. We want to give the power back to photographers. As blockchain simplifies and removes the need for many intermediary processes, the emphasis becomes totally on the photographer and their work. Our full scale service has rebuilt each aspect of the photostock process, using technology to create a seamless experience. At the end of the day, photographers receive much more protection and reward for each of their works. 3. Because we have a great team. Photochain was created from the view of amateur photographers who couldn't understand why photostocks are so difficult. All team members are experienced in their own field, but recognize the potential of Photochain to truly make a difference in its industry. We all have the same ethos, that we want to give power back to the photographers and work around the clock for this to be a success. 4. Our potential has been recognized by highly respected individuals in the blockchain industry. Recently we've won 3rd place at the ICO Pitch Competition at the Blockchain Leadership Summit and we've also been highly recognized in the mainstream media for our potential. See more of our news and articles on our webpage. 5. Because we have a great community and userbase. Already, we have hundreds of photographers interested in taking part in our alpha. Once we have a fully developed platform, we know that the interest will only grow. And rapidly we expect.",False

Traditional photostocks are often associated with limitations and high fees for the photographer - these businesses can end up taking 90% of the works’ earnings. With Photochain, the lack of need for an intermediary means the seller sets their own terms of sale, and can take home 95% of the revenue generated from sales. The other 5% goes into a community pot, which is used for rewarding moderators and upkeep of the network.    Characteristics of Photochain DApp   Security The benefit of blockchain technology means transactions are fully secure and verifiable at all times for both the photographer and the buyer Decentralised storage Digital works, as well as all transaction data are stored in a decentralised and encrypted manner. This is done using the IPFS protocol and Photochain DB. Contents The DApp is to be used exclusively for trading stock photography. Content that doesn’t fit the rules will be filtered using in-house developed bots. Copyright By employing machine learning bots and also incentivising of the Photochain community through rewards.  Photochain Token facts  Trading on Photochain DApp is conducted through PHOTON token (PHT). PHOTON token is the means of rewarding used across the Photochain Ecosystem.
