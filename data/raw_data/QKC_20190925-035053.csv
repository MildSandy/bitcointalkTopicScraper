Can i still get rebate rewards? You are still eligible for basic rewards but cannot get rebate rewards because the Elf Guardian that you voted is not elected. 4️⃣ Only when voting starts in April then the rewards start? The eariler you stake, the more votes you will get, which means more rewards. 5️⃣What is the rebate reward? It is based on that Elf Guardian's promise. 6️⃣Can I stake QKC in my metamask for votes? Yes, you can. Tutorial: https://www.reddit.com/r/quarkchainio/comments/b4btlr/stepbystep_tutorial_staking_qkc_for_votes_in/""",False

If dApps are quick to jump onboard, QuarkChain could quickly find itself right up there among other major blockchains. Potential investors should keep a keen eye on this project.  Risks     Competition should be fierce with other projects undoubtedly coming along and attempting to compete in this market. Current projects, such as Zilliqa, will be competing directly with QuarkChain. Also, Ethereum is working to solve their scaling problems in the near future. -1.5     Although it doesn’t appear to have dampened the enthusiasm of potential investors, only 20% of tokens are available for purchase during the token sale, which is quite low compared to other ICOs. The 35%-65% range is preferable. -0.5  Growth Potential     QuarkChain has demonstrating 2,000 TPS on their closed testnet while using only a few AWS nodes, putting it ahead of most blockchain 3.0 projects with higher valuations. As more and more nodes are used in the testnet, higher scalability should be achieved. In comparison, the Ethereum blockchain is currently supporting around 15 TPS. +4     With high profile YouTubers promoting QuarkChain, multiple ICO investment spreadsheets ranking QuarkChain at the top, and a massive Telegram membership of 80,000 and growing, the hype surrounding the QuarkChain ICO has been tremendous causing extremely high interest from investors. The private sale sold out quickly with many potential investors unable to participate. With only $4 million USD available for purchase during the public sale, the demand is currently greater than the supply. The hype factor cannot be ignored in the current ICO climate. +3     QuarkChain has integrated the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for smart contracts, which allows dApps built on the EVM the ability to be directly deployed on the QuarkChain Platform. This is a huge advantage for dApps looking to migrate easily to a platform that accepts ERC20 compatible apps as well as delivers speed well beyond what Ethereum can. +3  Disposition If QuarkChain stays on course with its roadmap, they are extremely likely to become a major player in the blockchain industry. With their highly respectable team, an MVP (testnet), major hype, and investors chomping at the bit, QuarkChain receives a rating of 8.0 out of 10. Proof: https://hacked.com/ico-analysis-quarkchain/  This is a very good result!",False
