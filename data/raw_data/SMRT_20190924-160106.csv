Think of a vending machine that dispenses templates of smart contracts with a row for business formation, a row for intellectual property, a row for funding, a row for trading etc. Choose your template, insert your token, and get going on filling in the contract or engaging an expert to help you. The SMRT project is to create this vending machine and the user interface to turn the templates into executable contracts.  We are focused on the clearly defined ecosystem of startups and small businesses, providing automatically enforced contracts that enable them to trade and function.  WE AIM TO MAKE BLOCKCHAIN MORE ACCESSIBLE  Our team includes a Member of the European Parliament, Professors and highly skilled and experienced talent, connections and expertise in blockchain, AI, entrepreneurship, funding, intellectual property, government and regulation.
