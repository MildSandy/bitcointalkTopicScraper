Some ico's have over 20 people, and that's without maintenance staff.

The Kerberos Coin is a startup GPU Only Crypto mining company based in Gauteng South Africa. The South African Landscape for Crypto Farming is still in a very early stage of adoption and development. Demand for mining operations worldwide will increase exponentially over the next few years to ensure the long term stability of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain applications. South Africa is a flourishing country with world class commercial infrastructure and relatively inexpensive electricity supply, which makes it a very suitable environment for the Kerberos Coin Project.  KRC Information  Coin name is Kerberos â€“ Abbreviation: KRC ICO start date is the 1st of April 2018 12:00 AM GMT and runs until 12:00AM GMT the 1st May 2018. The Coin offering will be open to the global public. Restrictions apply for residents of Germany and US-based investors. Kerberos Coin is based on the ERC20 protocol, which determines that up to 10 million coins will be issued with the first round discount of 34% (US$0.12). The final coin allocation is set up as follows:  88% Investors  5% Founders  4% Kerberos Company  3% Bounty Program   Token Discount and Sales  o   First round of 2,900 000 million tokens will be sold at 34% discount (US$0.12) o   Second round of 2,900 000 million tokens at 15% discount (US$0.14) o   The last 3,000 000 million tokens will sell at its original price of US$ 0.16   Kerberos is not a minable Coin. Dividends to be paid out in Ethereum quarterly to secure wallet.  Funding Goals  The soft cap funding goal is US$ 500,000 with a hard cap of US$ 1.2 million.  Invested funds will be allocated as follows: Ninety percent (90%) of funds for acquisition of hardware and initiation and completion of operational infrastructure. Five percent (5%) Infrastructure and Marketing Five percent (5%) Research and development. In the event that soft cap is not reached at closing of ICO, the investors will be contacted with a proposal to continue operation at a profitable scale.   The premises preparation will only commence once an ETA on hardware delivery has been confirmed. Estimated return on investment (ROI) is projected to be between 7â€“10 months, depending on current difficulty and profitability of the Crypto environment at any given time.  Dividend Payouts  The proposal is that all profits after deductions will be divided as follows: Each coin will entitle its holder to their pro-rata share of 70% of the companyâ€™s profits after deductions every quarter for the duration of the project. The other 30% is then reinvested into additional mining equipment and the development and improvement of Kerberos Company. The amount of dividends is a pro-rata share of the tokens held by our investors at the time of dividend declaration. The dividends are calculated and paid out quarterly in Ethereum.
