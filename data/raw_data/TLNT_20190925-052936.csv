The goal was simple: make the process cheap and quick, while giving both parties the control they deserve. 2013 marked the start of iCasting’s revolution to change the casting market. We have a mission to rule out agents to connect clients and talents directly to each other. We have worked two hard years to make our dream come true. Finally, in 2015, the launch of iCasting was met with great succes. Right now we're serving 0,8% of the dutch markets’ total population and have become it’s largest talent database!               Today it’s time to take the next step. With the use of blockchain technology and the Talent Token. The whole world is opening up to us. We will decentralise the process and put full control and security in the hands of our clients and talents. Large fees and slow communications will be a thing of the past. It’s time to sideline the casting agencies. It’s time to disrupt not only the dutch market but the market globally.

The team behind iCasting is a combination of experienced managers, skilled professionals, blockchain experts and entrepreneurs with a proven trackrecord in marketing, development, ICOs and startups. The founders gained their knowledge in running an advertisement agency since 2001, a professional music label since 2007 and a successful international award-winning media startup since 2015. They already have a professional pool of 80+ loyal employees, who are always ready to contribute and help out other companies within the holding. The advertisement agency is the perfect partner for international marketing and PR campaigns for iCasting. All new ideas and companies are founded out of market frustrations. With this the founders always stayed close to their burning fire from within to create new markets and to make the media and talent landscape in its whole a little more convenient. The advisory board adds a great proven track record in successful ICOs and blockchain projects and adds valuable knowledge on finance, legal and tax regulations.",False
