Unfortunately, it is currently the case that we are still in a bear market, most altcoin don't do well. Furthermore.. Unfortunately, not so many people are interested in startups, as a good year ago ... but! Swissborg is constantly working on publishing the Wealth app and CHSB will be the heart of the ecosystem. What does that mean? It means that as Swissborg releases more products or services, CHSB will gain more useful utilites. The current utility is the possibility to take apart on the referendums, which are curerntly on hold as the teams works 100% on the wealth app... a fee reducing & buy & back utility is planned for the wealth app. as people use the app to invest, they have to pay fees.. a part of the fees will used to buy chsb back from the market and burned.. and more utilites are planned...  Cyrus (CEO of SB) mentionied at the AMA yesterday that he's going to build a TEAM just for the CHSB token to drive the price and volume up (hopefully). He will start with that project next week.",False

For institutional investors, exclusive investment opportunities are planned, which the team has not disclosed yet. The Wealth App offers financial services for EVERYONE, which, as far as I know, does not yet exist. Wealth management used to be something for the richer people on this planet due to high fees. The OEMS should be groundbreaking and really unique. It analyzes the liquidity and volume across different currencies (also FIAT) and tokens to find the cheapest price. In Q1 / Q2 2020, the team plans to release Crypto indices.  Quote ""Swissborg offers wealth management. As A Wealth client of the upcoming wealth app, you will have access to a simple gateway to themed crypto indices (and other investment products) , from proven experienced investment professionals and therefore alpha generation. Also, if you buy CHSB, holding a multi utility token with an ongoing decreasing circulating supply that provides also a fee  reducing mechanism  for transaction (like bnb) on the wealth app. Moreover as chsb holder you become part of the ecosystem where you get rewarded  for taking part on referendums.

Swissborg is a project of the A + class. The team is top, they deliver highend results and are just placed at cmc rank 430, this is ridiculous. The bear market will separate the wheat from the shell of the grain and the good projects will survive. Swissborg will be one of them.

Its clear that many ppl have invested in Swissborg, without knowing what they have actually invested in. At the time when the project was still just an idea, the only planned utility was to share the company's gains through referendums with the ICO investors. This is of course initially a very trivial utility, since the startup probably generates little to nothing or even loses capital in the first 3 years. The team even considered (if legally possible) to have CHSB as security, which wasn't possible because there was and there is STILL no legal regulatory framework. Over time concepts change radically, especially future-oriented conecpts. Yesterday ICO, today STO. Today STO, tomorrow something totally different.  Meanwhile, the team knows that the future belongs to STOs (yet), especially multi-utility tokens and tokens which are treated as securities. Binance (BNB as multi utility token) has done it and the team takes their token as example and want even to make it better than binance.. There is a possibility that CHSB will never become a security / stock but will forever remain a multi utility token that develop further as network token on investment platform and other services Swissborg will offer in future. There remains a lot of speculation and blurry. But I'm sure the team knows what they're doing, I trust them. But I don't force you to trust them too, thats your choice  Source:   I hope I didnt write down anything wrong. Text may contain errors https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0wkVsRZdwo (13:10) - Speaker:  Alex Fazel (Head of Communications)  Let's cut through it, CHSB won't only have a  meaning for referendums, but will be also at the same time the heart of the ecosystem. Cool, isn't it?  Things certainly remain exciting.  ",False

They attended panels, joined workshops, gave talks, made friends and exchanged ideas with like-minded crypto influencers and enthusiasts.  The Illumina Tribe, as the event organizers like to be called, aims to grow community and enable the union of like-minded people working towards a common vision of the future. They organize events that aim to bring people together and expand the minds and hearts of those who are breaking path in this pioneering space.  Cyrus Fazel participated on a panel with influencers Jonathan Teo and Geo Star, about the Evolution of Value. The philosophical, social, and the empirical notions of ‘value’ were explored. How has the definition of value changed because of the changes in the way we transact and interact? How can we value a token, a piece of information, data, or a tribe of people thinking about solutions?  Along with the great panels and talks, the SwissBorg team attended workshops in the beautiful surroundings of Villa Illumina, that included yoga and mental concentration courses. But, with this symposium even more so than others, the biggest benefits were the minds met, connections made, and ideas bounced around.  Among the lessons learned and shared, the two most important were: the value of community and the need for courage. Caring for the community is essential in this space, because if we want to move to a new era of business and wealth management that is more transparent and meritocratic we have to nurture our community and see those who enable our projects as members of our tribe rather than as clients who are ‘other’ to us, as in traditional banking and business.  “To show our commitment to community” Cyrus Fazel explains, “we took the responsible decision to shift from HODL to CODL (Contributing On Dear Life)!” We need, more than ever, to remind ourselves of our disruptive DNA and our significant reliance on the collective efforts and support of our community.  Courage is indispensable because we are breaking new ground, stepping into the unknown, and it is going to be a bumpy ride! We need the courage to persevere. We need not fear mistakes but learn from them, fear is part and parcel of path breaking, without overcoming it we cannot move forward. The Villa Illumina Crypto Conference gave us this clear takeaway: we need to strengthen the bonds of our community and shed our fear of making mistakes in order to turn into reality the future we envision. https://medium.com/@swissborg/crypto-symposium-at-villa-illumina-building-community-bc459e663a3f",False

With the SwissBorg Monthly (our first hence the lengthiness) we aim to keep you informed of our development and progress, because an informed and actively engaged community is at the essence of our meritocratic approach.  We have reached many of our objectives since the end of the ICO just a little over four months ago:  Our first referendum which is our principal way of tapping into our community’s swarm intelligence and at the core of our promise of meritocracy, was successfully completed in April.  We have managed to get listed on four exchanges and more are coming.  Our tech team in Canada and Switzerland is growing with best of breed engineers.  We are progressing in the development of our Mobile App. We expect to have the first version released by the end of the year.  The funds collected during the ICO have been successfully hedged from the beginning of the downward trend and we are finalizing strategic alliances with DAOs.  Despite the aggressive competitive environment, most notably Coinbase’s acquisition and development strategy, we see many opportunities in the crypto wealth management space, especially in Europe and Asia where there are no recognized on-chain fintech leaders in the field. Proud of our project and our team we want to grow at a responsible pace that meets our standards of quality and is also compliant with regulations.    In the future, through CADO (Customization, Automation, Decentralization and Optimization), on-chain wealth management will accelerate the very process of wealth creation. Tomorrow individuals will not only create investment portfolios out of their financial savings, but also through the tokenization of their assets: house, arts, cars or stocks but also datas. This is what we are calling holistic wealth management. SwissBorg leverages blockchain to create a robust yet accessible technology to embrace this new paradigm and our mobile app smart wallet is the first piece of the puzzle. Our strategy requires serious investment, talent hunt and timely crisp execution. This is Day1 for the on-chain financial industry and for SwissBorg and its community.  https://medium.com/swissborg/the-swissborg-monthly-may-2018-aea30f72b964",False

A graduate of the University of Novi Sad — Faculty of Technical Sciences, Serbia, in Engineering and Media Management, she is a skilled administrator. But, like many on the SwissBorg team, she is much more than her job title connotes. Maja is a vibrant organizer, a can-do team player, with enough energy to match the multitudes of tasks that she takes on with confidence.  It is easy to understand what makes her such an enthusiastic team leader when she explains her many years of being a Pilates and Aerobics instructor, her big passion in life.  Born in Serbia before the fall of the Berlin Wall, Maja is no stranger to war and strife. Perhaps, that is why she loves nature, sports and animals. Peace, she realized, early in life, is precious and life is to be lived fully because it is a gift denied to many. Married to a professional handball player, Maja had the opportunity to travel all over Europe and gain invaluable experience working with people from different cultures. Her resilient character and happy disposition helped Maja to travel widely and adapt quickly everywhere she went.  Fluent in four languages, including her native Serbian plus Hungarian, English, and French. Maja took to blogging while traveling and living in foreign places, in two languages, about food, lifestyle, and health.  Having moved to Lausanne because of her husband’s job, three years ago, Maja decided she wanted to work in a job that put the managerial skills that she had learned at the University and the soft skills she acquired, teaching, travelling, and writing, to good use.  In SwissBorg she found a perfect match — a young and pioneering company with a great startup culture that felt like a family but was in urgent need of better organization and structure because it was growing fast.  Maja was not only excited about working at a pathbreaking company on the blockchain but also happy to become the team’s drill sergeant, the one who makes people move, her many years of Aerobic teaching, where you make a group of people work hard and sweat to the same rhythm came in handy!  At SwissBorg Maja manages many tasks, but her main mission is to manage our workflow and liaise with the different team members and our CEO and other department heads. Super organized and motivated she plans to improve communication within the team and increase productivity through better workplace structure & workflow strategy. She, also, plays a Human Resources role, interviewing & recruiting the many candidates that the company is busy hiring.  When asked what she likes most about her job, she answers, “I love the sense of belonging to a family and a larger community that working for SwissBorg provides, I like putting my energy to use towards a collective goal that aims to use blockchain technology to change an entire industry, with the promise of making it more meritocratic, transparent, and decentralized.” https://medium.com/swissborg/meet-maja-miloradovic-ceo-assistant-at-swissborg-113932825c7c",False

With a mathematician for a father, as a child Lomig possessed computing skills beyond his years. From the early age of 12 he began programming. When asked what attracted him to programming, he answers, “the pristine logic of it, the capacity to command the computer to perform tasks, solve problems, and the vast ability it gives one to create.”  Lomig studied computer science at the prestigious EPFL, where he received both his bachelor and his master in the field. For his master thesis in the area of Programming by Example, he helped develop an app, Pong Designer, which provides analyses of examples that is fed in order to create simple games.  For his final year internship Lomig went to work in the private bank Pictet & Cie. It was his first time working in finance but it was a very traditional bank, he learned quickly that the stiff traditional world of banking was not for him, it made him feel restrained and unchallenged.  In London he went to work for a startup in the AdTech industry which was much more appealing to him both professionally and culturally. There he got a taste for the dynamic and small startup culture that was, hard working, team oriented, and open minded. Lomig realized that he loved to work with a diverse but small group of people who were passionate about their work.  Upon returning to Switzerland for personal reasons, Lomig decided to devote himself to research. He joined the impressive, EU funded, Human Brain Project as a big data engineer, where he engaged in fascinating work with great minds trying to understand the most sophisticated of all computers: the human brain.  Before joining SwissBorg Lomig worked for the giant multinational, Cisco Systems as a software engineer. He wanted to witness the big company process and was interested in seeing how to coordinate with hundreds of people, in a decentralized workflow.  At home in the rapidly expanding world of computer science, Lomig is an active member of the OSS community. As well as being active in other open source projects, he has created a small library that is downloaded by tens of thousands of people every month.  After gaining experience in different fields and work spaces, Lomig returned to work in a startup because that is the space in which he is most happy and creative. When asked why he joined SwissBorg he replies, “I wanted to work on the blockchain because I love the technicality of it, I find it interesting and challenging and full of promise for the future of transforming the way we interact. I’m also glad to have a chance to work with Scala in which I’m specialized, my professor Martin Odersky was the creator of Scala, and am very glad to work with Nicolas Rémond, SwissBorg’s head of engineering who has a stellar reputation in the field.”  Lomig brings to SwissBorg his expertise in software, Scala and big data engineering, his passion for solving problems, and his experience working on big projects with a diverse and large group of people in a decentralized fashion. He believes that blockchain technology can create a future of finance and human connectivity that is more efficient, transparent and decentralized. He wants to help SwissBorg pave the way to this new and improved future. https://medium.com/swissborg/meet-lomig-m%C3%A9gard-swissborgs-senior-engineer-scala-expert-in-lausanne-4b01006fde2f",False

The CHSB is also used for the voting in they're Metocratic System and you will get revenue when you participate the votes.  Of course, the current price is very dissapointing for all ICO's buyers (as me...), but there is also a big chance to buy a lot of CHSB for a good price. Im not the pump and dump trader, its a very long term investment for me. For the moment, there are 576'000'000 tokens in the market - when Swissborg will reach a Marketcap of 1 Bil.

I was placed into a high school that had low expectations for its graduates: not one had attended a formal university. Instead of following the standard path for women in the area, getting married and becoming a housewife, I pushed aside my high school responsibilities and independently studied English from scratch for 14 hours a day for two years. After eight attempts at the university-entrance English test, I became the first student from my high school who was accepted to a formal university.  During my junior year of college, I founded TEDxRoppongi with the mission of encouraging social innovation by creating a platform for thinkers and innovators in Japan. Through designing TED-like experiences, I found my passion for creating experiences that help people connect, communicate, and collaborate. I have, since, dedicated my efforts to create empowering experiences for global women’s initiatives, such as iamtheCODE: a movement to advance STEAMD education and create 1 million women and girls coders by 2030; Girls20: a program to cultivate a new generation of female leaders and increase female labor force participation worldwide; Womenwill: a Google initiative to create economic opportunity for women everywhere, and help transform ways of working to make workplace practices more inclusive.  “The future is already here — it’s just not evenly distributed.”  In blockchain technology, I see an opportunity for a more transparent and meritocratic future. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is here and already transforming the way we work, play, and live. As a tech enthusiast and a community builder, it’s absolutely exciting to leverage my skills to support SwissBorg in its mission to shape a new era of wealth management: evolving age-old models of finance into a distributed, transparent, and accessible-to-all system for creating wealth; building a community of trust and fairness, and bringing more people into the future of money and wealth management",False

In case one of the team member wants to leave the company or do not commit enough to stay in the company, the remaining amount of his tokens will be given to the person that will replace him.  3) 2,5% to bounties and Advisors.  4) We are here to stay and shape the future of banking  5) Website is constantly being updated with new professionals joining our team and soon we will update our ""team slide"" in this forum. Linkedin profiles are real and I dont see anything wrong there.  Best regards, Deni.",False
