Here you can see the chart with candles and blocks, the book order and the recent trades and the block for placing orders. As we have described earlier we will support 7 order types. But several such algorithmic orders can be bought with the main two types of order, market and limit.  For placing any order you will need to log in to the ESCB exchange via the purple button at the top right hand corner. We don’t split sign up and log in operations. An internal account will be created after the first login and become bonded with your ETH address. A user can use 4 ways for sign in/ sign up process:  Metamask; Ledger; Trezor; Create a wallet; Unlock a wallet;  ESCB DEX sign in/sign up page In our ESCB exchange, we have 6 menu items.  “Trade” item is used for all operations related to trading. “My account” item contains your counterparties address book, the history of interactions, ratings and other information from the blockchain. “My profile” item contains all “personal data“ that you want to share with other counterparties. Some nodes of the HWM demands KYC, some do not. “News” item contains information about new markets and announcements. We plan to expand this menu item and include market information that can help to trade. “Talks” item contains all interactions via the internal secure chatting platform in the processes of resolving dispute issues in process of operation between you and counterparty. “Notifications” item contains the information about events related to your orders and can require action from your side. For example, to close a deal you must confirm operation, etc.  We are only at the beginning of an epoch new DEX generation and soon we will publish ESCB DEX on Testnet and share code as open source.

We decided to add this type of deposit for making quick deals during the day. This will allow traders to perform thousands of transactions per day. At the same time, our platform will not have more than 5% of the total deposits on each depositary account in HMW, this is to minimize possible attacks on the blockchain infrastructure of the ESCB exchange. It will also serve as evidence that our exchange will not be able to control our customer deposits.  To maintain decentralization, we added a pending transaction. Under such a transaction, one of the participants makes a deposit for the transaction using HMW, and the second one fulfills the conditions of the transaction, after which it receives the deposited funds.  Consider an example of a transaction on the example of buying 1 ETH for $ 100. Seller 1 ETH has on deposit the amount that is reserved for the transaction. The buyer receives the details for the transfer of p2p, for example from card to card. After confirming the transfer, the amount of 1 ETH is transferred to the buyer. At this stage, there could be possible disputes between the parties of the transaction. To solve such situations there is a “Talks” section on the ESCB exchange, which allows you to exchange messages between the counterparties to the transaction. If the dispute cannot be resolved, then a moderator is added to the conversation.  A natural problem in such a situation is trust between the parties. To do this, all messages in the conversation will be confidential. We have developed our own confidential correspondence system based on the elliptic curves of the ETH keys of the blockchain.   Photo by Haley Lawrence on Unsplash Such a communication channel works in the following simplified way:  Bob and Alice each have two keys — open, which is used to generate the ETH address of the wallet and closed, which is used to sign transactions. At the stage of forming a new communication channel, Bob generates a new key pair, public and private (identity), and encrypts this identity channel with Alice’s public key. At this stage in the database for two counterparties, there is an identity channel encrypted with the public key for Bob and Alice. This provides a confidential channel for their communication. To send a message, Bob decrypts with his private key the identity channel. Encodes the message with the public key of the identity channel and sends it. Alice and Bob use the identity channel private key to read all messages in a confidential channel. If the process of the transaction requires assistance in resolving the dispute. Then Bob or Alice can invite other participants to the group through the following mechanism.  One of the parties, for example, Alice, presses the button — to invite the moderator into the conversation. Identity channel is encrypted in Bob’s browser with the public key of the moderator and is recorded in the database. The moderator decrypts the private key of the identity channel and can use a confidential channel of communication with the parties to the transaction. If in the course of the transaction it is necessary to provide evidence in the form of images or other media files, they are encrypted by the identity channel and recorded in ipfs. Such files can be obtained by a hash code by anyone who has it. But such files can only be decrypted using the identity channel.  The advantages of such a scheme for building a confidential communication channel:  Only encryption keys available in the user’s browser are used. This eliminates a middle-man attack. All data is sent via end-to-end encryption. Generation of an identity channel does not require the participation of the server part or any other party, as is the case in the algorithm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange Identity channel is stored in an encrypted form for each participant in a confidential conversation. This eliminates the possibility of its leakage by hacking the database. The ability to add an unlimited number of participants in the conversation. The good speed of encoding and decoding messages, as one identity channel is used for all messages and files in a confidential conversation. For each communication channel a new identity channel is formed, so if one identity channel leaks, it is impossible to read other channels. The only possible disadvantage of this construction scheme:  In case of a leak of the private key of one of the participants in a confidential conversation, as it is possible to read all the messages in the channel. It is not possible to use the server performance for a search. Any string search can be performed only on the client side, but due to each deal in creating a new channel, the data length for a search will be limited.

As was expected our current implementation “matching engine” won’t allow you to produce matching orders at more than 60 orders per second, that equivalent is 720 000 orders per 24 hours.

The difference is that this sort of trade is carried out offline, counterparties cannot specifically know about the trade, only about the time of execution. This type of trade demands an escrow, only from one side, the counterparty must complete all expected actions by agreement for closing such a trade. For example, let us consider an exchange process for BTC_JPY. In this case, Alice wants to buy 1 BTC for 1 000 000 (1M) JPY, Bob creates a sell limit order with parameters: 1 BTC as the Quantity and the Limit Price at 1M, Alice creates a buy limit order with parameters: 1 BTC as the Quantity and the Limit Price at 1M. When the “matching engine” is faced with this order it creates the trade with “deferred” status, as opposed to the typical “closed” status. In this status, no one asset is transferred until it is actioned. ESCB exchange platform creates a “Talk” channel for such trades, we have described this service in our earlier articles. The key aspect is security in providing such a trade. Bob, who owns crypto assets, will wait until the transfer of external assets from Alice and only after this moment will “confirm” trade. After this confirmation escrow will transfer to the counterparty 100% of the value. Before sending external assets Alice has the option to “refuse” this deal. Then escrow will return to Bob 100% of the value. But what happens if Alice could only transfer 50% of the deal (or any part thereof) of the agreement amount due to a bank issue? This is when counterparties can ask for arbitration and that will resolve any disputes. The typical escrow deal can be closed without any 3rd party intervention but when a counterparty sees some suspicious offer or action and are faced with a force majeure, he/she can ask arbitration to close such a deal in a particular mode. In such cases, the arbitration will participate in “Talk” and will make a decision after listening to both sides. The trade will be decided by arbitration after a dispute resolution. Orders from a trade which has been resolved will not be created additionally. After this moment such trades will have a “closed” status and will be seen on tickers and trade feed as basic trades. The main concepts for deferred trades: Only one person from counterparties needs to call for arbitration. Only if arbitration is used, the current Talk messages will be accessible for exploring. Any messages and files will be encrypted by channel identity. Any user can set up a welcome message with some conditions and information about accepted payment methods or any other financial information. Any KYC procedures must be processed by counterparties, ESCB platform is not responsible for any risks related to counterparties rights on any assets that can be involved in an exchange. As a method of confirming any rights on assets, a user can demand the counterparty to provide a picture with the current financial data including   a credit/debit card with the first 4 and last 4 numbers hidden, signed by the counterparty The sandbox mode is not used on the blockchain. For production environment we will be using HMW smart contract, this will avoid any possible scam schemes. For the production environment, a rating system will be available to use based on the blockchain. This will allow for trusted trader status. P.S For the 20 days in the sandbox testing mode 2 084 871 orders were tested, 771 557 trades with 1 138 instruments. The next step in our roadmap is the preparation of publishing the open source.

We are calling it an IITO - Infinite Initial Token Offering.  The IITO start period will be known, but the end period will depend on the amount of funds collected at each stage. Thus, the IITO EscrowBlock will be terminated after the acquisition of all tokens on offer at each stage. During the IITO, companies and individuals investing in the EscrowBlock initiative will pay for distributed tokens through payments in cryptocurrencies or fiat.  IITO has a defence with a long period of establishment. It is the ""Control time"". The ""Control time"" is defined as 1 year. If at the end of this period the first stage is not fully funded then all proceeds will be refunded automatically, except fiat payments, which will be refunded manually.  This new type of ICO, IITO, will protect investors from over-foundation and will save money if the initiative does not get fulfilled.  What is the aim of the project?  The aim of the project is to create an EscrowBlock escrow platform for the Ethereum network blockchain. Such a platform can work as an independent environment, or be integrated into other Smart contracts  (see whitepaper), to provide escrow services as part of any other projects. The team will start the project on Mainnet Ethereum blockchain and then make a fork for providing an independent service.  Video presentation   How it will work?  Any token holder will be able to create an escrow contract for a transaction under the ESC9 standard. Such escrow contracts will be able to protect the deposit of one agent and the object of acquiring another agent from unpredictable circumstances.  If the terms of the contract are not executed by any party, then such contract is frozen and transferred to one of the arbitration bodies of the EscrowBlock network. The bodies themselves are not elected in the literal sense, appointment to this post can only be made if you own a certain number of tokens and on this basis voting by the owners of the tokens is for that purpose. Decisions on a disputable issue related to escrow are made through confirmation or cancellation of transactions. If such a decision is made there will be an explanation of the decision, if the counterparties involved in the transaction do not reach consensus, then the arbitrators may decide to transfer the decision to the higher-level for disputed contracts and it can arrange an anonymous vote among the token holders. Anonymous voting or a higher authority may decide in favor of one of the counterparties or in favor of withholding the deposit in full and blocking and canceling the ratings of the counterparties in the system. Anonymous voting is only an extreme measure to resolve disputes between counterparties.  What is the stage for IITO? 1. Development of ESC9, specifications and testing of the basic model in specific markets (up to $40,000). 2. Development of the hierarchy of multi-signature arbitration wallets, deployment of the entire functioning system on Ethereum Mainnet, preparation for launching its own Ethereum-like network block for an independent transaction environment (up to $100,000). 3. Development of the programing part of the EscrowBlock system and interface for the main software platforms (up to $200,000). The beginning of the offering of tokens on cryptocurrency exchanges. 4. Development of libraries for various programming languages and frameworks (up to $500,000). 5.

If you generate a new personal wallet in the https://wallet.escrowblock.net application, you MUST READ the nuances outlined below.  Our Airdrop uses the faucet mechanism. This Smart Contract can be found at https://etherscan.io/address/0x0c73260f143f198bd5f34a66487da5eb3bd2bcdc#code  The mechanism of the faucet is that the Airdrop agent only adds verified addresses that have completed tasks to the list to receive tokens.  If you received an email with the title “Escrowblock notification: Airdrop validated”, then your address has been added to this list and you can be guaranteed to pick up tokens ANYTIME. They are highlighted to you and the point.  Why we use the mechanism of the faucet and not a simple distribution by transfer to your address.  It is cheaper. We will be able to distribute more tokens among more participants. You can use your tokens only when it is profitable for you. Re-issuance to one address is excluded. This is honest. Rapid distribution, since you do not need to wait for the robot’s turn to send a token. We will be able to forcibly send to your address already allocated tokens, if necessary. Additional rewards are possible by transferring tokens to your address. Due to the fact that the https://wallet.escrowblock.net application can work with a newly generated wallet, this address has a zero balance.  To perform the “Get free tokens” function, you must have at least 0.002 ETH on your balance. To transfer from such a wallet address to another wallet will cost another 0.002 ETH. Generating a new wallet works only if you are not using the Metamask web3 extension which is necessary for the security of your main wallet.  Thus, wallet address in the https://wallet.escrowblock.net application assumes work only with ESCB tokens, but can be used for any other task within Ethereum blockchain, because you are given UTC / JSON, and you remember the password yourself (we do not store it).  If you do not want to use the generated wallet to receive Airdrop, then you can specify for Airdrop in the address field the address of your primary wallet.  IMPORTANT: the address of the wallet in this field will be added to the list of the faucet and ESCB tokens will be allocated only for this address.

Now we are seeing the emergence of many exchange platforms. Many of them resemble each other and fit into one of several concepts.  With commission No commission Decentralized Centralized Cryptocurrency Crypto-fiat  Exchange platforms with a commission and without won't be considered because doesn't improve the idea at all.  The most common are precisely centralized exchanges. They account for more than 90% of all operations with cryptocurrencies. The top 5 exchanges account for up to 80% of all operations with crypto assets.  So why do we think that our exchange platform will be competitive?  To answer this question, it is necessary to understand how any exchange and currencies in particular work.  Side A has 1 ETH and wants to exchange $200. In this process, someone will have to pass the exchange object first. Here a trust problem arises, because the party accepting the transferred object may not fulfill the conditions of the transfer on its part. It is solved by escrow.  A typical centralized exchange informs you of the account number where it is necessary to transfer the amount to before the start of any transaction on this exchange. Thus, you have a deposit for all operations with this asset at the address of the exchange. To withdraw a deposit, you need to ask the exchange team to send you an asset back. The exchange in this way can freeze all deposits on the platform for any reason. Many exchanges do not register at all and work on honesty. Centralized exchanges can lead to the worst consequences for the entire market, such as exit-scam MappleChange or stealing a large amount from hot wallets, as happened with Zaif.   Decentralized exchanges are deprived of this disadvantage, but can only work with digital assets, since the deposit for the exchange takes place according to the algorithm of the Smart Contract. The advantages of such exchanges are huge since at least you can make a direct transfer of assets since two participants make a deposit.  Crypto-fiat exchanges or exchange offices operate on the principle of trust, so they do not use a deposit. You immediately send the cryptocurrency to the operator and then wait for the transfer of fiat money to a plastic card or receive a different asset. The commission for the operation for such exchanges is quite large, 8?10 percent of exchange quotes. Such exchanges are often the only way to exchange fiat money for cryptocurrencies.  Our exchange platform allows you to combine the best approaches for assets exchange. In this way, it is safe to exchange any crypto assets for fiat or other high-speed assets.  How can we achieve this?  Our hierarchy of multi-signed wallets algorithm forms the Trust System and allows all parties to the exchange to form and validate new members who will exchange directly with each other. This approach will achieve several main properties:  Use the decentralized principle Transfer centralized exchange features to the community Avoidance of using hot wallets and centralized deposits Open source for exchange platform code Operations will be conducted on the blockchain, that allows using all benefits of this approach",False

This will allow, in the future, to quickly scale the project. Each part of the server side will be engaged in only one logical task and therefore increasing the computing capacity for only one task will allow you to save the budget for maintaining the system. For any exchange, the main part, its heart, is the “matching engine”. There may be several instances of such “engines” and each of them, in the current approximation, can process up to 1 million comparisons per second. Thus, if necessary, we will be able to quickly increase the computational power of the exchange at the lowest cost, simply by adding the necessary number of instances of matching mechanisms.  The tremendous speed of matching between transactions can be achieved only when working in RAM, therefore the matching engine is an in-memory database with the restriction that data loss is unacceptable. Therefore, data on transactions are duplicated in a non-relational database, both before loading into the matching engine, and after matching in order to preserve this important information. In case of system malfunctions at the service level of the matching engine, the instance is simply recreated and all data from the non-relational database is loaded into the in-memory database. Thus, the stable operation of the exchange is guaranteed. The non-relational database also works in a cluster environment with horizontal scaling logic. Thus, on one copy of such a database, there will be orders from the number 0–100,000, on the other 100,001–200,000, etc. Such an architecture guarantees the preservation of the history of transactions in the long term.  As stated in the API specification for the https://docs.escb.exchange, the exchange will support 7 types of applications (orders).  Market — An order to buy or sell an instrument at the best available price. Contains no restrictions on price or time frame. Limit — An order to buy or sell a set amount of an instrument at a specified price or better. A limit order may not be executed if the price set is not met during the time that the order is open. StopMarket — An order to buy or sell only when an instrument reaches a set price. Once the instrument reaches this price, the order becomes a market order. StopLimit — An order to buy or sell only when an instrument reaches a set price. Once the instrument reaches this price, the order becomes a limit order to buy or sell at the limit price or better. TrailingStopMarket — An order that sets the stop price for an instrument at a price with a fixed offset relative to the market price. If the market moves and the stop price is reached, the order becomes a market order. TrailingStopLimit — An order that recalculates the stop price for an instrument at a fixed offset relative to the market price. It also recalculates the limit price based on a different fixed offset. If the market reaches the stop price, the order becomes a limit order. BlockTrade — A privately executed trade.  After comparing transactions and finding the best parameters for its conduct between the parties, the process will be held directly between the parties with the participation of HMW on the blockchain. Thus, we implement a decentralized approach for conducting transactions with centralization by the platform itself for quick search and comparison of the most favorable conditions for both parties.  Since, in our opinion, any excessive centralization is harmful for the exchange, we will publish the source code of the exchange platform so that everyone can create their own exchange platform based on the ESCB9 protocol. Everyone can also integrate its applications with exchange platforms via API. For example, it will be useful to raise funds during an ICO. Participants will be able to invest any asset without the need to convert it; the exchange API will do it for the user.  If we describe the logical chain of conducting transactions briefly, then we get the following algorithm for the exchange based on the ESCB9 protocol:  Party A wants to exchange 1 ETH at the rate of $ 200 and places an order for an operation on the exchange platform Side B places an order to buy 1 ETH at the rate of $ 200 on the exchange platform The matching engine compares the orders of the parties A and B and determines that the transaction can be made The exchange platform attaches to one of the HMW dealers Smart contract deal and sets InProcess status for orders The Exchange website sends a notification to Side A with instructions for replenishing the deposit for the transaction, which is described in the Smart Contract  The website of the exchange sends a notification to party B with a warning about the transaction in a certain time window on the fixed conditions After replenishing the deposit by party A within a certain time frame, information is sent to party B for transfer of $ 200 to party A After acknowledgment of receipt by party A of the agreed $ 200, a deposit at the address of the HMW dealer will be sent to party B The HMW structure records data about the transaction and sets a rating for counterparties  Orders on the exchange platform are placed in FullyExecuted  As we see such a chain eliminates the risk of an exit-scam and the transaction itself is made between two counterparties in a safe way. The transaction itself can be carried out exclusively on the blockchain, while the exchange platform is used for the convenience of making such transactions in an intuitive format.  If a deal between counterparties is made on a third-party blockchain platform, for example, buying 0.1 BTC for $ 650, then it is conducted using Oracle. That is, with the help of such an auxiliary Smart contract, which allows you to link the Ethereum blockchain with the outside world. The Oracle contract allows you to write data from the outside world to the blockchain only from a specific wallet address. Data for recording will be provided by special utilities for working with each of the external sources. Thus, the operation on the Bitcoin blockchain can be recorded on the Ethereum blockchain in a safe way. Each HMW dealer will have its own Oracle contract, which will reduce the risk of an attack on such a node of the Trust System.  Each operation involving HMW will contain a commission for services, which will be calculated individually for the parties to the transaction depending on the rating in HMW, the number of ESCB tokens, etc. The commission will be spent on maintaining the network and distributing dividends between ESCB token holders.  Legal regulation of transactions ESCB foundation provides community software and does not participate in the financial activities of the network, so our organization does not need to obtain any licenses for its activities. Transactions take place directly between the parties using the secure escrow mechanism using the ESCB9 protocol. The structure of the HMW may include financial agents and dealers who have licenses for certain activities upon request and to comply with the local law of the parties to the transactions.",False

All referrals and distribution rewards will be made from 1 to 10 January 2019. Exchange listing will be possible from 15 January — 15 February 2019 depending on our negotiations with exchange platforms. We will announce this big event soon. Our development team promises to launch the ESCB exchange platform in test mode on 15 February 2019. Participators who got tokens from the faucet before 1 December will be allowed to be part of the first structure for hierarchy multisign wallets (HMW) with bonuses 10 000 ESCB tokens. Such members are 100–120.,False

Due to this technological solution, it is necessary to minimize the data collected from the user and not to store sensitive information on the servers of the exchange. In order to accumulate statistics, to store information about completed transactions and quickly interact with the Trust System, based on the HWM solution, the user must have a profile in the exchange database based on the ESCB9 protocol.  Regular applications use registration by email address or phone number. Registration by phone number may immediately discredit the user. Registration by email reserves the risk of phishing attacks. Registration with OAuth technology reveals even more information about the user.  We decided to abandon all these methods and implement the registration based on the signature from the Ethereum wallet. Thus, even if a stock exchange based on the ESCB9 protocol is hacked, no personal data, passwords, etc. will be known to attackers. To implement the authorization mechanism for signing a crypto wallet, we added the ability to use Metamask, Hardware-wallet, create a new Ethereum wallet, unlock a UTC / JSON-based wallet with a password in the user’s browser.  We want to achieve a balance in which the maximum amount of data that will be stored in the ESCB9 database is data available on the blockchain, or data that will not lead to a compromise due to a leak. In this case, the user will be provided with the necessary information quickly and in sufficient quantities.  When authorizing only by signing the wallet, a natural question arises about how to notify the user about actions on the exchange, how to implement security when accessing data stored on the exchange.  Event notifications can be configured to receive on the device on which the entry is made to the exchange. For example, when using a personal mobile phone push-notification of actions on the exchange will be received via a secure channel. The user can add his personal email to receive notifications. We recommend using Protonmail or other protected platforms for this purpose. Also, the notification can be configured to receive messages from the bot in the Telegram messenger.  We hope that these three methods of receiving notifications will be enough for our users.  To check the legality of access to data stored on the ESCB9, the standard two-factor authentication mechanism OTP is used.  Also, the user can configure IP login verification. This option will be available only if he/she specifies an email address as a means of receiving notifications. The exchange stores the IP addresses of users in a database in an encrypted form using the sha256 algorithm. Each time user logs into an account from a new IP address, the hash of the IP address in the database will be compared with the hash of the user’s IP address. If the hashes do not match, the pin-code will be sent to the email address specified by the user to validate the input from an unknown IP address.  We also do not plan to use third-party services for analytics and statistics collection, such as google analytics. Since such services collect statistics on the real IP address of the user.  For the dispute resolution system, file uploading is required. For this function, we use the distributed decentralized file storage system ipfs.",False

From the 1st to the 4th of January we paid the referral program reward for the first time. Our telegram community is approaching close to 10 thousand as the statistics show at https://etherscan.io/token/0x5e365a320779acc2c72f5dcd2ba8a81e4a34569f our token holders are almost 8 thousand. Thank you all for such confidence!  We are happy to announce that our token will soon be trading on https://p2pb2b.io exchange. Agreements have already been signed and we are currently working with the exchange for an easy adoption but unfortunately, we cannot disclose all information right now. We are preparing a big announcement in conjunction with the trading platform, which will be the first to offer the ESCB token to its users. You can find some information in press-releases https://coins.newbium.com/post/24763-8-projects-to-consider-for-investment-in-2019-p2 https://www.openpr.com/news/1490887.html  We are stopping our Airdrop phase 1 today 15 January, but we will be considering to continue Airdrop phase 2. For this reason, you don’t need to stop sharing info about ESCB. All rewards for Airdrop phase 1 will be paid up to 1 February.  Our technical department is busy testing the MVP exchange platform for the experimental environment. Soon we will be able to explain the dispute resolution subsystem based on Ethereum keys. In the meantime, we posted the concept of HMW on Github. The development of such a complex system as escrow services on the Ethereum blockchain requires a great deal of effort so we plan to establish a system of grants/rewards for third-party developers after listing on the exchange.",False
