I have a quick update for you....  Today we will be rebranding our advertising exchange project from the Smoke Exchange (SMX) to Grow Advertising (GROW).  An airdrop is scheduled for later today and the swap process will be incredibly easy and require 0 actions to be taken by the coin holder. So basically, all existing holders and addresses that carry SMX will be airdropped the new token. The SMX will then be obsolete and the GROW token will take its place. The airdrop and smart contract are designed to distribute that new token at an exact 1:1 ratio, so there will be no new tokens created or destroyed in this process, and once completed all holders will have the exact amount of GROW as they had in SMX.  Mercatox exchange and Barterdex have both been contacted and will be freezing the wallets to accommodate the process. Once the process is complete, GROW will begin trading in its place.  Thanks for your attention. I am looking forward to some big development releases and we have a lot planned for the next 6 months and beyond.  Regards,  Adam",False

I would like to reveal our built from scratch payment gateway www.cryptobillings.com  This Gateway will allow advertisers to fund their accounts with various cryptocurrencies. Our next step is to begin tying everything together and to complete the development of the advertising exchange portal.  For further details please refer to the full press release below.  Regards,  Adam Howell     FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Dopecoin (DOPE) Launches Crypto Billings: A Payment Gateway for Seamless E-Commerce Integration  World-Wide 12/19/2017    The Dopecoin (DOPE) team is proud to announce the beta release of its custom-built payment gateway.  Crypto Billings is designed to provide a seamless experience for popular E-commerce platforms to integrate cryptocurrency payments into their online retail operations.  The release of Crypto Billings marks the achievement of an important milestone in the Dopecoin / Smoke Exchange (SMX) development roadmap.  Crypto Billings will function as an essential bridge between retailers in the legal marijuana industry, Dopecoin, and The Smoke Exchange advertising platform.  The payment gateway provides an easy on-ramp for retailers with its plugin for the popular WooCommerce platform.   The easily installed plugin will allow retailers to quickly adopt our secure cryptocurrency payment method into their online retail operations.      Crypto Billings Features    100% security for retailers and customers. Payments from customers are transferred automatically to the retailer’s wallet and are never held online. Every transaction is individually recorded and provides merchants with a detailed report of each and every sale.    Accurate pricing and risk mitigation in volatile markets. Crypto Billings technology pulls real-time currency values directly from coinmarketcap.com to ensure merchants are displaying accurate, up to the minute pricing at all times.   When combined with the auto-sell feature on an exchange like Bittrex, retailers can eliminate the risk associated with holding altcoins in volatile markets.  Risk mitigation will also be possible by immediately liquidating supported currencies directly into advertising budget on The Smoke Exchange when the platform launches in Q1 of 2018.    Eliminate Fees Currently, there are ZERO payment fees associated with using the Crypto Billings payment gateway.   The plugin and payment gateway service are both 100% free, completely eliminating the merchant fees associated with being paid via cred0t card.    Accept payments from anywhere Open up your customer base to a wider audience with ease and security. No matter where they are in the world or what their local fiat currency is, they will still be able to pay you instantly with crypto.    Provide your customers with the latest technology Cryptocurrency adoption is growing exponentially. Stay ahead of the curve by providing your customers with access to the latest cutting-edge innovations in blockchain technology while simultaneously increasing your own foothold in burgeoning cryptocurrency markets.    Accept multiple cryptocurrencies Although initially, Crypto Billings will only process payments for DOPE, it has the capability to incorporate all of the most popular cryptocurrencies.   Retailers will be able to provide customers the freedom and flexibility to pay in whatever currency they choose.    DopeCoin exclusivity DopeCoin will be the only marijuana-related cryptocurrency that Crypto Billings will provide payment processing services for. This allows DopeCoin investors the opportunity to reap the benefits of the DopeCoin development teams hard work.   Future Development of Crypto Billings    UI  & Responsiveness Fixes, Live Sign-ups & Additional Features Scheduled to be completed by the end of 2017.    Additional E-Commerce Platforms Plugins and extensions for other popular E-Commerce platforms are still under development and are scheduled to be released in the future.

The Smoke Exchange team has decided to implement this feature as an incentive to reward ICO investors and early adopters.    The Smoke Exchange Solution As detailed in a previous press release:  “The Smoke Exchange will deliver a revolutionary self-serve advertising platform specifically designed to benefit the currently underserved and ever-expanding legal cannabis market worldwide.  Its implementation will represent a digital marketplace that will enable advertisers and publishers to buy and sell advertising space on a real-time auction-based bidding platform.

Im still a little confused about where the clicks are coming from. I understand Adwords and Facebook ads do not allow you to advertise ""drugs"" and accessories... which is fine... their product, their rules. Adwords is a platform where I can advertise my product to a bunch of websites that have subscribed to allow google ads to take up real estate on their page. Facebook ads show up on facebook. Where does ads posted on Smoke exchange show up?  Say I have an online store that sells bongs and stuff. And I use Smoke Exchange to pay and push my ad. Who sees it and where? Who clicks on it? Is it targeted with ability to filter out audiences like age group, gender, geography, etc? Adwords and facebook can because they have the user base and the big data to narrow down my target audience. Of course I cant use Adwords for that, so if Im reading it right, Smoke Exchange is going to be a replacement for Adwords and dope blogs / online seed shops will need to subscribe to the smoke exchange to get paid by showing my ad on their website? Is that how its going to work? If so, how are you going to collect the audience demographics necessary for the advertisers to compete for price?",False

Essentially yes you are correct. We will be building a database of marijuana-related traffic sources (also known as publishers) who will be paid to display banners and other kinds of advertisements such as popups on their website. Through the use of cookies, we will be able to determine many different types of targeting parameters such as geographical location, device, browser etc. Some websites will even have login systems with databases where targeting can be narrowed down even further according to gender and age groups.  As far as pricing is concerned each publisher will choose what they want to charge for their placement based on a CPM based system (CPM = Cost per thousand impressions). The Advertisers will then have the ability to bid on that placement and the highest bidder will be awarded the majority of the impressions.  The way that the platform will make money and allow us to generate the revenue we need to focus on onboarding new publishers and advertisers from around the world is that the publishers will pay the Smoke Exchange platform a commission ranging between 20-30% for serving the traffic.  At the moment, there is no other option available within the industry that offers such a high payout to publishers and essentially 0 fees to advertisers.  We are able to accomplish this because we have essentially cut out the marketing agency middleman and are able to provide a platform for publishers and advertisers to interact in a real-world bidding process.",False

WHAT IS THE SMOKE EXCHANGE AND WHAT IS ITS PURPOSE? The Smoke Exchange is a self-serve advertising exchange and has the same type of functionality as Google Adwords and the Facebook advertising platform.The difference is that the Smoke Exchange will be used specifically to service the marijuana industry and will help to connect publishers and advertisers who are currently not allowed to advertise on the other mainstream exchanges.  2. HOW IS THE TOKEN USED? The Smoke Exchange token (SMX) will act as the only currency used by the advertising exchanges software.If you want to buy advertising credit on the Smoke Exchange you will either have to deposit SMX tokens into your account or you can trade BTC, ETH, or DopeCoin and it will be automatically converted into SMX tokens at the current market price at the time of deposit.  3. HOW MANY SMOKE EXCHANGE TOKENS WILL I GET FOR 1 ETHEREUM? The price for the ICO period is set at 1 ETH = 300 SMX  4. WHICH WALLET SHOULD I USE TO PURCHASE SMOKE EXCHANGE TOKENS? Smoke Exchange token is an Ethereum-based ERC20 token. Token holders can easily store and manage their SMX using existing Ethereum clients, including the official Ethereum wallet, Mist, and MyEtherWallet.com.  5. CAN I PARTICIPATE IN THE ICO IF I AM A US CITIZEN? No, citizens of the USA cannot participate in the Smoke Exchange ICO due to current laws and SEC regulations. You can participate in the Smoke Exchange ICO if you are not a US citizen or do not reside permanently in the United States. Additionally, you will not be able to participate if you have a permanent residence in countries such as Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or any other territories under the United States control.  6. WHY DO USERS OF THE PLATFORM GET A 10% BONUS IF THE WITHDRAW OR DEPOSIT FUNDS IN DOPECOIN? The Smoke Exchange is brought to you by the creators of DopeCoin. The idea and concept to create a self-serve advertising exchange for the marijuana industry were first conceived and announced back in January of 2017. DopeCoin can be considered as the parent company responsible for bringing this entire project to life and both projects and communities will remain closely linked. The 10% bonus given to users of the Smoke Exchange who deposit or withdraw funds in DopeCoin is designed to not only bring a real world functionality to DopeCoin but to also reward users of the advertising exchange.  7. WHY BUILD A NEW TOKEN INSTEAD OF JUST USING DOPECOIN? In order to crowd fund for this project, it is necessary to create a new token so that we have a tangible asset to distribute to team members, advisors and investors. It would be impossible to launch a project of this scale otherwise.  8. HOW WILL DOPECOINS INVOLVEMENT AFFECT THE PRICE AND WILL IT IMPACT THE VALUE OR FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SMOKE EXCHANGE TOKEN? The Smoke Exchange token (SMX) will be the only currency actually used by the advertising exchanges internal software and the only way to buy advertising space. As a result, it will always be in demand and will not be affected. DopeCoin will provide advertisers a 10% bonus on deposits and publishers a 10% bonus on payouts and should make it the preferred way to spend or receive money when using the advertising exchange. Many believe that this will be a big benefit for DopeCoin and as the platform grows its user base we should see solid volume increases for both currencies.  9. WILL OTHER MARIJUANA RELATED CRYPTOCURRENCIES BE ADDED TO THE EXCHANGE LATER? Yes, it is our mission to add other marijuana-related cryptocurrencies to the platform as well as additional alt coins. The more communities that we are able to involve, the more cryptocurrency users we will attract to the project.  10. WHAT EXCHANGES WILL THE SMOKE EXCHANGE TOKEN (SMX) BE LISTED ON AFTER THE ICO PROCESS IS COMPLETE? We have a strong relationship with Bittrex due to the fact the DopeCoin has been listed on that exchange for 3.5 years. We hope to have the Smoke Exchange token (SMX) listed there at the end of the ICO process. Additionally, we will be paying to be listed on Livecoin and Cryptopia.  11. WHY DON'T I SEE THIS ICO ADVERTISED ON FACEBOOK, YOUTUBE, OR GOOGLE ADS? Due to the fact that this is a marijuana related business we are not able to advertise on any of the mainstream platforms in a traditional way. This is the exact reason that we are building out the Smoke Exchange platform.   OFFICIAL COMMUNITY MANAGERS  DopeCoinDude          -          Dr.Charles          -          GoldieX",False

Without your support and encouragement, this long road would have been a lot longer and a hell of a lot less fun.  When we first launched DopeCoin back in 2014, we had the vision to revolutionize the marijuana industry by providing a new way for marijuana transactions to take place in dispensaries and online shops across the world.  The problem was that there was already a ""better"" and easier way for customers to make their purchases that they were much more familiar and comfortable with. Cash and credit cards.  Even though we were able to bring online shops and brick and mortar stores on board, the fact remained that customers were not lining up to make purchases for these types of products with cryptocurrencies. We were too early.  Now, this is not a problem and challenge that only DopeCoin faced, the fact of the matter is that none of the marijuana cryptocurrencies have been able to accomplish this goal.  Even Apple Pay has yet to catch on with their hundreds of thousands of retailers, millions of users, and billions in advertising budget. Source click here  There will come a time when digital payments make more sense and the masses eventually begin to accept this new technology and we will be here to facilitate them when the time comes.  In the meantime, it was important for us to innovate and find a problem within the marijuana industry that did not have a better solution and would give us a competitive advantage.  In January of 2017, I announced our new strategy.  We would build the worlds first self-serve advertising platform for the billion dollar marijuana industry and provide this emerging marketplace with a solution to their advertising problems that is not currently in existence.  Our passion for this industry has allowed us to take that idea, turn it into a vision, and finally manifest it into reality.  I'd like to once again personally thank the DopeCoin and cryptocurrency community for being a part of our journey and I look forward to the challenging and exciting project that lies ahead.  Together we can change the world.  Warm regards,  Adam Howell (aka Dopey)",False
