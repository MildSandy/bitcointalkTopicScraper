I think the question is why an investor buy their token during ICO?  Well, according the whitepaper, HIVEWAY will only accept their token for advertising on the platform or for any other service, this means if any advertiser wants to start Advertising Campaign on the platform, he will need to pay with WAY TOKEN since he can't pay with fiat or any other currencies. So it will be demand on that token on trading platform if the project become popular.  Having that said, WAY token does not represent an ownership right or claim in the hiveway ecosystem. Disclaimer form the whitepaper : Quote The hiveway Token sale represents a voluntary contribution towards the execution of this product vision by its current and future team. The Way Token does not grant any direct equity stake nor profit sharing. It does not represent an ownership right or claim in the hiveway ecosystem, revenues or intellectual property, either present or future. Despite hiveway teamâ€™s best efforts and diligence to bring this project forward, all contributors should be aware that their contributions are not refundable and accept the inherent risk of project failure at any stage of development. This implicit risk is associated with any and all uncertainty of backing cutting-edge. technologically-focused entrepreneurial projects, and can be affected by either internal or external factors that are out of the control scope of the team. Additionally, contributions may be subject to any applicable compliance regulations. The Way Token can be used in the hiveway platform, with a corresponding utility value inside such ecosystem. The Way Token does not qualify as a security and does not provide a contributor equity share in the legal structure of any of the hiveway entities.",False

Its goal is to offer the alternative everyone expects when it comes to social  networks: a platform that does not sell your attention to third parties for their own benefit. In order to achieve this, Hiveway will be completely autonomous in terms of self governance, using a democratic system in which the entire community will vote on the people responsible for running it from within, and on the direction it develops towards.  Hiveway is a decentralized open source social network where users will have full control over their data. The interface will be a combination Twitter and LinkedIn, where users can follow, send and read posts from all the Hiveway nodes. By solving issues like personal data , fake accounts, non-transparent campaigns and central governance authority and data holders, hiveway plans to become the only go-to alternative in the market.  Its users will be able to post and interact with messages, photos and videos. The social platform will be ruled by its users, through an electoral system, with technocratic values. The users will receive the right to vote on the development of the platform, to run for a position in managing it, and to vote the candidates they believe more competent for each position.  Its evolution will always be in sync with the community demands because its management will be the community itself.  The HIVEWAY SOCIAL NETWORK is to become a direct democratic social network, running fully autonomously.  The Crowdsale is CLOSED  Thank you for your support so far. We have taken the decision to raise the funds for the development of the platform from private investment entities, therefore Hiveway ICO is not longer open for pre-sale or crowdsale. At this stage we do not know if we are going to re-open the crowdsale in the second part of the year or the project will be entirely funded in this manner.
