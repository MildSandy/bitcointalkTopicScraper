Now you began to ask a question – why there was a cancellation of sales of ICO.  We made the good proposal at sale on PRE-ICO – gave a bonus of 70% at the minimum purchase 0,001 ETH.  In response to our offer we expected what at least will be bought on 1000 ETH, but it did not occur.  Most of followers did not begin to participate in PRE-ICO only wrote about the doubts to our project! According to us for some reason most of people willingly invest in any doubtful projects which add the word GOLD or SILVER to the known name of cryptocurrency. And on our surprise people go to these projects though in fact they what are not! And in real projects as ours, people go very not willingly and difficult – strangely enough but it is the fact!  Because less than 1000 ETH were brought together and there was very small activity of investors, the analysis which showed that we most likely will not collect the minimum sum on ICO sales was made! And that our project was transparent we did not begin to wait for a failure of collecting on ICO - our sponsor suggested us to cancel ICO sales. It attracted some more investors who are ready to sponsor development of the Bmail platform. That there were no doubts in the project we decided to offer all investors who took part in sales of PRE-ICO at choice two options return of means or to continue to participate in our project!  Now when we finished sales of PRE-ICO and cancelled ICO sales – you begin to write that you would like to participate. We have a question – and why you did not join us earlier?  Well we are once again ready to go to you to a meeting – if you for any reasons did not manage to become an investor, and now very much wish it!

We think you can have two reasons to be here:  1. Reason: -   Do you probably like the fact that your account in cryptocurrency is decentralized and does not depend on the state; -   it is pleasant to you that your account is reliably protected; -   it is pleasant to you that your accounts in cryptocurrency are completely anonymous; If it is pleasant to you and you use cryptocurrency for calculations and storage of money then you have to like also our mailbox of BMAIL. -   Our mailbox BMAIL will be decentralized and independent  of the state! -   Your personal data will not be transferred to what state! -   Only you will have your correspondence, all completely anonymous! -   We as bitcoin or ethereum – only we send the protected e-mails!  2.

WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, Anonymous, Edward Snowden, ""Anonymous International"" — all these people and groups became known thanks to the publication on the Internet of confidential information. And the considerable part it was received by hacking of e-mail. Leaks in network of correspondence of government officials of the highest rank generated the real paranoia, worldwide.  Who can be interested in gaining access to someone's mailbox? First of all, it is the state organizations, post provider and cybercriminals. Certainly to hide correspondence from the usual mail service it will not turn out, the ordinary user will also hardly be able to resist to hackers.  The reasons one would want to crack your e-mail :  •   Public authorities: mass tracking and data acquisition about individuals; •   Gmail: scanning of letters in keywords for advertising; •   Hackers: spam sending, theft of bank data, theft of personal information – the list is limited only to ingenuity of hackers who find all new ways of receiving money by means of the stolen personal data.  Besides technical shortcomings of safety of e-mail, we can also consider the laws protecting confidentiality of its users:  •   After 180 days your e-mails on servers of the American post providers become the property of the USA. •   The research showed that 55% of the American employers read electronic correspondence of the employees. •   It is worth reading history of the Lavabit service which nowadays stopped the work which Edward Snowden used. It is possible to draw a conclusion that it is impossible to conceal any email while it is on the server of the company.  MAILBOX OF THE FUTURE  BTCMail WILL SOLVE ALL THESE PROBLEMS  Bmail: It will be the protected mail service working at base of technology a blockchain. The idea is: the mail service will be the network decentralized by autonomous P2P with own cryptoeconomy which is not needed to be controled from outside. Advantages of technologies of the distributed data storage allow us to create the platform for integration of third-party applications, steady against blocking, protected from censorship and collecting personal data. It means, for example, that you will not need to worry about possible loss of correspondence because Google will decide to close Gmail, and if something happens you will be able to replace the postal address because completely you will control it with ease. But the mail service is not only mail, on this base we plan to develop the big multipurpose platform. There will be a photo and video hostings, communication and entertaining services  Our main objective to declare oneself and attract the maximum audience which will be able to use the safe e-mail service of messages by the time of start of the platform of a mail service and will develop together with us.  Safety:The most protected and closest to the functions of the chat are the blockchainwallets and their peers – they are decentralized, they cannot be blocked, they have a reliable authentication system. We propose a system where users exchange a hash of a public key that also functions as the user’s address. If the public key can be obtained by the underlying protocol, then it can easily be hashed to verify that it belongs to the intended recipient.  Till February, 2018 will earn the website bmail.com on which our platform will be based. We will place all information on our project there, will also be open the forum for discussion of all possible questions concerning the BMAIL project.  Various blockchains allow to distribute data on different chains that in combination with various types of enciphering allows to create the most flexible and protected communication network. We took the best from this that there is for realization of bmail on the basis of technology a blockchain today.  Blockchain E-mail Token: The token BMLT will be the only cryptocurrency used by participants, by means of it you will receive an award for advertising viewing, will be able to pay services of partners, to pay various entertaining services.   The token of BMLT of the ERC20 standard on the basis of a blockchain of Ethereum will be an integrated part of Bmail network. Its main mission — to provide exchange of conditional value between participants of network.  Specifications: Token name:    Blockchain E-mail Token Token ticker:   BMLT Token type:   ERC20 Token issuer:   Bmail Limited Total supply:   88 000 000 BMLT (fixed, no more tokens will be issued) Mining: The concept of a mining is absent, the quantity of tokens after the sale does not change  OUR MAIN OBJECTIVE IT TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE PROJECT, BUT NOT TO RAISE MONEY!  After the termination PRE-ICO we made the decision to cancel ICO sales.  It is connected with small activity of investors, less than 1000 ETH were attracted.  We understand that as soon as we start our service your relation to change to us!  Let we the young and ambitious company but for us the main thing be our reputation!  All investors which took part in PRE-ICO - will not suffer, we will provide the choice – return of means or we will add to you into the account a constant token of BMLT which you will be able to sell on exchange (EtherDelta, Cryptopia, CoinExchange) the starting price of placement will be 1 ETH = 1000 BMLT or to wait for start of the Bmail platform. Dear investors who took part in sales of PRE-ICO – please if you wish to return the means write us robertwright@blockchainmailtoken.org in the next 48 hours! If from you the statement does not arrive - that to you the main token of BMLT will be automatically added!   Also in our team of change, new members of the team will be added to our main structure in the nearest future. Our main sponsor He Tengfei Kim attracted with some more investors - they undertake completely expenses on development and start of the Bmail platform. Before start of the Bmail platform, we release on the exchange limited quantity of our tokens – 4 000 000 BMLT (are included in this sum - investors who participated in PRE-ICO and decided to receive the main token, and also participants of the bounty company).
