This company represents HeliosCoin interests on the territory of former USSR and whole Russian Federation.  We would like to tell some you guys some words about this company.  Currently, bank deposits, precious metals, the stock market, real estate are no longer the investment tools that are able profitably preserve and multiply your earnings. Whether you like it or not, the era of the digital economy, blockchain and crypto-currency is coming when digital money will take its rightful place as a segment of the financial market. The period that replaces the absolute domination of fiat money in the economic space by the economy combining fiat and digital monetary instruments can be safely called transformational. Therefore, in the era of economic transformations, the strategy chosen on the principle of “not keeping all the eggs in one basket”, in our opinion, is a priority. When formulating an investment portfolio, we recommend combining both conservative and high-yielding strategies , and therefore relatively risky, investment instruments. The “Anaitik” compamy was founded in 2012, as an informal association of professionals in the field of investment and protection of investment performance. Each expert of our community has a rich professional and life experience, a business reputation and behind many of them there are entire teams of highly qualified specialists. This company represents not only the main areas and instruments of investment activities. In fact, the activities of our community are much broader and deeper.

This collapse in prices was initially driven by technological improvements and then accelerated as a result of attractive feed-in tariffs, economies of scale and Chinese competition. Meanwhile, feed-in tariffs followed the drop in module prices: 1 kWh of PV energy generated earned $0.40 USD in 2005, while it currently earns $0.08 USD/ kWh in most OECD countries. Beginning in the planet’s sun belt, country after country reached grid parity in the last couple of years, i.e. solar power became as cheap as power from the grid (production cost + transport and levies).
