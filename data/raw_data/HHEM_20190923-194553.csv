So who is behind this project? Are there any doctors? Because there has to be doctors from very begining in project like this. 2. Why you bought facebook page with 36k followers? To impress investors? 3. Why are you using Estonian e-residency program to get company registered in Estonia? Because it seems none of you are estonians what is the reason? And where are your team from if there is such? 4.Who bought all your pre-ico tokens? First time probably I see a pre-ico sold out and almost none information and discussion on bitcointalk. You didnt do it on facebook, because your reach and conversions on facebook posts are more than pathetic and you got ~100 twitter followers. So how you sold it? Or was it someone who bought it? 5.Consultations and second opinions require specialists, doctors. How are you going to get them? From which continent or country? What will be the prices of consultations and how people can benefit from all this? Whats your difference from companies who already offering such services except that you will have a token? 6. How do expect people who need your service for example consultation are going to pay for services? They will have to register to exchange, wait for 1 month for exchange to approve their documents, then make a deposit to buy Healtheureum tokens and then pay for service? It would be easier to go straight to private doctor and pay for him. Am I the only dont see any benefits?  Thank you for your answers.",False

Thank you for your questions. We are glad to answer them. Sorry for the late answer, our team is working tirelessly. 1. The team is already formed. We are creating the design for our team images and will announce them soon. 2. Is there any proof? Your conjectures are irrelevant. 3. The Internet is the environment free from borders and prejudices. Estonia has many qualified specialists; we have been collaborating with them for a long time and trust them completely. 4. You don't know the terms of our ICO. Please, read more thoroughly our Whitepaper and Terms and Conditions. 5. Please read our documentation. Probably, you have read our Twitter and Facebook, but those Social Media platforms are not designed to explain the ideas of such complexity as our project has. Healthureum is a dynamic and multi-functional ecosystem of healthcare services based on Ethereum blockchain. Please, don't draw conclusions based on the text on the images, read at least the section What is Healthureum. HTH token is not designed for media content purchases or gaming equipment.
