Find out how it works today in our review.  What is Gese GSE? Gese, found online at Gese.io, is a protection system against counterfeit alcohol. The company’s pre-sale begins in mid-May 2018.  The goal of Gese is to ensure accuracy in the alcohol industry, including reduced counterfeiting. However, it’s also designed as a marketing tool that provides reliable statistics to brands, allowing consumers to track every bottle from the manufacturer to the retail store shelves.  Gese relies on NFC tags and blockchain technology to accomplish that goal.  Gese has already partnered with a number of major brands, including Barefoot Wine, Hendrick’s, Monkey Shoulder, Beluga Group, Plantation Rum, Clan Macgregor, and other major industry providers.  How Does Gese Work? Like other supply chain control systems based on blockchain, Gese will use tags and blockchain to track the movement of items across the supply chain.  While other systems use QR codes and similar tags, Gese will use NFC tags. These tags will automatically activate your phone from a short distance away. There’s no need to take a picture of the barcode or scan a QR code. You pick up a bottle, hold your phone close to the bottle, and the Gese app will display all relevant information about that item.  The platform is catered towards three broad groups:  Consumers who want to ensure the quality of purchased goods Local businesses that want to promote their products Manufacturers seeking direct access to their target audience For consensus, Gese uses the PoA algorithm, which is a refined proof of stake (PoS) consensus mechanism (or proof of authority).  What Problems Does Gese Seek to Solve? Gese seeks to solve a number of problems in today’s alcohol industry, including all of the following problems mentioned in the whitepaper:  Manufacturers have limited ability to effectively advertise their products; in many countries, alcohol advertising is limited or even prohibited, which means manufacturers only have a narrow range of tools to promote their products Sellers, including shops, bars, and restaurants, face difficulties in opening a business and attracting new customers; other industries have aggregators that allow targeted sales of items based on geolocation and preferences, but there’s no such tool for the alcohol industry Consumers who wish to purchase high quality alcohol face problems with product selection; an inexperienced buyer will have difficulty sorting through a diverse range of goods displayed on the typical store shelf Manufacturers are losing money and decaying their brand’s value because of the spread of counterfeit products Gese Features Gese emphasizes all of the following features:  Authentication of Goods: NFC tags on each bottle can be used to search for information about each particular item.  Rating and Review System: The NFC tags also allow buyers to instantly view rating and review information from each item, seeing how previous customers enjoyed each product.  Alcohol Availability and Prices: You can use the Gese platform to search for alcohol availability and prices in your local area, making it easy to identify the best and cheapest source for that item in your region.  Social Platform: Gese has social features that allow users to share their opinions about products, publish blog posts, and contribute to the platform in other ways. Users are rewarded with cryptocurrency for every social interaction, including scanning NFC tags.  Mobile App: Users will interact with Gese through a mobile app.  Marketing Features: Manufactures and stores can advertise their products and selection through the app.  The Gese GSE Token Sale Gese tokens are listed under the symbol GSE. They’re ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.  The pre-sale for GSE tokens begins on May 15, 2018, while the main ICO is scheduled to begin on July 1.  The Gese whitepaper also mentions the use of a secondary token called GSEE.  It’s not totally clear how GSE tokens will work. However, we know that they will be used to reward users who contribute to social functions on the platform. If you scan a bottle’s NFC tag, for example, then you’ll receive a small number of tokens as a reward.  Who’s Behind Gese? Gese is led by Pavel Boboshik (Founder). No other executive team members are listed. The whitepaper doesn’t feature extensive information about any particular team member, making it difficult to see how any single team member is qualified.  The Gese whitepaper also doesn’t link to any member’s LinkedIn profile or other social pages. However, a Google Search for Pavel Boboshik reveals that he’s the General Director of a Russian glass factory called Ekran. That company made headlines in March 2018 for converting its factory to bitcoin mining. The factory is based in Siberia. Bloomberg appears to have a profile on Boboshik.  Gese GSE Conclusion Gese is a blockchain-based platform that seeks to disrupt the alcohol industry. The platform involves adding NFC tags to alcohol bottles, then allowing consumers to scan each bottle using their phones and the Gese app. You won’t need to take a picture of a barcode or scan the bottle – instead, you’ll just need to pick up the bottle, and your phone will read the NFC signal.
