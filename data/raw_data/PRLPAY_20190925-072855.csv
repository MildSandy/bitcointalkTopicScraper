The team offered a 100% money back guarantee option for Private Sale buyers which ended last month. Also team has 3yr vested which is audited and with legal escrow behind. The team have already employed developers for the project.  For now, The presale funding is allocated for the licenses and development of the product.  Some reasons why Komodo,  First, building in Komodo Platform is cost efficient for the team. Komodo Platform devs work hand in hand with the team. Since Pearl Pay's target market is the rural area, costing is very critical.  Second, team researched and studied all other platforms and Komodo Platform was the top choice because of its roadmap and technology. This was also identified by the China government when it first release its report about blockchain innovation. They named Komodo Platform as 2nd in innovation, next to Bitcoin. Read here: https://news.pearlpay.io/chinas-top-ranked-blockchain-platforms-and-bitcoin/  Third, mass adoption, scalability, security and transaction speed. In order for Pearl Pay to be on top of the Philippine market where internet speed is slow, they need a platform that can outperform the usual. Komodo is now at 40,000 txn/sec.  Fourth, Komodo Platform as we all know is a 3rd generation blockchain. Pioneered the Decentralized Exchange and Decentralized ICO. Also the best in Atomic Swap. Pearl Pay will have its own Decentralized Exchange.  This is actually a long list of reasons why Komodo Platform is the best blockchain for Pearl Pay.",False

Pearl Pay Mobile wallet is a white-label product that can enable Rural/Provincial or non-commercial Banks to launch their own virtual prepaid wallet. This will enable them to serve their clients at a higher level. This will also allow their clients to transact online and use e-money to buy goods and services. Users can use this to transfer money, pay bills and other typical online banking services.  2. Pearl Pay Remit is an advocacy of Pearl Pay. It is a service that will allow Oversees Filipino Workers or OFW to send their money to their love ones at the most minimal cost. The major challenge right now is the high cost of remittance in the Philippines which also happens to be the 3rd biggest remittance industry country in the world. With this initiative, Pearl Pay can lower the cost of remittance using blockchain technology.  3. Pearl Pay Exchange is a Decentralized Exchange that will provide liquidity of PRLPAY Coins. This is a vital product of Pearl Pay. This will allow users to use their cryptocurrency to purchase from non-crypto merchants.  4.

Philippine banking system is very interesting for foreign investors. We have different kinds of banks such as, Rural bank, Co-op Bank, Thrift bank, Universal Bank and Commercial Bank.  Pearl Pay's target market for the white labeling are the Rural Banks. We have full research of the industry and have already presented use cases and business cases to the biggest Rural bank organization which consist of at least 480 bank members (494 is the total number of Rural Banks). The challenge of building their own blockchain is the cost to build one. They don't even need to build a blockchain since its more complicated and wont generate any additional revenue. Most of the Rural banks small and can only accommodate offline deposits, withdrawals, bills payment and loans. The cost to build the infrastructure is around $4m not including the labor and maintenance cost.  the real question is, what is the advantage of Pearl Pay for them?  Pearl Pay created a white-label service for the Rural banks. Its a Mobile Wallet OS that has blockchain technology in it. It will utilize PRLPAY coins as its medium of exchange for remittance and other payments. Pearl Pay has four core products combined into a single integrated system we called VMLS (Virtual Money Logistics System) which provides a comprehensive “Mobile Payment and Money Transfer Platform as a Service” appropriately designed, of world-class quality, relevant for actual use and beneficial to the financial inclusion target market.  The Pearl Pay team intend to give these services to Rural Banks for Free. This will also allow rural banks within the Pearl Pay network to transfer money from domestic to international.",False
