The future of the decentralized web is dependent on the next generation of decentralized financial infrastructure. In order to sustain future growth and facilitate the influx of new members to the blockchain ecosystem, it’s important to create a financial base layer that is capable of handling such influx. For the ecosystem to thrive, the use of cryptocurrencies and tokens must become more user-friendly by a considerable margin. Present day financial blockchain architectures still suffer from several shortcomings that hold back a broad mainstream adoption, most notably long transaction confirmation times, little scalability, and a lack of decentralization and liquidity.  Herdius vision is to considerably lower the barrier of entry to the token economy by offering a superior experience to institutional and end users alike.  To that end, we aim to introduce an innovative and robust blockchain architecture that addresses the above issues. Our goal is to design a highly performant and scalable transaction and exchange infrastructure which enables seamless interoperability between different blockchains. These are critical conditions for adoption by many service providers and present a significant user experience improvement.  The possibilities that arise from this are endless. We envision a world where you can instantly take a loan, sign up for an insurance, or access the entire dApp world services - all with just your identity on the Herdius chain. And since the Herdius core technology is intended as an open-source platform, we believe that many developers will consider building the next generation of decentralized apps on top of the Herdius chain.   What is Herdius?  Herdius is a decentralized exchange network. The best way to think about Herdius is as a new transaction layer in the cryptocurrency space: Herdius will sit between the users and the root blockchains of all relevant cryptocurrencies (or tokens). In blockchain terminology, Herdius is essentially a sidechain. A highly performant and scalable sidechain, that is. This way, Herdius can enable fast and seamless cryptocurrency transactions and peer-to-peer trading — even if the original chain is subject to long confirmation times. By establishing Herdius as the transaction layer for crypto assets, the underlying root chains could approach development at their own pace while Herdius would take care of the user experience.   How does it work?  As we explain in our technical paper (PDF), Herdius will be powered by a native proof-of-stake blockchain with several innovative features. Most notably, we are looking to introduce a new block architecture which we dubbed Blocks-of-Blocks (BoB). Without getting too technical here: BoB blocks are “stretchable” as they can contain so-called child blocks. This enables parallelized block validation — which goes a long way when high transaction volumes need to be handled. But that’s only one of many interesting features under Herdius’ hood. As outlined in our technical paper, Herdius introduces hallmark storage and payment highways to its chain in order to further increase scalability.   The HER Token  Utility The HER token will be the staking currency on the Herdius blockchain. Hence, it allows any holder of HER to become a validator (similar to miners in Bitcoin) in the Herdius network. For their services, validators earn a share of the transaction fees and block rewards. Also, users will be able to pay transaction fees in HER at a lower rate in comparison to fees paid in other cryptocurrencies.  Value HER is designed to be economically relative to transaction volume inside the Herdius network. All staked validator nodes will be entitled to a share of total transaction fees (proportional to their stake's size). Therefore, owning HER becomes more desirable the higher the transaction activity is within the Herdius network.  Network Governance HER token holders are the key participants in the Herdius network. As such, we want them to play a central role in the governance and development of the network. To that end, we will give HER token holders several options to become involved in the future development of the Herdius network, for instance by hosting regular smart-contract based suggestion sessions and votings on important ecosystem matters.   A German ICO  Herdius is a project by the German Herdius GmbH, located in Berlin. Unlike many other ICOs with German involvement, Herdius is not relying on a Swiss foundation or subsidiaries in other jurisdictions. Instead, HER tokens will be sold directly by the German company. The Herdius team has disclosed its entire business plan and ICO model to German financial regulatory body, BaFin. The legal consulting was performed by a team of recognized blockchain experts, led by lawyer Nina-Luisa Siedler from the law firm DWF.   Token Allocation  Total Supply: 45.000.000 HER Sold during pre-sale & ICO: 90% Allocated to Herdius team: 10%   Token Sale Details  The Herdius ICO will be held in Q1 2018. Details will be announced here and on our official channels. Our pre-sale currently is underway. Anybody who meets the minimum ticket size can participate in the pre-sale at the following discount structure:  15% - €50,000 (≈78.5 ETH as of 12/14/2017) 20% - €150,000 (≈236 ETH as of 12/14/2017) 25% - €300,000 (≈472 ETH as of 12/14/2017) (thresholds in Euro due to ETH fluctuation)    All the details can be requested at ir@herdius.com.

First of all we never say that we are better than Lightning Network, I actually credited Lightning for advancing Bitcoin and propelling innovation in the space that was so slow at the time. The only place we make use of anything similar to Lighning's architecture is in the Entity Highways, other than that we do not rely on smart contracts or payment channels.  An easy way to think of Herdius is to imagine a transaction layer on top of all existing blockchains and future ones. The one thing that is common in all chains is the private key you use to access your assets, even if it the blockchain is graph based - which I am sure we will see more of in the future. Herdius is going to solve everything on the wallet / private key level without relying on setting up communication channels with individual blockchains. For example in our case the Bitcoin dev team does not have to do anything in the future to make the Bitcoin chain compatible with ours, and we don't have to do anything either as once again we solve everything on the private key level and we just transmit the signed transaction back to the root chain as any wallet would. I think this also touches on the cross-chain interaction point, all you need is a wallet that is compatible with the Herdius network and then you are good to go. There is no need for the developers of the blockchain to implement an additional communication channel to Herdius.  You are right on the consensus part and that it takes time, what we outline, however, is a bi-directional exchange. Example: If Alice wants to buy BTC with ETH and BOB is selling ETH for BTC then they both submit their orders to the network and the central book matchmaking system matches them and the exchange happens. I do believe that it is possible to make real-time trading *- which isn't part of our current proposal as, again, we talk about bi-directional exchange only - happen somehow, this field is moving so fast that I am sure someone will make it possible, perhaps even on top of the Herdius chain in the future  Github / Prototype: We are looking to release a demo in January outlining the early blockchain prototype. I will personally work on it in the coming weeks so you are going to definitely see something up there soon. To our defense, the infrastructure we propose is a bit more complex than a DEX that is relying on smart contracts and can only trade ERC20 tokens.  Hope I answered your questions, and happy to discuss further if I didn't.  - Balazs",False
