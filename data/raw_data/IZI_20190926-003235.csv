What is Izibits?  Izibits is an apps ecosystem driven by crypto-economy and built with microservice architecture that aggregates a multitude of chat-bots to ""message everything"" from one place. Its a modular system application built with microservice architecture that employs chat-bot technology for interacting with users.  The core module, iziWallet, is a cryptocurrency wallet that is used by all the other modules. Other system modules are utility modules that enable additional features demanded by next generation users and the new era of crypto-economy. The features available to users are adjusted dynamically, depending on various parameters such as country of residence, verification tier, rating, etc.  2.   Modules overview (the current development phase)  ●   iziWallet – Your personal, highly secured multicurrency crypto-wallet accompanied by an optional plastic card iziCard (or a virtual card) for using in the locations where crypto-currencies are still not accepted. ●   iziExchange – A platform for peer-to-peer exchange of cryptocurrencies to fiat money or arbitrary pairs of tokens. ●   iziInvest – A marketplace of opportunities to invest in the hottest crypto-currencies, ETFs and ICOs. This service might be unavailable for residents of some countries. ●   iziShopping – An e-Commerce platform for creating virtual mini-stores with seamless integration into iziWallet for accelerated payments.  3.   System key features  ●   Cross-platform (supports all popular and trending messaging apps like Telegram, Viber, Kik, Facebook Messenger, Skype, iMessage, WeChat, web apps, mobile apps). ●   A single, unified user account for all underlying messaging apps. ●   Two ways to top-up your wallet: directly from any bank card or through the built-in peer-to-peer platform iziExchange.  Any payment method may be used. ●   Safekeeping of private keys and completing transactions with two-factor authorization, by e-mail, SMS or Authy. ●   Seamless integration with third-party liquidity providers (exchanges) via API for the crypto-assets trading. ●   Seamless integration with various third-party service providers via API.   4.   Market Contrary to the majority of blockchain projects which are intended for technically savvy users, izibits is focused on a wide range of customers, particularly: ●   People who are taking advantage of crypto-currencies as a means of international payments, cross-border remittance and shopping in the real world (iziCard). ●   Self-directed investors and amateur crypto-traders looking for the possibility to save on brokerage fees and to increase their capital by investing in tokenized derivatives, ETFs and ICO campaigns (iziInvest). ●   Traders earning on the exchange of fiat and crypto-currencies (iziExchange). ●   Small to medium e-Commerce enterprises or individual entrepreneurs (iziShopping). According to experts and market research, the global volume of OTC trade (Peer-to-Peer) using crypto-shares is significantly larger than the trade volume of centralized exchanges.  There are a few reasons for this: ●   A simple user interface, as opposed to the increasingly complex interfaces of centralized exchanges. ●   Possibility to trade the most exotic fiat and electronic currencies, and corresponding pairs that are not listed on major exchanges. ●   The average exchange fee for P2P crypto-platforms is $100-150, meaning the price-tag of 5-7% higher than the market average does not scare off buyers. The recent inflow of money into ICOs and a multitude of crypto-funds does already constitute more than 800 million dollars and it continues to grow rapidly. iziBits provides users with not only the most current statistics on profitability, but also the opportunity for effortless investing in the tradable funds and ICOs crowd-sales. Users may access their favorite messenger window with the list of advertised parties (crypto-funds, startups, [Suspicious link removed]panies, etc) that they can individually evaluate and choose one to invest in. * (*This feature is not available to citizens and residents of some countries)  There is a variety of services and platforms that already exists and demonstrates some parts of functionality, for example, one Chinese messenger has more than 130 million virtual stores that can be navigated without leaving the messenger interface. Also there is one decentralized ecommerce platform which supports Bitcoin as a major payment method. iziShopping incorporates the best qualities of these two products and offers the opportunity to create virtual mini-stores directly in the messenger app, as well as conduct transactions with any crypto-currency in your iziWallet, instantly and without any intermediaries. In order to prevent sales of illegal goods and services, there is a virtual mini store monitoring mechanism. Likewise, an escrow mechanism has been built into the service to protect the rights and interests of the customers (e.g., holding the payment until goods have been received and etc).  The potential system audience is massive and has already been proven. The market for the services offered has just recently been created and tested. It is currently in its early monetization stage.
