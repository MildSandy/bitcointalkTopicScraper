Blockchain is a distributed ledger which is completely open to anyone. Once some data has been recorded inside the blockchain it becomes very very difficult to change it. So, how does that work. well, let's think about a single block in the blockchain. each block contains some data and hash of the block and hash of the previous block. the data that stored inside the block depends on the type of the blockchain. Bitcoin blockchain for example stores the details about transaction here suggests the sender, receiver and the amount of coins. a block also has a hash, you can compare a hash to a fingerprint. it identifies a block and all of its content and it is always unique such as fingerprints.once a block is created its hashes been calculated, changing something inside the block will cause the hash to change.so in another words hashes are very useful when you want to detect changes of a block. The third element inside a block is the hash of the previous block. and this creates a chain of blocks and this is the technique which makes the blockchain so secure.",False

In an ICO, a project creates a certain amount of a digital token and sells it to the public, usually in exchange for other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or ether.  The public could be interested in the tokens on offer for either or both of the following reasons:  1) The token has an inherent benefit – it grants the holder access to a service, a say in an outcome or a share in the project's earnings.  2) The benefit will be in increasing demand, which will push up the market price of the token.  Tokens, especially those of successful sales, are usually listed on exchanges, where initial buyers can sell their holdings and new buyers can come in at any time.  As a type of digital crowdfunding, token sales enable startups not only to raise funds without giving up equity, but also to bootstrap the project's adoption by incentivizing its use by token holders.  Buyers can benefit from both the access to the service that the token confers, and from its success through appreciation of the token's price. These gains can be realized at any time (usually) by selling the tokens on an exchange. Or, buyers can show their increasing enthusiasm for the idea by purchasing more tokens in the market.",False

It requires companies to identify and understand the risks inherent to digitization, public networks and outsourcing of infrastructure components.Companies still fear that their data is insecure with cloud systems. Businesses are moving their data from on-premise servers to cloud. And second, as the block- chain assets’ market like crypto-currencies is getting traction, the business decision makers are planning to diversify their assets and invest in the crypto-currencies. The commercial security products and crypto-currency wallets available in the market today, rely on encryption-based security using a single private key that is stored either on a local computer or an external cloud server. If the key is lost, stolen or hacked, the digital asset is lost. This creates the need for an enterprise class solution that provides a more robust and unified security solution not only for the digital assets like documents, files, emails etc. but also for the crypto-currency assets stored in the cloud. Security breaches in external cloud servers, internal and external intrusions and hacking by individuals and foreign governments poses a critical threat to the enterprise data stored on commercial cloud servers. The security of the cloud server is managed by the cloud service providers and the companies have little control over the security of their data and no significant legal remedies if their data or crypto currency assets are compromised on the cloud server.",False

Dubai  From its origins as a small fishing creek populated by nomadic Bedouin tribes for much of its history, Dubai gradually emerged into a regional trading and export hub in the early 20th Century. However, it wasn’t until the discovery of oil in the 1960s that the impetus for the Dubai we know today germinated.  Today, the Dubai economy is quite diverse and primarily tourism-based. Known for its combination of visionary leadership, highly advanced infrastructure, a large number of expats (over 80% of Dubai’s population is foreign-born), and a superbly connected flight hub anchored by one of the world’s greatest airlines, Dubai is naturally poised to embrace the latest technological innovations.  For anyone who has been paying attention to this fascinating metropolis, it came as no surprise to learn of news that the Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum announced an ambitious agenda to have all government documentation (i.e. visa applications) transacted digitally on the blockchain by 2020. This news was followed by the Dubai Land Department becoming the first government agency in the world to publicly adopt blockchain technology, promising to have 100% of land registry records migrated to the blockchain.",False

The console provides features to manage security at the organization, user and device level.

The admin panel also comes with dashboard that give a 360 view of the security of different device belonging to the organization and provides features like auto-provisioning users, defining security policies, view audit trails and define notifications when a security threat is detected  on a particular node in the network.  Our product strategy team has thoroughly done a competitive market analysis and we worked with our partners and industry leaders while defining the product strategy. We wanted to make sure we develop a product that addresses the needs of the cloud security industry while making sure the product is user-friendly and easy to use.  Hope this answers your question.

CloudFish actually provides an encryption layer on the data that is going to the cloud and implements a security mechanism that stores users security keys on blockchain after splitting it onto fragments.  CloudFish's Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) uses a proprietary algorithm to store and manage users’ encryption keys using block chain technology. Unlike the traditional CASB products available in the market that stores users’ private encryption keys on a single server, the CloudFish CASB splits the users’ keys into fragments and stores it in blockchain. This makes it virtually impossible for a hacker to steal users’ private keys and the digital assets protected through those keys. CloudFish uses a proprietary algorithm to dynamically construct and store users’ keys in the blockchain. The reconstruction and validation mechanism implemented by CloudFish for users’ encryption keys is very similar to the way blockchain validates your cryptocurrency transactions.  The use of blockchain for security keys validation makes it not only impossible for a hacker to steal but also makes it easy for the actual user of the data to access it anytime from any platform.  The follow picture illustrates how CloudFish's CASB server provides a security mechanism for users' cloud data using blockchain to store encryption keys: https://cloud-fish.com/cloudfish-corp-website/ico/Conceptual-Diagram-2.png",False

Regarding your question, Storj and CloudFish, although the two companies share some common strengths, their products are completely different and targeting different market segments. Storj's product is in the cloud storage while CloudFish's product is in the cloud security space.  CloudFish Enterprise Security Suite consists of three main functional components: The Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) and the Cloud Data Encryption Interface (CDEI).  Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)  The CloudFish CASB uses a proprietary algorithm to store and manage users’ encryption keys using block chain technology. Unlike the traditional CASB products available in the market that stores users’ private encryption keys on a single server, the CloudFish CASB splits the users’ keys into fragments and stores it in blockchain. This makes it virtually impossible for a hacker to steal users’ private keys and the digital assets protected through those keys. CloudFish uses a proprietary algorithm to dynamically construct and store users’ keys in the blockchain. The reconstruction and validation mechanism implemented by CloudFish for users’ encryption keys is very similar to the way blockchain validates your cryptocurrency transactions.  The use of blockchain for security keys validation makes it not only impossible to steal but also makes it easy for the user to access it anytime from any platform……means you don’t have to worry what happens to my crypto wallet if my laptop is stolen or lost or if the wallet company’s server gets hacked.  https://cloud-fish.com/cloudfish-corp-website/ico/Conceptual-Diagram-2.png  Cloud Data Encryption Interface  The Cloud data encryption interface provides a transparent security layer on top of commercially available cloud services. This layer automatically encrypts any data going to the public cloud and decrypts it when the data is received on the local machine. This encryption layer uses the industry-standard AES 256-bit encryption and it is built on top of the public interfaces provided by commercial cloud services provider.  In release 1.0, CloudFish product has been integrated with Dropbox, Google Drive, Box and Microsoft OneDrive. In release 2.0, additional integrations are planned including Amazon Web Service (AWS) Salesforce.com, Slack and IBM Cloud.  CLOUDFISH CLOUD SERVICES GATEWAY (CSG)  CloudFish Cloud Services Gateway (CSG) is a separate licensable product which integrates with CloudFish Enterprise Security Server.  The CSG provides enterprise data services related to security including automatic detection and control of security threats for the data, the companies store on commercial cloud servers.  The CSG is an agent-based software. Each node in the enterprise network (laptop, desktop, server etc.) runs a CloudFish agent software that monitors the network use pattern on that machine. It uses the artificial intelligence technology and  machine learning algorithms to detect unusual activities like suspicious login attempts, hacking or intrusion attempts, ransomware or a potential spyware or malware activity on each.   Upon detection of a suspicious activity on a node, the CloudFish agent running on that node immediately takes preventive actions on that node and it triggers an ‘alarm’ about the security risks that propagates to other nodes in the network .  Upon receiving this information, the agent software running on other nodes takes preventive actions to isolate themselves from the network threat. This sharing and learning about network threats among different network nodes acts like a ‘collective network wisdom’ which minimizes the risk of large-scale data loss and services interruption for the enterprise.  https://cloud-fish.com/cloudfish-corp-website/ico/CSG-Nodes-Concept.jpg",False
