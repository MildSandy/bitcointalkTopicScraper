The guildlies used to maintain the platform would develop and evolve based on the inputs received from buyers and sellers of the B2B services. So, this the execution part of the maintenance would be through Acuitty; the rules setting would be more decentralized and take inputs from the stakeholders (buyers and sellers). Hope this helps.

Since these are in a blockchain, the records would be permanent. But access to details of the contract would be restricted to the buyers and sellers only. For example, if A and B enter into a contract where B sells mobile application development Servies to A, then the contract terms would be stored in encoded format in the blockchain. But, only A and B would have access to these contract terms. So, the blockchain would be private. This privacy is needed as business buyers and sellers almost always would like their buying and selling to be confidential. There would be provisions to make details of contract public - but the buyers would need to set those terms before the purchase (this may be useful for government purchase - where there is a need for openness).  The ACT token would be on the Etherum blockchain - so, it would be public, like everything else on ETH.  Hope this clarifies.  Thanks for your interest. Acuitty Team.",True
