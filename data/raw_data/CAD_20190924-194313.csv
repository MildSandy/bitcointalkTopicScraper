Investors should bear in mind, however, that the fitness tracker device wasn’t even a twinkle in the eye of its developers a year ago. It was born at the height of the cryptocurrency fever in December 2017. While that doesn’t undermine the deal, it does increase the risk. Cardium must promote their brand and people must be willing to use their ecosystem. Otherwise, the reward tokens lose their appeal. If their roadmap materializes, this project could be a winner.  Risks     Cardium is a new concept that began at year-end 2017. While the startup has a defined roadmap through year-end 2018, it’s unclear if their fitness tracker is in development yet (samples are being tested this month, according to the company’s roadmap). There’s no history of performance or guarantee the market has room for another fitness tracker. -2.5     This brings up another risk, which is the possibility that a company like FitBit, that has proven sales, or worse Google or Apple, which similarly boast wearable products, could decide to integrate blockchain technology and issue digital tokens, which would raise the competition stakes significantly. -2  Growth Opportunity     Demand for wearable devices is on the rise, as illustrated below. Meanwhile, and while this part is unfortunate, the number of people with an excessive body mass index (BMI) is also increasing. Cardium has figured out a way to capitalize on each of these trends while at the same time improving the health of the global population. +4     Even though Cardium hasn’t generated any sales yet, they have a defined path to do so. The company will generate revenue from sales of the fitness tracker, a device by which all physical activity is measured and sent back to a smartphone and later to Cardium. They expect in year one to “attract” 10 million people and generate EBITDA of USD 150 million. +3     Innovation. Cardium’s concept of tokenizing daily activities could be brilliant. Consider the former wildly popular US television competition, “The Biggest Loser”. For 17 seasons, overweight contestants were tasked with losing weight by the carrot and stick method including a USD 250,000 prize reserved for one lucky winner. +3.5     Cardium is being advised by Moscow-based Conner & Company for the ICO. This relationship provides greater transparency to potential ICO participants and is a plus. +1.5  Disposition We arrive at a score of 7.5 out of 10 for the Cardium ICO. Proof: https://hacked.com/ico-analysis-cardium/  This  is a very good result!",False

The epidemic of excess weight and obesity is gaining momentum every year, especially in developed countries. Unfortunately, this is not another story to drive people into the gym, but a very real threat. According to scientists, by the year 2025 a fifth of the world's population will be affected by this disease. Lack of motivation, societal shaming and its harmful impact all have a very strong impact on people following an unhealthy life plan. Cardium offers its own motivation for one to always be rewarded for any athletic activity - from the highest intensity to the even the modest exercise.  Lack of motivation and small knowledge of sports are the main obstacles to engaging people through sports, so far nothing has been done to tackle this problem. Our project aims to change this situation. The key element of the ecosystem is Cardium fitness tracker, around which other interactions are built. Various techniques that we implemented in our knowledge database will facilitate the process of engagement.     https://i.imgur.com/qV7hZhB.png     CHANGE THE RULE OF THE GAME     https://i.imgur.com/3xutFEy.png     CRYPTOCURRENCY FOR EVERYONE  In addition to main goals such as social security and public health, our project solves one of the problems of crypto industry - popularization of cryptocurrencies. None of the projects presented before could equally distribute cryptocurrency to the world population. Thus, rich people are getting richer, huge mining farms are created, but common people do not get anything from this. Cryptocurrencies were intended for the masses, yet, the current distribution model prevents wide usage across all socio-economic groups. Until this problem is solved, cryptocurrencies will remain in the shadow, being a privilege of a certain class of people.     TOKEN SPECIFICATION  Cardium's utility token developed according to the ERC20 standard, which ensures its full compatibility with any other projects that comply with this standard.     https://i.imgur.com/gh4ix5M.png     Total number of tokens is based on potential growth of the Cardium ecosystem audience to 100 million people within 10 years. If this goal won't be achieved, unused tokens will be burned. The amount of burned tokens will depend on current ecosystem users according to the quarterly results, but not earlier than one year after the launch of the project.     https://i.imgur.com/6zo4lF3.png     MEET THE TEAM    https://i.imgur.com/bnfmbKz.png     https://i.imgur.com/feH1pah.png     https://i.imgur.com/TsHPdlv.png   https://i.imgur.com/FdMiRxL.png     https://i.imgur.com/xFwhYKE.png     https://i.imgur.com/4c28OjH.png   https://i.imgur.com/ScOgzH1.png     ADVISORS & PARTNERS     https://i.imgur.com/qLmID3r.png     https://i.imgur.com/cYUxYG7.png     https://i.imgur.com/d2nkvK8.png    https://i.imgur.com/R2nJL2X.png",False
