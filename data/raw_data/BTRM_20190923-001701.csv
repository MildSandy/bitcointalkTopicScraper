First: Betfair never has and never will pay or charge anyone in USD so this $4600 is garbage that you refer to. Many other regulated exchanges exist that offer a huge reduction in commissions and still don't get anywhere close to betfair, why? Second point: Betfair offers a huge pool of liquidity of LOSERS. For a professional gambler to win money on Betfair he has to be able to make margin off the everyday user from the Betfair site. These guys, with their seventh-grade looking ""demo"" (that doesn't even demo anything remotely decentralised or blockchain it basically shows you a very crap centralised sportsbook ui) aren't going to be able to attract the every day user in volumes that Betfair can in order for the professional bettors to find it worth their while. Apparently Andrey Rybalchenko, Betrium's betting guru, has made $150k in arbitrage betting since 2013. That's not even anything to do with seeding a gambling market, he basically took advantage of inefficiencies in the betting lines and abused them. The knowledge to do this style of betting (unbelievable easy - the hard part is having accounts that don't get closed for arbitrage abuse) vs actually setting the lines on Betfair is the equivalent of Andrey being class President and then asking you to vote him as the President of Ukraine this year due to that experience. The whitepaper is sloppy, there are grammatical errors everywhere. I actually think the concept of being a portal for people setting up their own events (particularly e-sports, as they mention) is a half decent idea but if i was investing in this i'd say cut out the marketing crap, show me an actual demo of how i can set up on event, make a market and publish that? Technically its not actually that hard to produce this as an MVP on the blockchain - so why the crap sportsbook which has nothing to do with the main premise of this ICO? Probably because they don't have a clue about blockchain technology. The other question i would ask, is how will Betrium create nodes to verify the contracts that are decentralised from the initial event organiser to make the outcome impartial and transparent? You become the bookmaker vs the customer but you also need to verify the outcome of an event yourself and, for me, a bookmaker that controls a) the actual event im betting on and b) the resulting of that event says HUGE potential for corruption. This is a badly thought out and executed sportsbook blockchain idea and project. Another one off the Ukrainian scam ICO conveyor belt.",False

So any current player, and particularly Betfair, offers these stuff.   You know, we can write a lot of beautiful words about decentralization benefits and blockchain powerful technology. However, simply, there are few very important things for us and our future customers:    — Our field, gambling and particularly betting, is risky and much regulated. What we really need is the system based not in one data-center, not in one or few countries. To be protected from regulators and agressive competiros, we’ve got to have no single center. Otherwise we can say hello to US IRS and FBI. Ideally, we’d build a system, that may work regardless of ourselves.    — Customers guarantees. It happens everywhere, when bookmaker holds customer’s money, blocks accounts etc. We want to provide transparency. It is profitable for us (reputation) and for our customers.    — Revenue sharing. The most safest way to provide some kind of «dividends» for our international investors (token holders) is blockchain.  However, our solution is partly decentralized. In Betrium bets happen off-chain and only added when the event happens and the outcome is undeniable. However the bets are broadcasted all over the network instantly for the odds to be recalculated. That means, in contrast to competitors, we are able to provide high-speed betting service built on decentralized IT architecture.  Try to imagine how to reach our goals and to provide the service we’re going to provide in traditional approach.    ",False

This is why they get banned (I worked with mayor bookmakers in europe but some easy research on internet will be enough to find gamblers that have been banned for being successful).  Another thing extremely dangerous I saw in the whitepaper is to open everyone to create events, I can create an event for a third league, bet millions on the outcome and pay the players to lose the game. This is why not every match is listed by bookmakers but only the ones they have some certainty they are not going to be fixed. The only platform could list every game is betfair where the bets are between players and betfair takes a % of all bets (still they don't to guarantee to all the users that the match it's played fairly).

However, with the exception of the founders and CTO with direct social media links, I'm having trouble verifying any of the other members. For instance, ""Maksym Bourduh"" has a picture of someone who has clearly been in a public space, but when I search the name, the only instance is the Betrium website.  I realized that there may be some Cyrillic character translation in play, and maybe he's never used the Romanized version - so I check over on google.com.ua and did get a hit for someone that looks similar (Romanized surname 'Bourdiuh'), but nothing that tied to the crypto space or the project (e.g. math, programming, marketing, etc). I tried the same for other members, and got varying results, but nothing that made any reasonable link to a project looking for millions of dollars in funding.  Please understand that I'm not trying to publicly cast doubt the validity of the project, but with the state of ICOs (and of course the world at large), verification and trust is key.
