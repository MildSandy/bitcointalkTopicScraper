We are pleased to introduce our team – people who develop and improve IQeon platform. Meet Yuriy Lipinsky, IQeon’s lead web developer!  Yuriy studied programming at the School of Business of Belarusian State University. His background is a considerable number of sites and online stores. He also has a wide-ranging experience in the analysis, data processing and full-stack development.  Yuriy Lipinsky joined IQeon team as a front-end developer in the beginning of 2019. As for today, he is a full-stack developer. Yuriy supports the platform, fixes errors and adds new features interesting to players.  “The development of leaderboard on the platform was the most interesting task for me, because it combined front-end and back-end parts. The front-end was realised through the WebSockets and the back-end using PHP. Generally, web development approaches keep changing all the time. There was a time, when front-end and back-end programming weren’t particularly divided. Then the responsibilities for working with the server and the client part began to segregate. And now, redistribution is taking place again. As a result, building of server-side logic gradually falls to the front-end developer”, — told Yuriy Lipinsky.  Any programmer have to be hunger for knowledge, strive to learn and implement new tools at work. That is the only way to keep a professional in your field. Yuriy Lipinsky doesn’t stop on already studied frameworks, such as AngularJS, ReactJS and other ones. He seeks to explore deeper into PHP and JavaScript ecosystems, in order to implement the new tools in his work.  The platform has moved to the open beta-test stage on the 26 of March 2019. It is a source of considerable pride for Yuriy, because a technical stability of IQeon.com launching was up to him.  “I really remembered the phrase from the Tony Hsieh’s book. It is a story of creation the “Zappos” company, which “Amazon” has bought afterwards. The company’s products should raise the “wow effect” for its staff, and thanks to that, significantly greater results  can be achieved in business. IQeon is just a case in point. The idea of the platform allows to develop it in opposite directions and using a digital asset as in-game currency gets possibility to create quiet real values out of virtual items. In addition, our platform is a good chance for developers to find an audience for their gaming products. IQeon architecture has already allowed to integrate into the platform a large number of games. So, the platform has great prospects! I'm proud of being a part of this team”, — emphasized Yuriy.",False

Expansion of partner network  One of our main goals is to provide IQN holders with the widest possible range of apps and services for performing cryptocurrency transactions on favorable terms.

The work with repositories brought results: IQN became available natively in MetaMask. MyCrypto - service similar to MyEtherWallet, implemented the native support as well. We are still waiting for the most important results on these direction and will for sure inform you about them as certain milestones are reached.  The last, but not the least among our achievements is already known to you - the addition of IQN to Eidoo wallet.

CoinMarketCap - the main rating of cryptocurrencies, thanks to which representatives of the global crypto community can monitor the capitalization and trading statistics of all cryptocurrencies. Adding IQN to this rating will be our next prior goal.  We will certainly share the details of the development of the platform in a special review - Development Update, which is planned for September.

IQeon is the ecosystem connecting games, apps and services based on intellectual competitions between players.  The total funds raised during the ICO is 1,055 ETH, 111 LTC and 8,5 BTC, that’s quite a substantial sum of money if we exchange it into USD. The number of active users has reached 1 million. The IQeon project was rated at 10 well-known tracking platforms, and IQN token will be listed on 4 major cryptocurrency exchanges. Our team has introduced the project at numerous international conferences, covering the topics of the blockchain, cryptocurrencies and a game-development industry. Four game and application developing companies have integrated their products into the IQeon platform and we launched a beta-version of the game IQClash. We have achieved such results only in 3 months! IQeon managed to do so thanks to our strong community, which includes more than 35.000 subscribers on LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.  The IQeon team is very grateful to have such a big audience of supporters in the gaming industry and to see an increasing number of subscribers in social networks. Stay tuned for more news from IQeon!",False

The aim of the event is to build a bridge between the crypto and traditional economies. IQeon is a vivid example of how cryptoworld may enter the traditional gaming sphere. IQeon is a Blockchain-based gaming PvP that gives users and game developers opportunities to earn on playing and creating games.  The importance of the Forum to the cryptoworld is additionally highlighted by Forbes. It distinguishes the Singapore meeting as one of the main events to facilitate the discussions of the most important topics of the crypto economy and its growing influence on the global economy. ""The forum is a great place for the market leaders to introduce and reinforce rules of self-conduct protecting uninformed contributors and preventing misuse of the crypto transaction while scaling benefits such as built-in rights registry, early adopters acquisition and low transaction costs due to the absence of middlemen.""  We hope to spot the light and grab the attention of investors, bloggers, bankers, venture capitalists, and potential partners. The total amount of investors is expected to be around 500. Vadim is planning to speak about IQeon project at one of 30 round tables organized during the three-days of Singapore Economic Forum. The opportunity to network during the 8 breaks introduced throughout the forum and finding partners to grow our audience is especially important as we are now offering our tokens for sale during the ICO (January 30 - March 13, 2018).",False

What is a game room?  Game rooms include a set of logical tasks that should be completed within a short period of time. The winner is the one who spends the least amount of time to complete the tasks. Moreover, these rooms are open for some particular period of time. Afterwards, they are closed and the winners receive their rewards.  The prize fund is made up of bets placed by the gamers. The platform and the developers of the games take the commission (that is quite small, less than 10%) and the rest of the prize fund is distributed among the players who received the highest score.  There are two types of game rooms:  - Public - The list of public game rooms is provided and anyone can participate. Private - Private rooms are created by players with a set of parameters (specified amount of players and period of time for the room to be open (available). The founder of the private room could change the settings and make it public or keep it private.  One of the brightest examples is IQClash game.

Everyone wants to be a better version of who they are. Be smarter, fit, study new languages, etc. Modern apps are huge helpers as through the system of notifications they remind the owners of the phones to do something: have a morning jog, study 20 new words, do some brain stretching etc.  The IQeon decentralized platform welcomes motivational apps and personal growth scenarios to be implemented into the system, moreover, we have everything ready for that. The unique feature that IQeon offers to the developers of motivational apps is that we could make their products interactive; users of IQeon platforms could poke each other and make bets on some particular kinds of activity.  For example, user 1 writes that he/she bets to run 2 km every morning for 10 days. User 2 confirms the bet and claims to do the same. They bet on some sum of money and make a common deposit. All the details of the bet are automatically written into the Blockchain network of IQeon platform and cannot be changed. The one who wins the bet receives the prize fund (minus the platform commission, which is very small, though). Smart contract mechanism introduced on the platform makes the payment transparent and ironclad.  Complete strangers, as well as your own friends, are able to poke you and organize a motivational bet. Be ready to go bold and earn on your personal growth.",False

Augmented reality uses the existing environment and overlays new information on the top of it.  The IQeon gaming ecosystem allows running quest-games based on Augmented Reality. Players receive intelligent tasks and jump to every new level as soon the previous task has been successfully accomplished. The quests encourage people to go out and pin down their location (it could be parks, public places, bridges, etc.). Having found the right place, the gamer finds the clue with the help of AR. Then it is entered into the app based on IQeon decentralized platform.  The quest is announced some time before the game starts and the participants know the exact time. The sooner the players complete all the levels of the quest-game, the more chances they have to be proclaimed winners. The prize fund is divided between the first 3 players and the winnings depends upon the time spent to complete the quest.  This year IQeon is on course to add new dimensions to the platform, and the introduction of quests, variety of games and applications based on AR is the part of this global goal. This aim like other IQeon innovative ideas is reflected on the project roadmap, which you can get acquainted with on the company’s official website.",False

In 2017, the volume of the games market reached $109 billion, and by 2021 the volume is considered to reach $130 billion. As for the players, from the two billion gamers a maximum of 3% are able to monetize their achievements, often facing the problem of fraud.  The IQeon PvP gaming platform is a revolutionary solution that has a number of advantages for players, developers, and investors. Players get the opportunity to enjoy their favorite online games, bet on the outcome of games and so on, as well as legally and safely monetize their gaming achievements and receive guaranteed winnings due to smart contracts. Developers receive additional revenue from each bid, the platform takes the lowest commission for revenue (10% instead of 30% like for AppStore and Google Play), integration of gaming products into the IQeon ecosystem through API platforms is fast and easy, the audience of gamers is constantly growing.  Thanks to the growth of the audience of players and partners, the value of the internal means of payment - the IQN crypto currency - will also be constantly increasing, which would be beneficial for investors. IQN tokens during the periods of pre-ICO (additional round) and ICO can be purchased at a low price.  We want to remind that the additional round of pre-ICO starts on January 8 and ends on January 15, 2018. The volume of emission will be about $ 1,300,000. For 1 ETH investors will be able to buy 550 IQN. This price is one and a half times more profitable in comparison with the main course. The ICO will be held at the end of January.  Hurry to invest in a promising project that will bring the long-awaited solution to the most pressing problem of the game industry!",False

To confirm the invariability and reliability of the conditions of each competition (bet), as well as to ensure their implementation, developers have implemented Smart contracts. The technology works on the basis of Ethereum blockchain, as well as the platform's own token - IQN.  What is a smart contract?  Smart contract technology is widely used in many spheres beginning from governmental, running unbiased elections and ending up with finances, concluding business contracts. This is a special protocol designed for parties to participate in negotiations, check the terms, implement agreements and monitor the performance of the contract. Everything is provided on automated basis due to the Blockchain technology. The implementation of smart contracts allows the participants making reliable, monitored and irreversible transactions without the involvement of third parties. The smart contract contains all the information about the terms of the contract, and guarantees that the actions provided by the contract are performed automatically.  We are one of the first solutions at the world’s scale to allow organizing PvP competitions on fixed conditions and assure the players of getting the winning payment instantly through the Smart contract technology. Thus, the winning is automatically transferred to the player’s wallet. Also users can connect to any online games (from chess to Warcraft), which take place outside the platform. This is possible thanks to the open API of the IQeon gaming platform. Enjoy the game, improve your intellectual skills and monetize your achievements!

Only 3% of players have learned to monetize their gaming achievements, and 57% of them are subject to fraud, or their accounts are blocked by developers, which leads to the loss of all virtual achievements. In this regard, the launch of the decentralized PvP game platform IQeon, the pre-sale of the tokens of which starts on December 15, will certainly attract considerable interest among intelligent game fans and not only.  At present, the global market of mobile intelligent games is up to 4.9 billion USD, and their audience is constantly increasing, which attracts more and more investments in this sphere. According to the SurveyMonkey Intelligence survey in the field of mobile games and applications, intelligent games and puzzle games take the first place by the amount of time spent in the game: each active user spends an average of more than 1 hour per month.
