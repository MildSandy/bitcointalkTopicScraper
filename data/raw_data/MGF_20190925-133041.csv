The USB flash card does not affect access to the Magnify Public services.  If the USB flash card is damaged or lost, the following options remain:  1.    If you have kept PRIVATE KEY as it was recommended upon installing the program on the USB flash card, you (and only you) can access your protected crypto monetary assets through the blockchain of your crypto currency. You can reinstall the application on another USB carrier and relocate your coins to the new Cold Storage via standard blockchain means. 2.    If you are using our Safe service, which is highly recommended, it will request a special phrase containing no less than 12 words that encrypts your PRIVATE KEY. Following that, it will automatically install the program on the USB flash card, generate a new PRIVATE KEY and relocate your coins from an old account to a new one. It will also encrypt a new key with your special phrase.  If you are using the Safe service, the program will fulfill the entire operation by itself.  However, keep in mind that PRIVATE KEY and the Safe key phrase are stored by you, which means that if you forget the key while switching off the Safe service or if you forget the key phrase as well, we will not be able to restore your access. We do not keep your key phrase and Cold Storage PRIVATE KEY without your permission. You are entirely responsible for the safety of this information.",False

The main idea of MAGNIFY WALLET is to solve crypto assets security problems and make platform where user can manage his/her crypto capital comfortably, make activities easier and smarter, trade with unprecedented low fees. Cold Storage – Magnify Paranoia is a unique MAGNIFY product. It is a software, multicurrency crypto wallet, with a very high safety threshold.  How it works  1.   Download the application to a USB flash drive; 2.   Disconnect the computer from the Internet; 3.   Enter and confirm your PIN code (we recommend setting 4-8 characters). If the PIN is entered incorrectly, after three attempts the device will be blocked, and the attacker cannot gain access to your wallets and crypto-currencies; 4.   Set up a two-step authentication (authenticator) factor. 2-step verification provides additional protection for your data. Even if the scammer steals your device and personal PIN, he will not be able to log into your account without a special code that is sent only to your mobile phone; 5.   12-24 words of a written down secret phrase will be created when using Safe. This phrase is a key to security. Without it, it will be impossible to restore access to your funds. You can generate an ADDRESS / PRIVATE KEY for a selected crypto currency. After receiving PRIVATE KEY, all information about it will be encoded. Data never leaves the device and interacts solely with applications to convey a transaction confirmation. After which, you will then have everything that is required to use the crypto currency purse: Addresses of your purses which can be given to other people, the ability to receive and send any crypto currency, using the appropriate buttons and functions in the installed program, a transaction history and address book.
