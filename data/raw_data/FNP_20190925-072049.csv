Thanks for your interest in the project. We don't have the information on private sale right now. If this changes we will update this space.  Let me try to answer your question, although I'm not too clear about what you are referring to when you say ""values generated by the application."" What is great about the FlipnPik platform is that it is a social media ecosystem which helps local businesses by giving them the the tools they need to succeed. Through creating incentives for local user‚Äôs participation, the power to succeed can be put back into the hands of local communities, working together to improve the neighborhood quality of life.  These are some of the stakeholders that will benefit from FlipnPik:  -Users can discover and follow nearby local businesses, benefiting from their promotions and offers. When they engage with theses businesses and promote them within their community, they collect flip social. They can then use their Flip Social for games or real rewards such as promotions and products or exchange them against FNP token.  - Merchants can promote their business throughout quality content, promotions and offers and gain additional visibility through premium services.  -Token holders can become a merchant partner, helping the merchant to promote his business, creating value within the ecosystem and benefiting from remuneration from the merchant.  There is an app available on Apple and Googleplay. It's only live in Montreal at the moment, but after the token sale, you will be able to use it worldwide.  You can download the app here: Apple Store: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flipnpik/id1191900917?mt=8 Google Playstore: https://play.google.com/store/search?q=FlipnPik&hl=en",False

Many centralized companies ‚Äì such as Facebook or Instagram - offer businesses features that allow them to promote their store and sell products or services online. But the visibility of these offers remains very limited in view, due to the general nature of these social networks and it strongly depends on developments in the algorithm.

On FlipNpik, location-based search and bookmarking take precedence over other publications giving fair visibility to all local businesses.  FlipNpik is an integrated technology dedicated to the promotion of local consumption and local businesses. Its mission is to offer businesses better visibility and consumers real rewards and compensation for their input and value creation.  The ecosystem advocates a collaborative economy by creating mutually beneficial partnerships between consumers and merchants. The value created is shared equitably between active actors.  The platform has innovative and fun functionalities that combine games, real rewards and financial benefits to the consumer experience.  FlipNpik is not just another fidelity program.

These local shops rarely have the resources needed to stay in the game. An innovative solution is therefore required to allow them to maintain a competitive edge.  FlipNpik is the first Collaborative Social Media tailored for local businesses. It is operating in an Ecosystem based on the Blockchain technology, in which the value generated is distributed in an equitable and decentralized manner among all active collaborators. The primary mission is to contribute to the improvement of the local economy and to promote the circuits of local and responsible consumption.    The FlipNpik Platform The FlipNpik platform offers businesses enhanced visibility generated by the participation of their community. The participatory model gives users-collaborators the opportunity to get rewards or remunerations for their actions.  Value Creation Users-collaborators contribute to the value creation by enhancing businesses‚Äô visibility through different actions, by adding new businesses on the app or by becoming an Ambassador Partner.  The FlipNpik token and the Flip Social The FlipNpik (FNP) is a utility token, distributed and identified on the Stellar Platform. The Flip Social is a reward system dedicated to stimulate and retain the users of the Platform.  Sharing of the value In return for their positive actions, users-collaborators receive Flip Social that they can use to benefit from instantaneous promotions, to discover and obtain products or simply to be entertained with the available games on the Platform. Ambassadors Partners receive a remuneration from their business when they actively contribute to increase the visibility of the business within the Ecosystem.     The FlipNpik token will be issued on the Stellar Blockchain. It can be used by businesses to buy Premium services, users can deposit FNP to become an Ambassador partner and finally consumers will be able to use it on marketplaces. FlipNpik chose the Stellar platform for their scalable volume of transactions with minimum fees. Merchants will have a practical solution to promote their businesses and easily set up an online store at low cost. Thus, small businesses will have a new point of sale allowing them to reach new clients.  1 ETH = 3500 FNP HARDCAP = 100 000 ETH ACCEPTED CURRENCIES : ETH, BTC, LTC, DASH, DOGE      An expert team in business development, public finance, technology development and marketing is working on FlipNpik :  - Its CEO, Henri Harland, is an expert in finance and public financing. His vision and sense of entrepreneurship and execution helped one of his companies to become the first to extract and therapeutically exploit krill oil. Participating in the listing of several companies on the stock market, Henri Harland built his legacy by creating and sharing value and he wants FlipNpik to follow the same steps. - Serge Helou, the CTO, worked as a software developer at Ericsson Canada before joining L‚ÄôOr√©al Canada as a business analyst and project manager. In the digital business IT team, he launched several e-commerce sites for the various brands of the group as well as one of the first online loyalty programs in the group. His experience helped him develop skills in digital technologies applied to retail commerce and in project management, which will be useful for FlipNpik and its project. - Richard Marganne, the President, served as COO (Chief Operating Officer) at the heart of the Oleosea Company in Lausanne prior to becoming CEO of Gobet RuÃàtschi.
