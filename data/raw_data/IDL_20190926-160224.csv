IdealCoin will be processed and protected by algorithms for immediate use.  These digital commodities are produced by large numbers of INFLUENCERS generating a critical mass of information. These INFLUENCERS can then accumulate, own, transfer, sell, trade or even use these assets as currency, benefiting from the usual guarantees and protections established by todayâ€™s digital tokens: valuable resources in this era of monetized information and digitalization.  About PayMHO: PayMHO is a digital social media platform where Influencers can actively participate in the generation of information and content while earning monetary benefits. After little more than a brief introduction, any individual can become a professional Influencer and start earning money regularly, engaging with an audience, and generating value that companies and organization will be interested in purchasing.  With each click, Influencers will generate bits of information that will build up into a chain of data that will eventually increase in value. We call this process crafting. Each crafting is linked together in hash chains, producing millions of pieces of secure, useful and valuable data, which in turn generate a critical mass of information.  Influencers retain ownership and control of their generated information, and by participating on the network, they will be playing their part in the digital age in a way that is fun, easy and enjoyable. As the system generates a data chain from the activities of hundreds of thousands of Influencers, it rewards Influencers by transforming each bit of information into a Digital Value Unit that we call a Talent.  What is PayMHO YouTube Video Explanation  About Talent: Talent are value units generated in the PayMHO platform that can be used to acquire goods and services within the PayMHO platform, invest in new knowledge exchanged with other Influencers, transfer resources to other Influencers on the network instantly and efficiently, and invest in businesses, causes, and projects. Talents can also be changed into the Influencer's own currency.  Talents can be used by third parties to purchase the information generated by Influencers. If Influencers or third parties want to use their Talents off the PayMHO platform, they can exchange their Talents for IdealCoin.

There is a steemit article about idealcoin which is a bit old and appears to have been based off of a mangling of an earlier version of the whitepaper (a version from October 2018).  for example, here's a paragraph from IdealCoin's current whitepaper (from page 7, available here : https://idealcoin.io/assets/whitepaper3.pdf) :  ""Those who wish to consult or use the PayMHO services must pay INFLUENCERS to gain access to their profiles. Having paid, CLIENTS will be free to extract the desired statistics, obtaining more information than they could have hoped for thanks to the high degree of market profiling. There is no risk to INFLUENCERS of invasion of privacy.""  and here is what appears to be a similar, but rather humorous attempted rendering of the same paragraph in the steemit article (available here : https://steemit.com/crypto/@kingseen/ideal-coins-what-is-pay-mho) :  ""Those who wish or need to ask or use the services of Pay MHO platform have to pay the leaders to get the accurate entry to their currency. After paying, purchasers will be capable to extract the essential content for free, getting more info than they could expect on the method to a sharp degree of profiling in the marketplace. There is no hazard of interfering with segregation.""  I have to wonder what sort of ""translate into language X then back into english"" procedures the steemit author went through in order to write his article ",False
