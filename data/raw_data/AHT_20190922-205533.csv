To receive refund please go to https://ahoolee.io/tokensale and follow our instructions.  We have analyzed all our steps and identified our mistakes:  1. The most important thing is that we didn't communicate personally with professional investors. We did it on pre-sale but on ICO we were confident about closing the round in any case. This time we were counting on the completed questionnaires: they showed us about $4M of possible investments and we decided that we would definitely collect $1M. One of our recommendations for those who conduct ICO is to start with personal agreements with investors about closing minimum soft-cup amount, and only then go on to ICO launch.  2. We used too complicated ICO scheme. We decided to go against market rules and act as it is accepted in the venture market - to collect a small round with a huge discount, then collect some more but still with a big discount, etc. We carried out our rounds far apart in time. Such scheme normally work on the venture market but there are other rules in the ICO market. Apparently, crypto investors didn't understand the meaning of this scheme and didn't want to join it.  3. Huge discounts on pre-sale and seed-round. We focused on the amount of venture rounds in calculating tokens prices. In venture market, a huge discount is given at the pre-seed round due to the huge risks. It turned out that in the ICO market such a discount only discourages investors.  4. Description of the project was too complex. Unfortunately, we were not able to convey the idea of the project to regular users. It is necessary to present the project in such a way that any user could understand by one phrase whether he needs it or not.  5. PR in mass media was not provided in time. Well, our partners let us down and we didn't see the necessary articles before the ICO launch. Plan budget for paid publications for such cases!  6. Work with the community should be more active. We got an active Russian-speaking community and very inactive English-speaking one. Also we moved the links to all communities to the bottom of the landing page, which didn't contribute to users involvement. By the way, in our experience, slack is evil. There’s constant spam and scam. Also, we practically didn't make any newsletters to our subscribers, which is bad! Work hard with your email database, as it pays off.  7. Advisors are needed from the very beginning. We attracted the advisers quite late. I can not say that this is critical, but it is useful to have them.  8. Our overconfidence didn’t help as well. In fact, it affected everything but one of the most serious consequences is a too complicated smart contract followed by inability to extend the duration of the ICO, etc.  What conclusions we have made and what we will do next: we will repackage the product and may be even rebrand it. We aim to communicate the globality of our idea to the big investors. We will conduct pre-sale and ICO according to the usual market scheme, attracting professional investors in advance. This is just the beginning!",False

Firstly, we thought about legal issues for a long distance and here are the thoughts that we had at this stage:  - the registration of a company in some jurisdiction and the choice of this jurisdiction is highly dependent on the goals. There can be two goals in the case of ICO:  1. company used to convert cryptocurrency to fiat.  2. company to conduct the operational activities of the project.  - in our case we choosed the second option. It is more expensive, but more transparent and we still need a global company to run the Ahoolee. Regarding this, the decision was made to postpone registration until the end of the next round of the ICO, immediately after its closure we are making a company to conduct the operational activities of the project.  Secondly, we considered a business model for the project, as planned. Actually here's what we got at the output: https://www.dropbox.com/s/onorospe2zvk0il/%D0%A1%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%88%D0%BE%D1%82%202017-07-20%2012.57.27.png?dl=0  As you can see from the financial model, we need a minimum investment of 35M to achieve our goals and to grow further quickly.  And for dessert here is a piece of video that we shot during the presale in our office and the reaction to what was happened As you remember, we've collected $200,000 for half an hour, and for the first 30 seconds we've got more than $ 100,000 Https://youtu.be/qna2-TRh-xA",False

Due to the fact that we conduct ICO on our own, 5 million tokens are released from the reserve for partners.  As a result, we slightly changed the format of the round.  1. Soft cap = $ 1,000,000. <$ 1,000,000 If the soft cap will not be reached, all funds sent to the smart contract will be returned to the owners.  2. Cap = $ 3,750,000 $ 1,000,000 - $ 3,750,000 If cap will not be reached, the number of tokens to sell, will be determined in accordance with how many funds will be received. The price of each token will be exactly $ 0.15 at the current exchange rate of ETH / USD  3. Hard Cap = $ 10,000,000 $ 3,750,000 - $ 10,000,000 If hard cap will not be reached, 25 million tokens will be sold and the price of each token will be formed from the amount collected and will be in the range of $ 0.15- $ 0.40 The price of token = collected funds / 25,000,000 tokens  In the case of Cap passing, at least 20% of the collected funds will go to product marketing, and the development of internal contextual advertising will be made before the end of the year. These are additional actions for which we collect a larger amount than originally planned.  Right now we see that even on an alpha version without traffic, we start earning commissions from stores that participate in affiliate programs. As a result with marketing, we will be able to show to April 2018 not only a full-fledged product on the blockchain, but also a normal revenue so that the next round could be as successful as possible.",False

And using a separate search engine for buying stuff takes literally the same effort as using google and going to the source shop.  And other than the top shops like amazon or ebay, plenty of the small and middle ones don't follow their own stock closely so it might say they have 10 of an item in stock while they have none. And small shops might tell you they have everything in stock while they don't even have a warehouse, they just order what you order and after the wait they ship it to you for extra. Or just use fake prices to lure customer. Shops like this would spam a shopping exclusive search engine.  A service like this doesn't need its own token, nor should it ask for trucks of money.

This instrument makes it possible to analyze the entire e-commerce market fully and it will be available to everyone.  In addition, Ahoolee’s own cryptocurrency will enable users to purchase any items in all the stores represented on the platform. At the moment, Ahoolee’s database contains more than 40 million SKUs, and the number grows daily.   We plan ICO in 3 steps, like venture investments. We're going to have a traction between all of them and everyone can see, that we make a real product, anyone can use it and may be company even have some revenue already. That's why we don't try to get $50M right now. We don't need them now. This money is necessary for scale and we'll get it when we're going to scale.   A total of 100 million Ahoolee tokens will be issued.  20 million will be kept by the Reserve Fund to pay miners and assessors. These tokens will be kept in multi-signature wallets. 10 million will be kept by the Ahoolee Fund for the team and partners and in order to hire new staff and develop the project further over the next 5 years. These tokens will be kept in multi-signature wallets.  ICO would be launched in a few steps:  1. Pre-sale (July 2017). On Pre-sale round would be sold 10 million AHT. Cap - $200,000. Price 1 AHT = $0.02 Cash will go to preparation of public launch of Ahoolee search engine and to marketing and preparation of ICO seed-round.  2. ICO seed-round (28th August - 11th September 2017). On ICO seed-round would be sold 25 million AHT. Soft Cap - $1,000,000 Cap - $3,750,000 Hard Cap - $10,000,000 Price 1 AHT = $0.15 - $0.4 Cash will go to development of in-house blockchain as a fork of Ethereum, to wallet development, to mining launch and to product marketing. In 6 months we’ll increase the number of SKUs in the system to 1 billion and the number of stores in the system to 50 000. Also we’ll develop and launch an assessor cabinet to teach machine learning matching algorithms. Not less than 20% of funds will go to product marketing in a few countries.  3. ICO (April 2018). On ICO would be sold 30 million AHT. Cap - $50,000,000. Price 1 AHT = $1.66 Cash will go to global marketing, sales scale to sell premium-accounts and contextual advertising for stores. Ahoolee will start accepting AHT as a means of payment in any stores available in the Ahoolee search engine.  Join us at Slack and Telegram. And subscribe at http://ahoolee.io",False
