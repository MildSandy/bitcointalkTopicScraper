First one is distributing of availability of data and reservation which has partially solved with GDS(Global Distrubution Systems), second one is operations and settlement between all parties and third one is circulation of payment through means of domestic and over the border transactions.  These three main issues are bottlenecks for travel industry to improve themself. With the millennials needs like Remote check-in, paperless boarding passes, real-time travel news, maps, GPS, messaging, shopping, travel industry has to change their business models to decentralize ones. Further Network is building Autonomus Smart Travel Ecosystem to solve this issues for every party in travel industry and changing their business models with decentralize one. With Further Network, We envision a future where the travel products are customizable, interactive and autonomous. An airline ticket can be a personalized product, solely for that travel for the person buying at the time of engagement. We may, very well, customize the ticket from the leg length of the row to the in-flight entertainment package the frequent flyer receives. Airlines may generate a peer-to-peer interline agreement contract within minutes of demand rises and offer them automatically. We may distribute and enable this personalized pass in your digital wallet, proofing your true identity, to be used from the autonomous vehicle taking you to the airport, throughout your flight and at the door of your destination hotel room.   “Planes from different airlines are docking at the terminal gates surrounded by the ground-service crew.” by chuttersnap on Unsplash  With digital currency Aton with in the Ecosystem, Travellers can buy airline tickets or make hotel reservations etc. without pay any intermediary fee.  Aton, main driving force of Further Network  The Aton is at the heart of the Further Network Ecosystem. The token would be useful to conduct transactions and also help users of the platform to participate in the governance of the platform. All transactions which has a value in the Further Ecosystem will both be kept in desired currency and Aton. This will allow the system to calculate the entirety of the transactions and set the balance independent of the currency used by the issuer or the purchaser. This is important for ease of calculation and conversion to other currencies. In an example of an agency in Brazil working with other agencies around the globe can see the balance of all the operations in Aton and its conversion in Brazilian Reais without depending on counterparts’ particular currency or another third currency, where another conversion is necessary  Aton (ATON), Further Network’s digital currency, is not an investment-grade security of any kind. Aton is a digital token for participation and use of the Further Travel Settlement Network and does not confer ownership of a stake in the business.  source: https://medium.com/furthernetwork/decentralization-of-travel-industry-12a688333f78",False

As many of you know by now, Aton is the digital coin for participation and use of the Further Network which aims to provide a solution to Airlines, Agencies, Hotels and travel service providers to solve their Billing, Settlement, and Payment (BSP) issues while removing the 3rd parties and completing BSP in real-time through our Autonomous Smart Travel Ecosystem.  Aton is based on Stellar- a Payment Blockchain. Further Network will issue a fixed amount of 7 billion Atons when establishing the ecosystem. This basically means the supply will be limited and no more Atons will be generated in the future.  Details About ATON  Token name: Aton Token symbol: ATON Project platform: Hyperledger Fabric Token type: Stellar Token initial price: 1 ATON = 0.02 USD Total tokens issued: 7,000,000,000 ATON Total tokens available for sale: 4,200,000,000 ATON Pre-Sale start date: August 5th, 2018 Accepted Currencies: XLM, BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, DASH, USD  Pre-Sale bonuses: Stage 1: 40% bonus Stage 2: 30% bonus Stage 3: 20% bonus Stage 4: 10% bonus  ICO bonuses: Stage 5: 5% bonus Stage 6: 0% bonus  FAQ on Aton and ICO  1. Why do you need a token?  Aton is the main fuel for the Network. It is the currency for payments, settlements and transactions. That means, parties can make settlements and payments between each other at the same time with the data being stored in our token, Aton. Even if a party pays in USD and another one receiving the money in Yen, the money is being converted to Aton within the system, and enriched with all the settlement & payment data.  1. What’s your KYC and whitelist process?  We require each investor to go through our KYC/AML process. We are incorporated in Gibraltar and our ICO is being regulated within the law.  We are working with TokenGet, the choice of 30+ ICOs for the whole ICO process.  3. How do you expect the token price to change in the future?  With each travel company integrating Further Network technology, the price would go up since that’s what determines the demand.  4. When can I trade my ATONs?  Aton investors will be able to buy and sell Atons when we are listed on the Stock Exchange which is planned in Q4 2018.   source: https://medium.com/furthernetwork/aton-ico-pre-sale-details-and-faq-269ea5cdaeec",False

Our vision We aim to revolutionize the processes of travelling on B2B level so it could have a positive impact on day to day lives of all travellers. Further’s disruption starts with Autonomous Smart Travel Ecosystem where any asset provider from small to large, Airline to Hotel or Tour Provider would be able to create their own assets, create their own modifiable services and publish them using their own smart contract and get real time payment throughout the system using Blockchain and cryptocurrencies.  We begin with tokenization of current assets from proprietary systems and for easy settlement and payment and continue with identity sharing and ultimately achieving a fully integrated set of systems with Blockchain which will directly tokenize the assets without any midware.  Problem Travel is one of the biggest industries in the world with a global economic contribution of 7 trillion U.S. dollars in 2016. But the process of customer booking is based on the rules that were set more than 40 years ago. Even with the arrival of e-commerce, the standards didn't change to reflect the needs of a digital-era consumer. This is why you are having a badly designed experience with not many options to suit your needs when you travel.  Solution Our Blockchain-based technology enables a faster and customizable ticketing and travel experience. We aim to help Airlines, Agencies, Hotel Wholesalers and travel product issuers alike to solve the Billing, Settlement, and Payment issues while removing the middle-man and completing BSP in real-time.  The ticket should be more than just a manifest of flight information. It must be customizable or even personalizable for traveler’s needs and preferences. With Further Network's unique technologies travellers will be able to change, sell, add options and customize their tickets. Moreover it will not be a simple ticket anymore but Smart Travel Record, a Further Network technology.  How it works? STR, Smart Travel Record; a smart token, unique Further Network technology consisting of necessary data for flight, hotel or any other reservation or any other travel product. STR will help solve the issues of settlement and payment using Aton, our digital currency. STR would also bring more structured data and automation to the operational usability for vendors to offer their travellers specific rule sets.   About the Token  Our token is called Aton and it is based on Stellar. Aton will be issued as 7.000.000.000 Stellar token and will not be issued again to increase amount by any central party included Further Network. We have 3 different use case for Aton in Further Network Ecosystem.  Settlement Currency Reconciliation and payment are two main problems for the industry. If the institutions only want to use the system for settlement, they can still use STR and other system tools. However, if the institutions want to complete the payment process, they will be able to pay with Aton in real-time. Payment Currency Any end-user who uses our wallet will be able to buy tickets or make reservations within our network from any available product issuers. (Airlines, Travel Agencies, Hotels, etc.) Transaction Currency Aton will be used like the gas price in Stellar to compensate for the transaction cost occuring on the network. It will be collected by Further Network for maintenance and other costs of the network.
