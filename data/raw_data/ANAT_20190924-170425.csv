For trading/trading volumes you can expect it to be relatively light once official listings on decentralised exchanges are up, but gradually increase as the Anacoins are used for sponsorship starting from this month and the full platform gets up and running.  We clearly didn't manage to penetrate the crypto community, but have had more international coverage than any but the largest projects and have more in the pipeline, including a trip around the Middle East and Asia in the next few months talking to governments, partners and donors.  At $50k a day trading volume coins become eligible to join coinmarketcap listings and it would be suitable to move to a centralised exchange, most of these now cost $30-100k for a listing, which is money we would rather spend on development at this point.  I would warn everyone against EtherDelta given their recent actions, not sure that any of the tokens you have there are secure.

In the meantime here is an article I wrote today on how we are the first token to have tax relief for UK and US contributors:  https://hackernoon.com/tax-efficient-crypto-assets-c5abfbe0499c  and here is a powerful TEDx video from our COO and Kofi Annan Bjørn Ihler on why we must build Ananas, sharing his experience of the Utøya attack when Anders Breivik tried to murder him and his fight against hate since:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmBATofAXr4  To be honest the token sale has completely exhausted the team as I think we've done most things right except for the smart contract error.  In particular the bounty, while we are grateful for the efforts of the hundreds who participated, proved a huge drain as they literally had to go through every tweet and retweet to be fair rather than focusing on building the product.  There will be a feature on Ananas on the BBC Radio 4 Today Programme on Wednesday, so 7 million more people will hear about it.  Feature pieces in Coindesk, Coin Telegraph and other crypto press also hopefully on the way, as is the story of how Tony Robbins originally backed this project and news on some interesting new joiners.  Once the project gets going I think people will quickly realise that the core of the token economy is a souped up version of what is currently happening with Crypto Kitties, which should sustain it well into the future.

Anacoins are given to contributors by the Foundation or communities who purchase them, eg to sponsor prizes for resource creation or to reward active community members. As ERC-20 tokens they will be exchangeable for any currency with ease once they are hopefully trading regularly next year.  Now we can look at the other side: why would anyone buy Anacoin? What's the demand?  The primary use of Anacoin is to sponsor resources.  Practically, this means you can sponsor a verse of the Bible, Qu'ran or even constitution, with the top three sponsors receiving special status (auction style) for a year on the platform and those who do a minimum sponsorship also get status.  Sponsorships are per language so, for example, there are 6,236 verses available for sponsorship in Turkish. There are additional bonuses for sponsoring entire chapters or every verse.  Sponsoring a verse doesn't 'cost' Anacoins, but instead locks them up for 1-3 years, with rewards for higher holding periods.  Amounts of Anacoins locked up are also aggregated on a community basis, so you can see, for example, that Catholics are supporting the Living Bible with 5 million Anacoins whereas the Mormons have 6 million of sponsorship.  This does not inform strict governance, but it does guide the Foundation as to where we should focus.  There is a second form of sponsorship, which are auctions for chapters, eg surah of the Quran. These are lifetime donations in exchange for huge status as, for example, the Living Quran will include every other digital resource that can be found.  We anticipate governments, institutions and high net worth individuals will be involved in these auctions, where bidding in Anacoins gives a hefty discount for the winning bid. Half of the proceeds from these auctions go toward buying Anacoins in the open market.  Sponsorships are unique digital assets backed with a hardware key that can be resold with the permission of the Foundation, who receive half the profits. Given the most expensive rare pepe is a few million dollars now this could be huge.   Anacoins are also used in the data construction platform, where communities, liberal to conservative, pick and choose resources and views that represent them in increasing complexity (which is why we are using hyper-relational databases & AI). You need to stake yourself up with Anacoins to enter this area and submit resources, providing a level of troll protection as Anacoins are lost if you break the rules.  When a community has packaged all these up, they can submit a curated data set for our custom consumer apps (Living Qu'ran, Bible, Constitution etc), for which they need to stake further Anacoins as a ""proof of stake"", potentially being able to draw from the pool of staked coins in the verse/community level.  This also makes sense in regards to the ""price"" of staking for content, as the basics of every community are simple, but as time goes by and more is mapped, it becomes increasingly complex, requiring higher and higher rewards. Curated content resources also become more verified as leaders of each respective real life community get a chance to sign off on them, becoming a community resource.  The concept of all of this is incentive alignment.  Clearly a lot of people would like to have a comprehensive, dynamic, end platform where they can reliably access digital and real life resources of their own community and others if they like.  Standardising the support element and having people see the value of hodling aligns all sorts of different groups to build a platform for everyone, even if they primarily use it and the tools they provide for their own community.  Locking up increasing amounts of Anacoins as more and more communities join the platform means that there is huge incentive to join it early and strong competition between groups in a ""tech arms race"" while creating a free to use community resource for the world.  As the price moves up, the incentive to hodl increases further, much as Ethereum and Bitcoin engender pseudo-religious fervour (this is known as the endowment effect).  There is more explanation on our blog, whitepaper and video on www.anacoin.io  If this works it provides a model that allows projects like ours to create commons while rewarding all participants and steering clear of the strings that often come with funding.",False

You'll be able to tap on any verse of a scripture and see how its perceived by your group or any other group, or even talk to people from any group.  You can also access the broader space of resources for your community and others from any perspective, with the information provided dynamically and reliably, with the ability to dig into as much or as little depth as possible.  As an example of what this can achieve, we believe in a few years you will be able to learn about Islam from the perspective of Catholicism or vice versa (as the system will know roughly what you know already).  You'll also be able to use the system to create knowledge maps of how political policies differ, from objective to subjective assumptions.  It really messes with extremists as it allows for their incoherent world views to be deconstructed, derailing radicalisation (already radicalised individuals are very hard to deradicalise). You will literally be able to say here is what 1.8 billion Muslims believe, graphically, and here are the extremists out there on their own because they fundamentally disagree on x, y, z and so are apart.  Google can't do that, it just shows you links based on how many people backlink to pages, which is fine for what it is (note we have received grants from Google and will likely be working increasingly closely with them as well as other leading tech companies).",False

We have:  - More international press than all but the largest token sales, all of it positive - Funders/donors including Google, Microsoft, IBM, US hedge fund manager Mark Hart & renowned philanthropist & leading life strategist Tony Robbins - A multidisciplinary, easily verifiable team with relevant expertise from Oxford, Stanford, Imperial and UCL amongst others - Fantastic partners on every part of the platform to support the team - A token economic model where rising token costs actually increase the use of the platform and factors like velocity have been factored in - Industry leading team vesting where we don't get coins (unless we buy them!) until the price goes from $0.02 to $0.10, with full unlocking at $0.50, aligning us too (!) - A strong ethics focus with the first ethics section in a whitepaper - Leading governance as a UK-registered charity - Achievable targets in terms of rolling out a platform in the next year that can immediately help a lot of people and long-term help literally billions  I'm not sure why we haven't sold out yet given a (relatively) modest $1.5 million total raise in the public sale.  Quite a few of those behind the $3.8 million pledged in the whitelist period were annoyed over the smart contracts, but nobody's ether was at risk and e think we have a great solution in place now and are issuing tokens to be used shortly for their intended purposes once distribution complete.  We have a stack of new partnerships, major press & announcements in the coming weeks, so its probably just a case of this project hitting a tipping point and then shooting off.  If we don't sell out by December 4th we will likely freeze unsold coins and just get to executing the platform as thankfully we have multiple other funding sources.

I hope you'll be able to answer mine.  I see in your whitepaper that one of the main aims of Ananas is to be authoritative similar to how the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy is regarded as very authoritative.That is great for countering ISIS-style narratives because there are loads of authoritative scholars and organisations that aren't regarded as fringe but as the mainstream, established scholarly consensus on sunni islam who regularly condemn ISIS and explain why Islam should not be interpreted the way ISIS do. So that is great.  But from the other direction of countering islamophobic points of view and interpretations, how are you going to do that when mainstream , sunni, orthodox Islam as characterised by the scholarly consensus of  Hanafi, shafi, maliki and hanbali schools of jurisprudence contains large numbers of rulings and judgements based on the quran and hadith which are antithetical to western , liberal values?  For example on the frequent charge of Islam being sexist, can you deny that the consensus of mainstream, authoritative sunni scholars is that a man can get married to whom he wants with or without his family's permission but a woman is only able to get married with her male guardian's permission? That totally goes against equal rights for men and women. Only the Hanafi school of fiqh has some disagreement on this issue. Or take the fact that all 4 schools of surviving, mainstream sunni jurisprudence agree that the penalty for converting away from islam or becoming an atheist is imprisonment then death. Note that these rulings by these schools don't say ""if you leave islam and become an enemy and traitor working to wage war against muslims"" (which is what apologists frequently claim). The jurisprudence,  which hundreds of years of scholars have studied the quran and sunnah and decided upon, is simply whether they convert or declare that they're atheist; if they do that then the penalty is death.  So here is your problem in a nut shell: if you want to be authoritative then you go with the mainstream sunni scholarly consensus; if you go with the mainstream sunni scholarly consensus then you end up with jurisprudence which is regressive, appalling and antithetical to enlightened, liberal, western values like gender equality , freedom of religion, freedom of speech and separation of church and state.  You can't be both islamically authoritative and in agreement with the values of liberal, western society without watering down Islam and adopting fringe, non-mainstream, non-authoritative, liberal positions.  I mean  since you make parallels to the stanford  encyclopedia of philosophy, what would happen if Al Azhar university were to make the Al Azhar encyclopedia of islam? What would most of the scholars there say about legal marriage rights for men and women? About what the punishment for converting away from Islam is?  If you want to accomplish both being islamically authoritative and not in opposition to fundamental, core, western values then surely it's just going to be an exercise in cognitive dissonance and dishonesty. Infact, I imagine you would have trouble answering this question honestly without putting your mission statement or funding at risk.  Is there anything I have gotten wrong here? Even if you create a nuanced interpretation where you say something along the lines of ""but lets leave virtually all legal discretion to Siyasa, much grey area""  that still isn't going to be what the mainstream of orthodox sunni scholars endorse.",False

In taking from the SEP we wanted to focus on editorialised crowdsourcing, so the Foundation or sub-communities could commission pieces etc rather than it being a free for all, here is an article describing some of the elements: https://qz.com/480741/this-free-online-encyclopedia-has-achieved-what-wikipedia-can-only-dream-of/  However, what we are trying to achieve with Ananas has some subtle differences that are not captured in the current white paper, but will be in the updated version ahead of the main sale as we needed to stress test certain elements, just as we have only now finalised the Anacoin token economics: https://medium.com/ananas-blog/tokenomics-building-a-token-economy-for-peace-af62ef2f3f32 .  The white paper also simplified some things (it is possible for the Pope not to be Catholic (!) although we used it there as a tautology).  It is important to determine what this project wants to do.  If you read our thoughts, we are aiming to move as many people as possible off ""Mount Stupid"" and give individuals the tools they need to navigate their own ideologies and those of others.  The goal is not to say ""This is the only version of Islam"" or this is the ""correct"" interpretation for Islam or any other ideology, but to encapsulate the plurality of belief structures.  Note there is nothing here about being in agreement with the values of liberal, western society (although as Fukuyama predicted illiberal democracy is on the rise).  This is not for the Foundation to call, but to respect the diversity of thought and the correct data/incentive structure to allow them to organise themselves and their data.  Thus there are three structures being built in the Ananas project:  1. The decentralized unstructured/lightly structured space.  Here you need to jump through some hoops and potentially use Anacoins to access (tbd) but is where any Anacoin holder can commission pieces to be written and reward collation of pieces on any area. So a Hanafi could have a piece here on the usage of analogy within their jurisprudence specifically for example. An Islamophobe could commission a piece on ""Taqiya"".. This data is interlinked in effective ontologies: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)  2. The community  This is where individuals interested in this project come together in multiple levels  a. Researchers/scholars/lay people helping with 1. b. Community helpers who want to help in various ways, including helping c. Individuals from these groups and outside who have genuine questions they want answered in a structured way have a human to help them. For those within a tradition, eg Muslims, it can be connecting them to other Muslims  Apologetics (where groups attack each other) get their own arena to combat  3. Structured ""consumer"" data  This one of our ""one neat tricks"". Groups from each community (for example Hanafi, Reconstruction Jewish, Tea Party Conservative) can come together to build data sets from the lightly structured data to reflect the beliefs of their own community.  So, for example, the ""traditional"" Sunni schools of thought would have their own data set with stronger linkages, that is then presented through consumer applications like the Living Quran (which as you might be able to guess is the first building block to a larger data set consisting of scripture, interpretation, private actions and community actions).  The Quran is a nice place to start and where you need to start before moving up to those additional layers, but doing so in a structured way with a common data format can yield some very interesting results..  Thus a member of the Hanafi school in the subcontinent (presumably Maturidi in theology) could choose to access the Quran from their perspective, looking through that data set in a consumer friendly way, but choose to dig into more depth on their ideology either through the community or unstructured data set, or access ideologies of others (you can do some interesting stuff if you know peoples contexts)  The broadness of multiple data sets (encouraged by financial incentives and/or a technological arms race) in a common format are what lend authoritativeness, as opposed to saying this is the way things must be, which will never work.  In classical Sunni Islam (which I would be happy to discuss in more detail, perhaps off this forum, it has some extra nuances), the key concepts for watering down hate (imo) and moving people off mount stupid are ikhtilaf (reasonable disagreement), shubha (reasonable doubt) and a bit more rigour on ijma (consensus - for example, does Imam Abu Hanifa's take on alcohol not from grapes or dates impact Hanafi consensus?).  This model of authority reflects the epistemology of our modern age - when we want an answer, we go to Google or Wikipedia, which respectively rank on backlinks and ""objectivity"".  This project focuses on ""objective subjectivity"", allowing each group and community to define their own ontologies.  Thus for IS for example, as the tool builds it will be a big blow to them even at the Quran step, but then it would be sensible to gradually build full fatwa construction/deconstruction tools for scholars and researchers with respect to primary text probability and contextual analysis, blockchained ijazas and all sorts of other fun things.. This is especially important as fatwa are fundamentally time situational constructs within the Sunni construction, but are taken as something else due to lack of contextual analysis ability.  Siyasa (secular Islamic law (really)) has changed through the years, particularly after Ibn Taymiyyah reconceptualised it as Siyasa Shariah, but it is not relevant here as (we think) for our mission it is sufficient to provide the tools for individuals and communities to make it difficult for extremist elements to claim supremacy and these tools will steadily grow if we crack the equation in utility.. A true reflection of the actual application of hadd would be a nice side effect of this project, as would a better appreciation of the nuances of siyasa, I'm quite partial to Asifa Quraishi-Landes work on Islamic constitutionalism for an example of where Muslim countries currently misapplying ""Islamic"" laws could do better, but that is for them to decide.  Thus the 'Al Azhar Encyclopedia' could well use our infrastructure and indeed if everyone else is doing so, would be putting their ontologies in a common format (remember Islam is just first, this is a flexible system).  Designing the system in this way also means anyone can contribute to the platform value so funding sources are not restricted and ultimately the primary control is not on the part of the platform 1, but the Foundation controlling 2. and 3. in terms of the formation of individuals from each community to best represent them.  If there is a split in the community, the data set can be easily split too, something not possible before. For the consumer part we will not approve any community where you need to pay for enlightenment or has active encouragement of violence against others based on their beliefs as part of their ontology.  We are trying to be as honest and transparent as possible and if you think there is merit in what we are doing (hard road!), please do join us on slack or information@ananas.org.uk",False

My impressions of what you meant by authoritative, what similarities you envision with the SEP and what your goal was were incorrect.  If your goal is to get people off mount stupid, then am I right in thinking that your product does not aim to counter  non-stupid islamophobia or non-stupid islamic beliefs approaching extremism?  On your twitter you've said something like ""we should not make an opponent out of conservative islam"" , but I don't see why we as western non-muslims shouldn't see  mainstream, conservative Islam which is representative of normal practice and preaching of islam in muslim majority countries around the world (http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/) as a threat to core western liberal values and way of life.  Unless these people assimilate and lose the Islamic values and beliefs they possess which are in opposition to liberal values then as they start forming larger %s in european countries they will want those european countries to accommodate their core values and norms more and more. When muslims form say 30% or 40% or 50% of a european country there is a significant risk that they will form and vote for a muslim-brotherhood like party that will try to change that european country's legal system and norms to become closer to that of a muslim majority country like egypt or jordan or pakistan or afghanistan. There isn't good reason to believe that with the current course being set by european countries this possibility does not have a significant chance of occurring. We might within our lifetime see a northern european county make gay marriage or even homosexuality illegal again as a result of rapid muslim mass immigration and fast breeding, how would you and your team feel about that?   The goal is not to say ""This is the only version of Islam"" or this is the ""correct"" interpretation for Islam or any other ideology, but to encapsulate the plurality of belief structures.  Note there is nothing here about being in agreement with the values of liberal, western society (although as Fukuyama predicted illiberal democracy is on the rise).  This is not for the Foundation to call, but to respect the diversity of thought and the correct data/incentive structure to allow them to organise themselves and their data. Are your non-muslim team members aware of and happy with this? I could imagine your non-muslim chairman or cto having misgivings about creating a space that will go towards reaffirming for instance that blasphemers and muslims who become atheists or followers of another religion should be imprisoned or put to death  , especially at a time in the world where this is regularly carried out both by official legal systems in islamic countries and by zealous muslims extra-judicially.  Also, since IslamQA.com already gives a range of mainstream scholarly intepretations (with reference to quran and hadith) when answering a question, such that their answers on say gambling or divorce cover most of the mainstream sphere of sunni belief systems , are you not worried that they already have captured the niche of ordinary muslims wanting answers to questions, and it will only be muslims interested in the fringe opinions and groups that IslamQA does not represent that will be more interested in your platform?",False

The beauty of western liberal democracy is that it allows for a range of expression and beliefs unless they specifically contravene the nation's laws or actively seek to impose their beliefs on others by force (which typically contravenes laws, but not always). The team agrees on this.  This is my position as a believer in multiculturalism (others are free to disagree if they prefer homogeneity).  This also means that any individual is free to criticise other ideologies : this is not what I count as Islamophobia (although erudition and actually bothering to do the research is good in this regard). Indeed, I criticise myself certain aspects such as modern (mis)application of hadd punishments. What I count as Islamophobia is hate towards Muslims on account of their faith, manifesting in harassment, violence and a curbing of their civil liberties.  If a populace wishes to elect an Erdogan or a Morsi, they are free to do so under a fair democratic system, just as they are free to elect a Duda, Duterte or Trump.  Given each of these individuals have indications of distinct illiberalism and this is where a country's institutions must come in to preserve civil liberties and stop the oppression of minorities (the majority of course having voted for another course..).  The spreading menace example you have outlined is true of all illberal political elements (indeed, one key mutation has been the interaction of reconstructionist Islam with western philosophy, eg Ayatollah Khomenei and Plato..), but the history of Islamic application and breadth of positioning and resonable doubt (shubahat) formation belies that Sunni Islam at its core is necessarily what it has been painted to be.  For example, things have been getting worse and worse for the LGBT community in Poland, a rather anti-Muslim country, with even Nobel Prize winer Lech Wałęsa saying LGBT members of parliament should be segregated and pride marches banned etc. Similarly you can see the Russian gay propaganda laws, reinforcement of Section 377 in India and elements in many other countries.  A focus on increasing ""Muslimness"" is particularly curious given the categorisations individuals who are Sunni apply to themselves and there have been no studies I have ever seen that increase religiousity (measured any way you like) leads to increased political action, violence, or breaking the law.  There have been studies showing strong disapproval of homosexuality amongst Muslim populations (although curiously its decreasing sharply in US Muslims), but this is not abnormal amongst conservative religions. Historically Islam's relationship with homosexuality (non public, but the old days were not good times for LGBT) was complex, Shahab Ahmed's What is Islam discusses this well, even if I don't agree with parts of his central thesis.  With regards to IslamQA.com, a very popular Muslim website, this is a prime example of why a resource like Ananas is needed.  What are the qualifications of Shaykh Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid? What schools does he have ijaza (authority/accreditation) to deliver fatwa in? Who does he represent?  IslamQA is based on one strand of Islam which is practiced by under 2% of global Muslims, the Salafi minhaj, which objectively rejects the classical four school (madhab, Hanafi, Shafi, Maliki, Hanbali) structure.  Salafi Islam is, oddly enough, Sunni Islam's reform movement, but at the puritan stage. It can not therefore reflect the opinions and methodology of the majority of Sunni Muslim jurists by definition as a it is theoretically a deconstructionist version of Islam, but in reality has a set series of popular positions based on a new epistemology.  But the average Muslim or non-Muslim would not know that.  I should also note that the positions articulated on IslamQA do not reflect the positions of the main Salafi nation, Saudi Arabia, where the Council of Senior Scholars have been the only individuals to be authorised to deliver fatwa according to the Saudi Salafi methodology since 2010.  Thus the positions of IslamQA do not necessarily that of Saudi Arabia. In particular Saudi salafism is fully quietist, ie apolitical (it is not a theocracy), even with movements like the sahwa.  Ananas helps solve a lot of issues here as individuals can contact community members or get resources from their local methodology of thought, starting with the Quran, versus necessarily just having to go to IslamQA where they get a mishmash of not always coherent or comprehensive analysis (note there are several instances of multiple usul mixage there, even though it is ostensibly Hanbali/Salafi in minhaj).  The way that we have constructed the platform, it will be significantly more rigorous as it grows than IslamQA (although again initial focus is just Quran), which if you are correct is a small group of individuals outside of the traditional system that have somehow become the go to place for a billion Muslims who have been bought up in that traditional system.  That should be worrying.  It should also be noted that even according to mainstream Sunni thought, you can say that the ""agreed upon"" positions are reflected by cross school primers like Ibn Rushd's Bidayat al Mujtahid or Ibn Qudama's Mughni, but all scholars are in agreement that fatwa are issue specific, temporal constructs, which is why you have multiple hiearchies of jurists and guidelines to issuance.  This is also why, until the last hundred years, you have seen the separation of siyasa and Shariah, with exceptionally high evidenciary standards to hadd (those severe) punishments: the legislative bench is simply too narrow to define a nations laws, except perhaps in the Maliki and Hanafi schools given some of the key methodologies there. Hanbali and Shafi jurisprudence certainly aren't suited to this.  Again, this resource will go a long way to clarifying some of these issues with regards to coherent application of things like blasphemy, as I discussed above, as well as hopefully combating extra-judicial elements.  The history of Islam isn't spotless, but there is a reason there were Yazidis in Iraq for thousands of years until ISIS came along, in contrast to the religion wars and homogeneity of Europe (cuius regio, eius religio etc).  So the questions are:  Will the Ananas platform be additive or subtractive to its stated mission?  Will it be of net benefit to the world or a net negative?  Given there are clearly negative elements of both Islam and other ideologies, religious, political and otherwise, causing increasing ideological divides and hate, does this have any chance at helping to bridge this gap for even a few?  I have not seen anything in your contestations against these premises (which I do not believe to be strawmen).  Thus far I have seen:  1. A belief mainstream Islam is reflected by IslamQA 2. Mainstream Islam is immutably illberal, sexist etc 3. A belief an increasing Islamic population will turn Europe illiberal and theocratic and shift its norms, particularly due to faster breeding an immigration  It would appear that Ananas can help with all of these and as other ideologies come online help better integrate Muslims with others as they can, for example, view Judaism from the perspective of Islam as opposed to learning about it through conspiracy theories.  A contention could be that Ananas would promote Islam, but the structure is such that as communities from other ideologies form and are approved they have access to teh exact same resources, which ultimately lays all the information and contexts standardised in data terms and bare..",False

Thus we only get coins when participants in the presale have seen their coin value go up by a factor of 2,000% and only get all our coins once they have  seen a 10,000% increase.

The governor had to step down in May after being convicted of blasphemy with a potential two year jail sentence (lots of politics around that.. was even more than the prosecutor asked for..).  As noted in the whitepaper and our website, our first focus at Ananas is the Quran, before branching out into other scriptures and non-religious ideologies as we get a critical mass of researchers and members of the appropriate communities.  As the platform grows, any individual so inclined would be able to dig into as much depth as they wanted on the nuances of Quran 5:51 and the interpretative traditions around it, including whether certain interpretations were acceptable within the analytical framework of, for example, the Yemeni-Shafi branch of Sunni Islam which is prevalent in Indonesia, at least up to the point of reasonable doubt.  With a centralised, ""objective subjective"" point of reference like this, politicisation of reilgion can occur extremely easily as it has here, where the interpretative tradition has sufficient flexibility to confirm that Ahok did not blaspheme.  Given the traditionally localised structure of Islam in Indonesia and emergence of hypertextualism that has hidden inside it, we wouldn't be surprised to see more cases like this and the emergence of a very literalist, non-contextual set of politics gaining ground.  So if any Indonesians (or those from any country!) would like to help in any way, please do email us at information@ananas.org.uk or join our slack.  For the record, I personally think that blasphemy laws are counter-productive and should be scrapped and hope this ruling is overturned on appeal (even the prosecutor appealed (!)).",False

This data is then collated into structured data sets by approved members of individual communities aided by some Smart programming/AI on the standardised data sets.  For example the ithna ashari (Twelver) Shia, ie those in Iran and large parts of Iraq, would have their ontology, the Greek Orthodox Church would have theirs. These ontologies are then available in the the customised consumer app, the first of which is the Quran.  The Foundation will have to form ties with each community to get stamps of approval on those curated data sets, but isn't there to make judgement calls, unless the ideology calls to violence against others or charges for enlightenment.  Part of the inspiration for this was the Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy: https://qz.com/480741/this-free-online-encyclopedia-has-achieved-what-wikipedia-can-only-dream-of/ and the work of Claude Shannon  2. Community is everything and we underemphasised that we want active and engaged members from each ideology on the platform to be organised not only to create and collate resources (digital and real life), but to answer questions in a safe area both from members of their own ideology wanting to learn more and those from outside with genuine questions. For the trolls and those looking to engage in apologetics we have some plans to allow them their own arena.  For Islam in particular the resources for 1.6 billion are pretty poor, there is nothing like www.logos.com or even near it meaning that while there is huge engagement with the Quran (93% of Muslims iirc) there is minimal understanding, or even knowledge of where to go for understanding..  Same for non-Muslims, where reliably can they go for a smooth, well-thought-out, trustworthy set of information?  That's what makes this so interesting.  Fingers crossed.",False

The homophobia was a bit concerning however.  I do not understand the stance that we are trying to be too ambitious.  Creating a contextual Quran as a first step is very manageable with the right support.  The information is all out there but just needs to be organised.  Blockchain is a means to organise individuals in unique was as Naval Ravikant outlined in his market economy tweetstorm referenced in our white paper.  We also note that we won't stop extreme explicitly up top, but we do think we can help by creating a resource like this, which would quickly be superior to the alternatives out there.  If this can stop one hate crime or individual being radicalised it will have been worth it for us, we think it can do so much more.  We believe that makes this worthy of support and is why we are working on this project and hope others will join us.  We will be having a public  competition shortly for better ideas as we would love to hear them.",False

The usage of the coins within the platform are for commissioning content, sponsoring parts and rewarding contributions.  As we note in the white paper information is everywhere, but contextual information, i.e. Knowledge, is harder to find.  The aim of Ananas is to map the worlds ideologies and resources related to these and make them easy to access and navigate, a knowledge graph for ideology if you will.  This does not exist today and is something that we believe would be useful to individuals within their own ideologies (the main users) and to those outside those ideologies looking in (a bonus)  To give an example of platform utility, how would you go about determining if ISIS was Islamic as a non-Muslim?  Googling won't get you too far as the primary organisation on the knowledge graph is backlinking. Wikipedia has its own notion of objectivity.  If you could have a platform where significant structural work had been done or where you know you could ask someone from that community it would be much easier.  For a Muslim this would make understanding their religion a lot easier and help them avoid mount stupid.  As more ideologies are mapped by their respective communities Anacoins will become more in demand and the value of the platform will increase even faster as then you can do cross ideological mapping.",False

This dataset is needed as the backing to create the resource needed and is the hard organisational problem that we believe wouldn't have been possible without blockchain. Even then people tend to only want to do their own ideology whereas we want to try and model as many as possible to really understand what makes great, positive ideologies and ones that mutate into hideous ideologies that commit literal holocausts.

Quote And why did you choose that name?  Ananas is the same in most languages of the world, representing our aim to help increase contextual communication amongst those of differing backgrounds.  We have the trademark and multiple domain names and thought it a nice brand to build on (although there are some issues with the name in Turkey and France due to the actions of certain individuals).  Plus the team likes pineapples    Quote Where are the team and supply information of the coin?  The team information is on the website, but we have updated the original post to give direct details & LinkedIn profiles.  We have also updated the supply information of the coin and as mentioned will be providing more details soon.  New coins are only minted if the foundation receives over $100,000 in fiat for this project, with tokens equivalent to 50% of that amount being minted monthly for the foundation and being locked for 2 years.  As noted before, full tokenomics and our thinking behind it to come shortly.  Quote Will the project continue if ICO fails?  Yes, we have several alternate funding streams and models and the team has been working on this project for three years, really trying to understand how ideologies are formed, where they turn positive and where they turn evil and how to try to aid the former and halt the latter.  The current funding for the project to date should shortly exceed £400,000 and we are in touch with several major funders. We are adamant about not giving up any editorial control in exchange for funding of any type.  We believe that given strong institutional and press relationships, a verifiable and experienced multifaith team, minimal technical risk and a worthy cause we should comfortably exceed our soft-cap target for the main token sale.  The pre-sale has been a good learning experience in advance of this, highlighting several areas where we need to bring on more resource and improve.  We will be sharing our learnings from this in the coming weeks.",False
