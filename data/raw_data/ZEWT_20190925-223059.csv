We are extremely proud to announce May 14th, 2018, as the official date of our ICO.  We have been touched by the tremendous community support we have received from our +1,000 investors in pre-sale, Telegram group and across our social media channels.  We are building an active global community and want you to participate in the continued growth of Zeew and follow us on our journey towards disruption of $215 Billion on-demand delivery industry.   ICO Details  The community has spoken and we have listened: ZEEW Hard Cap set at $11,000,000 USD  We have allowed contributions starting from 25th April, 2018, with discount conditions. We listened to the community and now we are enhancing the participate terms with 45% bonus instead. All contributions which were done between 25th April — 2nd of May will be credited with the bonus offer of 45%. for example if you purchased 100 tokens you will get 145 ZEEW tokens.  Thanks to its innovative technology, Zeew can be scaled globally. Following this logic, we want to encourage as wide a distribution of people as possible to participate in our ICO on May 14th.  Therefore, there will be no minimum investment for smart contract contributions. ZEEW tokens can be reserved at a starting rate of $1 USD (one dollar) +40% Bonus tokens for the first two weeks of the crowd sale.  All rounds can be viewed on our website https://ico.zeew.eu",False

Korean Whitpaper, Translated by wipeout0   _______________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________ ____________________________   Introduction  We believe that everyone should get his packages delivered ""Right Now"" why wait 1-2 business days when you order something online?  You may call us ""Uber for packages"" we allow SME's to send any package in minutes,  Zeew is a platform that is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, connects any store or Internet shop with the nearest available courier that can carry their package to their client immediately.  Meet the ""Uber"" for all last-mile deliveries.     ZEEW is based on the MVP – commercially available on-demand delivery platform – ZEEW (zeew.eu), which is already operating in 1 country in Europe for the past 3 month and have 58 businesses using us on daily bases.  Zeew’s currently serves flower shops, pharmacies, cosmetic shops, printing houses and more – now we plan is to go beyond that and include food delivery as well and to innovate to go global, to deliver anything, anytime, anywhere.  Zeew will transform the way goods move around cities by enabling anyone to have anything delivered on-demand. Our revolutionary HyperLocal Logistics platform on blockchain connects customers with local couriers who can deliver anything from any store or restaurant in minutes.   Since we started Zeew, we have been continuously transforming the way businesses ship stuff. Combining latest innovations in Artificial Intelligence driven chat-bot technology, deliveries by drone and robots with current Zeew’s infrastructure, operations, Zeew ventures to re-invent the shipping & ordering experience on blockchain, while improving upon business inefficiencies caused by human.  “Using our own research, big data and proprietary expertise, Zeew is developing tools that will change the way we choose, order and deliver goods. Modern lifestyles demand a much more tightly integrated service - nowadays almost anything can be ordered through apps and messengers lightning-fast, but the delivery industry has been too slow in adapting to these changes. This is where Zeew steps in with vision to disrubt the last-mile industry  The Future Marketplace for on-demand delivery 90% of business companies don’t have expertise in IT, e-commerce, AI, chatbots, apps, logistics and marketing. This is where Zeew, comes in with all-in-one solution for businesses to join its platform.     Zeew is convinced that blockchain technology combined with smart contracts will be the core engine for the long-term delivery industry.  The creation of the ZEEW tokens is the first step in building a system of incentives and rewards to drive network effects in Zeew platform.   Zeew is convinced that blockchain technology combined with smart contracts will be the core engine for the long-term delivery industry.  The creation of the ZEEW tokens is the first step in building a system of incentives and rewards to drive network effects in Zeew platform.   We believe that once payments are tokenized, the processes to drive token movement can be modelled using smart contracts.  Unique blockchain features on platform  (1) Identity of users, businesses and couriers. (2) Payments. All the “cycle of payments” from customer to Zeew to business and to courier. (3) Logistics platform connecting clients with couriers and businesses. Ubermodel, connecting thousands of freelance couriers to Zeew platform. Also the algorithms and calculations for the quickest delivery. (4) Reviews and ratings by clients of businesses. (5) Reviews and ratings by clients of couriers. (6) Program equivalent to “Amazon prime”. (7) Know Your Customer. (8. Tracking of the order.    PRE-ICO Timeline  PRE-ICO START: 23th February 2018 Limited to 1,000,000 ZEEW @50% discount.
