Along with the lottery launch, the project team will release a decentralised application that will sustain the non-profit operation of the lottery and all the functions provided by the smart contract.  📈Ticket tokens (TKT) can be purchased at the current exchange rate on a cryptocurrency exchange or using the exchanger integrated in the DApp. In order to automatically participate in the next draw, the user sends a Ticket token to the system via the decentralised application, entering a combination of numbers according to the lottery rules. Once inside the system, the token is added to the prize pool. The prize pool is stored in the lottery smart contract, and no one can access. The only way to obtain tokens from the smart contract is to participate in a draw and win a prize.  Draws are held on a weekly basis. The time of the draw depends on the number of Ethereum blocks completed since the last draw. Therefore, the time may vary slightly when the block completion frequency varies in the Ethereum network. Information about winning tickets is always updated in the decentralised lottery application. Users can also personalize their notification settings by email or other means.  🎲The game rules are similar to the world’s most popular lottery – Powerball, except that the odds of winning the jackpot are much higher due to the reduced number of possible combinations.

The Lottery never widely disclosed the technical glitch that gave players zero chance of winning. In response to The Oregonian/OregonLive's questions and public records request, the agency confirmed the defect lasted nearly six hours -- from about 3 a.m. July 23 to 8:45 a.m. – causing 172 winning Keno tickets to get false readings from scanners.
