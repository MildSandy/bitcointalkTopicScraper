Let me clarify that for you.  1) Why certain member's linkedin are unavailable? https://www.linkedin.com/in/krisnamjames1980/ https://www.linkedin.com/in/priscillawongyy/  ANSWER: Sorry, maybe we have mistakenly setting as private. But you have to be a linkedin members to be able to see our profiles. I'll check with Linkedin, because we are signing in perfectly?. ( Im Priscilla here by the way. hehe) Check back again in a while, should work! it has been identified with https://www.bestcoins.co/ico/chubex please check it there?  2)How do you guys consider secure for your exchanges? OK, i'm going to try to explain to you a more in-depth and detailed  security features that we implement to ensure the maximum security. We are developing our exchange based on an end to end encryption ecosystem by implementing smart contracts  + 0X protocol. If you understand how smart contract that are powered by the Ethereum blockchain works; all transactions are ""ESCROWED"", smart contract will calls to functions and execute which is safe guarded;  But unfortunately, the smart contract itself is on-chain which means all transactions will need gas fees for each trades; making trading at big volume is not so realistic, where gas price will go up significantly; so we are using 0X protocol to maximize the technology, offering off-chain ordering relay to make all trades more efficiently by cutting down the gas price; and network congestion.                                                                Therefore this it is like a wallet to wallet exchange on steroid, to ensure all transaction fast, efficient and secured.  3) How do you guys plan to compete with exchanges like Binance? In my opinion, there are a lots of great exchanges out there, but we do believe exchanges should be decentralised and transparence; This might be a very sensitive issues as we see, centralised exchanges are all in CONTROLLED in favor to the exchanges themselves. Traders are usually the one that pays for the costs. Let me make it more clear, Centralised platform is making money from collecting transaction fees; which means, they are mostly in favor to the ""WHALES"", they are in controlled of the market. Look at the stock exchange market system today...Isn't this is the reason why Blockchain Technology is born? Because we want DECENTRALISED and TRANSPARENCE? We are looking to create a fair trade market. An exchange platform for the users; as we are proudly claiming; we are an OPEN digital assets exchange platform; we want to be LOW COST, almost ""FREE"" transactions for all digital assets trade. We believe many users are sick and tired of paying high fees for all transaction; which at the end of the day, the winners are the TOKEN DEVELOPER and EXCHANGES. This is not what we want!  4) How can you ensure that you will be listed on exchanges like Binance, Bittrex? Then, if you are operating a DEX, why would you want your token to be listed on other exchanges? This is a real world. We are from finance background, and we understand the markets, we understand the people. Most traders are not going to change their habits, and trade in your exchange immediately as many people are still very unfamiliar with new technology. People are afraid of change, especially in ASIA country, which explains why, even after so many incidents of centralised exchanges gets hacked; people are still trading on centralised network. And one of the downside of the current decentralised platforms are too complicated, they are hard to operate. Many users still do not understand!  We are going to list our CBX tokens into other exchanges ( eg. Binance, Bittrexx, Okcoin, etc ) because we believe there are different kinda investor crowds in cryptocurrency world; CENTRALISED VS DECENTRALISED, and we want them all. We want traders to understand that we are open and we hoping them to see the differences. It is never easy to shift a person from one to another. This has been our past experience in banking system.  As we've explain before, there are many different investors who has different believe, even the ""THE TWO BIG DIGITAL ASSETS"" ( BTC [Decentralised] VS. XRP [Centralised] ) are building for different crowds in the market. We surely want all our investors to just trade all our CBX tokens in our platform, but we understands that this is not possible. Besides that, we wishes that all our investors are staying confident with us; which sadly in this world, its how much the value you can offer to them. Shifting and educating users about a new technology takes time; and time is money. Investors today do not wait for you to be success! So, make them success, and their success would succeed your vision.   Hope that clears up your enquiries.  Chubex Team",False
