DATA ANALYSIS PLATFORM.üåê,"Our PAX Cryptocurrency is Launching this Year   Many of you who have been following us have seen the progress we already made with our B2B strategy. In this blog post, we want to highlight to our supporters and community members the progress we made regarding our PAX launch and what you can expect for the foreseeable future.    The Path to our Vision ‚Äî The MADANA Platform  What many of you might still not know is that we are not only developing a sidechain or smart contracts. Here at MADANA, we are pioneering privacy-preserving data analyses. The core products that we are currently developing for enterprises will be connected and introduced to the masses with the help of blockchain technology to ensure transparency, openness, and fairness for all participants.   Release of MADANA products  Moreover, this approach will connect and open up the data-silos from various industries, while ensuring monetization and privacy for the true owners of the data and purpose-specific use of it for data consumers. With this in mind, the medium to make all the background transactions and validations is our cryptocurrency PAX. To scale and achieve our vision, we will grow through a longterm plan which encompasses our products starting with MADANA Enterprise and ending with MADANA Platform.  Therefore, the main launch of our MADANA platform will require a long period of development, testing & adjustment before it can be introduced to the public in the future. We didn‚Äôt want to keep our supporters waiting until this platform goes live, so we decided to introduce the PAX cryptocurrency in Q4 2019 as an ERC-20 standard token.   MADANA goes broader  The conversations with many of our customers from the B2B sector show one constant conclusion. The demand for our technology is simply too big to ignore! It is evident that we must act now and broaden the area of applications for our blockchain agnostic technology. We are excited to upgrade to this approach for several reasons. The ERC-20 token standard has been extensively tested and proven in the blockchain industry, and Ethereum has one of the largest user bases in the industry. The widespread wallet and exchange compatibility lowers the entry barrier and has the potential to trickle down users into both ecosystems. Not only will it warrant us and our supporters an earlier market entry but also empower us to stay flexible enough within our ongoing agile company development and meet the popular demand. In November 2018, Lisk released their new roadmap, introducing the action plan towards a production SDK. In this roadmap, the possibility to create a custom token on the Lisk main blockchain was set to be after the beta SDK in the future. This required agile adjustments on our side, and we quickly began to examine reasonable solutions to ensure the completion of our ambitions in terms of the PAX launch for 2019.   While we have an unchanged commitment to developing certain building blocks of the MADANA platform with the yet to come Lisk production SDK, we can certainly release the PAX cryptocurrency before that. Several possibilities exist to connect both ecosystems (e.g. a Lisk-Ethereum Bridge) and we will choose the best path that will suit the state of the MADANA platform development in the future.   Next Steps  In preparation for the PAX launch in Q4 of this year, we are going to collect Ethereum disbursement addresses from the contributors of the previous rounds of the Token Sale. We will contact everyone via email and announce on all social media channels clear instructions on how to progress from thereon. Further, we will give you a reasonable timeframe to send us your Ethereum address to receive the claimed PAX from the Token Sale.  A blog post dedicated to relaying the specific dates and instructions for this will be released soon. Subsequently, a blog post detailing our Main Sale will also be released.

DATA ANALYSIS PLATFORM.üåê,"The year 2018 is slowly coming to an end. We at MADANA are looking back with joy at a year full of hard work, new partners and change in the company as well as in the world of data privacy.  To conclude with 2018 we want to sum up all the major events of this year and have an outlook on the year 2019.  Setting Sails Many might not know that MADANA‚Äôs roots lye in the beautiful city of Aachen. Here our founders set up the groundwork for the company that it is today. Out of the academical environment of the local elite university RWTH Aachen, and together with Max Kordek, we have established a successful Bitcoin Meetup and even Lisk itself has originated from here.  With further growth at the beginning of the year, we finally could initiate the next step on our journey to the epicenter of our industry, moving to Berlin. Here, right before the Lisk Relaunch event, we announced Max Kordeks investment in our cause (followed by a second round investment in October) together with our partnership with Lisk to bring the world a blockchain driven data analysis market to protect and secure peoples data privacy.  Partnerships MADANA is not only beneficial for everyday people, moreover, all sorts of businesses also have a high interest in discrete data analysis with a focus on data privacy. The use cases span from fields like health care and energy over to IoT and online advertisement.  Therefore we have set up our strategy in a way that we could conquer the B2B market first, delivering businesses a tool to analyze data from foreign sources while proving privacy and purpose-specific analysis integrity. The possibilities in times of data leaks and scandals are unimaginable, especially with the enforcement of the GDPR on May 25th.    This spring we could finally celebrate our partnership with Capgemini for this cause, with whom we now have a strong and experienced partner to make ourselves a name in various competitive industries. To further strengthen our position here, we are already in talks with another, even bigger and internationally respected, consulting company. With them, we are following a particularly interesting use case, that we can‚Äôt wait to reveal in 2019.  Throughout the year we could also win a variety of partners in the academic and political sector, as well as welcoming highly experienced and renowned Advisors, like German Ramirez, who love and share our vision. They help with their experience and network on every step of MADANA‚Äôs journey.  Token Sale After a successful patent filing of our technology in spring, we could finally present our community the complete vision of MADANA in the form of our White Paper, our Tokenomics Paper, and a One-Pager to get an overview. This marked the starting point for our PAX Token Pre-Sale, which started with the whitelisting in August and ended on October 31st. Setting up such a business in Germany is not easy by any means, therefore we are proud to be one of the first BaFin checked German businesses to conduct a Token Sale here.  To celebrate this kick-off event we organized a party with over 100 attendants at our office.   PAX party invitation poster  The total amount of funding MADANA has raised so far is accounted to ‚Ç¨ 1.42 Million Euro. This money will ensure our growth and product development in 2019, yet it is still only the beginning as our Main Sale is still on the horizon.  International  Consensus New York 2018: https://youtu.be/2C3dnTzb-MU ‚ÄúMADANA is not only for Europe, but also the World‚Äù our CEO Christian Junger once said. The vision is a global one, and in this means we have traveled the world this year to make new business contacts and learn from different cultures. MADANA has made a debut in New York at this year's Consensus conference, found partners in China and Hong Kong and had an extensive Roadshow throughout Moscow, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.     At this point, we would like to make a big shout out to our Ambassadors in the USA, Poland, Netherlands, Russia, and China. With your support, we grow our community in your countries and establish the vision of a global decentralized pool of information that our founders had.   Outlook on 2019 The ground for a successful 2019 has been laid by our community and us in 2018. Therefore we can say that, despite a difficult market situation, this year was a good one for MADANA. We have been following our roadmap and reached one milestone after another. This, of course, will continue in 2019!  We are looking forward to collaborating further with our current, and yet to be announced, partners on B2B use cases and pilot-projects to demonstrate the power of MADANA to the industry. Because we are already in talks and have concrete use cases with a renowned company from the automotive industry, an international shopping mall provider and a well-known telecommunication provider, we are certain that 2019 will be the year of massive progress for us and our partners in the regards of our technology integration. The community can expect the release of the PAX token, and much more, that we have been preparing for you.  As our new year's resolutions, we have set ourselves to grow, share knowledge and be open for change in an accelerating world of technology.   Our Team with MADANA Ambassador Alexey Usanov (Russia)  We wish every single one of you a happy and successful new year!

DATA ANALYSIS PLATFORM.üåê,"What going mobile means for MADANA ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a computer?‚Äù asked a kid as she lay on her grassy garden with her iPad Pro. You probably know this advert, because it ticked off a lot of internet-dwellers. However, let‚Äôs overlook this take on a fantasy Apple world where desktop computers are outdated technology, and look at the facts. Mobile web usage has already overtaken desktop usage and most humans in technologically-developed countries are likely to be carrying a smartphone in their pocket. This means that if these devices had a mind of their own, they would probably know more about us than we do.  Mobile devices bleed data Mobile devices provide a completely alternative and personal view into the consumer. They might not have a mind of their own, but they collect data much like our brains do: constantly. Moreover, this data not only includes what a consumer does, but also where that action happened and sometimes even who they were with. Mobile devices can therefore be seen as the glue between the digital and physical world.    However, this overflow of data poses serious issues. Many companies are quick to jump at the opportunity to understand their consumers better. Yet are slow at establishing a secure and privacy-preserving way to store consumers‚Äô data. This has led to many data scandals in the past decade and prompted regulatory solutions such as the GDPR.  Preparing for the future Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if individuals could make their data as accessible as it is today, being able to monetize it while avoid leaks? Much of the data that we bleed as consumers can be incredibly useful for the technological advancement of many industries. The issue up until now is how to convert data into insights securely and anonymously. Therefore, our aim is to securely bridge this gap between data and insights. To create a tunnel where valuable data from mainframes or consumer devices can go through one end, and clean priceless information is delivered out of the other end. No leaks, no compromise and full transparency.  As the journey at MADANA started, we needed to raise the funds necessary to assemble a team to make this technology a reality. We therefore focused our efforts on collecting the capital necessary through crowdfunding. At the same time, we wanted to create software that could aid in the fundraising process, as well as serve as the base on which to build our finished polished products.  I would Rather go mobile The team got together to brainstorm a product that could fit this requirement. At first, we were very keen on bringing back control of the user‚Äôs Facebook data. The idea was to allow the user to collect the data that Facebook has about her, while giving an insight as to what this data can say about her. And then the Cambridge Analytica scandal happened. This meant that Facebook shut down many of the more insightful API endpoints; so, the data we got back was practically useless.  Luckily, our Data Scientist DongGu came up with a solution. He developed a way to derive insights about a user by means of a Rather game. Like Tinder. It may not give the most shocking of insights as the Facebook data would have been; however, it serves the purpose of showing how much a series of binary choices can say about us.  Moreover, to meet with the needs of aiding in our crowdfunding, the MADANA mobile application is also connected with our Community Hub. Everywhere you go, you will be able to see your profile; including your Community Points and achievements. Nevertheless, once our crowdfunding is over, these features will be replaced with what will be our decentralized Consumer Data Producer application features. So, take advantage.  If you really want to know We wanted to create an application that can be used both on Android and iOS. Given the proven track record, we decided to go for React Native. Not having worked with this technology outside of hackathons and private-time projects, it was a great learning experience. There was plenty of React, and even some Native. Of course, the majority of the code was written in ES7 and JSX. Moreover, having been built with JavaScript, the world‚Äôs most popular programming language, means we can count on more contributors.    Let‚Äôs be transparent As open-source advocates, our code will soon be available on our Github account. This will allow our users to leave feedback and to contribute to our products. Likewise, whether you are on your desktop computer or on an iPad Pro laying on your grassy garden, you can see what we are up to.

DATA ANALYSIS PLATFORM.üåê,"The End of our Public Pre-Sale     With our PAX token public Pre-Sale having ended on October 31st 2018, we would like to conclude and summarize the whole process, mention some major accomplishments and give the community an outlook on what is next to come.  Public Pre-Sale and Seed Phase  On August 1st, 2018 we started our Whitelisting process, one month prior to the launch of the public Pre-Sale. We gave the general public the opportunity to participate in our Token Sale at a discounted price of 50% with an additional bonus of 10%, whenever one contributed with Lisk. Out of 100,000,000 PAX token, a total of 15,000,000 were allocated to this sale. The price per token is valued at 1 Euro = 1 PAX.  In parallel, we have had tickets still left for our Seed Investment round where larger investors could get personalized deals with us. For this, we allocated 10,000,000 PAX token to these investors. The price per token was differently negotiated with every investor based on the risk they took and the help they offered besides the investment. To not lower our negotiation position in these investment rounds, we decided to not publish the individual PAX token prices yet.  All in all, we offered 25,000,000 PAX token (25%) up until now to the general public as well as seed investors.  Growth and Accomplishments  From the beginning of the Whitelisting, up until the end of the public Pre-Sale, we grew our social media channels completely organically, which we are truly proud of, and generated a lot of interest in the Pre-Sale. Here are some statistics:  Telegram: 1120 Members (+150%) Twitter: 1809 Follower (+ 132%) LinkedIn: 366 Follower (+50%) We are proud to have received additional support and investment by Max Kordek, the Elite Center and Postera Capital. Furthermore, Max, the CEO of Lisk, invested an additional 120,000 Euro in MADANA.  Furthermore, we wanted to give a big shout out to our Ambassadors who support us rigorously in the USA, Russia, China and Poland!  Pre-Sale Conclusion  At this point, with the finishing of the public Pre-Sale, MADANA sold 9,153,332 PAX token from the combined Pre-Sale and Seed Phase allocation of 25,000,000 PAX token. This means that there are 15,846,668 PAX token left for both allocations combined.  The total amount of raised capital is equal to 1.420.040,00 Euro. We are in the process of setting up a reasonable liquidation strategy and therefore we will not sell currently raised cryptocurrencies in the foreseeable future.  Next Steps  We have closed the public Pre-Sale and are now transitioning into a non-public closed offering of the PAX token. In this phase, we remove all the bonuses we offered before and apply additional requirements to the participation process. Here is an overview of this stage:  One can still invest with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Lisk (LSK) at the reduced price of 50%, however at this stage there will be no additional bonus for any of the three currencies. Whitelisting is now only possible by invitation from a community member. (Read the Bounty and Referral blog post) This phase ends when all allocated Pre-Sale PAX token are sold or when we announce the closing of this phase. This will be done a reasonable amount of time in advance. This means that only people registered to the Community Hub can invite people to the Whitelisting process and Token offering. Everyone who invited a person that contributed will receive a commission of 10% which are based on the total amount of PAX purchased. This way we go a more community-driven approach to our Token distribution.  From here on out we will focus to prepare our Main Sale with all the experience and learning we made so far. In addition, we will focus on our product development and aim to finalize our Pilot Project to demonstrate the implications and capabilities of MADANA. This way we are certain to have a much bigger impact during our Main Sale phase with something tangible on our hands and will start making MADANA ready for our next step in our scaling strategy, the B2B sector.  Last Words  We would like to thank everyone who supported us so far and we are keen to make the next steps together with you. From our experience blockchain projects can only flourish and thrive with strong communities, especially in times of low attention of the general public, therefore we invite you all to join us in the Community Hub and our Social Media channels, as we try to make sure to reward our community for their support.

DATA ANALYSIS PLATFORM.üåê,"Dawn of a new Data Economy   As the digital transformation continues to disrupt industries, social constructs and individual life‚Äôs, data seems to be the resource we constantly need more and more of to improve and develop technologies that help us manage the very same transformation we create our self. Access to data is, however, often limited‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääpartly for legal reasons, partly because of the factual data sovereignty of state and private authorities. The amount of useful, high-quality data must be significantly increased without violating personal rights, the right to control one‚Äôs own data or other fundamental rights.  An open data market as proposed in a position paper by our partner BITMi for the data economy of tomorrow is key to create the infrastructure and data model standardization needed for a frictionless exchange of non-personal information data between industry, research, and the public sector. But also personal information holds value, especially when put into context, which is why it is so important to propose solutions to the challenges GDPR holds for the new data economy. This is where emerging technologies like blockchain and trusted execution environments will play a major role in the future. While Microsoft has started to see the importance of such technology and hence filed this patent, we at MADANA have had our patent already pending.  For Europe to not fall behind GAFA and BAT we need innovation that lifts our data economy to the levels of our competitors, without giving up our hard-earned rights and values we have been able to achieve so far. It is, therefore, a positive sign to see Berlin, the geographical heart of Europe, forming the biggest Blockchain Hub in the world. With innovation that comes from projects such as Lisk, Ocean Protocol and MADANA. Europe has a clear path towards a democratic and self-governing data economy through innovation that is definitely worth supporting. This way we will have a European answer to the challenges and obstacles of a fair and privacy ensuring data economy, in turn positioning Europe once again as the leading figure for the right thing to do.  Enabling Privacy-Centric Data-Driven Business Models  The time for privacy-centric data-driven business models which are GDPR compliant by design is now. In order to achieve that we are in need of new infrastructure technologies that, not only enable GDPR but also solve the Big Data problems of today, such as data model standardization and governance.  We at MADANA are working on such an approach for the next era of Data Economies, one where we enable future business models to act in a privacy-centric manner and offer new digital services, through the use of fair data sharing and processing which in turn result in new analysis results.  However, in the data analysis domain, most data will be collected automatically over time, wherein the data producer is the legal data subject. This enables us to have an easy and transparent process for managing individual consent for data analysis.  In a nutshell, MADANA is currently working on providing:  ‚Ä¢ A privacy-protecting and GDPR compliant way to store and analyze data    ‚Ä¢ Giving back control of ones data/digital identity  ‚Ä¢ Enabling privacy-centric data-baes business models  ‚Ä¢ An open platform enabling new ways to analyze data  ‚Ä¢ An intuitive way to give and revoke consent to use any data  ‚Ä¢ Fairness by clearly defined rules and transparent incentives  Our patent-pending technology which we describe in our White Paper, alongside a multitude of use cases for different industries (Page 38), one particularly interesting Industry that stands out is IoT, as we make reference to the report on workshop for security and privacy in IoT by the European Commission in 2017. This use case shows how MADANA is able to enable IoT businesses to process sensitive end-user data and comply with the baselines of IoT security and privacy discussed in this workshop.  Generally speaking, it is of utmost importance to support and subsidize infrastructure technologies to continue a healthy growth rate for the European digital businesses and to not lose the competitive edge in data-based business models. Moreover not falling behind foreign regions in important development that requires open access to data in the scientific, private and public sector.

The idea itself is just essential.  We usually do not think about all the data we spew around here and there. The big companies (the smaller one, too) are earning from us, giving us nothing in return except the illusion of ""free service"" and ""data safety"" which, as we know, are both not true statements. MADANA wants to bring us back the control over our data, called poetically ""the Digital You""  And I personally would like to have full control over the data I give away (or rather not give it away at all, as MADANA's solution guarantees anonymity of shared data). Brilliantly written Whitepaper and Token Economics - I encourage you to read it so that you can get as enthusiastic about the project as I am . Registration in Germany and confirmed acceptance by BaFin (something like German SEC from what I understand) allow me to sleep well, not worrying about the safety of my funds.  This is not just-another-ICO-project. This is the real deal and solution which may - and should - be used globally by both small and big players on the market.

DATA ANALYSIS PLATFORM.üåê,"From the Article by Max Kordek, CEO of Lisk:  https://medium.com/@MaxKordek/announcing-second-round-of-investment-in-madana-19c63202ab2    Announcing Second Round of Investment in MADANA  At the beginning of 2018, I have announced that MADANA is receiving the first investment of 200,000‚Ç¨ from The Pioneer‚Äôs Vault for committing to build a blockchain application on the future Lisk platform. On September 1st, they have successfully launched their pre-sale after completing a variety of business and technological milestones. Therefore, The Pioneer‚Äôs Vault is ready to announce its second investment of another 120,000‚Ç¨ in MADANA.    A summary about the project  MADANA stands for Market for Data Analysis and enables individuals to participate in their personal data market, while simultaneously preserving their privacy. Its ecosystem incorporates a token known as PAX. It can be used to buy data analysis results from MADANA‚Äôs decentralized information pool while at the same time rewarding data producers. Learn more about MADANA in my first blog post and on their official website.  Why the follow-up investment  Successful and legitimate blockchain applications will make the foundations of the future Lisk ecosystem. Without them, Lisk won‚Äôt have a reason to exist. During this crucial time of the network‚Äôs development, it‚Äôs important for the Foundation, community, and myself to support quality projects as much as we can. After partnering up with industry giants like Capgemini, research-heavy technical universities like RWTH Aachen or important associations like Stiftung Datenschutz (Data Privacy Foundation), MADANA has proved to represent this quality.  Aside from securing high quality partnerships, they can boast one of the first completely approved pre-sales in Germany, being patent pending and by publishing a 59 pages long technical white paper, while building up a team of 15 contributors in total. Their combined experience shows that they understand legal, business and technical factors that will ensure MADANA‚Äôs success.  All these achievements in such a short period of time convinced me to keep supporting this future sidechain project with a follow-up investment. That sums up the total investment by The Pioneer‚Äôs Vault to 320,000‚Ç¨.  It‚Äôs up to the Lisk Community  Promising and revolutionary blockchain applications will ensure Lisk‚Äôs success. Let‚Äôs all support a decentralized future built in our ecosystem by contributing to solid projects with unique visions. MADANA has shown us that they are the first to the game and ready to build something impactful on top of Lisk.  Best regards,  Max Kordek",False

DATA ANALYSIS PLATFORM.üåê,"   Hey! Thanks for the question. I was actually just going to post about this, so it came at a perfect time. MADANA hasn't had an ICO yet. That will come no earlier than January 1st, 2019. Right now we are just over halfway through the Public Pre-Sale. Up until this point, approximately 9 million tokens have been sold, including the seed round. There is plenty of activity in the MADANA Telegram channel, as well as interactions amongst the Lisk community. Largely, I speculate there has been a mass exodus out of crypto in the last few months due to market conditions, but as we all know, when the next hype cycle comes in, the interest will regain traction. MADANA is building a great product that I feel is important to anyone who uses a computer, or does any business with companies that use their information online. Privacy is valuable, and MADANA is the only project I know of to be able to process data in a decentralized way, all while maintaining complete privacy in a permissionless environment. The strong will survive. The MADANA team are crypto veterans with a solid business plan. Read the Tokenomics paper and you will understand what I'm talking about. This is not financial advice, but I really just feel strongly about this project, and that's why I pursued becoming an ambassador. If you have questions, concerns or anything else, feel free to drop them below and I'll do my best to get you an answer.",False

Source: https://www.ccn.com/madana-the-market-for-data-analysis-already-sold-8-3-million-lisk-based-pax-token/   MADANA, the Market for Data Analysis, Already Sold 8.3 Million Lisk Based Pax Token   MADANA.io is the first major project using the Lisk blockchain platform. This marks a milestone in the recent token sale history. Lisk is a non-profit organization, that aims to make the blockchain more accessible to users and programmers. MADANA is the first to take advantage of this and provides additional value to the Lisk ecosystem. Therefore, every Pre-Sale contribution in LSK gets a 10% bonus in PAX. They already sold 8.3 Million of their Lisk-based PAX Token. You can still participate in their public Pre-Sale on www.madana.io.  How can you benefit from MADANA? You can benefit by monetizing your data in MADANAs secure network. MADANAs patent-pending ecosystem enables privacy-preserving data analysis, which is a major breakthrough in data science. By sharing only analysis results you always stay in control of your data. Moreover, you get rewarded in PAX token for every single analysis that uses your data. This is great for individuals, but also enables new services and business models in a GDPR-compliant way.  On MADANA you can also monetize your skills: Data scientists, analysis experts, and programmers can contribute analysis algorithms to the MADANA platform. Due to MADANAs openness and its fair rewarding system, best-performing algorithms will make the most money. This incentivizes experts to find new ways to analyze data and to provide most valuable insights to the data analysis buyer. This is why data analysis buyers gain insights they never had before. There is a wide range of possible use-cases of the privacy-preserving MADANA platform. Imagine optimizing user interactions, making products more sustainable, and developing new treatments based on a global decentralized pool of information.  MADANA pioneers ICOs run under German law In the recent past, many ICOs were conducted in states with loose regulation and unsustainable tax rules. As a German Startup company, MADANA pioneers ICOs run under German law. This required legal authorities to check the project and token structure before being allowed. This takes a lot of time, effort and money, but provides additional trust to the MADANA project and shows its team dedication. MADANA has a diverse team of blockchain experts based in Berlin. They have great support from well-known partners, such as Capgemini, and influential advisors, such as Max Kordek the founder of Lisk.  For interested investors, MADANA released a detailed white paper earlier this year. It explains the technical foundation, the ecosystem structure, and future use-cases in detail. To clarify questions about the PAX token and its token economy, investors can take a look at their recently release Tokenomics paper.  MADANA started their public PAX Pre-Sale on September 1st The PAX token will be used as the platforms fuel for executing data analysis and rewarding all participants. They are giving away 55 percent of all PAX token to investors and the MADANA community. As the first Lisk token, the MADANA team decided to give every Pre-Sale contribution in LSK a 10% bonus in PAX. This is on top of the reduced Pre-Sale price of 0,50‚Ç¨ per PAX token. The Main Sale will be held in 2019 for a token price of 1,00‚Ç¨ per PAX. To enable more people to participate in the Pre-Sale, MADANA set the minimum amount to be purchased to an equivalent of only 100 Euro. Thus, MADANA can reach a higher level of decentralization than projects that allow only bigger investors to take part in the Pre-Sale.

DATA ANALYSIS PLATFORM.üåê,"MADANA featured on one of the largest German news sites! PRESS The following text was translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator from German into English.  Source: https://www.welt.de/print/die_welt/article181489796/ICO-Digitale-Finanzierung-mit-Risiko.html  ICO - Digital Financing with Risk A kind of virtual IPO experienced a worldwide hype in 2017, viewed critically by supervisory authorities. The young German market can be particularly interesting for high-tech founders.  Simon Toprak was tired of searching for a new used car in his scarce spare time and comparing offers and prices. His business idea came to him when it was similar for friends when buying a car. And so in July 2016, he founded the Frankfurt company Trusted Cars, an online shop for new and used cars with T√úV value appraisals that are delivered to the door. Toprak is planning a new project with his company: The application ""Trusted Cars Flex"" is to offer its users a flexible hybrid of rental and leasing vehicles.  The app customer will be able to drive a well-kept car, including maintenance, insurance and vehicle tax, for as long as he likes, and exchange it for other vehicles without having to sign long-term contracts for ""favourable weekly payments"". The market launch is planned for the first half of 2019. Managing Director Toprak: ""Many dealers want to participate.  The app is based on blockchain technology, which, for example, forms the backbone of the crypto currencies. The translated ""chain of blocks"" is a decentralized database distributed on many computers. For the new app, this means that the mileage, vehicle identification number and condition of the cars, among other things, are stored in the blockchain. The founder is currently collecting the money for the development of the app on the Internet: Investors receive a digital medium of exchange based on the crypto currency Ethereum. The company calls it ""FLEX"" and it will serve as a currency in the car rental app.  For his project, the founder uses an innovative, digital means of financing called Initial Coin Offering or ICO for short. The term is derived from that of the initial public offering (IPO). However, an ICO is neither legally nor technically comparable with a share issue.  The background is that at the ICO an issuer, often a young company, issues so-called tokens. These are digital means of payment or exchange based on a blockchain. The company sells its tokens against a legal currency such as the Euro or Dollar or against crypto currencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. The ICO of Trusted Cars Flex is to issue 500 million FLEX tokens with an initial price of seven cents each.  The Berlin startup Madana, founded in 2017, is also currently collecting money via ICO. The team wants to develop an open platform on a blockchain whose users can earn money with their data without losing control over it. Spokesman Julian Schiemann: ""Data producers such as companies and private individuals, data analysts and buyers of data analyses who want to use them for product optimisation, for example, are to meet on the platform"". The idea is to become a pilot project in 2019, and the ""PAX Token"" sold by ICO will be the currency on the platform.  Madana and Trusted Cars are not isolated cases. ""In the first half of 2018, 13 of the 200 startup financing deals concluded in Germany were ICOs. That's five percent of all financing from young companies,"" says Peter Lennartz, Partner at the consulting and audit firm EY. Worldwide, ICO issuers had raised about six billion dollars in 2017 and more than twelve billion dollars in the first half of 2018. Lennartz: ""But cyber attacks and money laundering have meant that some of this has been lost.  According to attorney Matthias von Oppen, the worldwide ICO hype of 2017 is over. ""Supervisory authorities are taking a close look at ICOs as many projects have not been as successful as announced. And investors have become more critical,"" says the partner at the Ashurst law firm in Frankfurt.  In fact, many supervisory authorities are alarmed. The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) has been warning consumers since November 2017 that these are highly speculative investments, and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has highlighted the risks of ICOs for investors and companies.  Ruben Bach, partner of the Frankfurt financing consultancy svs Capital Partners: ""Following the international hype, ICOs are banned in ten countries. In my opinion, only the bans in China and Vietnam are relevant, since the Asian market is very active."" Although ICOs are permitted in the USA, they are strictly regulated in some federal states, according to Bach.  According to its own statement, the BaFin deliberately did not ban ICOs because they could ""represent a legitimate form of corporate financing"", but only published a consumer warning. This raises the question of the extent to which the instrument can also benefit German founders. EY partner Lennartz assumes that, despite the current acceptance problems, an ICO can become a serious alternative to venture capital financing for young block-chain companies: ""It can be flexibly structured, investors can be found worldwide, they have no say and new investor groups are being approached.  According to Tobias Schulz, the High-Tech Gr√ºnderfonds (HTGF) in Bonn has so far only lost one deal because the start-up preferred an ICO. ""But this will certainly not remain an isolated case. There will be business models that no longer need venture capital, but will conduct an ICO directly via their online community,"" says the investment manager. This is especially true for well-networked start-ups or those that are already somewhat more advanced. Currently, three young companies from the HTGF portfolio are planning an ICO.  What should founders who are considering an ICO know? Ashurst partner von Oppen: ""The utility token that provides access to services dominates the market. In this segment, however, many business models have failed, and there have been many black sheep among the issuers. It is often most attractive for founders to issue so-called security tokens of a securities nature."" They could, for example, be structured like a block-chain share. There is still no Security Token ICO in Germany, as these are more strictly regulated than utility tokens - they are subject to the supervision of BaFin. But various companies are preparing themselves according to von Oppen.  For the mortgage consultant Bach from svs Capital Partners, the ""vast majority of tokens"" are basically securities: ""Most of the utility tokens issued so far, which provide access to a platform and are tradable, probably fulfil the character of a security. In the worst case scenario, supervision could then prohibit their trading at some point. ""He therefore recommends to companies planning an ICO the security-like, legally compliant variant of the Security Token ICO.  The sticking point for founders is the high costs. ""It's very difficult for a real start-up company to stem a legally compliant ICO,"" says Bach. He has calculated an example: Assuming that a start-up company with a prototype in a new technology that generates at most low revenues wants to collect 15 million euros from a private placement using a Security Token ICO. This requires relatively little online marketing. Nevertheless, the company would have to fork out just under 480,000 euros for the project.  355,000 of which would be fixed costs, including project management, international legal and tax advice, creation of the website and programming of the token. A further 125,000 euros plus variable payments of between five and eight percent were incurred for raising the money. Bach: ""At least 150,000 euros should be available before the start of the ICO. This makes the project self-financing. I recommend blockchain founders who are planning a professionally managed ICO to look for two to three business angels who will give them around 500,000 euros for ten percent of the company's shares.""  One day, ICOs in Germany could also reach investors to whom Bitcoin and Co. are previously unknown. After all, the Stuttgart Stock Exchange group is planning an ICO platform with transparent processes for issuers and investors from 2019. Dirk Sturz, Head of Primary Market at the Stuttgart Stock Exchange: ""Many established companies want to test this financing. In the long term, the ICO has the potential to replace the classic IPO.""",False

The destinations were Moscow, Singapore, Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh. In this blog post you will find a rehash of the events that transpired in each of the locations.  Moscow‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäCrypto BBQ & MADANA Meet Up    We would like to preface that our Moscow trip wouldn‚Äôt even have even been half as successful without the help of our Russian ambassador Alexey Usanov. He did an amazing job helping us organize as well as conduct our trip to beautiful Moscow.    On the 23rd of August we attended the Crypto BBQ. The location was absolutely stunning and right next to the water at the Berezy Park a little ways outside of downtown Moscow. A lot of crypto enthusiasts showed up from all over the world and MADANA received a lot of positive feedback.    Even though the last summer day of the year happened to fall on the same date as our meet up a lot of people showed up. All of the attendees were very interested in our project and Lisk and we had a productive networking session after Christian‚Äôs presentation.  Source: Medium",False

After an exhausting 14 hour flight we finally arrived in our first stop of our South East Asia roadshow‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe world‚Äôs epicenter for ICOs and other blockchain related projects‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSingapore!   Singapore Blockchain Summit x MADANA On the 28th of August we attended the Singapore Blockchain Summit where we made some very interesting connections with other blockchain projects and blockchain supporters from all over the globe.   MADANA at The Blockchain Hub office in Singapore The very next day we had a highly productive meeting with the guys from The Blockchain Hub at their office‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähuge thanks again to them for inviting and hosting us!   Singapore Meet Up After our meeting with The Blockchain Hub we instantly headed over to the very cool and hip venue for our meet up. We were able to auspiciously present our endeavours for MADANA to the Singaporean blockchain community‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich showed up in numbers and made our presentation a very interactive one due to all of the questions and interest they had in our project. Huge thanks to all of the attendees.  Bangkok‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäBlock Hedge Asia & MADANA meet up  Bangkok, Thailand Subsequent to four awesome days in Singapore we took flight to Bangkok, Thailand. We were very surprised at just how progressive Thailand is in regards to blockchain and cryptocurrency acceptance.   Block Hedge Asia x MADANA x Lisk On August 31st we attended the exclusive Block Hedge Asia event at the Hyatt Hotel. There we were able to exchange valuable information with industry leaders and experts‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänot only from the business side but also from the regulatory side.   Bangkok Meet Up On the following day we conducted our Bangkok Meet Up where we carried over the momentum from the Block Hedge and continued our discussions in a more private atmosphere where we welcomed valuable guests, such as DragonEx.  A funny little tidbit of side information, whilst trying to get to our meet up venue we were not able to find a taxi and the monsoon rain was in full effect. In order to not be late to our own event we only had one choice‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääpack all our banners, drinks etc into the famous Bangkokian Tuk Tuk, squeeze together and off we went   MADANA x Tuk Tuk Ho Chi Minh City‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäMADANA Meet Up  Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam Our last stop of the Roadshow was Ho Chi Minh City, better known as Saigon. Vietnam‚Äôs crypto and blockchain market is most definitely emerging in a very rapid way and we could most definitely feel it during our meetings as well as our meet up:   Ho Chi Minh City Meet Up Due to the already existing enthusiasm that persists within the Vietnamese blockchain community it was a mere joy for us to educate and talk all things MADANA and blockchain with them. It was definitely a great way to close out our Roadshow.  Take Aways Prior to departing for the roadshow we set ourselves clear goals. We are constantly working hard on making the MADANA brand globally known. This roadshow was a big step towards achieving this goal. We need to build up communities throughout the different countries and regions of the world‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähence we also started our ambassador program (find out more about it here: https://blog.madana.io/the-madana-ambassador-program-216b2f1c395f) This roadshow was a huge success in this regard, Alexey Usanov‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääour new ambassador for Russia, is the prime example for this. Also in Singapore, Bangkok and Saigon we met several potentially great fits to fill out our ambassador slots for these regions so stayed tuned to find out more about this and the ambassador program as a whole in the coming weeks.  Another goal was to raise awareness and educate the different communities about MADANA as well as data privacy and blockchain in general. Based on the feedback, passion and sheer enthusiasm from the attendees of our meet ups we can confidently say that we successfully achieved this goal  All in all our Summer Roadshow was vastly successful. We were able to set foot and show flag in the Russian and South East Asian markets. Furthermore we made several very important connections, both business wise but also community wise. We are now back at our headquarters in Berlin, Germany and will most definitely use the momentum we brought with us to make MADANA a globally known brand.

DATA ANALYSIS PLATFORM.üåê,"Disclaimer: These are my personal thoughts and not an official blog. I wrote an article about this which you can find here: https://medium.com/@FinTechWill/a-case-for-madana-9cda5c419a0e  If you liked the article, please clap and follow me on twitter!  A Case for MADANA  I‚Äôd like to start off by saying that this is not investment advice. This is purely my opinion as a cryptocurrency investor, enthusiast, and supporter. Having been in the space for quite some time now, I have had the great benefit of learning from some amazing people in this space, and found great value in looking for projects that have intelligent token models which have a clear plan for supply and demand. Let‚Äôs be honest, not every project needs a token in this space. We‚Äôve seen a large number of ‚Äúcash-grabs‚Äù lately with ICOs, and while it‚Äôs no secret I am a fan of the Lisk ecosystem, it‚Äôs not ‚Äújust loyalty‚Äù that has me excited about MADANA, the first major ICO on the Lisk Network.  A Utility Token? Before I even consider owning a utility token, I will often ask myself several questions. Starting with, what will this token be used for? Will I use this token for its intended purpose, and is there any value to holding this outside of the network use? In order to answer these questions, a keen understanding of the token economics is required. We often hear the acronym DYOR (do your own research), and as clich√© as it sounds, one must take the time to really dig in and understand exactly what is going on under the hood. If available, a tokenomics paper is a great place to start to be able to determine important factors, such as supply and demand.  Here is a link to the MADANA Tokenonmics Paper, which I will be referencing for this article.  ‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî  The Problem ‚ÄúMADANA is tackling the problems of modern digital society in the means of personal data control and privacy. More specifically, MADANA addresses the related discrepancy of fair revenue generation and distribution of the created data for the data originator (herein called data producer). In addition, the heavily monopolized data market lacks open platform alternatives that provide data analysis specialists (institutional or private, herein called plug-in provider) with a way to offer and monetize their knowledge to a broader pool of parties interested in data analysis insights (herein referred to as data analysis buyer). Generally speaking, there is no system that allows for insights into data without giving it away. And certainly, there is no solution for monetizing the data on micro transaction scale for the originator.‚Äù Page 2 MADANA Tokenomics Paper  Simply put: there is a problem with the way our data is procured and sold, and there is no current solution to pay the very people who create this valuable asset. Right now, we have a system where data is bought and sold with little regard to privacy. Additionally, there are no incentives in place to pay the data producers any of their share for the estimated 42 billion dollars in revenue they will create this year. (Source: Statista)  Why MADANA? On page 3 of the Tokenomics paper, the economy is outlined in great detail. One of the most beautiful things about blockchain and cryptocurrencies, is that most of them are decentralized, borderless, and permissionless. No longer does infrastructure that plagues so many traditional companies inhibit the ability for innovative ideas to flourish, thanks to blockchain. MADANA is creating an open marketplace where data producers (us), plug-in providers (data scientists), and data buyers (businesses) can come together and transact safely, efficiently, and directly with one another. Not only does MADANA enable regular people like you or I to monetize our valuable data, but because of their patented technology, our data can now be processed with no risk to our privacy. All of our private and sensitive information is destroyed inside the ‚Äútrusted execution environment‚Äù (TEE) after the data is processed.  I believe in open markets, as competition tends to drive down prices. Now, we see a new dynamic to the way data is bought and sold, only this time, the ‚Äúlittle guy‚Äù isn‚Äôt being left behind.  Why PAX? PAX is simply the payment vehicle in which the services will be bought and sold with. It is the only cryptocurrency this ecosystem is designed to run on, and will be the sole form of payment within the MADANA ecosystem.  ‚ÄúThe usage of PAX can be described pretty simply as mentioned above. PAX is the only cryptocurrency that executes the smart contracts on the MADANA platform. It is used as the main payment vehicle in the ecosystem as well as to vote on data models.‚Äù Page 5 MADANA Tokenomics Paper  What about demand though? I mentioned demand before, and I wanted to point out, that just because something is a ‚Äúcool‚Äù idea doesn‚Äôt make it a wise business model. It has to make sense. Why would I want to hold a utility token? Where‚Äôs the incentive? That‚Äôs the key, and in my opinion, is what sets the best apart from the rest. The MADANA team is comprised of veterans in this space who have thought things through and through, and its something I deeply respect about them. Experience goes a long way in this space as you come to learn what works, and what doesn‚Äôt.  Token Velocity MADANA has some very interesting techniques to incentivize holding their tokens. The first one is a concept called token velocity. On a simple, fundamental level, this just is a way to attract everyone that uses the ecosystem into holding their tokens longer in order to reduce sell pressure. As we know, when demands outweighs supply, generally the price is reflected and the market cap grows, thus creating positive exposure for the platform.  ‚ÄúToken velocity means nothing other than the frequency of transactions resulting in a sell pressure situation for the cryptocurrency. It is preferred to keep the velocity low to have the demand overweighting the supply on exchanges. Therefore the HT (Hold Time) of the ecosystem participants who are the primary PAX input forces to exchanges (data producer, plug-in provider, APE) must increase. In the following, we examine the HT incentives of these participants.‚Äù Page 8 MADANA Tokenomics Paper  In addition to having the tokens in their wallet longer, participants who have larger balances will be considered first. This is a great method for creating scarcity within the ecosystem, as it incentivizes large numbers of tokens to be locked up and out of circulation. Supply and demand.  ‚ÄúThose who have a higher balance will be prioritized, meaning that as long as the data producer accumulates PAX in his wallet, he will participate in more analysis requests and earn even more PAX‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin contrast to those who liquidate their PAX immediately after receiving it. This mechanism reduces the overall token velocity, as the data producer is incentivized to hold on his earning to improve his match probability.‚Äù Page 9 MADANA Tokenomics Paper  Utility working for you Utility has to make sense, and something I look for is if the actual utility of the token drives the economy to be used. Nodes and incentives are a great way to do so when they‚Äôre done intelligently. In order to even participate in the MADANA economy, you automatically benefit from having and using PAX tokens. For example:  PAX can be utilized as another deposit measure. Data producers are rewarded by an incentive system when they provide quality datasets. The incentive system allows the data producer to nearly double the revenue from a particular dataset as compared to a respective lower reputated dataset. The data producer would need to make a small deposit on every dataset he connects to the MADANA platform. You have to spend money to make money! Not only does this weed out some of the lower quality participants from spamming the ecosystem, but it also keeps tokens off the sell side of the order books. The more tokens out of circulation, the better. Well played.  It will also cost plug-in providers to create the plug-ins for the data processing. This is considered an investment, as these plugins have the potential to generate revenue, but is another demand factor in the ecosystem (see top of page 11).  Lock them up! This is probably my favorite way to create scarcity because not only does this create an ecosystem I want to be a part of, it also helps secure the network, creates a stream of revenue, and creates demand. NODES. MADANA‚Äôs potential plan is to allow nodes to give their processing power to the network in return for PAX. In order to even run a node, you have to lock up a large number of tokens. Additionally, this is where token velocity will come into play as well, because the nodes who‚Äôve held the largest number of coins, for the longest amount of time will be selected first. This will create competition, thus keeping large amounts of coins out of circulation. I personally will support this strategy, and if you agree, then join the MADANA Telegram and let the team know!  ‚ÄúAPEs could be regulated by letting them deposit a considerable amount of PAX and putting it at stake. If the APE fails to deliver the correct processing of the analysis, it would, as a result, lose its deposit to successful APEs. This way, more and more PAX get locked up as the network grows and the demand for analysis processing rises. To participate in more valuable analyses (which may require a larger deposit), the APE therefore is assumed to have a constant need in PAX to process more or more valuable work. This increases the HT in his earnings and thus reduces token velocity‚Äù Page 11 MADANA Tokenomics Paper  Final Thoughts In an effort to keep this blog as concise as I can, I‚Äôve tried to keep this as short as possible. I encourage you to read the paper for yourself and get a deeper understanding of why I feel this platform is a gem, and has immense potential to grow in use and market cap. There are numerous factors at play, and I have not listed them all here. The team has the expertise and experience to truly build something spectacular here. Don‚Äôt take my word for it. Do your homework!  Lisk is an epicenter of innovation, and MADANA is just one of the fantastic ideas to come from it. I believe supporting projects like MADANA will only benefit the entire ecosystem as a whole, so remember to spread the word!  Cheers! ‚Äî  William Ryan‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäMADANA USA Ambassador",False

Extract from page 51, Fututure Potential, of our white paper:  STANDARDIZED PRIVACY LAYER The technology underneath the MADANA ecosystem basically acts as a privacy layer, which MADANA plans to make available for developers in a framework. By implementing the privacy layer into applications, developers could then create privacy-secured applications. Therefore, MADANA is having a competitive edge by securing data privacy of the end-users along with an additional revenue stream through data monetization. Further, creating MADANA on the Lisk Blockchain bears the opportunity for future Lisk dApps to integrate the MADANA privacy layer into their systems.""",False

DATA ANALYSIS PLATFORM.üåê,"Here's a recent article where MADANA is mentioned as a part of the Lisk Sidechains! Special thanks to BTC-Echo!  This text is translated from German in English via www.DeepL.com/Translator  Projects on Lisk: What happened after the relaunch? A good six months ago, the team behind Lisk relaunched its platform. The most important message Lisk received was that they wanted to make it easier for blockchain developers to start sidechain projects on Lisk. A look at the largest and most important projects associated with Lisk.  Sapiens The Sapiens project aims to create a decentralized platform for certification and verification within an academic ecosystem. Blockchain developer Matteo Ferrari had already founded the platform in 2016 to enable people to control their data and certificates via a blockchain. The first area of application he has identified is schools, universities and other educational institutions whose administration is to be relieved and made more efficient.  ""People deserve to have full control over their certificates and records in a form that allows them to easily share them. In return, the blockchain can function as a secure and trust independent notarial system. With Sapiens, we want to help schools, universities and businesses offer their services through a decentralized, cost-effective and secure application.""  says Matteo Ferrari.  According to the team behind Sapiens, digitized academic references should make services and certificates more easily retrievable and verifiable. The Sapiens platform wants to provide the necessary tools with which everyone can deposit the most important building blocks of their career on the blockchain. Sapiens builds on the Lisk-Blockchain and uses the possibilities offered by the Sidechain Development Kit of the platform.  BrikBit The Blockchain platform BrikBit exists only since this year and has the goal to develop Blockchain applications for the real estate sector. To this end, a team of architects has been put together who would like to use their experience in the real estate sector to work on solutions to key problems. The approach of BrikBit includes a crypto currency REDA (Real Estate Digital Asset).  The central challenge of BrikBit is that there is no object that realistically reflects the value of a property. In contrast to other models of tokenization, BrikBit does not only want to create a pure crypto currency, but an asset that contains the information about the property in digital form. For example, construction and renovation measures are to be mapped on the blockchain. Like the Sapiens project, BrikBit builds a sidechain on the Lisk-Blockchain.  ""REDA collects a range of information about the properties, which is jointly managed by a community. Thus, the system creates an infrastructure for the exchange and maintenance of this information through protocols that are accepted by all members. We are taking the first steps to develop international standards to be able to react to the developments in the real estate market.""  says BrikBit CTO Alex Dell'Orto.  Adamant The Adamant project is in the process of building an open source messenger on the blockchain. With this, the company wants to address a number of problems that arise with the various existing messenger services. The biggest problem identified by the team is security gaps, which are exemplary for centralized peer-to-peer messengers. The privacy of the users who communicate via the messenger also leaves something to be desired with the classic short message services.  Adamant is against this with a blockchain application. The platform advertises itself as the only private messenger that runs entirely on the blockchain. The project, whose developers come from Russia, exists since 2017. In contrast to the two previously mentioned, it is not a direct Lisk sidechain project, but rather builds on the code base of Lisk. In addition, the crypto currency LSK should be able to be used as a means of payment in the Adamant Messenger.  ""We believe in the power of Open Source. That's why we've looked at several open source projects to start our project. We first started with a proof-of-work system. However, since sending and receiving messages took too long, we quickly stopped doing so. Delegated Proof of Stake seemed to us to be a good alternative. Finally, we decided to base our system on Lisks Code-Base. The fact that Lisk uses NodeJS and PostgreSQL also influenced our decision.""  says Adamant-CTO Dimitriy Soloduhin.  GNY The blockchain project GNY started already in 2015 under the name Grey Jean Technologies. The aim of the project is to build a platform for machine learning and artificial intelligence. As a cross-blockchain project, GNY not only wants to set up its own blockchain, but also to insert its elements into various existing blockchains, thus adding new aspects to them. In addition to a Lisk sidechain, the project also builds on Ethereum and Asch.  GNY wants to find a blockchain solution for processing the huge amounts of digital data in order to make them commercially usable. GNY recognizes recurring patterns and learning components that adapt to the behavior of users. GNY wants to develop its own blockchain ecosystem on Lisk. With the GNY token, the holders will be granted access to the platform's learning tools.  MADANA The MADANA project is the first to carry out an ICO on Lisk. The aim of the platform is to create an ecosystem in which the users themselves own their own data and can trade it. The Berlin-based start-up is building on Lisk's sidechain technology. In addition, MADANA is already patent pending and attaches importance to the fact that it is equipped with a BaFin license and thus operates according to German law. The pre-sale of the MADANA-ICO started on September 1:  ""MADANA will use so-called Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) for data analysis. These are protected hardware components whose processing cannot be seen from the outside. With our patented process, we have discovered a new way in which data can be protected while still being useful. This enables us to build a unique platform for data analysis from which all participants can benefit.""  Christian Junger, CEO of MADANA, told BTC-ECHO.  You can find out more about MADANA as a German blockchain start-up in an interview with Christian Junger and Dieter Schule (MADANA-COO).

I encourage you to familiarize yourself with the white paper and tokenomics paper, as the team is really building something special here. We need to take back our digital YOU. Our privacy has been abused for too long. Join the movement to bring back the power into our hands and control our data. Blockchain has the power to set us free from the bondage we have been in for too long. I am excited about this. Thank you for your support!  Regards,  William Ryan US Madana Ambassador    https://blog.madana.io/german-blockchain-startup-madana-opens-the-pre-sale-of-their-pax-token-3b153217ab00   Berlin, Germany, August 31, 2018: MADANA, the Market for Data Analysis, is a blockchain platform from Germany which protects your privacy and makes your data work for you. Their patent-pending ecosystem enables privacy-preserving data analysis, which is a major breakthrough in data science. Their PAX token Pre-Sale will officially start on September 1st, 2018 12:00 UTC+2.  MADANA is the first major project using the Lisk Blockchain platform. This marks a milestone in the recent token sale history since most token sales were conducted on the Ethereum Blockchain. Lisk is a non-profit organization, that aims to make the blockchain accessible for everyone. MADANA is the first to take advantage of Lisk and increases the value of its ecosystem in the long term. Therefore, every Pre-Sale contribution in LSK gets a 10% bonus in PAX.  J.-Fabian Wenisch, MADANA Co-Founder and CTO, says: ‚ÄúWe are building an open platform to enable anybody to participate in our marketplace for data analysis. By sharing only analysis results and no raw data, data producers always stay in full control of their data. Further, smart contracts create trust between the participants and ensure that an analysis can only be conducted, when every participant gets a fair share for their contribution. Meaning you can monetize your data without actually giving it away. This is great for individuals, but also enables new services and business models in a GDPR-compliant way.‚Äù  To enable more people to participate in the Pre-Sale, MADANA set the minimum amount to be purchased to an equivalent of only 100 Euro. Thus, MADANA can reach a higher level of decentralization than projects that allow only bigger investors to take part in the Pre-Sale.  The accepted currencies are BTC, ETH, and LSK. From a fixed maximum of 100 Million token in total, 55% of all PAX token will be distributed to investors and the MADANA community. 15 Million PAX will be sold during the Pre-Sale for 0,50‚Ç¨/PAX token. The main sale will take place in 2019 for a price of 1,00‚Ç¨/PAX token.  Christian Junger, MADANA Co-Founder and CEO, highlights: ‚ÄúWe worked hard to run our token sale completely under German law. This has major legal implications but provides additional trust to our investors. We want to build a long-term blockchain company in Germany, that brings privacy back to data producers. To make this happen, we have a dedicated team, work with well-known partners, such as Capgemini, and experienced advisors, such as Max Kordek the founder of Lisk.‚Äù  Visit https://www.madana.io for more information and to buy PAX token in MADANAs Pre-Sale.

DATA ANALYSIS PLATFORM.üåê,"Tokenomics Part 1: The Problem   PROBLEM  MADANA is tackling the problems of modern digital society in the means of personal data control and privacy. More specifically, MADANA addresses the related discrepancy of fair revenue generation and distribution of the created data for the data originator (herein called data producer). In addition, the heavily monopolized data market lacks open platform alternatives that provide data analysis specialists (institutional or private, herein called plug-in provider) with a way to offer and monetize their knowledge to a broader pool of parties interested in data analysis insights (herein referred to as data analysis buyer). Generally speaking, there is no system that allows for insights into data without giving it away. And certainly, there is no solution for monetizing the data on micro transaction scale for the originator.  Existing Alternatives  The alternative solutions to the problems mentioned above are rather restrictive or don‚Äôt grasp the root of the problem. In the means of data privacy and control we have:  ‚ñ∂ Promises of security and privacy from service providers  ‚ñ∂ Law enforcement (GDPR)  ‚ñ∂ Encryption schemes like VPN, PGP etc. (which makes data unusable for third parties) In the means of sovereign data monetization, we are either fobbed off with free service (Facebook, Google) or get occasionally a voucher once in a while.",False

DATA ANALYSIS PLATFORM.üåê,"Tokenomics: The Economy  THE ECONOMY  The MADANA economy has a distinctive core function: It combines analysis algorithms (plug-ins) from the plug-in provider with data provided by data producers. This data is processed to provide a requested insight (analysis result) for the data analysis buyer. In this economy, the data producer creates the data supply and the analysis buyer creates the demand. Thus it can be assumed that these two ecosystem participants create the data price by supply and demand. Further, it is assumed that the prices for the plug-ins are governed by the competition between the plug-in provider as it is a service they offer to the data analysis buyer. The blockchain nodes (MADANA Nodes) that process the transactions and smart contracts in our ecosystem are charging transaction fees. This helps to avoid spam transactions and acts as an incentive for the processing of blocks. In the future, it is considered that the APE offers processing power to process the analysis itself and that it gets paid for this service by the analysis buyer. Again, competitive pressure will create the price for that processing. Finally, MADANA provides the infrastructure (front-end, routing of data to the right destination) and takes a certain service fee.  All inner processes are either escrowed, executed or paid with PAX. Therefore, we can sum up the ecosystem parameters that may influence the PAX price as follows:  ‚ñ∂ Value of Data ‚ñ∂ Value of plug-in services ‚ñ∂ Value of processing power ‚ñ∂ Transaction fees ‚ñ∂ MADANA service fees  WHY BLOCKCHAIN  MADANA is using the blockchain mainly for trust and transparency reasons, as well as for distributing payments in real-time on a micropayment scale. Participants in the ecosystem are monitored, registered and paid through smart contracts executed on the blockchain. This creates the trust and transparency an open market like MADANA requires. Further governance needs that are planned for MADANA can be modeled on the blockchain, for example securing and voting in a global data model everyone agrees upon. It is considered that in the future the APE‚Äôs work can be regulated and incentivized through smart contracts on the blockchain. Also, plug-in providers could register the ownership of their plug-ins on the blockchain. Decentralized applications have the advantage of being particularly secure and reliable. Also, data manipulation by unauthorized persons can be overcome. To eliminate this single point of failure in the cloud, one of the first goals in the expansion stages will be to decentralize all modules of the MADANA Main System as fast as possible.",False

DATA ANALYSIS PLATFORM.üåê,"Tokenomics: Governance, Outside Economy, and Usage  GOVERNANCE  The governance aspect of the MADANA ecosystem is also subject to future development and can turn out in a different way as described in the following text. The intention is to design the ecosystem in such a way that the PAX token holder has the opportunity to vote and agree on a global data model to ensure consistency across the whole ecosystem. Thus, the PAX token holder determines how the data producer has to offer the data to participate. This is particularly interesting for data producers because they would then have a democratic way of deciding on the data model they want to have next in the ecosystem. This could mean for a data producer that his data is instantly available for the ecosystem. If the data model is a different one, he would need to go the extra step of converting it.  OUTSIDE ECONOMY   The outside economies that will influence the MADANA economy are the following: ‚ñ∂ Lisk sidechain ecosystem: With Lisk, MADANA has the unique opportunity to position itself as the privacy and data monetization integration of choice for other dApps that will develop on the Lisk blockchain platform. ‚ñ∂ Cryptocurrency Market: As the PAX cryptocurrency is tradeable like nearly every other cryptocurrency, it will be sold and bought on different exchanges and over the counter. ‚ñ∂ Data Market: The MADANA economy will be influenced by the growth, changes and innovation of the global data market as our core product deals with data.  TOKEN USAGE  The usage of PAX can be described pretty simply as mentioned above. PAX is the only cryptocurrency that executes the smart contracts on the MADANA platform. It is used as the main payment vehicle in the ecosystem as well as to vote on data models. In the future, however, there could be other utilities such as the regulation of APEs, the registration of plug-ins, and a vehicle for reputation systems.",False

DATA ANALYSIS PLATFORM.üåê,"SCALE AND GROWTH  The scaling strategy of MADANA can be portrayed in five steps: 1. MADANA‚Äôs strong advisory board connects and partners us with big consultancies. 2. Consultancies act as multiplicators. They bring the MADANA technology to their customers, which are in need of new data-services amongst their supply chain. 3. This leads to the next step: A pilot project in a B2B sector will be set up, showcasing the feasibility of the MADANA technology. 4. Highlighting the successful pilot project will open further doors into the B2B sector, enabling the potential to establish the MADANA technology as the B2B data insight solution. 5. Trickling down from the B2B sector into consumer products and services as data privacy and monetization layer is the next logical step. The main focus will be on everyday consumer goods, where MADANA could be implemented in the production process, e.g. telecommunication hardware & software; IoT hardware & software. Through this scaling approach, MADANA will have built up credentials and working data ecosystems in the B2B sector. In this realistic path, MADANA acts as a matchmaker between the ‚Äúold economy world‚Äù and the ‚Äúnew decentralized world‚Äù   ECONOMY HEALTH  An important metric for the health of the MADANA economy is the amount of PAX held in Exchange wallets. As the MADANA network grows and the system usage rises, so does the demand of PAX for utility inside the ecosystem. This will drain the supply of PAX on exchanges (acquisition from analysis buyer, deposit for APE and other as mentioned above). Therefore, there will be a transition from an initial discounted expected utility value (DEUV = value driven by investment speculation) of PAX to a current utility value (CUV = value driven by utility and usage today). A high CUV means that the value of PAX resembles the global data market share MADANA acquires more precisely.  In summary, this means the following: The more data producers, data analysis buyers, plug-in providers and APEs the ecosystem attracts, the more the PAX cryptocurrency embodies the growing intrinsic value of the MADANA platform. Because MADANA aims to take market share of the growing global data market, the future equilibrium market capitalization of PAX will equal approximately the percentage of the market share MADANA acquires.  TOKEN VELOCITY The described mechanics from above are arbitrary if the token has a high velocity in the means of short holding time in the wallets of the participants. Let‚Äôs visualize the problem in our case: Token velocity means nothing other than the frequency of transactions resulting in a sell pressure situation for the cryptocurrency. It is preferred to keep the velocity low to have the demand overweighting the supply on exchanges. Therefore the HT (Hold Time) of the ecosystem participants who are the primary PAX input forces to exchanges (data producer, plug-in provider, APE) must increase. In the following, we examine the HT incentives of these participants.",False

DATA ANALYSIS PLATFORM.üåê,"DATA PRODUCER  An edge-case exists in our system that will become more relevant as the network grows. Imagine an analysis buyer who requests an analysis by only one data producer or dataset. But the requirements the analysis buyer set match multiple data producers (or datasets) in the network. Which one will MADANA choose for the participation?  (See Tokenomics Paper for graph information here: http://www.madana.io/download/MADANA-Tokenomics-Paper.pdf)  REPUTATION SYSTEM FOR DATA QUALITY  PAX can be utilized as another deposit measure. Data producers are rewarded by an incentive system when they provide quality datasets. The incentive system allows the data producer to nearly double the revenue from a particular dataset as compared to a respective lower reputated dataset.  The data producer would need to make a small deposit on every dataset he connects to the MADANA platform. This gives him a Deposit Factor valuation for this dataset of ‚Äú1‚Äù. There is another factor valuation that is set to ‚Äú0‚Äù initially (Reputation Factor). These two factors added up (1+0 = 1) create a Value Factor for the dataset of 1 x (price of the dataset). When the dataset is used in an analysis process, plug-in providers now have an incentive to design and train their algorithms to check data quality before further proceeding with the analysis. After a dataset has passed through the algorithm, it receives a mark indicating that it has successfully participated in an analysis. During this process, the algorithm increases the Reputation Factor logarithmically to 0.5 and then 0.75 and so on, approach a factor of 1. If the dataset is being declined by an algorithm, its Deposit Factor falls logarithmically 0.5 and then 0.25 and so on approaching zero. Based on the Deposit Factor, the plug-in provider can claim the reward for separating datasets of low quality from datasets of good quality. Figure 4 - Reputation System based on accepted/declined analyses  (See graph on Tokenomics Paper here: http://www.madana.io/download/MADANA-Tokenomics-Paper.pdf)  In conclusion, datasets that are declined multiple times quickly lose their Value Factor, approaching 0, and making them worthless (0 x price of the dataset = 0). On the other side datasets that never get declined approach a doubled factor evaluation (2 x price of the dataset = double the price). The data producer is not forced to make a deposit, he rather has the chance to work his way up to a normal dataset factor evaluation. It is possible for him, starting from a value factor of 0 to approaching 1, without making a deposit within a few accepted analyses. This way, spam or low-quality data remains with a data factor evaluation of 0 to protect the data analysis buyer. The ecosystems growth will result in many datasets wanting to prove their quality, thus locking up more and more PAX as a deposit. This reduces the token velocity considerably.  PLUG-IN PROVIDER To secure proof of ownership, it is considered to implement a plug-in registration fee. This fee is paid by the plug-in provider to secure his intellectual property (the plug-in) on the MADANA platform. The MADANA Nodes receive the fee as a transaction fee. With increasing network growth more new plug-ins will be registered as a higher number of plug-ins means more earnings for the plug-in provider. The development and registration of new plug-ins are considered an investment for the plug-in provider, so he would rather reinvest in the registration of more plug-ins than liquidating his earnings. This also increases HT and thus reduces the token velocity.  APE Distributed Result Validation One future potential of MADANA is the implementation of a distributed network of APEs. By meeting specific requirements of software and hardware, volunteering entities can host the analysis process and get PAX token as a reward. An important question is how MADANA could ensure that the APE returns the correct and desired result which has been requested by the inquirer. The solution is to validate the signature of the code to be executed. This will ensure that only the desired code will be executed.  Moreover, it is conceivable to go one step further and execute the analysis process simultaneously on an odd number of previously validated nodes and then compare the respective results with each other afterward. The described process would rule out whether an analysis that is faulty for undetermined reasons would be sent back to the requesting entity. Corrupt APEs could be quickly detected in the network and be marked, which would have a positive effect on the quality of the analyses. The approach of distributed analysis processing would per se be vulnerable to adoption by a majority of corrupt APEs, but should be interceptable by the other security measures implemented in the system. APEs could be regulated by letting them deposit a considerable amount of PAX and putting it at stake. If the APE fails to deliver the correct processing of the analysis, it would, as a result, lose its deposit to successful APEs. This way, more and more PAX get locked up as the network grows and the demand for analysis processing rises. To participate in more valuable analyses (which may require a larger deposit), the APE therefore is assumed to have a constant need in PAX to process more or more valuable work. This increases the HT in his earnings and thus reduces token velocity",False

Anyone who contributes with Lisk (LSK) will receive a 10% bonus on the acquired PAX. These PAX will be provided by MADANA out of the Allocation ‚ÄúPartnerships & System Development‚Äù. Unsold Token PAX token that are not sold in the PAX Pre-Sale are used for the Main Sale. All token that are not sold in the Main Sale will be burned.  DISTRIBUTION OF PAX There is a total of 100,000,000 PAX token that will be created. After the Main Sale, the issuance of the PAX token will begin, and it is set to be not before January 1st, 2019. The initial distribution of the PAX token is the following: ‚ñ∂ Investor and Community: 55% ‚ñ∂ 10% Seed Investors ‚ñ∂ 15% Pre-Sale ‚ñ∂ 30% Main Sale ‚ñ∂ Partnerships & System Development: 15% ‚ñ∂ Long-Term Stabilization: 15% ‚ñ∂ Team and Advisors: 15%  Investors and community The allocation ‚ÄúInvestors and Community‚Äù is used for the total token issuance of PAX which includes private seed investors. These investors negotiated individual deals with MADANA and helped to bootstrap the company. This allocation also includes the Pre-Sale as well as the Main Sale for the community.  Partnerships and System Development The allocation ‚ÄúPartnerships and System Development‚Äú is retained by MADANA to grow the platform strategically. This PAX reserve will finance community campaigns, partnerships, incentive programs, and the Pre-Sale bonus allocation. Long-Term Stabilization This special reserve will be retained by MADANA to guarantee the long-term financing of MADANA. It will be locked for two years.  Team and Advisors The allocation ‚ÄúTeam and Advisors‚Äù is distributed among the team and current as well as future advisors. These token are vested for two years (24 months) and have a quarterly (3 months) release period with 12.5% of the token. The vesting starts with the distribution of the PAX token after the Main Sale.  ALLOCATIONS OF FUNDS   The PAX token Sale proceeds will be used for the following: ‚ñ∂ Development and Operations: 65% ‚ñ∂ Marketing and PR: 20% ‚ñ∂ Legal: 10% ‚ñ∂ Security Bounty Program: 5%  Development and Operations These funds will be used for the operational business of MADANA such as salaries, development expenditures, research, rent, and insurances.  Marketing and PR To expand the growth and image of MADANA in the future, this allocation will be used to develop a modern and appealing outward presence and communicate the importance of MADANA to the target market.  LEGAL To secure MADANA in every legal situation, these funds will be spent to ensure compliance in every relevant jurisdiction; especially Germany and the German Law.  Security Bounty Program This allocation is reserved to incentivize security specialists and hackers to communicate critical system errors and bugs directly with MADANA and help to resolve them before any damage can occur.  CONCLUSION The economy of MADANA revolves around the PAX cryptocurrency. The open platform design will attract participants from the growing global data market to create an ecosystem of privacy-preserving data analysis, processing, and monetization. The system holds key aspects to increase utility value as well as preserving value for the PAX cryptocurrency. Governance aspects of the platform, as well as incentives for the genuine behavior of the participants and ecosystem balance, are linked to PAX. The goal of the MADANA ecosystem is to acquire market share from the global data market and impose a more privacy-friendly data processing approach than the current industry standard.",False

DATA ANALYSIS PLATFORM.üåê,"   Hi, thank you for the interest. Our ecosystem is an open platform where the data producer (data source) can connect from various sources which we want to keep pretty generic. He in return gets rewarded everytime his data is used to generate insights for the data analysis buyer. In this process, the actual data is never revealed and the data producer remains the sole owner of the data and he can benefit from participating in various analyses over and over again. Please check out our FAQs to learn more. -> MADANA FAQs or read our white paper here -> http://www.madana.io/download/MADANA-Whitepaper.pdf",False
