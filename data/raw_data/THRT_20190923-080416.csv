And I am not moving it to a metamask wallet if I can't transfer it back to an exchange later,False

I think from an investors point of view this is good news if the unsold token ger burned as it increased the value of the token. Besides they have collected more than enough in my view to be able to execute their vision. Sometimes it is also better if project collect less money initially for psychological reasons. If you have too much budget available your risk to loose hunger and agility is much higher, you see that happenibg with many project that collect huge funds. When the ICO is over you sudfenly hear and see nothing anymore. A recent example is Quantstamp, after the ICO there was zero engagement with the community anymore and updates were also very scarce. As a result, one of the most anticipated and hyped projects in 2017 has now almost disappeared from the radar. More people are talking about Hacken than Quantstamp which seems unreal. Both projects started at the same time, while Hacken collected a fraction of the money, they have already customers in the meantime while Quantstamp hasn't even launched yet.",False
