See title: Bonpay Plastic/Virtual Bitcoin Card So far I'm concerned Bonpay never delivered any functioning debitcards  or only ones which worked for a short amount of time. Then people were putting some money into their online wallets, but it stopped working and they came up with more and more stalling strategies and excuses.  The lesson from that may of course be to keep ones money in different wallets on- and better offline. If you trust small exchanges more, after reading how it went for the Bonpay's customers, that's your problem.  Whatever, how to do handle these things exactly is not the topic here.

One of our advisors is Viktor Chkan, who is an expert on payment processing issues, and data security and has unique experience in financial projects, blockchain and cryptocurrency ventures. Also Velin Vlasev, specialist in launching e-financial services in Europe and USA, became our advisor to help us in providing best card issuing services for our clients.

The verification request is usually processed within 7-10 working days. However, in case we face with the high level of new users verification requests, the processing time might be increased. In case you experience a delay, that doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with your verification request. Just be patient and check your email box and notifications in your account regularly.  Card shipping time depends on the type of delivery - Standard or Expedited. To countries outside Europe Standard Delivery takes from 2 up to 8 weeks, while Expedited Delivery takes up to 7 days (in some cases it can take up to 10 days).  Thank you for the question!",False
