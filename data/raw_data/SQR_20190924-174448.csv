Squeezer uses world-class microservices platforms such as AWS Lambda, Google Functions and Azure Functions. The team at Squeezer wants to create a single unified blockchain connector that will allow developers to connect to any blockchain and use a sandbox to test the apps. The apps will be powered by microservices, the same infrastructure ebay, Amazon, and Netflix websites are built on.  The Squeezer platform will compile and deploy apps in multiple stages directly from GitHub or other code repositories.  Key Features of Squeezer include: Zero Administration: Deploy your code without any lengthy set-up beforehand or anything to manage afterward. Development Climate: Simulate the cloud provider environment on your local machine. No need to deploy code at every iteration. Speed up the entire development cycle by 10x. Pay Per Use: Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) computing and managed services charged based on usage rather than pre-provisioned capacity. You can utilize all your resources without paying a cent for idle time. Scalability: Let your service providers manage the scaling challenges. No need to set alerts or write scripts to scale up or down. Have absolute peace of mind during periods of high or low traffic.  Token SQR will be used for platform subscriptions and consultancy services. I was also told, “when the blockchain connector is finally working, the tokens will be needed.” At the end of the token sale, all unsold tokens will be burned. The distribution is as follows: 40% Token Sale 30% Squeezer platform 20% Team (locked and slowly distribution for  24 months)\ 5% Advisers 5% Marketing and partners   Team The team from Romania lists six members and four advisers. Nick Chisiu – The founder/CEO was a software consultant for ConsenSys for three months and was also senior software engineer at Modus Create Inc. Flavius Fulea: He claims to have been in blockchain since 2011 but the only work history listed is one-year as marketing manager at Hotel Romada Sibiu. Vlad Tarmure: Communications chief who worked for Safeway International as a marketing consultant from 2011-2013. Co-founded Cluj Crypto Community in Jan 2018. Odi Onyejekwe: International business developer who currently works for Food Panda. All his other jobs are management in Cluj County, Romania. the same place as Vlad Tarmure founded his crypto community. Looks like all these team members are connected to Cluj County.  Advisers include: Igor Karavaev- He has been an official adviser to more than ten  ICOs so far, including Faceter, Skyfchain, Trugame, Zero State and Arround. While not the hottest projects, it shows he has experience with small-cap ICOs. Ali Kassob: Advised Sentigraph and Whyral (social media marketing blockchain project). Mofassair Hossain: Advised Mobiuz, Hash Network, ShipIt (all blockchain projects). James Sowers: He also advised several low cap coins I’ve never heard of.  Verdict The idea of combining microservices and blockchain is hard to visualize because no one has done it yet. Netflix uses microservices, which shows the importance of the tech. Squeezer has several things going for it: there is no competition yet, apps will be built on the squeezer platform and the market cap will only be $15 million starting out. The problem is that it’s completely possible this project is simply using the buzzword “microservices” to sell people their token. They are greatly exaggerating the coolness of their not-yet built platform. Let me break it down real quick.  Risks Pictured above, you see that they are using four selling points for their token: (1) Working MVP; (2) Three years old; (3) Stable release; (4) 75,000 monthly downloads.  Growth Potential  According to the whitepaper, Squeezer is the only company with microservice framework currently integrating blockchain. +3 The founder was a software consultant for ConsenSys for three months. This means he is an impressive guy and should now be connected to some of the biggest players in blockchain. +2 A platform that you can build apps on in the future with a cap of only $15 million cap. +2.5 Received really good scores from ICO reviewers. They must see something. +2.5  Disposition It’s understandable when a token sale exaggerates certain things to try and make themselves look more worthy of funds. This sale went too far though, and unless their CEO Nick Chisiu is the Lebron James of crypto, this team is not capable. 4/10  https://hacked.com/ico-analysis-squeezer/  As for me SqueezerPublished is not so bad! He has a huge potential, if the project team will make the right decisions, then maybe the project will fly to the top! I hope they will manage to implement their plan!",False
