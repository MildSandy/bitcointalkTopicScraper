Alpha.EventChain.io    What is EventChain?  The EventChain Smart Ticketing platform was launched to create a peer-to-peer infrastructure where event tickets have no excessive processing fees and are widely available on a platform for everyone. There are so many problems with the current event-ticketing industry that can be fixed by EventChain’s SmartTicket platform. A lot of event goers are fed-up with monopolistic control with common problems including unfair ticketing fees, website crashes and single points of failure, ticketing scalping and ticket resale mark-up, and unfair cuts for artists who do most of the work with little return.   With EventChain you can create online or local events from any device, and make Smart Tickets available to event participants globally. The EventChain blockchain token network for event management presents the opportunity to upgrade the current event ticketing industry to faster transactions, indisputable ticket vouchers and transparency from event hosts and fully flexible and programmable Smart Tickets through the use of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.    Smart Ticket Use Cases:  Smart Tickets are all fully programmable, enabling smart contract code that can fix tickets at a permanent price, designate a maximum mark-up value, or attribute any other individual or group pricing variables.  To prevent massive ticket purchases from scalpers, event ticket distribution options can be tailored with any custom range on the amount of tickets available to single users or groups, and optional constraints that allow for alternative distribution methods.  EventChain will have an integrated ticket resale reputation system on a distributed secondary market, allowing event ticket vendors, promoters and fans to build and grow their reputation as they sell Smart Tickets. Scalpers will clearly be identified by their Smart Ticket reputation.  EventChain will utilize various payment gateways that accept EventCoins to purchase products and services from over 205,000 vendors across 182 different countries. Payment gateways convert the EventCoins in real time to the vendor’s currency.

A lot has happened this month in the cryptocurrency space including hacks and we have been inactive on BCT since then because we realized we need to step up to the plate and deliver something safely and securely. We've redesigned www.eventchain.io, expanded the foundation of our Board of Advisors and have rolled out the social bounty campaign. I will link to the bounty thread in our next post.  We also listened to the community had to say regarding The ICO distribution and decided the ICO  participants desired more of a say in eventchain so 65% of the total eventchain tokens are being offered to participants, up from the original 40%. We have also displayed our commitment to the eventchain project by locking all of the EventChain team's and advisor's EventCoin's for a 2 year vesting period with a 25% cliff each 6 months. Our team and Board of advisors is still expanding and will grow ongoing as more smart minds come together with the same idea, to bring real tickets to real fans. All of these updates are now available in the top ANN thread which has been updated and also on eventchain.io  Please join our slack to chat and join the community. It is a mandatory step to participate in the social bounty campaign as well. Here is an invite, looking forward to it.  Ashton.",False
