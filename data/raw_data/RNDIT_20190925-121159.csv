My name is Remik Chincza, co-founder and owner of a small company based in Ireland, Render It. We specialise in providing high-end computer hardware, mainly as graphics rendering solutions and as of recently, cryptocurrency mining solutions. Our goal is to minimise costs related to accessibility of high specification hardware and to provide cheap alternative to existing cloud services offered online.  We think that cryptocurrencies are gaining momentum and are on their way to become standard payment options, therefore we chose to create our own digital currency and incorporate it as a payment gateway for our services. We are currently in the initial coin offering stage and we are looking for people interested in purchasing or investing into our coin. Apart from advantages for farm customers, we have also developed a plan that will interest investors, as we are committed to making our cryptocurrency valuable and popular.  Following is a statement of what we intend to do with money that we are entrusted with by investors, the values represent our plan when the initial coin offering reaches the designated hard cap of â‚¬25,000,000. Our plans also include construction of wind turbines, a source of renewable energy that will make cryptocurrency mining feasible. We believe that the windy isles of Ireland are a perfect location for such constructions.  PLAN:  What can we offer to Investors who Help us Achieve hard cap?  All the money collected during ICO in 80% will be allocated for the purchase of mining equipment ( such as FPGA Cards, Antminers, etc. ) and turbines providing free energy.  90% of the income generated in the cryptocurrency mining farm will be used for payments to investors who have invested in our project during ICO and will keep RNDIT on our platform. Every user who will store their coins on our online wallet will receive a percentage from farm income (in BTC), evenly distributed between users. Investors income will be based on the number of coins held.  remaining 10% left for maintenance and equipment replacement (maintenance - payments to us and employees dealing with the farm) ( replacement - power supplies and running gear)  We dedicate income from high spec computer rental to equipment upgrade and replacement of equipment for better in order to maintain the growing difficulty of mining.  We will be able to keep payouts for investors at a high level for a long time.     20% of the money from ICO, we will allocate for equipment that will be rented to people who need such equipment for rendering or private mining. Prices will be lowest on the market due to the lack of energy costs and no costs for maintenance.  Here are links to our websites: Render It Farm Render It Coin  We are patiently looking forward to your response, we would really appreciate any feedback or advice you are willing to share.
