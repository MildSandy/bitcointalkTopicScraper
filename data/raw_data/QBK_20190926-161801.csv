QB is able to overcome the current flaws by leveraging on the characteristics of the Ethereum blockchain and the QBK. Together, they allow QB to provide a trustless ecosystem in which users on the QB Platform book their purchases from merchants and submit their reviews, and merchants interact directly with the users by way of customised promotions and loyalty programs.  QBKs are used for all transactions on the QB platform. Consumers use QBKs to pay for goods and services provided by any merchant on the QB Platform, while merchants use QBK for rewards and discounts. QB provides merchants with improved cross-selling opportunities and direct engagement with the consumers.  Problem and Challenges:  Polarisation Bias - Online reviews tend to over-represent extreme views, resulting in highly polarised views that are extreme positive or negative. Fake Reviews - Widespread fake reviews threaten the usefulness and credibility of online reviews as barometer of online reputation. Censorship - Potential conflict of interest inherent to the business model of review sites where there are incentives to sell advertising. Privacy Control - Reviews submitted by users reveal information about them, but the users have little control over these sensitive and private information.  The QashBack Solution  A consortium platform for different applications to share in the user pool, data pool and content pool in a trustless and autonomous environment through the introduction of world’s first decentralised reputation management system:  Master token for the clearing and settlement of cross-industry application transactions. Reward based reviews to incentivise consumers to share their experiences with merchants. Behaviour based promotions utilising artificial intelligence and algorithm to provide targeted offers to consumers. Permission based advertising with privacy rights controlled by consumers and rewards for opting in to the advertising network.  Our Value Proposition  Consumers Merchants ☑ Cheaper consumption via rebates and discounts offered on QashBack platform. ☑  Faster accumulation of online reviews to enhance online reputation for better commercial impact. ☑ Full control over personal  data privacy and contextual advertising. ☑ Access to customer data on platform for lower user acquisition costs. ☑ Rewards for viewing advertisements and participation  in other merchant promotions ☑ Faster development cycle and go-to- market, leading to lower financial risks.
