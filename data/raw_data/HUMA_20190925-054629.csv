Why?  Humancoin will refund 95% of its raised funds... let's calculate 6.600.000 mln * 5% equals 330,000 USD.. Interesting.. Humancoin only refunds contributors with a sum of investment (eth 20+) that could be legally enforced (at least theoretically). Surely nobody will sue the Humancoin CEO (Giles Gailer) for 200 usd. This is supposedly clever. But Giles Gailer, you are hopefully aware that this is criminal.  2) Giles Gailer changed his Telegram Account yesterday  During the ICO he contributed frequently in Humancoins Telegram Channel. Since yesterday his personal telegram account showed his picture (as shown on Humancoin webpage) and his (hopefully) real name ""Giles Gailer"". Now he changed it to ""Giles G"" and put a picture of Elvis Presley. Strange. This I would not expect from someone who claims to work with VCs (transparency is here no 1). Or is he now Elvis Presley? Has similarities with Craig Wright (the Satoshi cheater, also known as #Asstoshi the original creator of Buttcoin).  3) During the ICO i asked several questions in the Telegram Channel of Humancoin. Then a nice video of Giles Gailer appeared. Recorded on the beach side. I just wondered why a CEO sits on the beach during a working day... strange!. Now I understand.  Giles Gailer has cheated the Crypto community. He only refunds the investments that could legally be dangerous for him. Quite secretly, he bags 330,000 USD for himself. Yes, this project was indeed a SCAM. It's unbelievable these people disguise themselves as benevolent and ultimately expose themselves as cheaters. The worst part is that he stole the money from the little people (the average Joe). He certainly does not have the balls to take it from the big investors. I'm sure.  Humancoin was a scam created by an old man from the beginning. ",True

Thank you for all you have given to our charity start-up project!  💥Despite a relatively successful Token Sale we plan to stop the tokenised project and OFFER A REFUND! After that the project will be restructured and pursue venture capital opportunities. The tokens will NOT be released!  🌏We have been in close contact with our largest contributors and potential partners over the last few weeks to come to a measured and strategic decision on how to proceed. We’ve had to take into account the current bearish and volatile crypto market and possible drawbacks of Humancoin platform tokenization. And we have been strongly advised to stop the project’s tokenization and restructure it to better fit the current business and venture capital demands.  ✅The Tokensale refunds will be arranged as follows 1) Contributors will need to send the following information to info@humancoin.net by the 30th November 2018 (any correspondence received after this date may not be actioned): - the registered account email - the date(s) of contribution(s) - the total sum of the contribution and the type of the cryptocurrency - profile information you provided in your login section (age, country etc) - the wallet(s) address(es) the contribution was sent from - and the wallet address the contribution should be refunded to.  2) Follow receipt of that information and by 15th December, all valid 20eth+ worth contributions are to be refunded. It will take this time to confirm all details as it refers to 95% of all the contributions raised.  3) Other valid contributions are to be refunded in the period of 15-30th of December.  📨Please be very accurate in providing all this👆information in one letter to info@humancoin.net. Only valid and trustworthy claims can be refunded.  📌As a result of this, the team will be busy and will NOT be entering into correspondence (also no time for chatting in social channels or via e-mail). Please be patient. There will be a reduced communication.  ❓Please read all this message carefully as it highly likely has the answers to your possible questions.  💡We will update you WEEKLY with the status of the refund process via our official Telegram channel! https://t.me/HumancoinChannel  ⏳Only official telegram channel will be updated and all other TokenSale related social channels will be gradually removed in November/December 2018.

Earlier last week, it was reported that Humancoin raised over $6 million in their public and private Token Sale.   By integrating the Bancor Protocol, HUMA token holders will gain access to continuous liquidity regardless of trade volume or exchange listings, through the Bancor Network, where any integrated token can be automatically converted to any other directly from the Bancor Wallet or any Web3 wallet, such as MetaMask. A long list of integrated tokens using the Bancor protocol can be found here https://www.bancor.network/tokens   Humancoin unites philanthropists and recipients of funds on a single P2P blockchain platform in the most convenient and transparent way possible. HUMA tokens can be easily convertible into any points, miles, bonuses, coupons. The Proof of Charity “mining” concept allows the project to scale hundreds and thousands of times.   About Humancoin Humancoin is a decentralized platform that has the potential to become a global e-commerce loyalty program aggregator. Association with philanthropy gives its tokens a unique advantage in developing loyalty programs with partners creating a strong emotional resonance. Instead of competing with existing programs, the Humancoin token is effortlessly integrated into already existing systems — all it requires is setting a conversion rate. For more information, please visit https://www.humancoin.net/  About Bancor Bancor is the world’s largest decentralized liquidity network. Bancor functions similar to a decentralized exchange, with a key difference: orders are processed against automated smart contracts on the blockchain, instead of matching two parties in a trade. Any project can easily integrate their token by creating a Relay on the Bancor Network to automate fair and efficient token conversions for users, directly from their wallets. Tokens on Bancor are instantly convertible for one another, with 8000+ trading pairs across ETH, DAI, BNB & more. Bancor technologies impact organizations and people across the globe, from blockchain teams to token holders to real-world communities in Africa, Asia and beyond. Visit the Bancor Web App to convert tokens instantly, list your token on the Bancor Network or join the Bancor Telegram group for more information.",True

In your wp you stated that the recipient project of a donation can specify which currency (crypto or fiat) it wish to receive from the benefactor. My question is, in case fiat is selected,  does this mean that the benefactor will have to send fiat via your platform. Take for example,  i as a benefactor wishes to send nigerian Naira to a recipient who wishes to accept rupees. Does that mean i can send the money through your platform, it will be exchanged via your platform (if it is part of the currency supported) and sent to the recipient? If that is the case then how does it cut the number of days it takes to send fiat? Or,  i just need to buy your tokens and send via your platform which will be exchanged to the currency needed by the recipient and i receive 50% cash back.  2.For loyalty programs, will a user have to hold humancoin to receive discount, miles or points OR it is when a user pays for goods with humancoin that he/she is eligible to receive discount, miles, point or loyalty? Or humancoin will be used to activate coupons, discount, miles, points etc. (like sending HUMA to a specific address to enjoy discount on a good) ?  These are my questions for now and i expect a reply. Thanks",True

Let me reply shortly as there is a lot information on the landing page and in the whitepaper.  Donors can quickly make donations worldwide, monitor their expenditure online, receive benefits from the platform's partners.  The platform provides the opportunity to fully track donations online, as well as voting and ranking for projects and philanthropists along with other features.  There is also the option to receive a receipt for each donation to use for tax deduction purposes depending on the donor's tax jurisdiction.  The future expansion of the project will be financed by the 5%-fee raised from the funds collected for charity projects, which is 4 times lower than the market average.  The blockchain platform fuelled by the “mined” Humancoin token will breathe new life into the charity industry, proving an engine of growth.

Then we’ve got some bad and some good news.  According to various sources, about 20% (sometimes up to 30%!) of all donated funds are kept as administrative expenses by charity foundations. Although it is not the fault of some specific person or fund — that’s just how the whole system works, with funds having to pay rental fees and salaries to their employees — you probably did not expect that to happen while making a donation.  Humancoin founders totally agree with you. That’s why the platform only keeps a 5%-fee raised from the funds collected for charity projects — 4 times lower than the market average! This money will be spent on helping to develop and scale up Humancoin. We are not an intermediary; we are a convenient platform that connect donors and charitable projects directly to each other! Also, thanks to blockchain, all transfers are absolutely traceable and transparent.",True

Retailers keep moving online, discovering the benefits of online stores. This extremely high competition puts pressure on market players to develop new loyalty programs—for both attracting new customers and retaining existing ones by offering a variety of discounts and benefits.  With new loyalty programs constantly appearing on the market, it is becoming more and more challenging to engage consumers at an emotional level. And this is where Humancoin will make a huge difference. Integrating consumer loyalty programs with the charity industry creates a very strong emotional bond.
