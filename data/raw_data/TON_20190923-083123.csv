From the whitepaper I quoted before:  Quote These Global distribution partners seeking to market our Tontines, shall first be required to purchase and lock down TON$ with a value equal to 5% of monthly expected referral volumes. This stake shall act as a surety deposit for Tontine Trust to protect against the risk of advisors miss-selling to members.  So your local insurance guy has a financial incentive to offer the tontine (amongst other products) that gives him a competitive commission and his customers 30 to 40 percent more revenue. But say you don't even ask the local intermediary and instead buy TON tokens yourself and buy into a tontine:  Quote TON$ holders which are intending to invest in the Tontines themselves can utilise this Partner staking system to generate a 5% bonus for themselves by staking their TON$ and using their own partner code when joining the Tontine. This may be the first legitimate retirement product in history where the saver immediately gets more capital value upon investment (105%) rather than seeing their capital value immediately depleted by up to 30% due to fees. Accordingly, TON$ Holders not using an Advisor are rewarded for holding the TON$ if they invest in the Tontines.",False

Over the years, as members of the tontine die off, their share is distributed among the other members in the form of mortality credits. This means that the longer a member lives, the more monthly income they will receive. Talk about a hedge against inflation!

Also, it is about time someone takes on the pension funding industry (and wipes out their greedy profits) and offers a reasonable alternative.  I take it these tontines can have just Bitcoin as the underlying asset if one so chooses? Bitcoin's growth combined with the tontine effect would be nice!",False

There are several solutions for this referenced in the whitepaper.  We will also connect to third party oracles which can provide authoritative death notices. There are many projects developing these at the moment but we will also develop our own.  An example would be an oracle that tracks the US Social Security Death Index",False

The most superior one is a loving and caring family with resources willing to take care of the old generation. But unfortunately many people are not that lucky and are not in that situation. And since we cannot create care-taking families with crypto-technology we resorted to re-creating tontines and bringing them back to the market .,False

After that initial period tontinetrust is going to pay these commissions out of the fees they are taking in.  I imagine that to be interesting moments when the retail customer realizes how competitive tontines are compared to the current products.",False
