Partly this is due to the downturn in the market we have seen lately, (which finally appears to be reversing), and partly it is down to slower than expected implementations of improvements to our first small-cap crypto investment in Unitus.  We have worked hard with the Unitus team over the last months, and we hope that the work we have done will help grow Unitus in the near future.  As outlined in our white paper we are committed to making regular payments of excess profits to the holders of Angel Token.  However, due to market up and downs the value of the Angel Token portfolio has decreased slightly in ETH terms, (by about 9 ETH), since the last Dividend Declaration Notice on January 23rd.  Therefore there will not be any dividend paid to Angel Token holders on April 30th 2018.  INVESTMENT STRATEGY  Due to the lack of growth of the Angel Token portfolio in the last two quarters we have had internal discussions about the best way forward for Angel Token.  Due to the challenges we have faced in the last months we are re-considering our main strategy, to mainly invest in small-cap coins and assisting them in growing their userbase and improving their coins.  We have discussed instead favouring investing in medium to large-cap coins that we believe have potential to grow faster than ETH.  The new strategy would not exlude investments in small-cap coins, but would shift the overall focus from small-cap more towards medium and large-cap coins.  We will shortly open up this topic for discussion within the Angel Token Private Investors Community, and will consider organizing a vote on this, if the community as a whole seems positive to this potential shift in investment strategy.

As a miner, you can choose 5 different algorithms to mine with. 99% of all coins and blockchain projects don't have this.

At the moment EtherDelta is the only open exchange, but we would not advise you to trade there because of the recent hacking of their website and exchange, and the change in ownership.  We have had a lot of people contact us after the ICO had ended, asking if they can invest in Angel Token. Some of them simply missed the ICO and others were concerned and didn't dare to invest but have now changed their mind and wanted to buy Angel tokens.  Everyone is keen to start trading Angel Token ASAP so we do understand they importance of getting a listing as soon as we can, and we can assure you that we are working on this.  The coinmarketcap.com listing will hopefully follow fairly shortly after being listed on another exchange than EtherDelta. However, there is a requirement that in order to get listed on coinmarketcap.com a coin must have at least $10,000/day in trading volume on one of their approved exchanges, so the CMC listing will only come once we meet those requirements.  The Angel Token Private Investors Community is temporarily closed due to a security breach, but we hope to re-open by Wednesday or Thursday this week at the latest.  Our normal Slack is still open though and we advise everyone who has an interest in Angel Token to please join our open Slack community to stay up to date with the latest information: https://angelinvestors.io/slack",False

The security review has now largely been done, (although some small amount of work relating to the database remains).  We will re-open the private community for new registrations on Wednesday Jan 10th.  Please note that the private investors community is ONLY open to Angel Token holders with a minimum of 10,000 Angel Tokens in their wallet.    ANGEL TOKEN EXCHANGE LISTINGS  We are aware that many investors are interested in seeing Angel Token listed on another exchange than EtherDelta (which is not recommended for use by us for security reasons), and likewise there are many people contacting us asking how they can buy Angel Tokens because they missed the ICO.  Therefore Angel Token have now applied to be listed on the following exchanges:  https://hitbtc.com/  Our application is under consideration with HitBTC.  https://www.coinexchange.io/  Our application is under consideration with CoinExchange.  https://yobit.net/en/  Our application is under consideration with Yobit, but we have paid the premium listing fee of $1600 so our application should be processed (and hopefully approved!) within 7 working days. The $1600 listing fee will be paid from personal funds of the Angel Token founders team.  We understand the importance for many investors of getting Angel Token on an exchange, and because we do not wish to use the ICO funds for these types of expenses, (and since the fund management fee for the Angel Foundation is not yet large enough to cover these type of expenses), we decided to pay this cost ourselves.  We have also applied to get into the voting to be listed on:  https://next.exchange/  In order to get listed on next.exchange we need strong community support.  The number of votes we get will determine if and how quickly we can get listed. Our general description is still awaiting moderation, but as soon as it has been approved please show your support for Angel Token by voting for us to get listed here:  https://nextexchange.featureupvote.com/suggestions/3542/angel-token-angl  Please note that next.exchange only accept a maximum of 50 votes per day, and they will only consider coins with at least 250 votes for listing. Please also read this article to understand how the voting system works and why your vote MAY not always count: https://blog.featureupvote.com/online-voting-and-voter-manipulation-931b5d7a60d6      UPDATE ON INVESTMENTS  We are in early stage discussions with the community manager of our first proposed investment.  If we are able to work out what we believe is an acceptable deal with them we will put this investment up for discussion, analysis and a vote inside the Angel Token Private Investors Community.  We will attempt to get this done as soon as possible, but hopefully towards the middle of next week we will have more information.  In our opinion this is a HIGHLY undervalued coin with MASSIVE potential. It is a low-cap coin that has been around for a few years and they have what we believe is a strong development team.  Although their marketing efforts have improved lately we believe that there is still A LOT we can do to help them get the recognition this coin deserves! With us as a team using both paid and free marketing methods, and the Angel Token community behind us the moon is literally the limit for this coin...  Excited yet?  You should be!    This will be our first proposed investment and we are personally very excited about the potential of this coin!  However, since we are only in early discussions we do not yet know the outcome, and if there will be a deal or not.  If there is no positive outcome we have several other coins that we have researched and will approach in the upcoming days and weeks.    OTHER POTENTIAL INVESTMENT/PARTNERSHIP  As has been mentioned previously, during the ICO we were approached by one of the ""community leaders"" and ""an insider"" of a well-known established altcoin that we have always liked for various reasons.  We have now received a formal proposal from them.  Although the proposal is somewhat lacking in detail and would be quite demanding for Angel Token, we are now happy for this person, (who is also an Angel Token investor), to come forward and for us all to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of this potential partnership inside the Angel Token Private Investors Community if he wishes to do so.  This can happen from early next week as soon as the private community has re-opened and everyone has had a chance to get inside.",False

So, our first dividend declaration date is here and we hope that it is no surprise that we are NOT paying a dividend this time.

We are in the process of building up our research facilities and in working discussion with a few investments (to act as Angel Investors and help these coins grow their exposure and market value) and that are looking forward to showing our community.

The coin has some unique features that we think are very smart, and with a good team and growing community behind it we think that it is in TOTALLY the wrong place on coinmarketcap.  UNITUS (UIS)  Unitus is a merge-mined multi-algorithmic coin secured by the following algos:  - Lyra2RE2 (GPU mining) - Argon2d (CPU mining) - Skein (GPU mining - soon to be ASIC) - Yescrypt (CPU mining) - X11 (ASIC)  SO WHAT DOES MULTI-ALGO MEAN IN PRACTISE?  Well it means that as a miner you can choose which algo you want to mine, but not only that. What really makes Unitus unique is that it's a coin that is both multi-algorithmic *AND* merge mineable.  As far as we know this is totally unique, and even if there MAY be one or a couple of other coins that have these features it is very rare and cutting edge technology.   SO WHAT DOES MERGE MINING MEAN?  Merge mining is an awesome feature that allows miners to mine any other coin they want, AND THEN MINE UNITUS ON TOP OF THAT COIN, WITHOUT SPENDING ANY MORE RESOURCES!  So basically it is like a ""_100% FREE BONUS_"" for miners to add Unitus to their mining operation. It costs them NOTHING EXTRA in terms of electricity or mining power, and they still get the Unitus coins that they mine FOR FREE!   SO WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF A MULTI-ALGORITHMIC COIN?  Being multi-algorithmic makes Unitus SUPER SECURE compared to other coins. Instead of having one algorithm securing the coin, (like Bitcoin for example), you now have 5 different algos that are all working together to secure the coin!   WHY DOES ALL THIS MATTER?  The problem that many small independent coins have is that because they are small there are only a few miners who mine those coins. Often it's only the founders and a few enthusiastic community members who mine the coin, because it has such a low value and uncertain future (if any).  This makes the smaller coins very insecure and even if they do well marketing wise they remain open to attack.  This is a catch22 dilemma that all new coins suffer from, that until they become valuable and popular they are highly vulnerable to attack. Even Bitcoin could easily have been destroyed in its early days when there was only Satoshi and a few enthusiasts mining it.  With the combination of a multi-algo and merge mining Unitus is overcoming one of the largest issues small coins face, *security.*  So if you are already mining one of those 5 algos mentioned above, you can use your precious hashes to get some extra Unitus coins above what you get anyway from your normal mining operations.  COIN SUPPLY  There are just under 56 million coins in circulation right now, *BUT* be aware that Coinmarketcap is showing an incorrect coin supply of around 47 million. The Unitus team have contacted them about this several times but they are yet to correct it. To see the current supply go here: https://unitus.online/network  Another interesting feature of Unitus is that there is no technical upper limit for the coin supply.  Rather Unitus is very much like a valuable natural resource such as Gold or Platinum.   Right now there is still ""plenty"" available for miners (relatively), but it becomes harder and harder to find the coins. However, the resource will never be 100% depleted. There will always be some coins available for mining.  For reference though, most coins available will have been mined by June 2022 and at that point there will be a total of 100 million coins in circulation, but taking away the 17 million that were burnt there will actually only be around 83 million.   EXCHANGES  Unitus is mainly traded on Cryptopia at the moment.  It is also listed on Yobit.net but do *NOT* buy Unitus there. Yobit has refused to update the wallet after a hard-fork a long time ago, and because of that the coins on the Yobit exchange are on the wrong chain!  The Unitus team have contacted Yobit many times to no avail, but we have discussed other potential options with them that would rectify this situation, but more on that later if Angel Token goes ahead with this investment.  SPEED  Unitus can handle 10x the transactions of Bitcoin in 60 second blocks.  This coin is infinitely scalable!   WAS THERE ANY PRE-MINE OR IS IT ""FAIR"" LIKE BITCOIN?  Most coins or tokens that are launched nowadays either do an ICO or Pre-mine a large chunk of coins for the developers to ""take a share for free"". A lot of the time this is done in suspect or shady ways by the developer pre-mining some coins for himself before setting the coins free on the open market, or by skewing the distribution in such a way that he can catch a lot of coins early on while the coin is still unknown.  We are pleased to say that Unitus had a completely fair launch, just like Bitcoin.   WHAT ABOUT THE DEVELOPERS AND COMMUNITY?   We have been watching the Unitus developers and community for some time now, from a distance and without interacting with them, (as we do with many coins), and we have been impressed.  They are pro-active and knowledgeble, and they respond quickly and friendly to questions from the community.  After having reached out to them and throughout these negotiations over the last few weeks they have been nothing but professional, friendly and great to deal with. Sure, the negotiations have been tough, but we are impressed with them, and we think they can lead Unitus (together with our help) to become the next big coin.   A PERFECT FIT?  The one thing that has held Unitus back since its launch in July 2015 is the lack of marketing. Basically the guys from Unitus are ""techies"" and developers. They know how to program and build a great coin, but they lack in marketing expertise.  If the Angel Token community come together and work as a team to market Unitus as ""the next Vertcoin"" we believe we that there is no limit to how far we can go...  We have created a comprehensive 6-month marketing plan that we have presented to Unitus, and if we work together on that plan this will become a VERY profitable investment for Angel Token and you the investors.  MARKET CAP  He he, this is where it gets really interesting and fun for us who are ""_in the know_""... :slightly_smiling_face:  Unitus current market cap is only around $2.3 million in and the coin is trading at around 650 Satoshis or about $0.05 (about 5 US cents).  This is ridiculously low for such a high-tech and smart coin!   WHAT SHOULD THE MARKET CAP OF UNITUS BE IN OUR OPINION?  We think a fair comparison that some people who have caught on to Unitus already have made is to Vertcoin.  Vertcoin, just like Unitus, focused on miners and making the mining accessible to everyone with a simple graphics card. Like Unitus they also had a 100% fair launch and distribution where they offered 100% of the rewards to the miners.  12 months ago to this day one Vertcoin costed $0.033 (3.3 US cents), and the market cap was less than $1.1 million.  Today one Vertcoin costs $2.88 (2 dollars and 88 cents), and the market cap is around $123 million.  We believe that Unitus has every chance to become the next Vertcoin and the entire Angel Token Team as well as the Angel Token Private Investors Community (ATPIC) are all very excited about this investment and collaboration with Unitus.",False

Angel Token has acquired a stake of 925,000 Unitus (UIS) at a substantial discount to the current trading price in an off-exchange deal with the Unitus Team.  In late January 2018 the Angel Token Private Investors Community (ATPIC), consisting of major Angel Token ICO investors, voted to invest a substantial amount of the ICO funds in Unitus, and to initiate a close collaboration with the Unitus Team after the two founder teams reached a mutually beneficial agreement.  The Angel Token Team and the ATPIC Community will be working directly with the founders, developers and community of Unitus over the coming months to assist with the re-launch, improvements and marketing for the long-established but still relatively unknown multi-algorithm cryptocurrency.  By working with the Unitus team towards improving the brand and visibility in the crypto space, Angel Token aims to drive this highly undervalued coin into its rightful rank in terms of marketcap.  Alex, the founder of Angel Token stated:  “We have privately researched undervalued coins to invest in and we selected Unitus as our first investment from 1500 cryptocurrencies.  Among the many low cap cryptocurrencies we have researched Unitus stands out to us as unbelievably undervalued and with huge potential. The coin has some unique features that we think are very smart, and with a good team and growing community behind it we think that it is in totally the wrong place in terms of marketcap.  Our entire team and community believes Unitus is possibly the most undervalued cryptocurrency project out there.”  ABOUT ANGEL TOKEN:  “Angel Token is a crypto incubator and investment fund for small-cap altcoins. The Angel Token Team and ATPIC community create wealth, rather than passively wait for crypto investments to rise. Together, the Angel Token Team and the ATPIC community invest in overlooked and undervalued low to medium cap cryptocurrencies, and the skilled Angel Token team of developers, designers and marketers then work with the community to improve the functionality, visibility and marketing of those coins they have invested in.“ Angel Token is traded on the IDEX exchange (ANGL): https://idex.market/eth/angl   ABOUT UNITUS:  “Unitus is a unique cryptocurrency that was launched in December 2014. Unitus uses 5 independent algorithms to ensure the blockchain remains extremely secure. Along with the multi-algorithmic aspect of the coin, Unitus is also using merge mining thus allowing a miner to mine a parent coin, whilst at the same time contribute network hashrate to Unitus - and earn both the parent coin's mining rewards and Unitus at the same time, with no additional effort, cost or overhead on the miner's behalf. Unitus was the first crypto-currency to combine Multi-Algo with Merge Mining to bring a more secure and resilient blockchain to the market.“ Unitus is traded on the Cryptopia exchange (UIS): https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Exchange/?market=UIS_BTC",False

There are two parts to the refund periods as we see it, and they are kind of competing with each other in terms of importance.  1. As an anonymous team there is the issue of trust that we wanted to address with the Guaranteed Investor Refund period.  The refund period consist of a total of 150 days.  During the first 100 days any investor in the ICO can INSTANTLY and AUTOMATICALLY get 80% of their invested Ether back, by simpy returning all or part, (for a partial refund) of their tokens to our ICO Ethereum smart contract address.  During the 2nd refund period, which lasts the following 50 days after the first 100 days have ended, any ICO investor can INSTANTLY and AUTOMATICALLY get 40% of their invested Ether back, by simply returning all or part (for a partial refund) of their tokens to our ICO Ethereum smart contract address.    We believe that 100 and 150 days will be enough time for investors to get a good feeling for and understanding of a lot of things surrounding Angel Token, such as:  - How we are as a team. By that I mean that investors will have plenty of time to chat to us and discuss various issues surrunding the ICO, potential investments and many other things. It is basically a time for investors to ""get to know us"".  - To see how we make investment decisions, and potentially even see how one or a couple of those decisions turn out. Investors will quickly come to understand how we deal with things inside the private investors community, and see how we address various issues and questions.  - To see how the price of Angel Token will develop on the open exchanges. Investors may have many opportunities to trade in and/or out of Angel Token with a profit. Or they may be disappointed with how the price develops during the first 3 months and rather claim their 80% or 40% refund because they don't think the price will develop favorably fast enough for them.  The point is that they have this time to see what happens to the price, which is obviously an unknown factor for us as a team as well, since it will largely depend on the investing public perception of Angel Token.  2. Investors want fast and good return on their capital.  Since we are unable to touch the 80% of investor funds that are locked up in the Ethereum smart contract, we are not able to use those funds for trading activities.  We believe that a 150 day total refund period, with 1 period of 80% and 1 of 40% gives both us and investors the right balance of allowing us to prove ourselves as a team and get to know each other, and at the same time allowing us to use investor funds in a reasonably effective way.  If we extended it further than these 150 days we would be locking up investor funds for too long without making good use of them, giving investors less than an optimal return.  Obviously the more funds we raise the more sense the above percentages and time periods make, but even where we are now, at around $500,000 raised we feel pretty good about the upcoming months.  As a very last point and to answer you directly, yes we hope that we will have achieved some good results by the time of the first refund period coming to an end at March 7th, 2018. However, regardless where we are in terms of investments/returns we believe that investors will have a very clear understanding of us as a team and what we are about, and it will be easy for them to decide if they want to stay invested with us or sell on an exchange or request the refund by then.",False

As founders we don't get any of the Ether funds that are raised in the ICO.  We receive exactly 8% of the tokens that are distributed to investors. So for each 1000 Angel Tokens sold we as founders get another 80 tokens that are minted ""extra"" for us and that we share among ourselves.  The management fee of 0.75% should hopefully cover the running costs for our office and team members etc. and then we personally benefit from owning those 8% of the Angel Tokens in the same way any other Angel Token investor benefits, from the rise in price of those tokens as the Angel Token Portfolio increases and from any dividends that are paid to Angel Token holders.  We believe it is fair and reasonable that 100% of the funds raised through the ICO goes towards investments in small cap altcoins and helping those coins become as good as they possibly can be, so their market cap increases, which benefits everyone (us included, since we will own 8% of the tokens).",False

Lot's of questions, and yes we are here, just not ""all the time""...  1. In regards to the dividend payout this is explained inside the white paper and also on the very first post here in this thread under: ""The Main Purpose of Angel Token"".  Quote from: LLec on November 11, 2017, 01:47:52 AM   HOW THE FUNDS RAISED DURING THE ICO WILL BE USED - THE MAIN PURPOSE OF ANGEL TOKEN  The Ether raised during the Angel Token ICO will be used to invest in, and assist, undervalued small to medium size cryptocurrencies reach their potential in terms of users, awareness and market capitalization.  It is our aim to continually grow the Angel Token crypto investment portfolio in value, and to make regular dividend payments in Ethereum to all Angel Token investors holding 10,000 tokens or more. (This limit is due to transactional costs.)  We make no specific promises either as to the amount of expected growth of our investment portfolio or dividend payments. However, our aim is to distribute up to a maximum of 25% of our portfolio growth each quarter that we reach a new ""portfolio high watermark"".   However, let me clarify this a bit further since you seem to assume that what is not paid out as dividends doesn't go back to the investors.  This is incorrect, apart from the management fee of between 0.75% and 1.5%, as explained in the white paper, 100% of all gains go towards the Angel Token holders in one form or another.  The only question is what is the RIGHT amount to pay as a dividend, and what is the RIGHT amount to keep inside the Angel Token portfolio to continue to grow the value of the portfolio, (which will then in turn grow the value of the Angel Token price and market cap).  We discuss this dilemma at some length inside the white paper, but here is a part of it for those that have not bothered to read it, (hint: never make investments without first reading the white paper!).  Quote We believe the true value of an asset should be defined as a combination of the expected income from that asset together with the expected capital return.  We have therefore decided that the Angel Foundation will pay dividends to Angel Token holders.  All dividends will be paid in Ether.  Angel Token will only pay a dividend if the portfolio has reached a new high at the end of the quarterly period in Ether terms.  The reason for this is that should the portfolio be recovering from a falling market, then taking a dividend from the portfolio will add to the amount that the portfolio would have to rise to reach a new record high.  With dividends there is always a trade off between paying large dividends, which is attractive to investors short-term but restricts the growth of the portfolio long-term, and paying small dividends.  Meaning, that if the dividend is small it keeps more funds in the portfolio and since those funds are growing it enables larger dividends in the future. The calculations that we have done on the expected growth of the portfolio have given us to believe that a sensible dividend strategy will be in investor’s long-term interests.  The Angel Foundation aims to pay a dividend in the region of 10% to 25% of the GROWTH in the value of the portfolio in the preceding quarter.  The Angel Foundation will declare any dividend payable to Angel Token holders on the following dates every year:  - January 23rd - April 23rd - July 23rd - October 23rd  Any dividends payable will be paid 7 days after the dividend declaration date, which is hereafter referred to as the “dividend payment date”. The dividend payment date falls on the following dates each year:  - January 30th - April 30th - July 30th - October 30th  2. The question in regards to a softcap has been explained here already:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2385917.msg24979608#msg24979608  Quote from: LLec on November 21, 2017, 08:15:25 PM Quote from: rytyr on November 20, 2017, 01:24:52 AM I have followed this project and I think it looks like a great opportunity.  I really think you will be able to make a lot from pumping small altcoins and I want to be part of that!    I am 100% for sure going to invest but I have one important question.  What happens if you only raise 5% or 10% of the total 31150 Eth that you have set as your hard-cap?  We will be happy to have you on board, and let me answer your question!  If we only raise 5% or 10% then that's what we will run with.  It is important that you understand that we are already operating this type of trading profitably by ourselves, without any external investors.  The idea behind this ICO is to be able to ""take things to the next level"", and the more we raise the higher that level will be.   Let me give you a couple of examples.   1. The more trading capital you have the more you are able to ""control the exchange market"" in a smaller size coin.  When you hold a substantial stake in a fairly low volume coin and you also have a large amount of capital available, you have a lot of ""power"" in the market. This is especially true when you are in direct contact with other major stakeholders in this coin...  The more Ethereum we raise the larger size coins we will be able to ""work with"" from this point of view.   2. In the past we have more or less acted as passive investors in the positions we have taken.  The more Ethereum we raise during the ICO the more resources we will be able to commit towards actually working with the founders and communities of the coins we invest in to improve them. Let's consider this ""the Angel Investor"" part of the operation.  With only a small amount of Ethereum raise this part of the operation will be more limited, and we will have to choose our investments more carefully to make sure that we can actually provide the resources they need to succeed in the marketplace.   3. The fewer investors we have the less ""community power"" we will have.  What I mean here is that we strongly believe in the idea that ""more brains are better than a few"" when it comes to certain types of jobs.    We have a very clear plan for how we want to ""use"" the community for everyone's benefit, but with each person only needing to take on what we refer to as ""micro tasks"". This relates both to investment research before we make investments, and also later on, creating awareness and helping our investments reach a larger market share.  This is what we refer to as ""Investment Crowd Intelligence"" in the white paper.  Apart from this we also believe that the more active investors we have bringing forward potential investments and ideas the better it will be for us all as all.    We do NOT have a referral program.  Please understand that Angel Token is NOT some form of MLM scheme or similar, it is more like a combination of an investment in a high-risk hedge fund and a ""crypto incubator"" for small-cap altcoins.  3. In regards to a minimum investment this question has been answered here already:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2385917.msg24380496#msg24380496  Quote from: AngelInvest on November 11, 2017, 03:08:42 AM Quote from: MEMEX on November 11, 2017, 02:40:29 AM This is a very impressive project, for the first investor will get an extra 690% bonus tokens. This is amazing.  How much the least purchase value allowed dev?  There is no minimum investment, but realistically anything less than 0.1 Ether wouldn't be worth the transaction fee for the gas I would think.  Although there is no minimum it is important to note that in order to become a part of the ""Private Angel Token Investment Community"", which is where we will openly share and discuss our altcoin investment research, and Angel Token holders get to have their say and vote on the investments we make, you need to own a minimum of 10,000 Angel Tokens.  The same holds true in order to take part in dividend payments that are made in Ether each succesful quarter, you need to own a minimum of 10,000 Angel Tokens.  The price of Angel Tokens are 1 Ether per 1265 tokens, so normally you would need to invest 7.9 Ether to become a member of the ""Private Investment Community"" and the quarterly dividend payments.  However, due to the incredible bonus structure incorporated in this ICO you COULD actually acquire 10,000 Angel Tokens for as little as 1 Ether, but you will probably need to invest immediately after the ICO launch on November 27th at 12:00 GMT, because we expect that the tokens will be sold quickly in the beginning as everyone wants to catch the best bonus.  For each 1 million tokens sold the bonus drops...but you COULD get 10,000 Angel Tokens for as little as 1 Ether, (and get 8735 bonus tokens!), if you are early enough, and some investors will grab those big bonuses!    4. We strongly advise anyone who is considering investing in Angel Token to read the white paper and also the questions and answers in this thread, so they are 100% aware of what they are investing in. Please also join us on Slack over here: https://angelinvestors.io/slack where hundreds of investors are already on the ""inside"" and there is often many lively discussions going on.",False

If you are genuinely interested in this project all of the so called ""huge red flags"" that you are bringing up have been thoroughly addresses in this thread already, meaning I really should delete your post as per our thread rules, (you have to bring up a genuine point that has not already been answered or addresses in the thread, or otherwise add value to the thread).  However, since you openly criticized our signature campaign and blame us for spamming the forum, I will let your comment stand and answer that.  1. I think you will find few people who care about this forum as much as we do. A couple of us on the Angel Team first learned about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies here on this very forum back in 2011, and we will be forever grateful for having the opportunities this forum has given us.  2. How many campaign managers do you know that manually check every single post in their campaign? We have had a team of 3 who have been doing exactly that and discounted all bad/spammy/low value posts.  3. We denied more than 50% of all ""good"" applicants in our signature campaign. I am not talking about those on the SMAS list or a outright spammers, but from those that were left after those basic checks less than 50% were approved to take part in our campaign, because we only wanted the best. We also banned several posters during the campaign who were simply not posting any high quality posts.  4. I agree that it is hard to find genuine quality posts on the forum nowadays which is also why we handed out $200 every week to the top quality posters. How many campaigns have you seen doing that? It is not easy but we have spent around $15,000 on this campaign and we have tried very hard to actively work towards higher quality posts in our campaign.  5. Since you responded to paolo99 who actually was our first week's winner for ""best quality posts"" I urge you to find some examples of him spamming the forum?  Let's be clear about a couple of things.  - You may not like our project, bonus plan or the fact that we have decided to stay anonymous or semi-anonymous. That's ok!  - This is the first signature campaign we have ever run (and the first ICO for any of us) and we have tried our utmost to run as clean of a campaign as possible. For anyone else to say something different is simply unfair.  - If you read through this thread and the answers from me and Alex, as well as join our Slack community you have every opportunity to understand what we are about and what we are trying to do, as well as get to know us better.",False

We want to keep this thread as informative and useful for potential investors as possible. Even if someone has a critical view of our project let's keep things courteous. If you have a critical question that is also fine, but make sure that your question has not already been answered in this thread or they will get deleted.       Because the refunds are built into the Ethereum smart contract and fully automatic.  Even if the price of Angel Token would go to zero on the exchange this is has no bearing on our ability to refund investors.  All investor funds are 100% protected inside the Angel Token Central Bank through the Ethereum smart contract, allowing investors full control over 80% of their investment at any time up until March 7th, 2018 and 40% until April 26th 2018.  This a completely different process from the type of buy-backs that you are referring to.  Here is some more information on how the refund process works.  Quote The refund is a fully automatic process that is built into the Ethereum smart contract, allowing YOU as the investor to “back out” of Angel Token with a minor loss of maximum 20% in the event the price of Angel Token on the exchange does not rise like you expected, or if you are not happy with us as a team and how we are running things, or the investments we are making etc.  For whatever reason you would rather get your Ether back you can choose to do so with 80% until March 7th, 2018, and 40% from March 7th until April 26th.  There are no special skills needed to claim your refund, should you choose to do so.  You do not need to have any more  understanding of how smart contracts work than you need to know about car engine mechanics in order to drive a car.  You just need to know how to send Ether and Tokens from your https://www.myetherwallet.com/ and this you can easily learn on YouTube, or on https://angelinvestors.io/go  In order to initiate a refund you simply send back the amount of tokens that you want to refund FROM THE SAME ETHEREUM ADDRESS THAT YOU INVESTED IN THE ICO FROM, (so you MUST have control of this address and it can NOT be an address on an exchange).  Then within a few seconds your Ether is automatically refunded to your wallet.   So there is no complicated process to go through, (and there is no “approval” needed from us or anything like that).  You as the investor have total control.  Partial refunds are also possible. So if for example you are not particularly happy with how things are going in a couple of months, but you would like to remain with 10% of your original investment in the project you can refund part of your tokens if you want.  The only conditions are:  1. You must have purchased Angel Tokens during the ICO, and you must have the private key to the wallet you sent your investment from.  We strongly recommend https://www.myetherwallet.com/ but other Ethereum wallets such as Mist will also work. The refund is ONLY applicable to investors who buy tokens during the ICO. It is not applicable to those only acquire their tokens on an exchange.  2. You can not refund MORE tokens than you purchased during the ICO. So if for example you buy 100,000 tokens during the ICO and then another 100,000 on the exchange a few weeks later when we are listed there, you can ONLY refund a maximum of 100,000 tokens, which was the amount you got through the ICO.  The point to remember is that there is no complicated process and no special knowledge needed to get your refund, and YOU as the ICO investor have total control over what you want to do with 80% of your funds.  We think this is the future of ICOs...  Quote from: Energy_girl on December 07, 2017, 12:16:48 AM There are so many tokens of the same kind. What would you say is your business proposition as compared to your competitors?  We don't believe that there are any tokens or ICOs that offer what we do.  We offer investors the ability to actively take part in selecting and vetting investments in our Angel Token fund. These are investments in small-cap cryptocurrencies that have great potential but that have for some reason not yet achieved their true market cap and worth.  Our team will work actively with the founders, early miners and other large stakeholders in those coins and offer them the expertise and resources from our team and the Angel Token Foundation, to help them improve and better market their cryptocurrency. In return we will buy a stake in these coins (usually off the exchange market and at a discounted price), which will be added to the Angel Token portfolio.  We think the combination of an active investor community that take part in and vote on the investments we make, as well as regular dividends and the potential for massive returns from the small-cap coins we invest in makes us a very attractive ICO.  When you also take into consideration that we offer investors a protection of their funds, making it IMPOSSIBLE for any ICO investor to lose more than 20% of their Ether investment before March 7th, 2018 we think our ICO is really a ""no brainer"" for anyone looking for big returns. We offer all the potential upside with very little downside risk.",False

We would therefore hereby like to make the following official announcement to all existing and potential Angel Token ICO investors.  BACKGROUND  Since there was no pre-ICO or any other similar fundraising activities the Angel Token Team has funded all the costs of this ICO to date ourselves.  The funds we have used to fund this ICO come from profits from previous crypto investment and trading activities that we have benefited from as a team prior to this ICO.  However, we have reached a point where the marketing budget we have made available as a team has nearly been used up.  We are committed to using virtually all Ether raised during the Angel Token ICO to invest in, and assist, undervalued small to medium size cryptocurrencies reach their potential in terms of users, awareness and market capitalization, and thereby increasing the value of the Angel Token portfolio.  However, unless we raise more funds we would have no choice but to reduce our marketing spend during the last and crucial week of the ICO, which is something we obviously want to avoid.  STATEMENT  We have therefore made an agreement with a private investor that falls outside the scope of the normal investment procedure for the Angel Token ICO.  The investor has agreed to contribute $12,000 (twelve thousand USD or the equivalent in another currency), to be used solely for our Angel Token marketing efforts during the last crucial week of the ICO.  The Angel Token Team have decided to accept this $12,000 investment on the following terms:  1. The investor will make the investment available to the Angel Token Team in a way that it can be used immediately to fund marketing expenses.  2. The investor was planning to invest a similar amount in the Angel Token ICO but was waiting towards the end of the ICO to see how many investors would join, before deciding on the total amount to be invested. The investor therefore wants to be compensated with Angel Tokens at a rate that is at least as a favorable as the rate which is currently available to normal ICO investors.  3. The investor has agreed to forsake his right to an 80% refund until March 7th 2018, which all other Angel Token ICO investors benefit from. The investor will have no right to refund of any kind.  4. The Angel Token Team has agreed to compensate the investor with a total of 228,000 Angel Tokens in return for the $12,000 investment.  5. The 228,000 tokens represent the approximate total number of tokens that would be minted at the 393% bonus level, (including the 30% that normally goes to the Angel Foundation - 15% to Marketing, 8% to Founders and 7% for Talent recruitment and incentives). This is the next bonus level to be reached after another 34 Ether has been invested in the Angel Token ICO.  6. The 228,000 will be reserved and paid from the 15% ""Marketing Fund"" that the Angel Foundation has at its disposal, and which currently holds just over 1.2 million Angel Tokens.  7. The Angel Token Team believes that this distribution of 228,000 Angel Tokens from the 15% marketing fund is a good use of those tokens that will benefit all Angel Token holders and ICO investors, since it will improve our chances of getting further investments into the ICO before it closes on December 19th at 23:59 GMT. It will help ensure that we can maintain a reasonable level of marketing efforts during the coming week.  8. These funds will primarily be used towards re-marketing to those people who have already expressed an interest in the Angel Token ICO, but may not yet have made an investment for one reason or another, (including those investors who have tied to invest but been unable to do so due to the high fees on the Ethereum Network caused mainly by the viral ""Crypto Kittens"" game), as well as the upcoming social media bounty that Angel Token is about to launch.  WITH 8 DAYS LEFT TO GO THE ANGEL TOKEN ICO HAS RAISED MORE THAN 700 ETHER CURRENTLY WORTH AROUND $360,000.  If you have any questions about this announcement or anything else relating to the Angel Token ICO, please contact us through our Slack channel https://angelinvestors.io/slack or feel free to post questions here, but please note that if you post repetitive comments or questions that have already been answered in this thread they will be deleted.",False

Quote from: cliffhanger35 on December 12, 2017, 02:26:32 AM I want to invest before the next bonus drop, and I have tried several times but my ethereum just keeps coming back into my wallet after an hour or two?    if i send eth from https://myetherwallet.com/ to your ico address then I should get the angel tokens sent back to me automatically no? Do you know what is going wrong my transaction because I see everyone else happily getting their angel tokens ok!? I am the stupid one who can't figure it out.    Almost for sure the reason your transaction is not going through and you get your ETH returned to you is because you are not using enough Gwei (the gas price). As long as you use enough gas and a high enough gas price all transactions go through fine in the smart contract used for our ICO.  You may have heard of the ""Crypto Kittens"" game?  If not, here is an article about it: https://www.coindesk.com/loveable-digital-kittens-clogging-ethereums-blockchain/  Basically the crypto kitties have gone viral and caused a huge backlog of transactions on the Ethereum network over the last week or so. Therefore in order to make sure that your transaction goes through and you get your Angel Tokens you need to use a higher Gas Price (Gwei) setting than what is normal.  You can check the website https://ethstats.net/ to see what the current Gas Price is at the moment, but otherwise use something like 50 for Gwei and your transaction should go through just fine.  Here is a picture showing where you change your gas price setting inside https://www.myetherwallet.com/:    Set the Gwei at around 50 as per the picture above and set ""Gas"" at 450,000 and your transaction will go through fine.  Let us know if you have any other issues after using the above settings.",False

Quote from: tuiputui on November 23, 2017, 08:45:57 PM  - (people that already made millions according to the website, and now need to run an ICO ?, why ?)  I´ll keep and eye on it, if the project gets released and proves to be legit and alive in some months, i might jump in at a more advanced stage   Yes, since the early 2000s we have as a team operated a very successful marketing business that have generated several million dollars in net profits. (For complete transparency I should point out that the majority of those large profits came from the years up until around 2011/2012 or so. We still operate successfully, but business is nowhere near what it was 5 years ago.)  Although we made our first Bitcoin investments in 2011 we are not massively wealthy Bitcoin multi-millionaires. We had a substantial amount of Bitcoins stolen from one of the early exchanges, and we also sold off a large chunk the first time Bitcoin crossed $1000, (yes it is not one of the trading decisions we are most proud of today!   ).  Our mining operations in 2014 were more on a ""hobby level"" than a professional operation. In total I think we generated the equivalent of 22-24 Bitcoins from all of our combined mining rigs, and once you accounted for equipment and electricity it was only marginally profitable if you discount the rise in price of Bitcoin, (compared to buying coins at the current rate).  Quote from: tuiputui on November 23, 2017, 08:45:57 PM  - big rush for the early sell with that big bonuses, creating FOMO in the investor   There is no ""big rush for an early sell with the big bonuses"".  We have explained this earlier as well, but let me try again.  We believe that the current system under which most ICOs operate is kinda ""broken"", and we wanted to try something new...  Most ICOs see the vast majority of investments come in on Day 1 and then a rush on the last day of the ICO.  This just doesn't seem right to us.  What we are doing is rewarding investors with bigger bonuses the earlier they get involved, on a sliding scale in relation to the overall investment in the ICO.  We believe this is a fair way to reward risk taking.  If you are interested in investing in our ICO feel free to wait until the last day, just understand that it is going to cost you in terms of smaller bonuses that are instead rewarded to those who choose to invest ahead of you.  With the way our sliding scale bonus system works, (please see the white paper for exact details), it is a gradual decline in bonuses from the first million tokens sold until the last, and with very generous bonuses for the first several million tokens sold.  This has nothing to do with creating FOMO, because everyone is aware of the rules and how everything works BEFORE the ICO starts.  Investors are then free to choose their own entry point and willingness to accept risk, but the earlier they get involved the higher the bonus.  We believe this in combination with our Guaranteed 80% Instant And Automatic Investor Refund through our Ethereum smart contract is the way most ICOs will operate in the future.  It is fair to all investors, and just like with Bitcoin or any other coin, the earlier you decide to get in the more profit you will make.  Since most teams don't need 100% of the funds raised on Day 1 there is no real reason for most ICO teams to hold onto vast amounts of investor funds from Day 1, especially when those funds are not efficiently deployed in the market.  Our smart contract significantly reduces the downside risk for all investors, by allowing the investors to ""be in control"" of 80% of their investment (and claim it back if they wish for any reason) until the day it is actually needed.  Quote from: tuiputui on November 23, 2017, 08:45:57 PM  + this ANN is just a few days old....   1. This ANN is almost 2 weeks old by now.  2. We have been actively working on this project since June of this year, but yes the announcement was only published when we knew we were ready to launch shortly. What is wrong with that?    3. During the past 2 weeks we have published the source code for our smart contract on Github, ran a public bug hunt and gone through an official audit of the smart contract with a 3rd party Solidity expert coder.  Quote from: tuiputui on November 23, 2017, 08:45:57 PM  - the reasons for creating a token seems not clear at all for me, can´t see at all the ""use case""... businnes angels clubs already operate just in fia or eth/btc directly.  I´ll keep and eye on it, if the project gets released and proves to be legit and alive in some months, i might jump in at a more advanced stage    Then I am afraid that you have completely missed the main purpose of this ICO and what it is we are trying to do.  One potential investor in our Slack channel yesterday described our project as a ""crypto-incubator"", (a bit like Y Combinator), for ""sleeping and forgotten altcoins with huge potential"".  We think that is a very accurate description.  The main purpose of Angel Token is to create long term wealth for its token holders, by building up a portfolio of small to medium size altcoins, as well as to pay regular dividends in Ether to its token holders.  As we have explained in our white paper we are not just a ""passive portfolio"" holder like most crypto funds, but rather an active one.  We will invest in low to medium marketcap altcoins that have a good coin and a solid foundation, but that may be lacking in one or several areas.  That could be anything from a lack of funds to hire a full-time developer to work on the coin, to a lack of marketing skills, to something as simple as missing nodes/mining power, or a broken wallet.  We will work TOGETHER with the founders, community and other large stake holders of those coins to try and help them succeed, both in terms of awareness, adoption rate and to raise their market caps.  We wil be doing these investments after thorough research and discussions inside the Angel Token Private Investment Community, where everyone on the inside will hold a significant amount of Angel Tokens (minimum is 10,000). This way everyone's goals will be aligned, (with the main goal obviously being to increase portfolio value and dividend payments to Angel Token holders), and we will all work together achieve those goals.  We do not wish to try to ""convince"" anyone who feels this is ""too risky"" at the moment, and we will happily welcome you at a later stage, if at that point you would choose to invest.  However, we would like to remind everyone that ONLY those investors who purchase Angel Tokens via the ICO, by sending Ether to our smart contract address, are covered by our Guaranteed Investor Protection which assures that they CAN NEVER lose more than 20% of their investment before March 7th 2018.[/u]  If you choose to buy Angel Tokens on an open exchange at a later time, there is no downside protection should the price at any time go against you.  We hope this answers your questions and clarifies a few things.    ADDED: We try to keep this Announcement thread useful for potential investors, so please do NOT ask repetitive questions that have already been answered numerous times in this thread, regardless if they are about bounties or anything else, they will be deleted. Please read the thread and our answers before posting and make sure you are asking something original. Thank you!  ",False

I mean, fees are appealing when they are low, not high, and this could be a huge problem for the future appreciation of the token.   No.  It is nothing like paying for a ""club membership"".  When you pay for a club membership fee the money goes to club owners. When you invest in the Angel Token ICO we do not take those funds for ourselves.  Your investment does not go to us, (not even 8%, but in case someone is confused about that please ask!), it goes into the Angel Token portfolio to be used for investments.  You can think of Angel Token more as an aggressive and high-risk hedge fund, but with one major difference. We do not act like most funds do, as passive investors. Rather we act more like a ""crypto incubator"".  We are ""angel investors"", (hence the name Angel Token), in small to medium-cap altcoins.  However, what you are thinking of is indeed one of the core benefits of being an Angel Token investor, assuming you hold more than 10,000 tokens in your wallet.  You become a member of the Angel Token Private Investment Community, which is where we discuss research and potential investments with all of our stakeholders. Being part of the Angel Token Private Investment Community is a benefit because it allows you to have an active role and even potentially influence the investment decisions that Angel Token makes.  We welcome all members of the Private Investment Community to bring forward any investment proposals that they have, and share their research with all of us. We can then openly discuss this research, as well as the investment research brought forward by our own research team, and then we can vote as a community on the most interesting investment opportunities.  Despite that we are only few days into this ICO we have already had two investment proposal from Angel Token investors of projects/altcoins they think we should consider. One of them we consider very serious and interesting. The other one we haven't yet has a chance to look at closely. We will present these opportunities, as well as our own investment research and suggestions to the community after the ICO is over.  In short.  When you pay a fee to join a club, the club keeps your money.  When you invest in the Angel Token ICO your money goes into an investment fund that makes altcoin investments that benefits ALL Angel Token holders.  I suggest that you read the white paper and the previous discussions on this thread to understand better what we do.   Quote from: Supergain03 on December 01, 2017, 11:05:56 AM   2) As you are distributing dividends, can angel token be considered as a security? Big exchanges are not prone to list new tokens if there is that risk.   Considered a security by whom?  There are several countries governments that have made statements to the effect that they may consider some or all tokens as securities, among them United States. We do not allow investors from the United States or these other countries who have made similar statements to take part in the Angel Token ICO, and we specifically block them from even entering the investment part of our website.  Now if you are concerned about us not being listed on certain exchanges for this reason that is a different issue and one we will tackle in due course. However, in principal you are correct that some exchanges may not allow Angel Token to be traded on their exchange for this reason or any other, if they choose not to.  We believe exchanges are moving towards decentralization, but either way, we do not believe Angel Token investors will have any problems finding exchanges to trade their tokens should they wish to come January. In fact, we are already listed on EtherDelta as mentioned above, so you can trade there from Day 1 after the ICO.    Quote from: Supergain03 on December 01, 2017, 11:05:56 AM  3) Is there any maximum investment for each investor? Some whales could buy a lot of the tokens with this huge discount and control the token price.   Yes indeed they can.  Whales may buy a lot of the tokens because of the big bonuses we offer to early investors, and we hope they do.    It is important to remember that there is only 1 million tokens for sale at each bonus level, and we have already passed several of them. We are now at 464% rather than 690% bonus, still very generous, but the longer the whales wait the less their advantage will be...  Quote from: Supergain03 on December 01, 2017, 11:05:56 AM  4) You declare ""members agree not to buy large stakes in investments that we are collectively considering before such an investment has been made, nor reveal such ‘insider information’  to  any  other  3rd  party.

Insider trading does still exist in the regulated fields, think about the unregulated ones. This agreement is going to fail and one of the main purpose of the project is at risk.  I think the idea is simply great but these are my main concerns.  We believe that you are wrong, for several reasons, but even if turns out that you are correct, Angel Token will not fail because of it...  1. Everyone who is a member inside the Angel Token Private Investment Community owns a MINIMUM of 10,000 Angel Tokens. This means that they have already made a reasonably significant investment in Angel Token and it is therefore naturally in their interest that Angel Token succeeds.  That is the main reason for the 10,000 minimum in order to be a member of the private community. That we want everyone's goals to be aligned.   2. One major point you need to understand is that since Angel Token is acting as angel investors we are generally going to acquire our stake in the altcoins we invest in off the exchange market. We will be negotiating directly with the founders, early miners and other large stakeholders in those altcoin communities that we are looking to help and invest in.  You are right that there will likely be speculation and the market will move to some extent in those coins we are negotiating with, and those coins will also go up substantially once we have made a deal with the large stakeholders of that coin. However, this is in everyone's interest, that the price and market cap of those coins we invest in will rise. It benefits all Angel Token holders as the value of the portfolio increases.  There is no question that those who are on the inside of the Angel Token Private Investment Community will have an ""unfair advantage"" and will be able to buy into coins that we KNOW are going to rise, (because of the many improvements we are going to make to them, and the enhanced marketing efforts and so on), before the rest of the world does, but as long as this is not abused by members we don't think this will cause any significant problems, at least not over the long-term.   3. Members of the Angel Token Private Investment Community will have to agree to the terms and conditions of our community before being allowed in. Those terms and conditions include that they agree to abide by all laws in their jurisdiction as it pertains to insider trading. If they choose to break those laws to make profitable trades with the information they have gained inside the community, then they may be held accountable in their country if anyone finds out who they are. However, since cryptocurrencies and tokens are still largely unregulated in most parts of the world it is up to each member to research what laws apply to them in regards to this.  Being a member of the Angel Token Private Investment Community is not an absolute right, simply because you hold the minimum number of Angel Tokens. If we identify members who are abusing the information they have in a way that it hurts the rest of the community they will simply be blocked from the community. The same goes for disruptive or abusive members, they will be kicked out. David, our Community Investment Manager will be in charge of the community and make sure that people follow and agree to the rules we have, as far as is possible.   4. From our point of view we would obviously be concerned if members abuse their insider information in such a substantial way that it drives the prices so high that it jeopardizes the negotiations we are having with the large stakeholders of that coin, or makes it significantly more expensive for us to acquire the position we want. However, it is important to once again remember here that ALL members have a joint goal in seeing Angel Token investments succeed, because everyone is a token holder with a minimum of 10,000 Angel Tokens.  There are several countermeasures we can take if this would becomes a problem, including simply not revealing our final investments until the negotiations are over and we have secured our position. In this scenario we can likely still conduct most of the research openly, as long as there are several potential coins up for consideration (which is exactly how we see it happening) and then we simply hold back revealing the final choice that we made until the investment has been secured.   5. In those cases where we may need to acquire Angel Token's stake in a coin on the open market we may need to be more careful in exactly how open we are, even inside the private community, but we will review this on a case-by-case basis.   I am not sure I have relieved your concerns, but I have tried to answer your questions as best I can.  This ICO is NOT for everyone. It is high risk and we understand that the anonymity of the team (and investors!) is a concern for some people. However, it is how we have chosen to do this ICO, because we think it is the better way for everyone involved, but if you think it is not for you that is 100% ok!   No hard feelings, we promise!

It has recently gone through a final extensive bug hunt and audit process where some great suggestions were made that led to a few small further improvements.  The contract is live on the Ethereum network, (you can find the address at the top of our website here: https://angelinvestors.io/) and we have had over 100 investors using it in the last 3 hours or so and everything is working like clockwork.    So do not let worries about the smart contract delay your investments, because the bonus keeps dropping while you wait...  The bonus has already dropped from 690% to 558% in 3 hours, and the more investors join in the more it drops.   Here below is a post with more information about the bug hunt and smart contract audit that was done by an independent 3rd party.   Quote from: LLec on November 25, 2017, 10:42:02 PM ***BREAKING NEWS - ANGEL TOKEN OFFICIAL CODE AUDIT FINISHED***  As promised, we are publishing this prior to the Angel Token ICO going live in less than 38 hours from now.   We have now concluded both our official bug hunt and the official code audit and review of the Angel Token Ethereum Smart Contract.  We have posted a letter signed by the official auditor, Anthony Akentiev, that you can read as a PDF document here: http://angelinvestors.io/code-review      As you are probably aware, our smart contract code is open source and available for anyone to publicly view at our GitHub account: https://github.com/bitcoinfriends/angel-contracts  It was coded by one of the top solidity developers in the world, who just happens to be on our team.    Now it has also been tested hard in every way by a number of skilled programmers and Solidity developers who have tried to hack our smart contract in every way possible. This did expose a few relatively minor issues with the code that could be improved, and this has now been done.  Thereafter the code had been audited and thoroughly reviewed by Anthony Akentiev, a highly skilled independent 3rd party Russian Solidity developer who is in no way attached to us or our team.  At our request he has digitally signed the above letter (with his encrypted key) where he confirms that in his professional opinion investor funds are safe and secure.  Our smart contract has now been deployed on the Ethereum Network and is ready for launch on ""Cyber Monday"" November 27th at 12:00 GMT (Midday UK Time).  We look forward to having you on board as an investor in less than 2 days time!",False

We kind of answered this question a bit earlier and here is a quote below, but we will expand a little bit on this also below...   Quote from: AngelSupport on November 11, 2017, 10:09:08 AM  Government agencies in some jurisdictions have made statements that we interpret such that they consider Initial Coin Offerings and token sales as investments/offers that are to be regulated in some way.  Therefore citizens and/or residents, (tax or otherwise), from the those countries are prohibited from participating in this ICO.  We obviously have no real way of stopping people who are determined to invest, since it is all done through an Ethereum smart contract, (and we have no way of knowing who is investing) but at least we want to try.  As I explained before, the reason is not that we don't WANT these investors on board, but rather that we are in this for the long run and don't want any legal battles with law enforcement 3 years down the line!  In regard to WHAT HAPPENS if an investor from the US for example tries to invest let me explain.  We will attempt to block US IPs from visiting the ICO website that goes live in about 18 hours at https://angelinvestors.io/   WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A POTENTIAL US VISITOR ARRIVES IS AS FOLLOWS:  1. The visitor will get a pop-up preventing him/her from seeing the Ethereum smart contract address where you need to send funds to invest in the ICO.  2. The visitor will be asked if we made a mistake, (because IP blocking software is not always very accurate and we obviously do not want to block people from other countries by mistake).  3. The visitor then has two options:  a) Clicking to confirm: I am from the US. in which case they will be taken away from the site.  b) Clicking: No, you made a mistake I am not from the US.  4. If the visitor selects option b) they have to fill in a legal form confirming their name, email and what country they are really from and legally certify that they are indeed NOT an American citizen or resident. If they do they will then be allowed to see the Ethereum address where to send fund to invest.  We hope this clears things up a bit.  ",False

One potential investor in our Slack channel described our project as a ""crypto-incubator"", (a bit like Y Combinator), for ""sleeping and forgotten altcoins with huge potential"".  We think that is a very fitting description.    Quote from: LLec on November 18, 2017, 05:35:02 PM  We are using safe, prudent, tested investment strategies and only invest in existing altcoins tha are already listed on coinmarketcap.com and various exchanges.  We act similar to an investment fund that diversifies risk across a number of altcoins.   The big difference between Angel Token and most other crypt funds are the following:  1. We are not passive investors. We are active ""Angel Investors"" (hence the name ""Angel Token"").  When we invest in an altcoin we also help them grow and become more successful in various ways, thanks to our skilled team of programmers, web developers, marketers and designers.  2. We pay dividends in Ether each quarter we have reached a new high watermark in the value of the Angel Token portfolio.  Most crypto funds have chosen to do ""token buy backs"" instead of paying real dividends. The assumption with these strategies is that as  the supply goes down when the fund buys tokens back the price of their token will go up.  This is a technique that is also used by some very large companies around the world, but it is a far less certain way to give value back to token holders than to pay them a direct and guaranteed dividend paid in Ethereum each quarter.  As investors we have never been a fan of share buy-backs so when we decided to launch a token we didn't want to use that method for our token either.  From an investor point of view we are very safe and prudent, and even our ""Guaranteed Investor Protection"" follows the same principle, making it impossible for any investor to lose more than 20% of the Ether they invest before March 7th 2018.  The bonus structure offering a 690% bonus to the investors that manage to buy the first million Angel Tokens during the ICO is simply a way for us to reward the early risk takers and investors that come in early.  If you have seen ICOs in the past you will have noticed that most of them have a huge influx of funds on the first day when the bonus is high, and then everything stands still until the last day or two of the ICO when another huge rush of funds come in.  Our bonus structure is a simply a new way to counter that.  What we are doing is this. We are telling investors:  ""Sure you can ""wait and see"", like so many ICO Investors like to do, but for every million tokens sold the bonus goes down and you lose some benefit you would have had by investing early.""  It is simply a way to make it more fair and honest for those that commit early and say: ""Yeah I want to be part of this token!"" and send their Ether as soon as the ICO opens.  They deserve that reward, and the longer you wait the less your reward will be.   On top of that is worth noting the Angel Token Private Investors Community, open for all Angel Token holders who own 10,000 Angel Tokens or more.  You can find more information in our white paper and on our website: https://angelinvestors.io/",False

I´ll keep and eye on it, if the project gets released and proves to be legit and alive in some months, i might jump in at a more advanced stage   Yes, since the early 2000s we have as a team operated a very successful marketing business that have generated several million dollars in net profits. (For complete transparency I should point out that the majority of those large profits came from the years up until around 2011/2012 or so. We still operate successfully, but business is nowhere near what it was 5 years ago.)  Although we made our first Bitcoin investments in 2011 we are not massively wealthy Bitcoin multi-millionaires. We had a substantial amount of Bitcoins stolen from one of the early exchanges, and we also sold off a large chunk the first time Bitcoin crossed $1000, (yes it is not one of the trading decisions we are most proud of today!   ).  Our mining operations in 2014 were more on a ""hobby level"" than a professional operation. In total I think we generated the equivalent of 22-24 Bitcoins from all of our combined mining rigs, and once you accounted for equipment and electricity it was only marginally profitable if you discount the rise in price of Bitcoin, (compared to buying coins at the current rate).    - big rush for the early sell with that big bonuses, creating FOMO in the investor   There is no ""big rush for an early sell with the big bonuses"".  We have explained this earlier as well, but let me try again.  We believe that the current system under which most ICOs operate is kinda ""broken"", and we wanted to try something new...  Most ICOs see the vast majority of investments come in on Day 1 and then a rush on the last day of the ICO.  This just doesn't seem right to us.  What we are doing is rewarding investors with bigger bonuses the earlier they get involved, on a sliding scale in relation to the overall investment in the ICO.  We believe this is a fair way to reward risk taking.  If you are interested in investing in our ICO feel free to wait until the last day, just understand that it is going to cost you in terms of smaller bonuses that are instead rewarded to those who choose to invest ahead of you.  With the way our sliding scale bonus system works, (please see the white paper for exact details), it is a gradual decline in bonuses from the first million tokens sold until the last, and with very generous bonuses for the first several million tokens sold.  This has nothing to do with creating FOMO, because everyone is aware of the rules and how everything works BEFORE the ICO starts.  Investors are then free to choose their own entry point and willingness to accept risk, but the earlier they get involved the higher the bonus.  We believe this in combination with our Guaranteed 80% Instant And Automatic Investor Refund through our Ethereum smart contract is the way most ICOs will operate in the future.  It is fair to all investors, and just like with Bitcoin or any other coin, the earlier you decide to get in the more profit you will make.  Since most teams don't need 100% of the funds raised on Day 1 there is no real reason for most ICO teams to hold onto vast amounts of investor funds from Day 1, especially when those funds are not efficiently deployed in the market.  Our smart contract significantly reduces the downside risk for all investors, by allowing the investors to ""be in control"" of 80% of their investment (and claim it back if they wish for any reason) until the day it is actually needed.    + this ANN is just a few days old....   1. This ANN is almost 2 weeks old by now.  2. We have been actively working on this project since June of this year, but yes the announcement was only published when we knew we were ready to launch shortly. What is wrong with that?    3. During the past 2 weeks we have published the source code for our smart contract on Github, ran a public bug hunt and gone through an official audit of the smart contract with a 3rd party Solidity expert coder.    - the reasons for creating a token seems not clear at all for me, can´t see at all the ""use case""... businnes angels clubs already operate just in fia or eth/btc directly.  I´ll keep and eye on it, if the project gets released and proves to be legit and alive in some months, i might jump in at a more advanced stage    Then I am afraid that you have completely missed the main purpose of this ICO and what it is we are trying to do.  One potential investor in our Slack channel yesterday described our project as a ""crypto-incubator"", (a bit like Y Combinator), for ""sleeping and forgotten altcoins with huge potential"".  We think that is a very accurate description.  The main purpose of Angel Token is to create long term wealth for its token holders, by building up a portfolio of small to medium size altcoins, as well as to pay regular dividends in Ether to its token holders.  As we have explained in our white paper we are not just a ""passive portfolio"" holder like most crypto funds, but rather an active one.  We will invest in low to medium marketcap altcoins that have a good coin and a solid foundation, but that may be lacking in one or several areas.  That could be anything from a lack of funds to hire a full-time developer to work on the coin, to a lack of marketing skills, to something as simple as missing nodes/mining power, or a broken wallet.  We will work TOGETHER with the founders, community and other large stake holders of those coins to try and help them succeed, both in terms of awareness, adoption rate and to raise their market caps.  We wil be doing these investments after thorough research and discussions inside the Angel Token Private Investment Community, where everyone on the inside will hold a significant amount of Angel Tokens (minimum is 10,000). This way everyone's goals will be aligned, (with the main goal obviously being to increase portfolio value and dividend payments to Angel Token holders), and we will all work together achieve those goals.  We do not wish to try to ""convince"" anyone who feels this is ""too risky"" at the moment, and we will happily welcome you at a later stage, if at that point you would choose to invest.  However, we would like to remind everyone that ONLY those investors who purchase Angel Tokens via the ICO, by sending Ether to our smart contract address, are covered by our Guaranteed Investor Protection which assures that they CAN NEVER lose more than 20% of their investment before March 7th 2018.[/u]  If you choose to buy Angel Tokens on an open exchange at a later time, there is no downside protection should the price at any time go against you.  We hope this answers your questions and clarifies a few things.

You do not need to have any more understanding of how smart contracts work than you need to know about car engine mechanics in order to drive a car.    You just need to know how to send Ether and Tokens from your https://www.myetherwallet.com/ and this you can easily learn on YouTube, or on https://angelinvestors.io/invest  The refund is a fully automatic process that is built into the Ethereum smart contract, allowing YOU as the investor to ""back out"" of Angel Token with a minor loss of maximum 20% in the event the price of Angel Token on the exchange does not rise like you expected, or if you are not happy with us as a team and how we are running things, or the investments we are making etc.  For whatever reason you would rather get your Ether back you can choose to do so with 80% until March 7th, 2018, and 40% from March 7th until April 26th.  You simply send back the amount of tokens that you want to refund FROM THE SAME ETHEREUM ADDRESS THAT YOU INVESTED IN THE ICO FROM, (so you MUST have control of this address and it can NOT be an address on an exchange). Then within a few seconds your Ether is automatically refunded to your address.  So there is no complicated process to go through, (and there is no ""approval"" needed from us or anything like that).  You as the investor have total control.  Partial refunds are also possible. So if for example you are not particularly happy with how things are going in a couple of months, but you would like to remain with 10% of your original investment in the project you can refund part of your tokens if you want.  The only conditions are:  1. You must have purchased Angel Tokens during the ICO, and you must have the private key to the wallet you sent your investment from. We strongly recommend https://www.myetherwallet.com/ but other Ethereum wallets such as Mist will also work. The refund is ONLY applicable to investors who buy tokens during the ICO. It is not applicable to those only acquire their tokens on an exchange.  2. You can not refund MORE tokens than you purchased during the ICO.  So if for example you buy 100,000 tokens during the ICO and then another 100,000 on the exchange a few weeks later when we are listed there, you can ONLY refund a maximum of 100,000 tokens, which was the amount you got through the ICO.  The point is that there is no complicated process or knowledge needed, and YOU as the ICO investor have total control over what you want to do. We think this is the future of ICOs...  ",False

The main point from our side is that long-term we believe it is beneficial for both ourselves and investors that we keep a low profile and stay semi-anonymous...  We have explained why in the posts I have copied below.  We also believe that the 80% Guaranteed Investor Protection that is build into our immutable Ethereum Smart Contract offers MUCH MORE protection to investors than having some names and faces on a team page does.  After all, in the Angel Token ICO the investor remains in control of 80% of the investment and can simply request it back if they are not happy with us as a team, the investments we make, the price of Angel Token on the exchanges or for any other reason up until March 7th 2018.  Anyway, we will not dwell any more on this topic and just post some of our previous comments on this here below, but I think this question has been addressed enough times by now!     Quote from: LLec on November 19, 2017, 08:54:53 PM There has been several question on this now, and I want to comment on the issue of personally identifying the team members, and why we have chosen not to do this, or at least not at this stage.  1. First of all let's clarify that there have been many successful ICOs and projects launched with anonymous teams, so we are hardly breaking new ground here.  2. As we have said before, we would like our proposal to speak for itself, and we do not believe that revealing our identities would add any significant value to this proposal.  3. We believe that a person’s name guarantees nothing, (at least not unless it is a very well-known person within his field), and in the fast-changing and largely unregulated environment in which cryptocurrencies and assets currently exist we see few benefits for either the investors, or the founders, to fully divulge their identities.  You have full access to the team through various channels, including here and on Slack http://angelinvestors.io/slack. We only use our first names, but you can ask us anything you want, and we will do our best to answer you.  4. For those of you that have invested in other ICOs that pay dividends, (in Ether or otherwise), you should also consider the fact that anything centralized, (i.e. the people behind the ICO are easy to go after), is much more likely to be tied up in legal battles and/or have ""difficulties"" meeting old or new compliance regulations.  These legals situations may at times prove to be directly harmful and dangerous, not only to the founding team members, but also to the investors. They may also hinder the team from being able to always act in the best interest, (i.e. most profitable) for their token holders.  Various governments around the world use force and threat of violence (i.e. prison), often in an almost arbitrary manner. They go after certain companies and people, and sometimes imprison them to ""set an example"", even if there are no victims and no crime has taken place.  When you offer something like an ICO to an almost worldwide audience it is easy to fall foul of some regulation somewhere...  We are doing everything we can to avoid legal trouble of any sort, and to make sure that we don't breach any regulation that we are aware of. That includes not allowing investors from those countries that have made it clear that token sales and ICOs could be considered securities in their jurisdiction to take part in the ICO.  However, since new laws and regulations constantly come into place in various parts of the world we feel that staying at least ""semi-anonymous"" may give us (and all other Angel Token holders!) another small safeguard for the future.  If were to do anything truly criminal, like stealing the 20% of the funds we raise during the ICO as ""the newbie wodan11"" suggested above, our anonymity here certainly won't protect us from law enforcement. This is more about not making ourselves ""the easiest target in the forest""...  ICOs are generally risky, and this one is only slightly different.  Yes, we are an anonymous (or semi-anonymous) team, but we also offer the 80% Guaranteed Investor Protection through our immutable Ethereum smart contract.  This means that an investor basically remains ""in control"" over 80% of his/her's invested Ether until March 7th 2018, and 40% of the invested Ether until April 26th 2018.  At any point during the coming 5 months they can simply initiate an immediate and automatic refund of up to 80% of their investments by simply sending their tokens back to our smart contract from the same address they sent their intial Ether investment. We believe this offers more protection than almost all other recent ICOs, despite the fact that we are not completely open with our identities.  However, we do understand that some people may have wanted to take part in this ICO, but are concerned about our anonymity. We can fully appreciate any such caution and if that is how you feel, we are not trying and persuade to invest in this ICO.  What we suggest is this.  Read our white paper, review our smart contracts on Github and review the Initial Coin Offering as we have laid it out in the white paper and on our website.  If you believe that our goals are achievable and that we have set-out a sensible and rigorous structure, and that our smart contracts are secure and robust, then join us in our vision for the future of Angel Token and help us create it.  Our smart contract allows you to scrutinize our performance and ensures that you can always recover at any point (until March 7th 2018) 80% of your investment.  Reach out to us and get to know us over on Slack, or ask more questions here.  In the end, if you decide that this is not for you, we understand. Each one has their own criteria for risk and there are zero hard feelings from our side if you don't join us...we promise!  As a team we believe very much in ""if it's meant to be and we are good fit it will happen, and if not that's ok too"".  We don't try to hard-sell anything we do.  We's rather just point to the opportunity and honestly explain what we can do, and then let people decide if they think we are good fit for them or not.  If you do decide to invest, only invest as much as you can afford.  Yes, you have the 80% Guaranteed Investor Protection, but even so, always stay within your comfort limits when investing in ICOs.  For those of you that DO decide to join us, we very much look forward to seeing you on the inside!     Quote from: LLec on November 23, 2017, 05:31:59 AM Quote from: Kavallo on November 23, 2017, 01:23:20 AM But if early investors will have 690% ROI won't they just then dump their cheaply bought coins on the market to realize a 5X or 6X gain, thus tanking the price as usual?   Yes, it is quite likely that some early ICO investors will take advantage of the generous bonus structure for the early investors, purely to flip them for a quick 5x or 6x gain on the exchanges as you suggest.  However, what we don't think you will see is the price tanking as a result of this, (and even if it does we expect that to be short lived).  Let me explain why...  Every investor who decides to come on board and invest in this project during the ICO has a Guaranteed Investor Protection that makes it IMPOSSIBLE for them to lose more than 20% of their Ether investment before March 7th, 2018, because they can simply refund instead if they risked losing more from a lower exchange rate price.  Now let's assume a worst-case-scenario.  1. A large investor comes in early to take advantage of the generous bonus and gets a lot of extra bonus tokens. Immediately after the ICO is over he goes on to the exchanges and dumps his newly acquired Angel Tokens for a tidy profit of 500% or something similar.   2. As a result the price of Angel Tokens start to drop...let's assume it drops by 35%.   3. Now, as an ICO investor you know for a FACT that you can at any time, instantly and automatically, get 80% of the your Ether investment back by simply returning your tokens to our smart contract address until March 7th, 2018.   4. Would you rather return your tokens for a refund with a 20% loss or would you rather sell them on the exchange with a 35% loss?   We think the answer is obvious!     In this sort of situation it doesn't make ANY SENSE for ICO investors to sell their Angel Tokens on an exchange with a bigger loss than 20%, because they already HAVE that as a built in guarantee in the smart contract. A guarantee that they can execute it INSTANTLY and AUTOMATICALLY themselves, without asking anyone's approval or permission, or checking that there is enough funds in the Angel Token Central Bank.  80% of their Ether investment is secured in that smart contract, and they can view it themselves on the blockchain at any time to see it is still there, and they can get it back instantly at any point they so desire up until March 7th 2018.   So my point is this.   The ICO investors are already PROTECTED from any ""tanking"" of the price of more than 20%, so the only time it makes sense for ICO investors to sell their Angel Tokens on an exchange before March 7th, 2018 is to do so with a profit, not if the price ""tanks"" as you suggest.  We are also very interested in seeing how this kind of unique Guaranteed Investor Protection that we offer will affect the price on the exchanges, but we don't think it will have a negative impact...rather the opposite.    Quote from: d3vnull on November 23, 2017, 03:41:00 AM Quote If you succeed in hacking or breaking our smart contract you will be rewarded with up to 15 ETH, and we pay out for smaller bugs as well.  Do you also reward for any CVE regarding your web application / server... ?  As I understand, angelinvestors.io want to be anonymous regarding their dev/team... If I found breach that reveal the information of one or more of your team, do you pay for it too ?  Thanks,   Just a point on anonymity though, because I think you may have misunderstood what we mean with it.  We are not trying to ""hide"" from investors or the public at any cost!  We even use our first names when chatting with investors in Slack, on the website or in other places.  We are normal people and we have to provide various kinds of documents like everyone else when we trade on exchanges or open accounts in various places etc.  We are not criminals that are trying to hide from anyone...  That is NOT what our semi-anonymous ICO is all about.    I explained this in an earlier post that I will quote from here below a bit. Both our reasoning for this and what levels we go to.  There is a vast difference in trying to hide your identity at any cost from anyone, and flashing your name and credentials, business contacts, home address and other revealing information on a public ""Team Page"" for any lazy government investigator in any country to see.",False

We have posted a letter signed by the official auditor, Anthony Akentiev, that you can read as a PDF document here: http://angelinvestors.io/code-review      As you are probably aware, our smart contract code is open source and available for anyone to publicly view at our GitHub account: https://github.com/bitcoinfriends/angel-contracts  It was coded by one of the top solidity developers in the world, who just happens to be on our team.    Now it has also been tested hard in every way by a number of skilled programmers and Solidity developers who have tried to hack our smart contract in every way possible. This did expose a few relatively minor issues with the code that could be improved, and this has now been done.  Thereafter the code had been audited and thoroughly reviewed by Anthony Akentiev, a highly skilled independent 3rd party Russian Solidity developer who is in no way attached to us or our team.  At our request he has digitally signed the above letter (with his encrypted key) where he confirms that in his professional opinion investor funds are safe and secure.

And there can be some potential questionable situations - this 10k investors club, what kind of info about your plans will they possess? Also are you planning to stay on board of the assets you manage to revive or ""pumping"" as it was assumed above? Also do you have any view on technological aspects interesting for the market (like new DAGs etc.)? And finally do you have technical knowledge to introduce new features into old coins?

We would rather under-promise and over-deliver than the other way around, and that is part of why we are not promising any specific investment returns in the white paper.  In regards to our past trading history we have been extremely successful over the last two years, with a number of trades with more than a 1000% percent ROI.  However, we honestly don't think this says very much... Why? Because we all know that the cryptomarket has exploded over the last 2 years, and it has actually been pretty HARD to make bad medium to long-term trades!  This won't continue forever, (although it might for a while longer)...  We are not going to make any promises in regards to the returns Angel Token investors can expect, but let us share with you what we expect internally, within the team.  1. We expect that we will be able to deliver a 2x to 5x average return (Yes, a 200% to 500% return) within 3 to 6 months of investing in a typical small to medium size altcoin.   2. Please note that this is not always necessarily a ""liquid return"", (meaning that we have cashed out in ETH, BTC, BCH, DASH or Monero for example), but rather this is ""the expected rise in the Angel Token Portfolio value"" for the holding of that coin.  How much of that holding we will liquidate into ETH or BTC or another major currency depends on a lot of factors, including the market liquidity for that coin. However, our goal and intention is to liquidate enough to be able to pay a substantial dividend each quarter.   3. We are unlikely to deploy more than 20% to 25% of our available capital in any one coin at any one time, although long-term we expect to have at least 50% to 60% of the available funds deployed in various altcoins.   4. Therefore the expected return, (based purely on our own experience and really meant for internal use only), is that the total portfolio value will increase with 100% to 250% during an average 3 to 6 months investment cycle.   5. These expected gains are in relation to the value of Ethereum.  Of course in relation to fiat currencies, such as the dollar, the price of Ethereum might go up or down over time and this will have a big impact on the performance of the portfolio in relation to US dollar and other currencies.  Our long-term goal is substantial and continual growth of the Angel Token portfolio.  However, one of our internal goals inside the team is that all ICO investors should have received back MORE than their total Ether investment in the form of dividends as soon as possible after we have launched this ICO. It is therefore likely that we will be paying higher than average dividends during the first quarters, compared to long-term, assuming that the market liquidity and profitability of our trades is such that we can.   Please note that the above statements is purely us sharing our internal discussions and expectations about our expected returns.  Althought our internal discussion include predictions, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking, these are not be construed as ""promises"" or ""statements of factual expectations"" by any potential ICO investor. The Angel Token is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from what our internal expectations are. As a potential investor in this ICO you are hereby cautioned not to place much reliance on the above statements, which only reflect the opinions of our team members and based on current market sentiments. Although we will always attempt to keep Angel Token holders up to date we are not obligating ourselves to revise or publicly release any revision to the above statements and/or expectations in light of new information or future events or changes in the altcoin markets.

However, what we don't think you will see is the price tanking as a result of this, (and even if it does we expect that to be short lived).  Let me explain why...  Every investor who decides to come on board and invest in this project during the ICO has a Guaranteed Investor Protection that makes it IMPOSSIBLE for them to lose more than 20% of their Ether investment before March 7th, 2018, because they can simply refund instead if they risked losing more from a lower exchange rate price.  Now let's assume a worst-case-scenario.  1. A large investor comes in early to take advantage of the generous bonus and gets a lot of extra bonus tokens. Immediately after the ICO is over he goes on to the exchanges and dumps his newly acquired Angel Tokens for a tidy profit of 500% or something similar.   2. As a result the price of Angel Tokens start to drop...let's assume it drops by 35%.   3. Now, as an ICO investor you know for a FACT that you can at any time, instantly and automatically, get 80% of the your Ether investment back by simply returning your tokens to our smart contract address until March 7th, 2018.   4. Would you rather return your tokens for a refund with a 20% loss or would you rather sell them on the exchange with a 35% loss?   We think the answer is obvious!     In this sort of situation it doesn't make ANY SENSE for ICO investors to sell their Angel Tokens on an exchange with a bigger loss than 20%, because they already HAVE that as a built in guarantee in the smart contract. A guarantee that they can execute it INSTANTLY and AUTOMATICALLY themselves, without asking anyone's approval or permission, or checking that there is enough funds in the Angel Token Central Bank.  80% of their Ether investment is secured in that smart contract, and they can view it themselves on the blockchain at any time to see it is still there, and they can get it back instantly at any point they so desire up until March 7th 2018.   So my point is this.   The ICO investors are already PROTECTED from any ""tanking"" of the price of more than 20%, so the only time it makes sense for ICO investors to sell their Angel Tokens on an exchange before March 7th, 2018 is to do so with a profit, not if the price ""tanks"" as you suggest.  We are also very interested in seeing how this kind of unique Guaranteed Investor Protection that we offer will affect the price on the exchanges, but we don't think it will have a negative impact...rather the opposite.

If I found breach that reveal the information of one or more of your team, do you pay for it too ?  Thanks,   Both the Angel Token Official Code Audit and the Bug Hunt are nearing their conclusions, and no, the website was not included in the bug hunt.  However, if you think you have spotted some vulnerability or potential breach in our website that could be damaging to us in any way, please do reach out to us. If it is indeed something that concerns us and a valid issue we will make sure that you get some sort of reward.    Just a point on anonymity though, because I think you may have misunderstood what we mean with it.  We are not trying to ""hide"" from investors or the public at any cost!  We even use our first names when chatting with investors in Slack, on the website or in other places.  We are normal people and we have to provide various kinds of documents like everyone else when we trade on exchanges or open accounts in various places etc.  We are not criminals that are trying to hide from anyone...  That is NOT what our semi-anonymous ICO is all about.    I explained this in an earlier post that I will quote from here below a bit. Both our reasoning for this and what levels we go to.  There is a vast difference in trying to hide your identity at any cost from anyone, and flashing your name and credentials, business contacts, home address and other revealing information on a public ""Team Page"" for any lazy government investigator in any country to see.  As I said in an earlier post...  Quote from: LLec on November 19, 2017, 08:54:53 PM There has been several question on this now, and I want to comment on the issue of personally identifying the team members, and why we have chosen not to do this, or at least not at this stage.  1. First of all let's clarify that there have been many successful ICOs and projects launched with anonymous teams, so we are hardly breaking new ground here.  2. As we have said before, we would like our proposal to speak for itself, and we do not believe that revealing our identities would add any significant value to this proposal.  3. We believe that a person’s name guarantees nothing, (at least not unless it is a very well-known person within his field), and in the fast-changing and largely unregulated environment in which cryptocurrencies and assets currently exist we see few benefits for either the investors, or the founders, to fully divulge their identities.  You have full access to the team through various channels, including here and on Slack http://angelinvestors.io/slack. We only use our first names, but you can ask us anything you want, and we will do our best to answer you.  4. For those of you that have invested in other ICOs that pay dividends, (in Ether or otherwise), you should also consider the fact that anything centralized, (i.e. the people behind the ICO are easy to go after), is much more likely to be tied up in legal battles and/or have ""difficulties"" meeting old or new compliance regulations.  These legal situations may at times prove to be directly harmful and dangerous, not only to the founding team members, but also to the investors. They may also hinder the team from being able to always act in the best interest, (i.e. most profitable) for their token holders.  Various governments around the world use force and threat of violence (i.e. prison), often in an almost arbitrary manner. They go after certain companies and people, and sometimes imprison them to ""set an example"", even if there are no victims and no crime has taken place.  When you offer something like an ICO to an almost worldwide audience it is easy to fall foul of some regulation somewhere...  We are doing everything we can to avoid legal trouble of any sort, and to make sure that we don't breach any regulation that we are aware of. That includes not allowing investors from those countries that have made it clear that token sales and ICOs could be considered securities in their jurisdiction to take part in the ICO.  However, since new laws and regulations constantly come into place in various parts of the world we feel that staying at least ""semi-anonymous"" may give us (and all other Angel Token holders!) another small safeguard for the future.  If were to do anything truly criminal, like stealing the 20% of the funds we raise during the ICO as ""the newbie wodan11"" suggested above, our anonymity here certainly won't protect us from law enforcement.  This is more about not making ourselves ""the easiest target in the forest""...",False

You are saying that the blockchain technology is here to stay, and that the whole market is followed by pure speculations and other things, you are right with that, and i think that those are the most important facts about why the initial coin offerings have been so succesfull during the last few months.  I must ask to you, how much ethereum is the minimum contribution? i have read the first page, and the first replies of LLec and i have not seen the minimum contribution.  I have seen a lot of people complaining about the anonomity in this project, and i must say that i was a little bit concerned about the team, and their faces when i just saw this project. But just think about it, there have been a lot of projects who have been succesfull, and they did not even said who they were. Maybe a guy with 15 years old decide to create an innovative ico who raises more than 15 million dollars and starts a new era on the blockchain, but if you knew that he was 15 years old, would you invest in his project? i bet 100 dollars that you wouldn't. Maybe your anonimity is playing a big role in here, you are trying to be anon, and that is one of the main reasons of why bitcoin, altcoins, and so many other coins including the whole blockchain has been created, because we dont want to be exposed.  All those people who are complaining about it, is because they have some kind of stereotypes about ico's , and you are only following the facts of other people.  When i first saw this coin, i thought that i was a joke, i dont know why did i, but then i started to read the ANN thread and i knew that it was not a joke, maybe it is one of the most organized ico's that i have ever seen, because you have the full team here answering, and you seem to be very proffesional by the way that you are answering questions and paying a lot of attention to the whole community. And it really seems that you are investing a lot of money and effort in order to create a big marketing campaign (and that is the first thing that someone sees before investing into a project)  Plus, you are only taking 8 millions of angel coins from the total supply, and that is a good thing because you are not taking the full control of the market. It is a big amount of money if your project has a succesfull ico, but you dont have the rights to fuck off the whole price by dumping those coins, i have seen projects who are claiming more than 20% of the total supply in order to fullfill their pockets and be able to pump/dump the price of his altcoin as much as they want to.  If there are any details about in which exchanges are you going to list this coin, then i would glad to hear about your proposals (anyway, if it is a succesfull project, then it will be listed in every exchange that you really want to, so it is not a problem at all)  I am going to be paying a lot of attention to this project, i am gonna be one of your early investors because you guys, really convinced me about this project.

First of all let's clarify that there have been many successful ICOs and projects launched with anonymous teams, so we are hardly breaking new ground here.  2. As we have said before, we would like our proposal to speak for itself, and we do not believe that revealing our identities would add any significant value to this proposal.  3. We believe that a person’s name guarantees nothing, (at least not unless it is a very well-known person within his field), and in the fast-changing and largely unregulated environment in which cryptocurrencies and assets currently exist we see few benefits for either the investors, or the founders, to fully divulge their identities.  You have full access to the team through various channels, including here and on Slack http://angelinvestors.io/slack. We only use our first names, but you can ask us anything you want, and we will do our best to answer you.  4. For those of you that have invested in other ICOs that pay dividends, (in Ether or otherwise), you should also consider the fact that anything centralized, (i.e. the people behind the ICO are easy to go after), is much more likely to be tied up in legal battles and/or have ""difficulties"" meeting old or new compliance regulations.  These legals situations may at times prove to be directly harmful and dangerous, not only to the founding team members, but also to the investors. They may also hinder the team from being able to always act in the best interest, (i.e. most profitable) for their token holders.  Various governments around the world use force and threat of violence (i.e. prison), often in an almost arbitrary manner. They go after certain companies and people, and sometimes imprison them to ""set an example"", even if there are no victims and no crime has taken place.  When you offer something like an ICO to an almost worldwide audience it is easy to fall foul of some regulation somewhere...  We are doing everything we can to avoid legal trouble of any sort, and to make sure that we don't breach any regulation that we are aware of. That includes not allowing investors from those countries that have made it clear that token sales and ICOs could be considered securities in their jurisdiction to take part in the ICO.  However, since new laws and regulations constantly come into place in various parts of the world we feel that staying at least ""semi-anonymous"" may give us (and all other Angel Token holders!) another small safeguard for the future.  If were to do anything truly criminal, like stealing the 20% of the funds we raise during the ICO as ""the newbie wodan11"" suggested above, our anonymity here certainly won't protect us from law enforcement. This is more about not making ourselves ""the easiest target in the forest""...  ICOs are generally risky, and this one is only slightly different.  Yes, we are an anonymous (or semi-anonymous) team, but we also offer the 80% Guaranteed Investor Protection through our immutable Ethereum smart contract.  This means that an investor basically remains ""in control"" over 80% of his/her's invested Ether until March 7th 2018, and 40% of the invested Ether until April 26th 2018.  At any point during the coming 5 months they can simply initiate an immediate and automatic refund of up to 80% of their investments by simply sending their tokens back to our smart contract from the same address they sent their intial Ether investment. We believe this offers more protection than almost all other recent ICOs, despite the fact that we are not completely open with our identities.  However, we do understand that some people may have wanted to take part in this ICO, but are concerned about our anonymity. We can fully appreciate any such caution and if that is how you feel, we are not trying and persuade to invest in this ICO.  What we suggest is this.  Read our white paper, review our smart contracts on Github and review the Initial Coin Offering as we have laid it out in the white paper and on our website.  If you believe that our goals are achievable and that we have set-out a sensible and rigorous structure, and that our smart contracts are secure and robust, then join us in our vision for the future of Angel Token and help us create it.  Our smart contract allows you to scrutinize our performance and ensures that you can always recover at any point (until March 7th 2018) 80% of your investment.  Reach out to us and get to know us over on Slack, or ask more questions here.  In the end, if you decide that this is not for you, we understand. Each one has their own criteria for risk and there are zero hard feelings from our side if you don't join us...we promise!  As a team we believe very much in ""if it's meant to be and we are good fit it will happen, and if not that's ok too"".  We don't try to hard-sell anything we do.  We's rather just point to the opportunity and honestly explain what we can do, and then let people decide if they think we are good fit for them or not.  If you do decide to invest, only invest as much as you can afford.  Yes, you have the 80% Guaranteed Investor Protection, but even so, always stay within your comfort limits when investing in ICOs.  For those of you that DO decide to join us, we very much look forward to seeing you on the inside!",False

If we only raise 5% or 10% then that's what we will run with.  It is important that you understand that we are already operating this type of trading profitably by ourselves, without any external investors.  The idea behind this ICO is to be able to ""take things to the next level"", and the more we raise the higher that level will be.   Let me give you a couple of examples.   1. The more trading capital you have the more you are able to ""control the exchange market"" in a smaller size coin.  When you hold a substantial stake in a fairly low volume coin and you also have a large amount of capital available, you have a lot of ""power"" in the market. This is especially true when you are in direct contact with other major stakeholders in this coin...  The more Ethereum we raise the larger size coins we will be able to ""work with"" from this point of view.   2. In the past we have more or less acted as passive investors in the positions we have taken.  The more Ethereum we raise during the ICO the more resources we will be able to commit towards actually working with the founders and communities of the coins we invest in to improve them. Let's consider this ""the Angel Investor"" part of the operation.  With only a small amount of Ethereum raise this part of the operation will be more limited, and we will have to choose our investments more carefully to make sure that we can actually provide the resources they need to succeed in the marketplace.   3. The fewer investors we have the less ""community power"" we will have.  What I mean here is that we strongly believe in the idea that ""more brains are better than a few"" when it comes to certain types of jobs.    We have a very clear plan for how we want to ""use"" the community for everyone's benefit, but with each person only needing to take on what we refer to as ""micro tasks"". This relates both to investment research before we make investments, and also later on, creating awareness and helping our investments reach a larger market share.  This is what we refer to as ""Investment Crowd Intelligence"" in the white paper.  Apart from this we also believe that the more active investors we have bringing forward potential investments and ideas the better it will be for us all as all.  ",False

THIS PROJECT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HYIP OR MLM, PYRAMID SCHEMES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT!  In fact our ICO is the OPPOSITE of what all of those things are and stand for.  We are using safe, prudent, tested investment strategies and only invest in existing altcoins tha are already listed on coinmarketcap.com and various exchanges.  We are the opposite of HYIP and act more like an investment fund that diversifies risk across a number of altcoins.   The big difference between Angel Token and most other crypt funds are the following:  1. We are not passive investors. We are active ""Angel Investors"" (hence the name ""Angel Token"").  When we invest in an altcoin we also help them grow and become more successful in various ways, thanks to our skilled team of programmers, web developers, marketers and designers.  2. We pay dividends in Ether each quarter we have reached a new high watermark in the value of the Angel Token portfolio.  Most crypto funds have chosen to do ""token buy backs"" instead of paying real dividends. The assumption with these strategies is that as  the supply goes down when the fund buys tokens back the price of their token will go up.  This is a technique that is also used by some very large companies around the world, but it is a far less certain way to give value back to token holders than to pay them a direct and guaranteed dividend paid in Ethereum each quarter.  As investors we have never been a fan of share buy-backs so when we decided to launch a token we didn't want to use that method for our token either.  From an investor point of view we are very safe and prudent, and even our ""Guaranteed Investor Protection"" follows the same principle, making it impossible for any investor to lose more than 20% of the Ether they invest before March 7th 2018.  The only thing that could possibly be interpreted as ""hypie"" and that you are also referring to is our bonus structure.  What you have to understand is this.  The bonus structure offering a 690% bonus to the investors that manage to buy the first million Angel Tokens during the ICO is simply a way for us to reward the early risk takers and investors that come in early.  If you have seen ICOs in the past you will have noticed that most of them have a huge influx of funds on the first day when the bonus is high, and then everything stands still until the last day or two of the ICO when another huge rush of funds come in.  Our bonus structure is a simply a new way to counter that.  What we are doing is this. We are telling investors:  ""Sure you can ""wait and see"", like so many ICO Investors like to do, but for every million tokens sold the bonus goes down and you lose some benefit you would have had by investing early.""  It is simply a way to make it more fair and honest for those that commit early and say: ""Yeah I want to be part of this token!"" and send their Ether as soon as the ICO opens.  They deserve that reward, and the longer you wait the less your reward will be.  I hope that clarifies things a bit? ",False

No, 1 ETH buys exactly 10,000 Angel Tokens during the 690% bonus period, so there will be no need to ""buy any extra tokens"" in order to be part of the private community and get dividends.  The 690% bonus period lasts until the first 1 million tokens have been distributed to ICO Investors, and if you are among the investors grabbing those then 1 ETH is all it takes to ""get you a seat at the table"" in the private investment community.  You can find the exact amount of tokens per Ether and the bonus percentages etc inside the white paper.  2. That URL was a mistake and I appreciate you  pointing it out. I would also appreciate if you could edit and remove that quote from your question so no one goes to the wrong website and finds the wrong Ethereum address there...  The ONLY domain name that will be used during the ICO is https://angelinvestors.io/ and that is also where the correct Ethereum address where to send Ether to will be displayed.  The second link to https://angelinvestors.io/invest/ has some videos and more information on how to get Ether and wallets etc.  3. The ICO launch time is November 27th at 12:00 GMT as stated on the website. We are indeed launching at ""lunchtime"" rather than midnight.  Sorry about the confusion regarding the URL, and thanks again for pointing that out.  In regards to ""the missing token"" in the bonus graphic (that adds up to 9999 for 1 ETH instead of 10,000), this is simply due to a rounding error that we missed. The smart contract uses exact numbers so it will not affect that.  You have a good eye for detail and I really hope we get a chance to welcome you on board as on of the investors in the Angel Token ICO. I am sure you will be a great asset in the private investment community.  ",False

We have the final say in the investments that are made, but it is very much a collaborative approach.  What I mean by this is that we strongly believe in the idea that ""more brains are better than a few"" when it comes to certain types of jobs.   We have a very clear plan for how we want to ""use"" the community for everyone's benefit, but with each person only needing to take on what we refer to as ""micro tasks"".  This relates both to investment research before we make investments, and also later on, creating awareness and helping our investments reach a larger market share.  This is what we refer to as ""Investment Crowd Intelligence"" in the white paper.  This also involves the community voting on potential investments and potentially individual members/investors putting forward their own research and opinions on a particular coin.  We believe that the more active investors we have that are bringing forward potentially good investments, the better it will be for us all as all.  After all, we are only a small team and for sure we will miss many opportunities by ourselves.  As an example, there are currently around 1300 coins and tokens on coinmarketcap.com, and we know for a fact that there are many coins and projects that are massively undervalued that are currently not yet on our ""radar"".  It takes a lot of time and work to stay up to date with developments and new coins on the market, and having a group of investors who are willing to do small ""micro tasks"" and collaborate with our researchers will be hugely beneficial for everyone.  We have system that we have been using for discovering undervalued coins, but it requires a lot of manual research into each coin.  We will have a dedicated team working on investment research, but we believe that the combination of our expert team and the investor community will be incredibly successful and profitable for everyone involved, especially when used in combination with our marketing and development team.",False

It seem like my other team members have missed your question, so let me answer it.  You are correct that 80% of investor funds are indeed locked up in the Ethereum Smart Contract during 100 days, (and 40% for a further 50 days), and the funds are NOT available for us to trade with during that time.  We looked at what we have accomplished in our altcoin trading on our own over the last year, as well as how other big ICOs have handled the Ethereum or other crypto funds trusted to them from the investors.  In terms of most ICO projects they don't really NEED all the funds they raise immediately and up-front. Many of the teams just sit on their funds for long periods of time, or turn it into fiat that also just sits in their accounts.  This approach does nothing good for the investor. He believes in the project and wanted to invest, but he no longer has access to his funds and the team is not actively using it to built or create the thing he decided to invest in.  It's really a kind of ""capital destruction"".  Because funds, (whether crypto or fiat), should be invested or used to create wealth...not just sit around waiting for some day 2 or 3 years down the line when the team is running low on money!  So we figured that why not give the investors the opportunity to ""change their mind"" on the project, if they are not happy with the performance of the team, or even the token exchange price after the ICO.  As a team we are quite confident that we will blow everyone's expectations away in regards to giving investors a huge and early return on investment (ROI).  So we think it's in everyone's interest that investors get the chance to evaluate us for the first few months, and we are as comfortable proving ourselves with 20% of the total capital as we are with 100%.  In the meantime the investors in essence remain in control over 80% of their invested capital, giving them maximum flexibility.  ",False

Our profits per trade range from -20% to +1700%. I am not sure what the average is, but we have done very well.  However, it is important to note that in the past we have acted as ""normal traders"" and we have not really been using capital to push prices, put up buy walls or any of the other things that are possible with a larger capital.  We have also not been working together with the small to medium size cryptos that we have invested in, which is the major difference, because this is what Angel Token will be doing.

We are looking to invest in promising cryptocurrencies and crypto assets that are currently undervalued, and help them grow and improve in every sense.  Part of that may involve setting up “buy walls” and other things that you have seen pump groups do, but our main focus will be on improving the coin/asset/offering and bringing it to the attention of a wider market.  That is how you get real long-term growth in a coin.  There is a good example of this in our white paper, of the coin that used to be called “DogeCoinDark” (DOGED) and was re-branded to “Verge” (XVG). You have probably heard about it?  Their team made a lot of great of improvements such as as bringing in multi-algorithmic mining, TOR-I2P to enhance privacy features etc.  The point is this though.  The combination of an active development team, new and improved features, new branding/website and successful social media competitions etc. helped revive the community interest in this coin.  Verge went from a trading volume of less than $100,000/day and a market cap of around $1 million in early May 2017 to a trading volume of at least a couple of million dollars per day, and a current market cap of almost $90 million now.  That is a 90x return on investment, meaning if you invested $1000 you in May of this year, now in November six months later you would have around $90,000.  If you are following the altcoin market I am sure you have seen this before with many other coins.  Maybe not 90x but small to medium size coins that just get a new website and/or a wallet and improves functionality can often immediately gain 100s of percentage points in a very short time.  Our investment strategy is to make long-term improvements to small and medium size coins that will not only improve their functionality, but also make them more popular with both users and investors.  When you have a decent/good starting point, but a developer/founder who has lost a bit of interest or direction, and you come in with a new strong development team with proper funding and a community to help drive market adoption, you can make wonders in terms of price and market capitalization.

I like the idea of Angel Token because they are going to help those coins to show their potential. Aside from that, the Angel Investors have the right to vote on which coin to support and pump.

Click here to play the youtube video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHYU1ASpHYM      Why invest in Angel Token?  There are many reasons. It is important that you read our white paper before considering an investment. In summary though, we think you should invest as it will give you some exciting benefits.  Here are a few points to consider.   THE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY AND THE POTENTIAL OF HUGE RETURNS  We will build a substantial portfolio of investments in cryptocurrencies/assets by our experts working together with the Angel Token Investment Community to identify cryptocurrencies/assets that have great potential but may not be as widely recognized as they should be.  The Angel Foundation Team of designers, web developers, programmers and online marketers will work together with the community and stakeholders in these cryptocurrency/assets to enhance their branding, offer, public awareness, website, wallet, offer technical expertise etc. in return for a holding in these cryptocurrencies/assets.   THE VALUE OF BEING PART OF THE ANGEL TOKEN COMMUNITY  The essence of Angel Token is its community spirit. Investing in cryptocurrencies and ICO's and making good investment returns is challenging.  We are offering a chance to collaborate with other people with similar interest, all working towards the same goal of identifying and evaluating undervalued crypto assets. Our expert team and our investment community can then work together with the founders and community of those crypto assets we identify, to enhance their value in the marketplace.  Together we get to benefit from everyone's joint investment expertise, as well as the power of combined capital, in sometimes thinly traded assets, working together to maximise profits for all community members.   THE FIRST ICO WITH GUARANTEED INVESTOR PROTECTION  You can invest in the Angel Token ICO knowing that there is an immutable Ethereum Smart Contract protecting the bulk of your Ethereum investment.  During the first 5 months you can be involved in the community and talk to the Founders, and see the initial investments and trades being made with the Ethereum raised, as well as benefit from any potential price increases of Angel Token as it gets listed on the exchanges.  If, for any reason during the first 5 months, you wish to no longer be involved, then as an ICO investor you can return your tokens. You will receive back up to 80% of the invested Ether amount, (80% during the first 100 days and 40% during the next 50 days).  These refunds are immediate and automatically handled by our immutable smart contract.  So as an Angel Token ICO investor there is very little downside risk, and a huge potential upside. This is especially true for the earliest investors, due to our generous bonus structure offering up to 690% extra bonus tokens to early investors.   HOW THE FUNDS RAISED DURING THE ICO WILL BE USED - THE MAIN PURPOSE OF ANGEL TOKEN  The Ether raised during the Angel Token ICO will be used to invest in, and assist, undervalued small to medium size cryptocurrencies reach their potential in terms of users, awareness and market capitalization.  It is our aim to continually grow the Angel Token crypto investment portfolio in value, and to make regular dividend payments in Ethereum to all Angel Token investors holding 10,000 tokens or more. (This limit is due to transactional costs.)  We make no specific promises either as to the amount of expected growth of our investment portfolio or dividend payments. However, our aim is to distribute up to a maximum of 25% of our portfolio growth each quarter that we reach a new ""portfolio high watermark"".   VALUEABLE ANGEL TOKEN INVESTMENT RESEARCH (FOR FREE!)  Angel Token investors holding more than 10,000 tokens will have direct access to the Angel Token Research Team through our private investor community. Our research team is using the latest techniques and tools, as well as good basic investment principles, to propose to the community and help decide what cryptocurrencies are undervalued, and worth investing in.  You, as an investor, will not only have access to our research team and our altcoin research, but you will also be able to propose Angel Token investments backed by your own research.  Our aim is for the Angel Token Investment Community to function like an ""Investment Club"" where all members can help and influence the Angel Token portfolio, and where we all work together towards the same goal.   OUR UNIQUE INVESTMENT APPROACH  Angel Token will always look for new investment opportunities and undervalued crypto assets with potential for growth. However, we feel that the best way to drive growth is to create value. To this end we are going to use our skilled team of designers, web developers, programmers and marketers to help improve the functionality, user growth, visibility and marketing of some of the cryptocurrencies that we are looking to invest in.  In the highly volatile crypto market sometimes relatively simple things that can easily be fixed or improved can result in extraordinary gains in market capitalization, especially when combined with the social media influence and investment power from a large and growing community.      You no longer have to sit on the sidelines waiting and hoping that the cryptocurrency, and the team behind it, will create the value you were hoping for.  You become an integral and important part of the process of not only finding, but also creating these opportunities.  Because we believe that the best way to drive growth is to 'create' value.    We are creating a private community of like-minded investors. The community will be working together with our expert team towards the same goal, to identify and evaluate undervalued small to medium size cryptocurrencies and crypto assets.  Our expert team and our investment community can then work together with the founders and community of those cryptocurrencies/assets that we identify, to enhance their value in the marketplace.  When you invest in Angel Token you are no longer just a passive investor. You become a true 'Angel Investor'.    Partial Road Map for Angel Token  Visit the website for the full roadmap - www.AngelInvestors.io       THE MOST GENEROUS ICO BONUS STRUCTURE OF 2017?   The longer Angel Token investors wait before investing during the ICO period, the more bonus tokens they will lose out on.  If an investors were to wait until the ICO is over and buy Angel Tokens on an exchange instead, he or she would not receive ANY bonus tokens at all.  Compare that with being an early investor who buys some of the first million Angel Tokens when the ICO first starts, and receives 690% extra bonus tokens and it quickly becomes apparent why many consider this to be the most generous ICO of 2017.",False

There are 2 ways that we think that you could make money.  1) Make sure you are one of the earliest investors when the ICO goes live on November 27th.  Then, soon after the ICO has finished and there is a secondary market in Angel Token, you sell your tokens with a profit.  This type of short-term speculation in ICOs is normally risky.  However, since no investor can ever lose more than 20% of their initial Ethereum investment during the first 100 days there is very little downside and unlimited upside in this ICO, especially if you get in early and manage to bag a lot of bonus tokens.   2) A more profitable strategy would likely be to buy early in the ICO, and then hold your Tokens.  Be involved in our investment process.  Help identify and evaluate the future investments of Angel Token.  See us improve the values of other small to medium size coins through our own development and marketing skills, and with the help of the community.  In this way you will see the value of the Angel Token portfolio grow and not only make a profit, but also feel connected to the market and our community. Assuming you hold more than 10,000 Angel Tokens you will also be eligble for the quarterly dividend payments in Ether.    QUESTION: Who decides what coins or crypto projects Angel Token will invest in and work to improve?   The best thing about Angel Token is the investment community that you get to be part of.  All token holders with 10,000 or more Angel Tokens will be encouraged to become part of the private exclusive investment club. Here we will discuss investment ideas and show, privately, our detailed investment research into various altcoins.  All members of the private investment community can propose cryptocurrencies or assets that they believe Angel Token should invest in, and back it up with their own research and thoughts on those assets.  Only when we have heard the recommendations and arguments from our investment community, voted on them, and thoroughly vetted the top choices will we decide to invest. We will have the final say but it is very much a collaborative approach.    QUESTION: How do I participate on the ICO? Do I just send ETH to the ICO address?   Yes, that is all that is needed to participate and our smart contract will immediately and automatically mint your tokens, (together with your bonus tokens, depending on how early you are compared to other investors), and send them back to the same address you sent your Ether investment from.   However, we recommend you do things in this order:  1. Read the Whitepaper.   2. Think clearly and carefully whether you want to invest and how much Ether you are willing to commit.  Remember that you can always claim an 80% refund on anything you invest in the ICO during the first 100 days, and a 40% refund from day 101 to day 150, (the first 5 months).   3. If you decide you want to invest but are not quite sure how then visit https://angelinvestors.io/invest/ and watch the videos there.   Alternatively, simply send Ether to the Angel Token ICO smart contract address at the top of this page https://angelinvestors.io/ (note that the address will only be displayed after 12:00 GMT on November 27th, 2017), from an Ethereum based ERC20 compatible wallet that you control the private keys to, (we recommend you use https://www.myetherwallet.com/), and your tokens will be immediately and automatically minted and sent to your wallet.   DO NOT SEND ANY FUNDS FROM AN ONLINE EXCHANGE TO OUR ICO ADDRESS!    QUESTION: Your ""Private Investment Club"" sounds a bit like a ""pump and dump"" community, is it?   Not really.  Although it is true that we will be able to ""move market prices"" and substantially increase the market capitalization of many of the small to medium size altcoins that we will be investing and trading in, we are mostly in this for the longer term growth potential of such coins.  We are looking to invest in promising cryptocurrencies and assets that are currently undervalued, and where we can help them grow and improve in every sense. Part of that may involve setting up ""buy walls"" and moving the price upward (and similar ""pump tactics""), but mainly we will focus on improving the coin/asset/offering and bringing it to the attention of a wider market to see real long-term growth.   QUESTION: Is Angel Token some sort of investment fund then?   Yes, that is a more accurate description.  The ETH raised during the Angel Token ICO will be used to invest in, and assist, undervalued small to medium size cryptocurrencies reach their potential in terms of users, awareness and market capitalization, through a well-managed and structured investment fund.  However, one of our main differences from some of the other cryptocurrency investment funds out there is that we are generally not planning to be ""passive investors"".  When we have identified a coin or crypto asset that we want to invest in we will approach the founders, major stakeholders and community, and offer to work with them to improve their coin, using our money, developers and marketers.    QUESTION: Why should I invest in the ICO when I can wait and see if and how it’s going to perform when listed on an exchange?   There are two main reasons why the ICO is likely to be a much better, and safer, investment.   1. We have one of the most generous bonus structures for early investors that we have seen in the entire history of ICOs.   The longer you wait to invest during the ICO period, the more bonus tokens you will lose out on.  If you wait until the ICO is over and buy Angel Tokens on an exchange, you will not receive any bonus tokens at all. Compare that with being an early investor who buys some of the first million Angel Tokens when the ICO first starts, and receives 690% extra bonus tokens!    2. As an ICO investor your Ether investment is protected.  It is impossible for any Angel Token ICO investor to lose more than a maximum of 20% of their Ether investment before March 7th, 2018, regardless of what happens to the price of Angel Tokens on the exchanges.  Since 80% of your Ether funds are secured in our ""Angel Token Central Bank Vault"" trough our Ethereum immutable smart contract, (which is being audited and verified by the team from solidified.io and others, and you can review the source code for this yourself as well), you can simply return your tokens at any point up until March 7th 2018 and get an immediate 80% refund.  So as an ICO investor you have unlimited upside potential, with a maximum 20% downside risk to your investment, (or 60% risk if you wait the full 5 months/150 days before requesting a refund).  People who invest on the exchanges are subject to the normal volatility and market fluctuations and have no such ""safety guarantees"" for their investment.  ",False

Although there is no minimum it is important to note that in order to become a part of the ""Private Angel Token Investment Community"", which is where we will openly share and discuss our altcoin investment research, and Angel Token holders get to have their say and vote on the investments we make, you need to own a minimum of 10,000 Angel Tokens.  The same holds true in order to take part in dividend payments that are made in Ether each succesful quarter, you need to own a minimum of 10,000 Angel Tokens.  The price of Angel Tokens are 1 Ether per 1265 tokens, so normally you would need to invest 7.9 Ether to become a member of the ""Private Investment Community"" and the quarterly dividend payments.  However, due to the incredible bonus structure incorporated in this ICO you COULD actually acquire 10,000 Angel Tokens for as little as 1 Ether, but you will probably need to invest immediately after the ICO launch on November 27th at 12:00 GMT, because we expect that the tokens will be sold quickly in the beginning as everyone wants to catch the best bonus.  For each 1 million tokens sold the bonus drops...but you COULD get 10,000 Angel Tokens for as little as 1 Ether, (and get 8735 bonus tokens!), if you are early enough, and some investors will grab those big bonuses!

Quote from: masterpi33 on November 11, 2017, 03:38:32 AM Where is information about your team?  The team behind Angel Token has decided to stay anonymous for this ICO.  We would like our proposal to speak for itself, and we do not believe that revealing our identities would add any significant value to this proposal.  We believe that a person’s name guarantees nothing, and in the fast-changing and largely unregulated environment in which crypto assets currently exist we see few benefits for either the investors or the founders to fully divulge their identities.  This is also one of the reasons why we have introduced our Guaranteed Investor Protection through our immutable Ethereum smart contract.  ICOs are generally risky, and there is nothing worse than losing your hard-earned Ethereum.  That is why, as an Angel Token ICO investor your Ether investment is largely protected.  It is impossible for any Angel Token ICO investor to lose more than a maximum of 20% of their Ether investment before March 7th, 2018, regardless of what happens to the price of Angel Tokens on the exchanges.  What we suggest is this.  Read our White Paper, review our smart contracts and the Initial Coin Offering as we have laid it out on our website.  If you believe that our goals are achievable and that we have set-out a sensible and rigorous structure, and that our smart contracts are secure and robust, then join us in our vision for the future of Angel Token and help us create it.  Our smart contract allows you to scrutinize our performance and ensure that you can always recover at any point (until March 7th 2018) 80% of your investment.  However, we do understand that some potential investors may have wanted to participate in this ICO, but are concerned about our anonymity.  We can fully appreciate any such sensible caution and we would do nothing to try and persuade such a person to invest in this ICO.",False

Yes, we will have a very cool and well paying bounty program, but it has not gone live yet, hopefully no later than next week on Tuesday Nov 13th.  It will not be a ""traditional"" program where the only thing cared about is how many useless promo tweets you do to X,XXX number of useless followers...  We will ask for different things, and reward people that actually bring results much more, and those that do not will get nothing or very little.  So instead of just posting our link on your dead Facebook account for example, we will instead ask you to take part in discussion in relevant Facebook groups and mention our project in those places, but without spamming...  Same thing with Twitter. Instead of tweeting to 1000 dead followers you can take an active role and tweet comments in an active ICO discussions that mention our ICO, (assuming it fits in the discussion of course!). Same with YouTube comments and Reddit and on high traffic crypto blogs etc. Of course if you have high quality accounts with active followers that is a different story, but we would need to see that first, and we will reward you accordingly...  Basically we will be looking for ""high quality people"" who are able to make ""high quality posts"" in various places about our ICO. If you fit that criteria or not, I dont know, but feel free to pm me at this account ""AngelSupport"" and let me know what you can do for us and how you can help us promote our project.  Yes, we are certainly interested in a Spanish translation, but we are looking for more from our translation partners though...  We would like you to include information such as if you can post a translated version of our project here on Bitcointalk in the Spanish section of the forum for example? Perhaps you know of Spanish crypto forums or Facebook groups that you may be able to post in, and the same with Twitter or other crypto marketing avenues.  We would prefer our translators to provide more of a ""full service solution"" where you become our ""Local Language Spokesperson"" (in Spanish or whatever language it is), and you then promote our project on relevant Spanish websites, forums, groups etc. as well. Perhaps you also write or translate a few good articles about our project and get them spread out anywhere that Spanish crypto enthusiasts hang out.  If you are reading this and it sounds like something that would be of interest to you, please send me a proposal via PM and include a cost estimate as well as a DETAILED description of exactly what you can do in your language to promote us, and we will have a look at it and let you know if we are interested.

It was the same with Cryptoping (and I think they raised at least $2 million with an anonymous team) and there are many other anonymous projects out there as well.
