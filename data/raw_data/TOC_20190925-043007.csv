We design, build and host a wide variety of financial DApps. From simple token trading DApps to complex applications.  WHY INVEST IN TOKEN CHANGER?   [1] Token Changer is not a whitepaper ICO, our platform is ninety percent complete and we have DApps running on the ethereum mainnet and testnets.  [2] Token Changer uses revenue to buy back its token from the market. This token buy back scheme achieves two objectives. One, the purchased tokens funds our customer loyalty program in the long term. Two, the buy back returns value to token holders.  [3] The Apple App store is a destination for mobile apps. Amazon and Alibaba are e-commerce destinations on the web. Token Changerâ€™s strategic intent is to become a one stop shop for distributed financial applications (DApps).  [4] Token Changer DApps have a point and click interface. Processing steps for transactions are also kept to a minimum making transactions fast and stress free.  [5] Within 90 days after our ICO, we are going to start launching DApps for minting, trading and transferring stable tokens (usd, euro, yen etc). These DApps are the implementation of what we call the convergence of money. The convergence of money represents a very big market opportunity and we have a five year plan to take advantage of our first mover position.    [6] Token Changer is not a typical ICO marketing a team and ideas. We have a proven team currently working on our launch DApps even before the ICO (stable token).  PLATFORM FEATURES  [1] Web browser interface for DApps [2] No login required [3] Secure and trustless blockchain software at the back-end [4] Multiple blockchains supported  ROADMAP   FINANCIAL STRUCTURE   TOKEN CHANGER TEAM (LINKEDIN)  Alexis Bizalion: co-founder George Ezechukwu : co-founder Luke Sherwood: community manager Mike Maurer: customer experience manager Rob Moya: front-end engineer Simon Cocking: adviser Hans Koning: adviser Alex Rutledge: adviser  MORE PROJECT CONTENT   - Token Changer ICO Paper  - Token Changer White Paper  - The Convergence of Money  - Minting Synthetic Tokens on the Blockchain for Profit",False

Tried to find the idea of the project. It was written that 90 percent is over. But, in white paper very little specifics. A lot of thoughts of universal scale. I would like to see something that is not in other projects. Like, and the team is cool and all that sort of thing. It seems to me that white paper is overloaded with unnecessary information, why do so many sheets write about the problems of crypto currency? We all know this. Every time you start reading about the project, everyone writes that all projects are shit, and ours is the best. After a few sheets, you lose the thought. In the preface it is necessary to write about the essence of the project, briefly and concretely, then investors will have an interest.",False

(1) Dollar Token Minting DApp (2) ETH/USD Trading DApp  What these two dapps will do, is to enable the trading of ETH/USD trading pair on the ethereum blockchain. This capability currently does not exist. Lets's look at some numbers.  The ETH/USD pair according to coinmarketcap has a daily trading volume of over $3bn. If we assume that 1% to 10% of this trade comes home (to the ethereum blockchain), we are looking at a daily turnover of between $3 to $30 million USD.  The way our customer loyalty program works is that users get a chuck of our commission. At 0.15% flat rate, the commission revenue for this particular dapp is estimated to be between $4,500 to $45,000 daily.  Here is a link to our green paper https://medium.com/tokenchanger/papers/home for minting stable tokens on the blockchain.",False

Our intent is to get to $1 within 24 months. We have to focus on execution and that should reflect on market price and ranking on coinmarketcap.  Right now we are not so much worried about competition since the market is so big (global financial services and products). ETH/USD is important, but it is just one of many. If we focus of speedy execution, we should be okay.",False
