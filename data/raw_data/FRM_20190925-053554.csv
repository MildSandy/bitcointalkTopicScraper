Firmo is building the future of financial infrastructure. 1/7 of the world's economy is derivatives, but these financial contracts are not securely available in the crypto economy yet. FirmoLang enables businesses, like exchanges, to securely and intuitively offer smart derivatives on any major blockchain. Firmo already compiles to Ethereum and is now researching implementations on other major blockchains like Neo, Cardano and Qtum. This is just the first step in overhauling today’s financial infrastructure.    What is FirmoLang?  FirmoLang is our formally verified, domain-specific language which can compile to any blockchain. FirmoLang offers the same level of security used to make sure planes, trains, and satellites operate securely.  Secure  Although it's theoretically possible to write a derivative on the blockchain, there are serious security vulnerabilities holding the industry back. 45% of smart contracts written on Ethereum could be hacked. Examples include the DAO and Parity Wallet. Large financial institutions won't chose the blockchain over existing infrastructure if half of the transactions made could be at risk.  Intuitive  More than that, FirmoLang is intuitive for any developer to use. It takes just 12 lines of code to execute a smart contract compared to Ethereum's Solidity, which can take 90 or more.  Blockchain agnostic  Firmo's vision is to work on any major blockchain. Our compiler already works with Ethereum and we are exploring partnerships with other major blockchains.
