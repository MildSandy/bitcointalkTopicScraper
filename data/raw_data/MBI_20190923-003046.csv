The only way you can buy MBI is currently through the Waves DEX (and eventually through PotEx.io once it launches). Our ICO ended nearly a year ago, and the ownership / partner tokens are not for sale on the open market, so if you buy on the open market, you are buying from someone that is selling.  Next, no, it won't primarily be for MBI tokens; there is a lot of detail in the Medium post above. But the general overview is that we are planning on targetting both large coins, and smaller coins and tokens with a unique offering that lists them in MoneyPot (which in turn makes those coins / tokens available for gaming on select properties), as well as PotEx.io to be traded against both BTC, and MBI pairs.

We are writing to you today to update you on some of the strategic initiatives under our consideration as they relate to long-term positioning of the Monster Byte (MBI) token.   First, we firmly believe all the work that we’ve done over the past year warrants much better exposure and liquidity than what MBI has received on the Waves decentralized exchange (DEX).  It’s important to note that there is a Waves marketing team whose charter is to assist Waves-tokens post-ICO with getting better exposure, marketing, and press coverage. We’ve been in regular contact with this team for the past quarter precisely to achieve these objectives but unfortunately, we feel that we are not receiving the proper coverage a valid business like Monster Byte deserves.  In addition, it’s also been challenging for us to get our token listed onto other exchanges as Waves-based tokens aren’t widely accepted.  At the same time, we’ve recently been approached by a Top 50 exchange that is eager to list Monster Byte; however, in order to do so, we’d have to migrate from the Waves platform to the Ethereum platform and convert all tokens held over to ERC20 tokens. If we did pursue this conversion, it would be at a 1:1 swap, meaning there would be no dilution to current token holders.  Apart from the improved liquidity we expect from this listing, ERC20 tokens are more widely recognized, and there is a growing demand for ERC20 token support at many top exchanges, both centralized and decentralized. A switch for MBI in this direction could allow for many more listing opportunities and, therefore, better liquidity. Ethereum’s rising popularity is also demonstrative of its maturity as a blockchain network – something perhaps Waves may need more time to achieve.  Before we make any changes, we’d like to gauge the community’s response – so we please ask you to answer this short survey so we can ensure any decision we make is aligned with the aspirations of our token holders.  Please click here to participate in the survey.  Thank you for your support!",False

You can verify the results using the ""Provably Fair"" button in the bet control.  At a high level, Provably Fair is a technique that allows you to reshuffle the deck before it is dealt.  We shuffle the deck once on the server then present you with a hash of the shuffled deck before any wagers are made. Then, whenever you place a wager, you can provide us with a 'client seed'  (which is generated randomly in your browser, or optionally by you, by hand).  We then use the 'client seed' to reshuffle the deck in a deterministic way. At the end of the wager, we reveal the initial shuffle, which allows you to verify that we presented him with a valid hash, and also reshuffled the deck in the correct way. Since we didn't know the value of the 'client seed' until the moment the hand was dealt, there is no way for us to manipulate the outcome of the shuffle of the deck.",False

If what was described as complicated, I'd suggest you not play games of chance online and stick to playing the lotto.  Seeing how high your emotional intelligence is, it is safe to assume this would all be way over your head. Couple that with you publicly begging (trolling) for a highly -EV bet, and I think most (even you) can put 2+2 together.  That said, we will be offering insurance soon, but I can share some math for you on why this is a terrible bet for you, the player. Read it slowly, math is hard  The main number you want to concentrate on here is 9:4 odds – or rather, the odds against the dealer having a blackjack when they’re showing an ace is 9:4. To break this down further, let’s say you make $5 insurance bets 130 times; based on the 9:4 odds, you’d win your bet 40 times for $400 in total winnings ($10 total earnings X 40 bets). On the other hand, you’d lose 90 of these bets for $450 in total losses ($5 total losses X 90 bets). As you can see, this leaves you $50 in the hole, thus making it a bad bet overall.",False

Their are many great poker games where the house has no risk at all, just taking in a rake around 3-5%. Of this you then offer free tournaments to win money or pay bonus money in tournaments to ""playing members"" giving back about 30% to build loyalty in your brand. Or take just a rake of 1-2% and use this as advertising as the cheapest rake online. It's early days and you need to build a big customer base before you can expect big dollars return. A sportsbook will get many in if done right with a professional look that is easy to use and understand - but it looks like a few people currently do not like this with Monsterbyte. So if you are struggling with that get someone in to build poker rooms on your network as the poker community is huge, they talk to each other (sociable game for many) and when they find a good thing they tell many people. Once you have a poker base they will venture into all the other avenues of the casino/sportsbook etc. The other thing with a poker room up and running utilising Bitcoin is that many people in countries like Australia can then bet online again as regulations have stopped us betting with the likes of Pokerstars etc. They will eventually ban it from cryptos too but by the time it takes for regulations to get made/enforced it can be many years. Meanwhile abuse the flaw in the system while you can and even when they ban certain countries you will have a worldwide customer base by then so it will be minimal impact. I have worked in casinos many years and most games have a risk of a whale placing a few big bets, winning and taking all your profits from the smaller punters and then some. So even though the odds are normally in the houses favour - they can backfire. Poker is no risk profits, just require a server that can handle the amount of players. So go out headhunt the developer/programmer at pokerstars or similar to get this happening?? Just a thought for you guys to ponder.",False

Thank you for all the support you have provided! We are extremely grateful, and motivated to execute on our roadmap!   TOKEN UPDATE We are going to distribute all tokens on Thursday, August 10th, this includes users that participated in our bounty program. If you purchased or earned tokens, you will receive an email once the transfer has been completed. Immediately after you receive the tokens you will be able to trade them within the Waves DEX; however BE SURE to trade only the verified Monster Byte token, it has the green check mark next to it, there are unfortunately some imposters out there! (our id is CJpRwfpBcFyA6p3g1fb7xuiArSQ7xLkNH8SD9AB4HeD9)  Our dividend schedule is currently set to be quarterly, but we will potentially change that to monthly after the 3rd quarter is complete. In order to receive dividends, you must be holding the tokens in a waves address you control during the dividend period (i.e. not an exchange). As we get closer to our first dividend period (October), we will communicate clear instructions via email, forums, and our slack channel.  Knowing that broader exposure it important for longer term liquidity we will be pursuing listing our token on other exchanges in the near term (1-2 months out). We will update you as this occurs.  ROADMAP UPDATE We are very happy to report that the new Sportsbook has gone live on BitcoinRush.io earlier this week to 10% of the traffic, please check it out here. This took several teams working collaboratively in Panama, India, and the United Kingdon to pull off and was an extremely large undertaking as we switched our odds provider, enhanced our UI/UX, and have built a risk-management system in place to ensure we are operating at a 0% risk model.  We anticipate turning this up for 100% of traffic in all sports before the end of this weekend baring some configuration items with the odds provider we are leveraging.  Users of BitcoinRush.io will also notice that we've been gradually updating the user experience across the entire site, not just the sportsbook. We aim to have all the pages (excluding the casino) completely revamped by early September, just in time for the NFL season.  We are on the right track! Our team remains focused and highly motivated as we head into fall sports season, which is always our busiest and time to shine! Thank you again for your participation and support in our ICO!

In just one week, 80% of our ICO is subscribed, allowing us to raise nearly $800,00 from nearly 500 individual investors from around the globe!  This is an even more incredible feat given the fact that we are conducting this ICO in very difficult market conditions with the uncertainty of a bitcoin fork impending just weeks away.  Our ICO ends in 3 weeks, and even if we are not fully subscribed by August 6th, we are still moving forward with our aggressive product roadmap and producing real results for our token holders so they can see value quickly! In fact, both our users and token holders will be happy to learn that our new Sportsbook (with a new UX, and risk-free model) will be launched on BitcoinRush.io in 2 weeks or less!   ICO Still Open So far, nearly 2000 users have registered to participate in our ICO. Even with all the success we've had just one week in, there are still ~1500 of you that might be on the fence in investing with us?  If you are in that category, we first offer up one fact - Monster Byte is literally one of the few Bitcoin companies that incorporated in 2013 that is still operating today. If you look at the bitcoin gaming industry (excluding Dice), we are one of the oldest around! Couple this fact, with our endeavors into the B2B sector, and we remain confident that Monster Byte is still a very good opportunity at the ICO price we are offering.  That said, if you're still unsure about Monster Byte, we welcome you to hop into our Slack Channel to address any questions you may have!   Play for Fun, Win for Real!  MonsterByte.io",False

If I can make it, I'll let you know. Would be good to meet other bitcoin casinos in person for sure.    Quote B - In no way are we trying to portray something dishonest; the P&L, ICO and whitepaper all have a disclaimer showing the sportsbook metrics assume the no-risk model which we are about to deploy. As you've been a follower for a while, you have a clear view of our historic sportsbook challenges, I also mention it within this thread for reference.  [...snip...]   It's a mixed equity stake/salary based model; salaries are no doubt drastically lower than the norm in 2017 and part of 2018, but sacrifices have to be made short-term, and everyone involved will benefit from the equity model as it relates to dividends.  I think it might be worth while to break down the finances in a lot more detail and let people assemble it in a way that makes sense to them. There's a lot of stuff missing from them that leaves investors shooting a little blind.  For instance: in your spreadsheet you show that in 2016 you have a net income of $123,251. But for reference, what would it be if you used more generally accepted accounting principles? (e.g. the using actual realized gambling revenue for revenue. And counted the equity you paid out at the ICO price as an expense).  From the financial statements it's not really apparent to me if this is a company that's making money and looking for additional capital to super-charge the growth ... or it's company hemorrhaging money and needs life support.",False

I see a few red flags which maybe you could help me clear up:  a) It seems like you've changed names since a few weeks ago when you were earlier asking for funding. Before it was ""Tim Zoo"" and ""Luke Rose-Chambers"" and now it's ""Tim Walters"" and ""Luke Rose"". I'm not sure what to think of this.   b) Your ""actual revenue"" figures seem to be adjusted to what they would've hopefully might have been if the new system was in place. This strikes me as rather dishonest as it can gives a very different picture. I completely understand that you're upgrading the system to something that you won't have risk, and that would absolutely justify optimistic projections. However, actual revenue should be actual revenue, not adjusted for what it would've been nice to have. Besides being misleading, the problem with trying to adjust revenue for what they might have been is the huge causation factor.  For instance: imagine you price the odds wrong that would allow a smart players take advantage of it while covering it somewhere else. You'll obviously have great volumes, and lose a lot of money. But it would be silly to think the same player would've played the same amount if the odds were priced more correctly.  I think it would be very useful to show what the actual revenue is, along with volumes and projections. This will make sure it's clear exactly what's going on.    c) What do you based your projections on? This sort of stuff kind of raises an eye-brow: Actual Casino Revenue: 2014: 125k 2015: 109k 2016: 88k ---projections--- 2017: 105k 2018: 364k 2019: 1.29M 2020: 2.05M 2021: 2.7M   d) Your expenses are extremely low (well done! I'm really impressed at how well you've kept a tight ship) but for things like last years salary expenses you have $25,853, but I see you have a CEO/director/advisors. I'm assuming that this is a fair bit below market wages, so how does this work? Is it because of their equity stake? Or a promise to be paid in the future? How do you see this changing?   e) I couldn't find any mention of the current assets/liabilities. It's not clear if the company is debt free or not, or what it's holding; which makes evaluating a fair value rather hard.   Sorry about so many negative points (there's a lot more positive ones, like the b2b strategy but I didn't really have questions about them).  Good luck with everything! Ryan",False

We've  mentioned this before, but all collectively admired what you've done with Bustabit.  BTW will you be attending the IGB conference in Amsterdam on the 12th of July? Luke, and some other Monster Byte principals will be there for certain; would be great to meet in person.  Answers below;  A - Previous names you saw were an attempt to deter Doxing; but that train has left the building.  B - In no way are we trying to portray something dishonest; the P&L, ICO and whitepaper all have a disclaimer showing the sportsbook metrics assume the no-risk model which we are about to deploy. As you've been a follower for a while, you have a clear view of our historic sportsbook challenges, I also mention it within this thread for reference.  We are very certain our odds were correct, you can trust that we've micromanaged the book since 2014 and have 'canceled/refunded' any wager which was at an incorrect odd (it's happened less than a dozen times in 4 years). Last, our whitepaper shows actual volume numbers in both casino and sportsbook.  C - Exponential growth based on new earned operating income, and expenditure. You elude to this in (d), but we currently spend an incredibly low amount in marketing and product enhancements. This changes post-ICO with us hiring people to promote our brand on this (and other) forums, paid marketing efforts in traditional outlets as well as organic search. Further, we will spend considerable amounts in redesigning BitcoinRush and PeerBet with a professional firm (we've shared working examples in the OP, and whitepaper). Last, we anticipate the use of cryptocurrencies for online gambling will increase YoY, this is a leading factor in the growth we anticipate.  D - It's a mixed equity stake/salary based model; salaries are no doubt drastically lower than the norm in 2017 and part of 2018, but sacrifices have to be made short-term, and everyone involved will benefit from the equity model as it relates to dividends.  E - Technically speaking we are debt-free; principals have put up additional capital in 2016 to keep things moving, but this is not considered debt as it was part of equity swap deals.",False

The pre-sale, which contains 2,500,000 tokens, opens at July 3rd 16:00 UTC and will remain open until July 8th 16:00. If those 2,500,000 tokens sell-out before July 8th 16:00 UTC, that round will be complete and people can get into the general round which opens at July 8th 16:00. In the general round, 7,500,000 tokens will be sold in total.  We've priced both rounds with the intention for them to both sellout quickly, so we do recommend anyone that has a keen interest in this opportunity to register on https://www.monsterbyte.io to stay up to date with the latest news, and be prepared to buy their tokens next Monday July 3rd.",False

BitcoinRush.io  * We earn ~2% of all bets placed in the Sportsbook, regardless of if the player wins or loses  * In the casino, we hold anywhere from 1-7% edge based on the game being played.  * In our peer to peer games, like Bitcoin Rush, we retain 1% of the pot  * In pools, like Survivor Pools or other P2P contests, we retain 1.5% of the pot  Bit777  * This is strictly a casino, so we hold anywhere from 1-7% edge based on the game being played.  PeerBet  * In Dice, we retain a 1% edge; just like other dice sites; however, this bankroll is still all crowd-funded; so we make a small commission of the profits the investor earns on PeerBet.  * There are raffles that run every few minutes where we retain 1.5% of the pot  * We also charge smaller coins a commission (paid in btc) to list their coin on PeerBet, a recent example is PepeCoin  B2B  * We will charge a one-time licensing fee to leverage our software on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis  * We will share in the profits with the operator, exact terms still TBD (this is a new vertical for us after the ICO is completed)   Overall, since we have a hard cap and a set amount of tokens (40,000,000) 1 token is entitled to 1/40,000,000 of our profits (revenue - expenses).

There are a lot of different variables that affected revenue since 2014 some in our control (UI, marketing, product), some out of it (price of bitcoin, etc).  We kind of alluded to this in a previous response, but how we handled risk in the Sportsbook was one the main culprits. Believe it or not, the bitcoin sportsbook space has a lot of professional cappers in it, reason being is that they've been kicked off traditional sportsbooks and have come to bitcoin books because of the level of anonymity they can have. In 2015, when we were suffering losses in the book, and worst when we got left holding the bag from a 3rd party provider, we had to cut other areas including marketing and product development. At the same time, many other competitors came into the bitcoin gaming space and we lost market share.  But to answer your question directly,  Yes our roadmap is strategically aligned to combat the lessons we learned in 2015 and 2016. First and foremost, we will hire dedicated community managers to better promote our brands, at the same time we will gradually roll out a new user experience on BitcoinRush.io and PeerBet.org. In conjunction with that - we will launch our new risk-free sportsbook which will drastically improve our options in the book, raise our limits, and get some of those big (and casual) players back onto our sites.  Last, users that are interested in both the pre-sale and general sale should register on https://www.monsterbyte.io; that's where the token sale itself will take place starting on July 3rd.  Thanks again for your interest!",False

First, we gotta thank both Havelock and everyone that invested back in 2014; back then we raised a total of $55,000 in a matter of minutes. From there we were really able to grow from just a few hundred users to what you see today, nearly 50,000 users across three different properties, owners of all the intellectual property, and momentum to carry us to the next level in both the B2C space as well as enter the B2B space. If you have been close to Havelock through the years, you'd know we are 1 of the only funds still in operations from the 2013/2014 era, and we take a lot of pride in that and we're happy to reward all the folks on Havelock by moving them to the new token.  Havelock users were collecting dividends early on; however, we had a few hiccups with our Sportsbook in both 2015 and 2016 which made us be a bit more conservative. The sportsbook as a whole has been a very good lesson learned, we were handling risk at first, then offset with a third party (who went bankrupt and stiffed us), then we handled the risk ourselves again a bit more intelligently.  Without going into some of the ""secret sauce"" we now have a new model that we plan on launching right after the ICO closes which will allow us to offset risk programmatically, without the risk of a third party folding on us. This will launch in conjunction of the new sportsbook UI which can be seen here: https://www.bitcoinrush.io/sportsbook/b/mlb  Historic, and projected, P&L can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14hV9RUtrdPeDusRDwdjyFzwmMep3tVOEdaVuOSd4J3M/edit?usp=sharing",False
