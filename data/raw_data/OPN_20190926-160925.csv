It is a USD 2 trillion-dollar industry globally in 2017; Involving hundreds of thousands of movements daily – across different legs of supply chain. It involves multiple stakeholders – primary ones being shipper, transporter, driver and consignee. Supported by intermediaries, viz. logistics service providers; banks; custom brokers; technology solution providers; government agencies and regulatory bodies.  Many elements of this process have been automated. eg: Transport Management Systems integrated with ERPs; technology solutions for last mile delivery - typically used by online retailers.  However, lack of secure supply chain control in the distribution channel, particularly in less developed markets, tend to drive up distribution costs due to lost sales, penalties from late delivery, theft or pilferage, and product damage.  With multiple parties are involved in data chain – starting with delivery note from shipper or logistics service provider; commercial and tax invoice from shipper; and finally, delivery confirmation from consignee; to highlight few critical data reconciliation points. One of the greatest business problem of road transportation industry is delivery confirmation or Proof of Delivery (POD); which is prone to being inaccurate and unreliable.
