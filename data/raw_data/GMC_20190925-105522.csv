We are excited to announce the official launch of CopyTrade system – the system of automated trading on the Binance exchange platform is now available for all the subscribers. Receiving signals and carrying out transactions on the exchange platform is done automatically without direct participation of a user. Crypto exchange platforms operate 24 hours a day and the system will monitor the signals and generate profits for you the whole time!  The use of CopyTrade* system is a paid service for all the subscribers. It is necessary to deposit funds to one’s RichLand account in the bot (“Referrals” - “Add funds” section, there will be a “Wallet” option added from which one is able to withdraw and deposit funds in the future). Funds will be withdrawn from the account daily in accordance to the tariffs. Commission amount depends on the deposit amount:  MIN deposit - MAX deposit / RichLand interest rate per month Under $100 / 9,00% $101 - $500 / 8,00% $501 - $1 000 / 7,00% $1 001 - $1 500 / 6,00% $1 501 - $2 500 / 5,00% $2 501 - $5 000 / 4,00% $5 001 - $10 000 / 3,00% $10 001 - $25 000 / 2,00% $25 001 - $50 000 / 1,50% $50 001 - $100 000 / 1,25% Over $100 001 / 1,00%  Example: your deposit amount is $5047, in this case the daily charge is $5047 * 0,03 / 30 = $5,05. The bot checks the balance daily; a recalculation is made in accordance to tariffs depicted above in case the balance decreases or increases (deposit/ withdrawal of funds or fixation of profits) by minimal/ maximum tariff value. Consequently, the higher your Binance balance is, the lower RichLand commission will be.  Please note, the referral rewards, which can be used for paying for the CopyTrade service as well, will be deposited to the wallet directly.  All daily transactions (payments) participate in the 10-stage RichLand referral program. Each transaction generates rewards for the uplink!  Signals will be copied for your whole deposit on the Binance exchange platform, which is connected to our bot. 10% of free capital is always used when purchasing an asset on the exchange platform through the bot’s signal.  For example, in case your deposit is $10 000 and a signal is received, then $1000 will be used to purchase an asset. Let’s assume that you earned 20% from the signal. You balance will be: $9000 + $1200 = $10 200. Consequently, the next signal will also use 10% from the available capital, i.e. $1020. This allows for you to always have available funds to purchase the next asset and diversify your balance regardless from the size of the capital.  Attention! Yet another exciting announcement: the price of standard subscription for RichLand trade signals remains the same - $49 per month (excluding discounts when paying for 3-6-12 months)!  *- It is necessary to have an active (paid) subscription for RichLand service in order to use the CopyTrade system.",False

As you know, market interest in cryptocurrency projects decreased sharply in 2018–2019, and therefore we could not fully collect the initially announced amount of funds (hard cap). But this did not prevent the successful development of our project due to the availability of alternative sources of funding. We continue to develop the project successfully, and the number of installations of the Gem4me messenger is very close to 8 million, our Market Space is already functioning as a beta version with the number of active stores 500+.  Gem4me Market Space is a promising project with a great future. At the moment we are investing our resources in the development of both the messenger and the marketplace. Users will be provided with the possibility to transfer funds in various currencies, sell and purchase goods, promote their ideas, products and personal brand using the most modern technological solutions, as Gem4me Market Space is a new generation communication tool.  We are still glad to see all interested parties, as investors of the project or just active users of the messenger of new generation and the Market Space financial and trading platform. All tokens obtained for various actions can be used at the Market Space site after all the planned functionality has been implemented.   We thank all the participants and wish you great success!

Your response has exceeded our expectations, and we’re both humbled by and grateful for the sum we’ve raised so far.  As you may know, the crypto market is currently rebounding from a downturn. Business is picking up, but many large players are in summer mode - so the market is moving slowly.  In light of this, as well as a large number of requests to extend the pre-sale, we’ve decided to move the last day of the pre-sale up to November 30 2018 (23:59). This new date will help us make sure everyone can participate, and maximize the market value of your tokens.  Pre-sale participants will receive:  1,000+ GMC - a 10% pre-sale bonus 15,000 GMC - a 15% pre-sale bonus 50,000 GMC - a 20% pre-sale bonus 100,000 GMC+ - a 25% pre-sale bonus  An additional bonus program will run concurrently with the main sale to reward all of you for your commitment and ongoing support. Details will be announced soon.  The new public sale start date is December 1 2018, at 23:59. The end of the public sale will be April 1 2019, 23:59. All tokens will be released once the ICO is finished.  Sincerely you’re, Team Market Space",False

Actually, seller and buyer will be communicating directly, but Market Space as a trading platform will also be a part of the process providing for several useful features listed below:  - Gem4me Market Space’s blockchain solution ensures that transactions are secure, and creates a universal verification system wherein users can access all available stores safely after using KYC verification. All payment transactions (in physical and online payments) are carried out via, and stored on the blockchain. As a result, getting proof-of-payment is always possible, ensuring transparency.  - Another key feature of the platform is a built-in escrow system that doesn’t release funds until a product is received. This means that merchants only receive funds after a customer has verifiably received their product, adding another layer of security to Gem4me Market Space.  - The blockchain-distributed feedback system that lets you leave indelible, tamper-proof feedback, making Gem4me Market Space merchants transparent — and rewarding excellent customers and merchants. This way, the platform and the users in it are optimized for fair competition, while the risk of fraud is minimized.",False

All recordings and transactions are stored indefinitely, and adding to them costs GMC tokens. This means GMC tokens pay for blockchain-recorded actions like:  a. KYC Verification. b. Review authenticity verification. c. Leaving feedback that affects user reputation. d. Store transactions that count towards Back4Cash eligibility. e. Past purchases, sales and other transactions. f. Credit scores and payment histories affecting the ability to get and give credit. g. Using blockchain technologies helps protect Gem4me Market Space and the users inside it from counterfeit goods, malicious retailers and data manipulation.  As you can see blockchain offers a way to get a good feel on the level of trustability each party has within Market Space platform (meaning both buyers and merchants), having in mind that KYC completion will be required for all users and merchants prior to entering the platform, there will be full transparency in terms of all identities for every party on the platform.  Of course, no one can give you a 100% guarantee that some particular user has no fraudulent intentions and won't try to go out and attempt theft, but since every piece of information is stored and transparent on the blockchain, there will be a way for the seller to prove the product was actually delivered, assign the scammer negative rating or even go for legal prosecution of the scammer.
