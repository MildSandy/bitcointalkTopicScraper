ICO as a concept is a absolutely new way to test ideas in relatively cheap manner, allowing more tries (and more failures as well). And I do not see how eg HODLing will bring value.

Presale 01.03,"   I add some more information. I consulted the whitepaper, and this is what it says about regulation:  Quote REGULATION We anticipate that the EQUI platform itself will be considered an Unregulated Collective Investment Scheme (UCIS) as per UK statutory regulation and FCA guidance, which is the opinion shared by our legal counsel. This means the scheme will be operated by an FCA authorised individual, which will give comfort to investors that their rights under the smart contracts to which they commit to investments are being managed correctly.   However, we would like to emphasise that the issue of tokens theselves in the ICO is not a regulated activity in the UK, and the EQUItoken is not considered a security, which is again the opinion shared by our legal counsel. The token's utility is in providing a means of  access  to  the  future  EQUI  platform  and  does  not  directly  or  indirectly  provide  any  return.

Presale 01.03,"PROPOSITION:  EQUI is a utility token that will enable access to the EQUI investment platform once developed. All qualifying participants will be able to transfer their tokens to the platform and access an evolving selection of investment projects.  EQUI’s unique reward structure is weighted towards providing enhanced returns to those who share our vision and objectives in supporting the next generation of entrepreneurial success.  The EQUI proposition offers participants both flexibility and control in the making of investment decisions. EQUItokens can be bought for various reasons:  INVESTORS:  Investors are those participants who commit EQUItokens to the EQUI platform and apply their tokens to projects. The level of commitment is completely flexible and is determined by the investor’s appetite in a particular project. Investors will receive 75% (pro-rata) of the net profits* generated from projects they invest in.  As a further reward mechanism, Investors will participate in the EQUItoken loyalty program. This will involve the transfer of bonus tokens annually to Investors and Holders.  EQUItokens applied to an investment will be sold to raise fiat currency. The rate of exchange will be fixed at the market rate on the day of investment. On sale of the investment, returns will be made in ETH to the Investor’s EQUI wallet.  HOLDERS:  Holders are those participants who transfer their EQUItokens to the EQUI platform but have yet to commit their tokens to projects. Holders will participate in the EQUI loyalty program, so long as their tokens remain on the EQUI platform.  TRADERS:  Traders are participants whose EQUItokens sit outside of the EQUI platform. They have no access to the investment opportunities or the EQUI loyalty program and benefit only from any enhancement in the token price. A Trader can decide to move EQUItokens back onto the EQUI platform for investment or to hold in their EQUI wallet.   Participants may choose to apply their tokens in all, or any, of these ways.  All showcased projects will have been assessed and evaluated by the EQUI Investment Team prior to publication.  75% of net profits* are returned to Investors. The remaining 25% goes to the EQUI Investment Team as a performance reward. This structure has been designed to ensure that the interests of all parties remain aligned at all times thereby deriving maximum value for all stakeholders.    * Net profit is defined as exit value less cost of investment after 3% pa Fund Manager’s fees based on invested funds.",False

Presale 01.03,"Hello, guys!  Thank you for all your feedback, it's important to us to ensure we continue to learn and improve on daily basis. Equi team is active on telegram group: https://t.me/equicapital  Going back to development perspective, here are a number of aspects which contribute to making Equi unique:  1) clients cannot share/sell their private key, this would not fit KYC requirements. This has a few important implications such as... the inability to use client-side wallets where the user is in charge of their own private keys, hence we will use a custodial account approach. Therefore, we are responsible for all the funds, which leads us to the question - can you trust us with your Ether?  2) The Ethereum private keys we generated for our customers are stored in the safest manner possible, in a secure safety deposit box in this instance.  3) All spendable transactions will be achieved by signing a transaction on airgapped computer (one which has never be connected to Internet), and then transaction data will be copied to another machine and distributed to the Ethereum Blockchain.   As you see from the above, its quite different approach when compared to publishing an ERC20 token and allowing anybody to exchange their hard earned Ether for EQUItokens.  If you have more question, we will provide the best answers we can to clarity your queries and hopefully mitigate your concerns.  Please, let's stick to constructive, efficient and valuable discussion, time is precious.",False

Part of the platform will be launched on March 1st, as a part of ICO process, which is quite different from normal ICO flow (please see my post above).  3) officially we launched exactly one week ago, and were already featured in multiple places, such as Forbes, CNN, Sun and a few others.  4) Blockchain is needed for this project to track the involvement by potential investors into particular projects, calculate returns, apply rules nobody could change. For investor its useful to see that Project X has already N% shares distributed, transparency is beneficial for both parties.  5) Roadmap of the project is published in the WP and also on official website. Exact scope of work is not possible to define, as it will be dependent on the exact amounts raised. Still, next 9 months plan is described and posted already.

Presale 01.03,"     Oh okay, I will read your ""white paper"".  I checked the guy's LinkedIn. He is a web dev who recently started (5 months ago) a small venture in Blockchain. I don't see how putting one guy (who isn't a blockchain dev at all) can help your case, he has no relevant blockchain experience.  So goes the white paper...  Speaking of which you have 43 pages, 2 of them are about your platform, 2 about the general blockchain stuff (yay a database, yay hashes and blocks) The only relevant thing we can read about your platform (apart from the KYC stuff) is ""It will be user friendly, aesthetically pleasing and provide all relevant information for an investor to plan their investments and review their portfolio."" No actual technical details on the implementation. You have a picture so what? What is your solution? Do you use metamask? If yes then why do you have an ethereum node, if no where do you keep the keys? Private/public solution?   Then on the business side... If I understand you well people have to buy your token in order to invest it in some projects. If the project is successful and you have invested you get ROI and everybody can benefit from a % of your investment as well. Which begs some questions: - Why would projects use your platform and not do an ICO themselves? Especially if they will receive tokens. - How will you update the rewards, you know that you can't update your smart contract automatically. Then who cares about your rewards since your product is not the businesses, your product is your token. Who cares about 50% of ROI when you are pushing 1000% with EQUI in a vary subtle way? - Where is the business logic? You don't need 72 million to write a bloody 1000 lines of solidity code to do a demo   ""Built on Ethereum Blockchain technology, EQUI disrupts the traditional venture investment market and empowers the crypto community to join the next generation of venture capital investors. Utilising EQUItokens, investors will be able to buy stakes in emerging, entrepreneurial companies, and benefit from great investment returns and rewards.""  Why do you need Ethereum? Why don't you make your own fund and use fiat? Assuming you've answered, why do you need a token? You can do the same stuff with Ether.  ""Through a unique reward structure every EQUItoken holder will benefit from the returns generated from realised projects, ensuring all interests remain aligned throughout the project lifespan"" You are basically creating something like a DAO. Be very careful as the expectation of passive investment is a dangerous thing to do with unregistered instruments. Right now you have no audit for that so proposing your token to everyone is not very legal. And your KYC won't save you.  ""Following the ICO, the platform will be fully developed using the funds raised."" Oh so, a billionnaire can't put 5k on the table to pay a dev from India in order to sketch decent wordpress website/demo?    Conclusion  Too bad I do Blockchain project audit for a living and I see you people doing the same scams every time. But I am sick of all the scams in the field, so I will tell what you really want to do.   You want to raise money from people with ambitious claims about how you are going to change and disrupt the world by basically throwing big words on the table. Your white paper is a pure marketing plan to lure the newbie investor. All you want to do in reality is a classic pump and dump. At best you will just run away with Ether and pay you a nice fee. Your use-case is weak, you have no demo. No real team, you don't have to put 13 people (with one technical guy) to do a website where businesses can register and receive your tokens.   Although I know I can't stop you and you will probably raise your 72millions anyway. And as always your project will be as deserted as Augur shortly after your ICO.",False
