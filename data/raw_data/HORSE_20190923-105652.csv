We are extremely thankful to the community members who are helping with this effort and providing feedback contributing to the success of Ethorse. The network connectivity issues we had in the beginning are not present anymore. We are continuing to update the dApp and implement new features based on the feedback we receive. Below are some updates we have rolled out so far.  -The Betting period for all races have been increased from 1hr to 6hrs, so there will always be a race to bet on -Added two new 1hr races. Now for every 24hrs, there will be four 1hr races and two 24hr races -See the current coin price the dApp uses before you bet and during the race -Odds calculation is updated to align with global standards and easier understanding (Now includes +1ETH) -Small update to make it usable for now in Cipher Mobile Browser -Other updatesâ€Šâ€”â€ŠScrollbar, wordings, price (and %) decimals, disable coin selection after the race starts, etc.  As we continue to update the dApp, please keep the feedback coming. If you need Kovan Testnet Ether to play with the dApp, all you have to do is log-in to the Kovan Faucet Gitter with Twitter/Github account and post an address to receive it. We will be conducting a bug bounty in the next few days. After we address the major items from the community feedback and the bounty, we will release the dApp on Mainnet.

With this, if your coin wins by having even a slightly higher performance, you win from everyone who bet on the other coins. Eg: If everyone is betting on BTC or ETH, let's assume 100 ETH, and you are the only one to bet on LTC which later becomes a winner, then you get 100 ETH from the others even if you wagered only 0.1ETH. This is where the Pay-off odds come into play. Hopefully, this explains the huge potential of Ethorse in comparison to using the Exchanges. Also, there is no central party running these races, announcing the winner and issuing the payout. It's all done by smart contracts without any external control.  2) https://www.reddit.com/r/Ethorse/comments/7q0hb6/ethorse_has_just_been_added_to_idex/  https://www.reddit.com/r/Ethorse/comments/7q80uu/trading_horse_on_etherdelta/",False

Ethorse provides a betting system widely used in Horse Betting - ""Parimutuel Betting"". With this, if your coin wins by having even a slightly higher price increase %, you win the entire pool from everyone who bet on other coins. Eg: If everyone is betting on BTC or ETH, let's assume 100 ETH, and you are the only one to bet on LTC which later becomes a winner, then you get 100 ETH from the others even if you wagered only 0.1ETH. Huge in comparison to buying from exchanges. This is where the Pay-off odds come into play. Hopefully, this explains the huge potential of Ethorse in comparison to using the Exchanges. And the beauty is there is no central party running these races, announcing the winner and issuing the payout. It's all done by smart contracts without any external control.",False
