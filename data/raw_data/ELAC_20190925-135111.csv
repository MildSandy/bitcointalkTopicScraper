I would like something new and impressive!  It is a clear fact you stated that AI market is now in great competition. IT giants all over the world from Google to Alibaba are heavily investing in AI with phenomenal expansion of AI market. The point of interest to make on current status is that it is still a newer market with huge potential to grow. Market-base of AI market is still expanding and growing every year, which means it is not a zero-sum market with plenty of fresh opportunities for new AI project to take initiatives.  Competitiveness of AI ELA compared to other blockchain-based AI or even other conventional centralized AI services is well addressed in our whitepaper so I wouldn't go too deep with that subject. ELAMACHAIN Platform's comprehensive eco-system which can fully integrate AI-use and users' daily life will bring possibly first functional Hyperledger-based AI to the world with incomparable benefit.",False

From that on, two major things needed for AI to tell one's emotion would come from constant interaction between AI and users and analysis on data from such activities. So no, you will not need to fill out questionnaires or be forced to answer rather pointless questions. AI ELA would adopt to deeper level of user preferences mostly through natural language conversation and specifically formated ELA missions. Ultimately it will grow to be capable of identifying key parameters of user behavior, notably key words used in conversation with ELA.",False
