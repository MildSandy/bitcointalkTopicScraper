Cryptassist could easily list on a small exchange, however, the CEO would like to start strong with a large exchange listing.  The Cryptassist developers are working tirelessly and a completely new Cryptassist website will be online soon.  The CEO believes that proceeding with an ERC20 token will be in the best interest of all of the Cryptassist contributors due to exchange listings. CTA is not a primary payment coin, it is much more service and gaming focused.  Cryptassist gaming will be done with gaming points which can later be changed into crypto. This is necessary in order to take crypto out of the discussion and allow for mass adoption of the game and acceptance by the App Store and Google Play.

How do you feel now?  Enter the crypto era: Let’s take one example – Binance.  In early 2017 Binance was somebody’s idea – a dream. Today it’s the world Number 1 cryptocurrency exchange and it is estimated that they, even after this short period of time, raise US$500 million in annual fee revenue.  The Binance ICO was run in mid 2017 and raised around US$15 million by selling their Binance coins (BNB) at US$0.10 each. Supporters of that ICO would, within 6 months, realize more than a twenty two thousand, yes, twenty two thousand, percentage increase in value, or put in basic terms – profit.  This absolutely amazing trajectory of BNB is a demonstration that utility coins like the Cryptassist coin (CTA) can have great value and become popular with exchange users. Couple this with the 50% discount on fees the Cryptassist exchange will offer when trading fees are paid with CTA and there is even more motivation to be a supporter of CTA.  The Cryptassist exchange is, of course, not exclusive for CTA trading and will function like any other full cryptocurrency exchange, as well as offering deposits and withdrawals in fiat.  If you are still not tempted to support Cryptassist and participate in the ICO, then consider that the exchange is only part of the amazing overall platform that is being developed. This is a platform that will undoubtedly change the way the crypto world is viewed and how cryptocurrencies are used, by everyone, everyday.  With more than 20 features and apps to cater for every person, from novices through to established traders and experts, no aspect of the crypto world has been left untouched.

In order to stay at the forefront of crypto technology, Cryptassist will run on a DAG based algorithm.  Blockchain is a concept that started gaining popularity as a standalone technology in 2015. Previously it was known only as the data structure underlying the technology behind Bitcoin and was referred to simply as “a chain of blocks”.  As Bitcoin rose in popularity it became known as Blockchain 1.0, but with transaction speeds of only a maximum of 7 TPS and taking 10 minutes to generate a new block. Then along came Ethereum as a decentralized platform for applications and the crypto world began to refer to it as Blockchain 2.0, but still only being able to perform 20 TPS.  Cryptassist will run on DAG – Blockchain 3.0  Direct Acyclic Graph, or DAG, is a structure that uses topological ordering, meaning that it can only go from earlier to later. DAG is often used to solve problems related to data processing, scheduling, data compression and finding the best route in navigation, meaning that it is infinitely more efficient than other blockchain solutions.  Solving the scalability issues that many other cryptocurrencies face  Cryptassist has a block generation time of only 15 seconds and transaction speeds of a blistering 4,000 to 10,000 TPS, meaning that is at the forefront of blockchain technology and giving Cryptassist users an edge in the ever dynamic cryptosphere.

How do you feel now?  Enter the crypto era: Let’s take one example – Binance.  In early 2017 Binance was somebody’s idea – a dream. Today it’s the world Number 1 cryptocurrency exchange and it is estimated that they, even after this short period of time, raise US$500 million in annual fee revenue.  The Binance ICO was run in mid 2017 and raised around US$15 million by selling their Binance coins (BNB) at US$0.10 each. Supporters of that ICO would, within 6 months, realize more than a twenty two thousand, yes, twenty two thousand, percentage increase in value, or put in basic terms – profit.  This absolutely amazing trajectory of BNB is a demonstration that utility coins like the Cryptassist coin (CTA) can have great value and become popular with exchange users. Couple this with the 50% discount on fees the Cryptassist exchange will offer when trading fees are paid with CTA and there is even more motivation to be a supporter of CTA.  The Cryptassist exchange is, of course, not exclusive for CTA trading and will function like any other full cryptocurrency exchange, as well as offering deposits and withdrawals in fiat.  If you are still not tempted to support Cryptassist and participate in the ICO, then consider that the exchange is only part of the amazing overall platform that is being developed. This is a platform that will undoubtedly change the way the crypto world is viewed and how cryptocurrencies are used, by everyone, everyday.  With more than 20 features and apps to cater for every person, from novices through to established traders and experts, no aspect of the crypto world has been left untouched.  So, next time this year, will you be a winner, or will you be the one that let another opportunity pass you by?

Let me explain:  Cryptassist is arguably the largest crypto related project ever undertaken. With an abundance of apps, features and customizable alerts available on both mobile and web based platforms. Cryptassist has something for everyone, from the novice to the crypto expert.  Cryptassist (CTA) uses an advanced Deflation Model where CTA are burned when used for alerts and premium features, meaning less CTA over time, potentially increasing the value of the remaining CTA. A Proof-of-Stake (PoS) coin, CTA uses an S-Scrypt platform and will be converted to a DAG based algorithm allowing an outstanding transaction speed of 3,500 TPS.  Cryptassist will have a Debit Card that can be refilled using the top 50 cryptocurrencies.  Cryptassist will have its own fully licensed spot exchange along with features ranging from a fun augmented reality app - CryptoGo, through to a webshop, a mobile messaging and an online payment app – ChatPay and tools that will make trading crypto simple to use and all on one platform.  To demonstrate the Cryptassist philosophy and commitment to the community and the environment, Cryptassist will partner with and donate 1% of the proceeds of the ICO to a Reforestation Organization and 1% to an Ocean Conservation Organization. Cryptassist will also provide to all interested nonprofit organizations and their donors an app, free of charge, that will allow donations to be tracked and validated in real-time, providing transparency and confidence to donors.",False

Meetings will be held over the next few days with private investors in Weihai before Ms.Tonjia moves on to the next Blockchain Meet Up in Beijing China. In Beijing she will be accompanied by the Cryptassist CEO, Henri Oostebring and the Cryptassist Public Relations Manager, Samantha Haeberli.
