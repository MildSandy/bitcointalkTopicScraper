In the past week we refined the design of our data models and improved infrastructure set-up, the smart contract designs are in progress and are on track to be QA'd & audited in time for the V1 mainnet launch. We‚Äôll be implementing a bespoke contract to record the provenance of work identity claims on the blockchain. Web3 and IPFS helper functions have been completed for QA to speed up development in coming weeks. We will now be focusing on implementing the core web functions of the dApp and implementing processes for security by design.   * Styling & components We set up Fela‚Äîa CSS in JS framework for styling our components and application. Storybook was also integrated into the application so that components could be visually tested and shared internally in isolation from the application. We spent some time looking into UI libraries and have decided to use Vuetify for the first version of the application so we can efficiently test and validate the UX ahead of investing time building our own components. Vuetify is a very popular and mature UI library built in Vue and implements near enough all components from Google's Material Design suite. This week we will start to flesh out the login flows and user profile page using components from this UI library.    * Using cryptography (TweetNaCl-js) to protect user data. We have written and published an extended version of the encryption wiki page.    * Data science workshop. : R_Block are partnering with Birmingham Uni and a Coding school to host a Data Science workshop this weekend (9th - 10th June).

Obviously this is a very big decision and a lot of factors are at play so we want to make the right decision taking all factors into consideration. In changing the R_Block name we will inevitably lose brand awareness as well as ranking organically on page 1 - we currently dominate the first page (bar one website) and a new more popular name might prevent this from happening for a few months at least. (These are things to bear in mind when making your decision)  For the new name we have been looking at the following factors:  ~ The name must be memorable. ~ The name must convey trust. ~ The name must have some relevance to what we‚Äôre doing. ~ The name must have a cutting edge or futuristic feel to it. ~ The name must be one or two syllables max. ~ SEO friendly and searchable. ~ The name must not be an established crypto company or recruitment company in the UK (we have particularly struggled with this one due to the sheer number of crypto companies) ~ Reasonable domain available.  Over the past few weeks we‚Äôve produced and sifted through over 6000 suggestions and conducted independent research as well as consulting with an agency. Based on the criteria above,  we‚Äôve narrowed it down to 3 options. After this hard work we want to gift the R_Block community with the power to dramatically shape the future of this project. We are handing over the reigns to you, our valued community to define what we call ourselves and shape the future name of this movement. Here are the options‚Ä¶  1. RBLOCK - as you can see the beloved underscore has gone!  We appreciate this doesn‚Äôt bode well for SEO and ease of use. RBlock is arguably the most relevant because of the ‚Äòrecruitment‚Äô and ‚Äòreference‚Äô element as well as being powered by blockchain. As mentioned above we have also got some brand recognition for the name. If we change it we will lose the SEO presence in the short term (3- 6 months)  2. ZINC It‚Äôs short, it‚Äôs punchy, it‚Äôs memorable. Zinc is typically used as a catalyst in bringing two organic things together. Although the relevance is somewhat tenuous we think it best fulfils the criteria in other areas.  3. KAIZO Derived from the term ‚ÄòKaizen‚Äô (the philosophy of continuous self-improvement) which is one of our core values (https://rblock.co/mission.html). Kaizo or Kaizu is short and memorable and has a futuristic feel to it. Both versions of the word are SEO rankable. We have also read that highly ranking scrabble letters work well for memorability and it doesn‚Äôt get much better than Z.  Please vote (link below) for your favourite name based on the criteria above. (please note we are waiting for the full report back from the trademark lawyer to see if they can find any potential infringements)  *Instructions to vote*  dApp: http://rblock.co/vote.html  We‚Äôre holding the vote on the blockchain! So you‚Äôll need to have Metamask installed and be connected to the Ropsten network. You'll also need some Ropsten ETH to vote (get it for free here: https://faucet.metamask.io/).

The referencing tool integrates seamlessly into the hiring process. So the reference and skills data is collected in real job applications by previous managers. The reference scores highly by providing real examples of their work and the amount of detail.  The upvoting functionality exists within the hiring network. Companies in that pay CV tokens to interact with the worker and see their full profile will be given the option to upvote after interviewing or interacting with them. Hiring companies will be identity checked (Civic or Uport) just as referees will and the network validators will be looking out for this behaviour.

But let me know if you have something specific in mind.  Collecting The Reference A company may be working with a recruitment firm to supply staff to hire. Usually, in this scenario, a recruitment firm will at least claim to be conducting references as part of their service with the client. We encourage both parties (the company & recruiter) to be involved in collecting the reference. The reference is collected via our email - private message exchange. The reference provided by the referee and will be passed by to the company or recruiter that initiated the smart contract in a form in an email. If the company is not part of this process, the worker can share the reference that has been stamped on the blockchain and their profile to cross check.  Job Board Network Within this network companies and recruiters will have an interchangeable persona. They will be operating in the same way - just like companies and recruiters do on traditional job boards (Monster, Indeed). A company or recruiter will search via workers proven skills, then pay CV tokens to reveal their full profile and a chance to contact them.  Good question, thanks very much.",True

R_Block will be a decentralised CV/Reference network, bringing references and proven skills into a CV. For the first time ever, workers are able to own their reference data and monetise it through C.v tokens. Our unique solution to the problem in referencing will be the framework for a tokenized careers ecosystem. Then become a self-sovereign identity management technology. The employment history data itself will become a core part of identity verification. Every Worker has an employment ‚Äòdigital fingerprint‚Äô which can be used to uniquely identify them. Years of credibility and performance proof is a powerful identity claim, like no other. Synthesized by reference data in the R_Block network.

Establishing Workers as the rightful owner & controller of their Reference data. To become the industry standard for proof of employment history & performance across careers and beyond. Utilising Web 3.0 to create a proof of credibility & long term performance identity claim compatible with ERC725.  PROBLEM  References supplied by an ex-colleague, are the most reliable way to authenticate a worker's‚Äô competency. They are the most reliable long-term performance indicator. Ten years ago References were the primary measure for gauging Workers‚Äô competency, today References have lost their rightful and inherent importance. What‚Äôs changed?  TRUST.

The popular centralised recruitment platforms naturally look after the parties that pay their bills - recruiters.  The balance is off, frustration is at an all time high and the knock on effect is a decline in use for recruiters too. Referencing is a primary example how data is being abused. It‚Äôs more often used by Recruiters for sales-leads rather than for verifying competency. Frequently, a Recruiter says that they need to collect upfront References from a Worker. In reality this isn‚Äôt true, the Recruiter uses the contact information for pitching business.  This kind of misuse has led to scepticism about sharing personal data [12]. The abuse of Worker information has diluted the trust in the Referencing & hiring in general. Furthermore, red-tape has muddied the water on what can be shared. Which unduly deters Workers from utilising the powerful tool. Lack of knowledge & tangible incentive has contributed to Referees becoming tight-lipped over supplying useful information.  In 2010, 75% of employers would Reference Workers for technical jobs, but today only 25% of employers take References [5]. What has broken this tool?  DATA ABUSE.  Referencing used to be the best tool for companies to establish Workers‚Äô competency. Now Referencing is just a validation check to back up decisions that have already been made, simply to check there are no ‚Äòskeletons in the closet‚Äô.  TOOL BECAME CHECK.  Like the centralised platforms, referencing doesn‚Äôt help Workers - checks at the latter stages of the recruitment process can only impact them negatively. After years of duplicitous requests, Workers are now less willing to share their Referees. Referees are less willing to provide detailed References due to lack of incentive. We‚Äôve reached a stalemate.  Referencing is now usually only conducted after a Worker has been offered a role, which has relegated Referencing from being a competency evaluation tool into a last-minute sanity check. Hence, we now have the phrase ‚Äúreference check‚Äù.  R_BLOCK SOLUTION  Headline: We have built a unique SaaS tool which seamlessly integrates into the hiring process to rejuvenate referencing. This tool is the unfair advantage R_Block has to attract users to build out our tokenized careers network. 1. Tokenisation allows R_Block to put the right incentives in place for Referees to share quality reference data. 2. R_Block empowers workers by giving them the opportunity to own this data and monetise it. By becoming searchable & contactable. Only once this network has been proven can we realise our vision of becoming a identity proof relied upon for high level identity claims.   this announcement thread will updated with more information.

Social hacking is an extremely important concern that needs to be dealt with. Concerning your first question, in the same way people could lie about their qualifications on Linkedin but don't. Why? Because other people on the site could find out and if they do it would have a detrimental effect on your career. This is the beauty of using the Blockchain. Given that your reference will be left on the blockchain forever it would be against your interest to lie.  On your second question, I'm not sure if I have understood you correctly but I take it that you're raising the concern of people giving negatived biased references due to personal reasons. Ultimate completely eliminating personal biases is impossible but this problem can be mitigated in three ways. First, through people selecting their referees, second people having multiple reference sources and lastly the fact that you have access to your references.

The token has 2 key utilities in the ecosystem.  1. One of the reasons for the 50% decline in referencing is the lack of incentive to provide detailed information. The R_Block ecosystem is powered by the referencing tool we have built, this collects data from real job applications. When a company pays CV tokens to conduct a reference, up to 50% of this fee is rewarded back to the referee. The network validators score the reference on how factual and detailed the data is. Then award the percentage of the fee earnt. The remaining 50% of the transaction fee is used for our buyback scheme.  2. Within the tech sector, we face another key issue. Workers get bombarded with approaches from recruiters whilst not looking for jobs so there's no incentive for workers to interact. There's frustration that there's no reward for time spent interacting and often Cv's and contact data is shared to no end. In the R_Block ecosystem, workers choose for their skills to become searchable. Companies search the network for profiles with matching skills then pay the worker in CV tokens to interact and reveal their full profile.  We've seen sites like Hired.com rise in popularity which empower the worker. R_Block goes one step further to empowering the worker by making sure they are paid for their time interacting.",True

We see skills and experience as no different. There have been many good whitepapers about Blockchain for prove of digital assets, one of my favourites is BitFury's - http://[Suspicious link removed]/1SzMmyo.  The second and arguably more important factor is the built-in anonymity it brings. We are trying to remove data abuse in hiring. Blockchain provides a network in which companies and workers can interact anonymously, purely based on proven skills. This has another very worthy benefit in destroying prejudice. In the R_Block network, it won't matter what university you went to, or where you come from. Companies will evaluate you purely based on your skills.",True
