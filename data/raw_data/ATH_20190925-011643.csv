Did you read the White Paper? I would be happy to explain it to you. Furthermore, I would like to highlight that we are about to release our demo version of the rating platform shortly.  Regarding the roadmap: there will be a more concrete version after the ICO when it will be clear how much of the funds can be allocated to the different milestones. In our opinion it does not make any sense to present some visionary milestones to that we can not fully be committed due to the uncertainties.  We fully agree to the point that a self-assessment of an investment project is necessary. We will not provide any investment advice on project but even more transparency and aggregated data to facilitate the investor's decision.  Hope this helps to better understand the project.

No average Joe is able to read and understand a whitepaper, to evaluate token design etc. or to even hang out here (honestly better that way).

WHAT IS ALETHENA?  Alethena is the first Swiss Blockchain-Asset rating agency. Reliable due diligence and a resulting rating are established by providing a professional, transparent, and in-depth methodology. Proudly transferring the values of its Swiss heritage, Alethena sets itself the highest standards of neutrality and independence.  A scalable and decentralised methodology is the definite goal to be achieved with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in the near future.               WHY ALETHENA?  To empower investments and thus drive market growth and maturity.  Alethena allows for truly neutral and independent ratings as its payment structure is designed to prohibit any potential conflicts of interest. Furthermore, Alethena renounces any additional services such as investment advisory and consulting for third parties.  In opposition to the majority of ratings there is and will be no way to promote, advertise, or even enhance visibility of an ICO.     ROADMAP          VISION  Alethenas vision is an entirely decentralised company and rating process. Legal and regulatory circumstances as well as the state of technology don’t allow for this yet but can already be outlined and anticipated. Efforts will be made to influence (primarily Swiss) politics and society to allow for the structural frame and acceptance of this innovative form of organisation.  More importantly Alethena will start immediately to assess and integrate Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence technology to enhance the rating methodology in terms of scalability and automation.     ABOUT US  We are a team of 13 highly motivated and dynamic colleagues with backgrounds from finance and investment analysis to building deep-tech digital products.  Together with seasoned strategic advisors with backgrounds in finance, behavioural science, Machine Learning, and the application of those topics in the blockchain sphere, we feel well-equipped towards our goal to shape the future of capital markets.

Either they are plain scams (e.g. a good rating is dependent on higher payments) or even if they have good intentions the factors taken into consideration are not adequate or sufficient. This way ICOs can't get fair ratings even if they pay enormous amounts of money and investors can't get unbiased information about ICOs.  We are trying to change this by building a solid due diligence methodology with a team fully based in Switzerland.
