However, despite all the efforts made, we have to take this extremely tough decision. It is that the work on the development of the project will be stopped because the project team considers that, under the present circumstances, the project idea cannot be realized. These circumstances are the result of both the objective time factor and some technical difficulties and the disagreements among the team members which have arisen in the course of negotiations. The financial questions relating to the project closure have been settled with the private investors, and all the funds received for pre-sale and pre-ICO have been paid back. We would like to express our appreciation and gratitude to all who supported the development of our project, in particular to the mentors and the participants of the bounty campaign. We are convinced that the idea which forms the basis of the project is very promising for the tourist business, and we believe that someone will surely realize it in the future. But for now, we present our apologies to you in connection with the decision we had to take. We wish you every success in your next projects and undertakings!

You don't mention how are you gonna value good experiences of customers in hotels and viceversa (hotels with customers). What if a customer breaks stuff in a room? you can't charge those costs directly without the customers approval.  It doesn't look solid.

I find your project very interesting! I am relatively new to cryptocurrency investments, and currently working to grow my portfolio. I am interested to invest a little of my money in it come the ICO sale.  But I would like to know if you have an e-mail address where I can send my CV? I am also interested to work with your team in the future to push forward the use of your platform in my country, and help make my investment worth every penny.  I agree that you should already be getting in touch with a number of hotels before your anticipated launch, which is mid-next year according to your timeline. A lot of business owners are skeptic about the whole concept of cryptocurrency, and with the bad light being shed by mainstream media, it may be tad difficult to penetrate the industry without giving some time to educate the owners/operators. Coming from the travel industry, I can also tell you that not many establishments agree to work with a number of booking platforms due to the gray areas in their reservation/cancellation policies that oftentimes don't uphold the best interest of the hotels/resorts and merely focuses on customer feedback/rating for their apps.  I have spent a couple of years in the tourism industry, am connected to a number of hotels, and have worked with local and national government in my country. Surely, there must be help I can offer or a task I can accomplish for you and your associates.  Praying all the best for this project!",False

How It Works    Many of us go traveling or on a business trip to a different country every year, booking accommodation on Booking.com, Agoda.com or Airbnb.com. There are several hundred of these platforms on offer around the world. They save you time on seeking a hotel, apartment or flat as well as save money by booking a room at a discount. All of them are similar, and in most cases, they are stand out from others only at the expense of a huge advertising budget.  How do the platforms earn?  Owners of hotels and apartments pay 10-25% of each reservation to online booking platforms.  Why Tetarise ?          ICO  A total of 100 million TTR tokens will be issued.  They will be offered on the Ethereum blockchain platform.  The TTR token offer will take place in two stages:  Pre-ICO — 15.11.17-15.12.17 — goal is $500,000  ICO — January 2018 — goal is $10,000,000.  Distribution of TTR tokens  70% of tokens will be placed on the Pre ICO and ICO,  25% will receive the project team,  3% will go to the mentors,  2% will be distributed to the bounty program.  Tetarise automatically pays 50% of the total obtained after tax profit to TTR token holders, in proportion to the size of each holder’s share in the total number of tokens.     Moreover!  We offer to each investor: who invested in Tetarise 10 ETH and more at the pre-ICO stage, and who invested in Tetarise 20 ETH and more at the ICO stage lifetime return of the hotel fees IN FULL at the level of 10-15%       Tetarise changes the online  booking market    busminer I'm not a project developer, I just help Tetarise post an announcement.",False
