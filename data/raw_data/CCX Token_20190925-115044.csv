Hello sir, With your message, you prove that not only you have no idea about our project, but you lack basic knowledge about certain notions. First of all, it is 10 million transactions per second for the exchange transactional system. Second, the ERC 20 token is totally separate and has nothing to do with other aspects, unless using it for its utility function. Third, they are not mineable because we generate all tokens off during the token generation event. The team tokens (as you can see in our White Paper and website) equate 15% of the total of tokens, and only 25% of them are dispersed for 4 years until they are gone. And third of all, GoLang is a programming language. What you stated is like saying C++ belongs to some other token. Which is nonsense, just like your comment. Leaving such a comment with only 3 activity on Bitcoin Talk makes me wonder if you are not in fact a troll, whose mission is to denigrate good projects just because you can.",False

Finally, it can be used for the purchase of premium functions such as the features I mentioned above.
