In developed markets we have credit bureaus - the big three are called Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, which are multi-billion dollar listed companies.  Equifax came under a lot of press coverage last year when they lost the data of 143 million people and businesses, risking their identities being stolen.  The centralised model has many problems, the most significant being: 1. You are exposed to data breaches - your data is only as good as the security of the bureau 2. No easy way to improve your credit score or sometimes even know what it is 3. The bureau makes money when they sell your data, not you 4. Data is fragmented and is often not even the same between bureaus - there is no single location of 'truth' 5. Usage is limited to whatever products the credit bureau has developed  Credible decentralises and improves the model across all these factors: 1. You control the keys to your records 2. Complete visibility as well as the ability to add new information.  Your data becomes your own asset to manage 3. You make money from your data 4. One source of truth 5. Decentralised collection, consumption and use of data.  Anyone can build new exciting use cases on top of the blockchain and monetise for their benefit and the benefit of merchants  Hope this answers your question!",False

We are building on Tendermint, a proof-of-stake BFT protocol focusing on the networking and concensus layers.  Three main reasons behind this decision: speed, security, scalability. Tendermint blocks can commit to finality in the order of 1 second and handle transaction volume at the rate of 10,000 transactions per second for 250 byte transactions. The bottleneck shifts to the application layer. https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/wiki/Introduction  Our database layer interface is through the Tendermint Application BlockChain Interface (ABCI) - https://github.com/tendermint/abci - where the application layer focuses on storing and managing the ownership of the encrypted credit data. This is where we layer the RPC logic, and ontop develop Explorer and interfaces like dApp (brower with Credible JS driver, mobile SDKs, etc).
