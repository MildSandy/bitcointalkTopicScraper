The ICO didn't meet any of the SEC requirements, of course, so Americans were blocked from participating.  But Americans could mine the coin themselves and buy it from other miners OTC.  All the while, Citicash kept promising an instant listing at the close of the ICO, etc.  None of this makes sense from a legal or regulatory perspective.   It looks like the founders said: ""ok, ICOs aren't allowed in the USA so we'll make a coin that meets that requirement AND which also is available to the U.S. market anyway because the Americans didn't think of that, so gotcha!""  Is that work-around functioning?  I can't see CCH listed anywhere and from my perspective it's going to be going through a world of hurt.   Not to mention: citicash?

Yes, well we are a pretty humble bunch. If you look at our sale, it doesnt even have bonuses, airdrops etc. we never intended to do some crazy hype type ICO so many things about it are not very typical. Only hired some crypto-marketing experts few weeks ago, but mostly we have worked on the product and the ecosystem, the marketing etc. was (I guess unfortunatelly) the last thing on our minds. But some of our guys are miners, so they will mine some more if they want I belive:)  Our main goal is to raise funds for the further development as we have poured hundreds of thousands into the project from our own pockets + some donations from our sponsors, but really we have a long road ahead and want to deliver top service, which means hiring more people for development, support, conferences, exchange listings etc. and that cost a lot of money, so even though you can mine CitiCash ever since the frist block we are hoping that people would come and support our project by participating in the public coin sale, as without those funds we will not be able to make this ecosystem work and the miners will not have that big of a use for their coins. Or at least it would make the road very difficult and much longer, so we wouldnt be able to deliver on schedule and would have to depend on donations.",False

CitiCash is a cryptocurrency that has been developed to spread among the global public. For this reason, the technical difficulty and choice of terminology have been adapted for users who do not have any experience with cryptocurrencies. CitiCash users will also have the chance to pay by crypto-wallet for goods and services in real life. CitiCash, like most decentralized currencies, is based on the CryptoNote protocol.   Properties  Easy to understand: All the necessary user tools have been developed in order to spread CitiCash among the widest possible global public. Obstacles in cryptocurrency being used by ordinary people are thus removed.  Payments: CitiCash owners can make non-cash payments in everyday life with standard debit cards that can be issued to any wallet.  Anonymity and security: To ensure security and anonymity we use RingCT (Ring Confidential Transactions). For transactions in the CitiCash network a mixin with at least 6 ""Ring Signatures"" is used.   Emission The total number of coins in the first 20 years is 1,000,000,000. Inflation will begin after 20 years, so in the year 2038. For this reason, 2,103,840 more coins will be released each year. A total number of 865,000,000 coins are reserved for community mining. The number of re-mined coins will be 130,000,000. Five million coins will be used as a compensation for the CitiCash development team.  Detailed overview: Total issue: 1, 000, 000, 000 coins Developer reward: 5, 000, 000 coins Public sale: 130, 000, 000 coins Coins for mining: 865, 000, 000 coins Inflation quantity per year (after extraction of 1, 000, 000, 000 coins): 2, 103, 840 coins   Coin Units: 1 NanoCash  = 0.000000001 CCH (10-9 - the smallest coin unit) 1 MicroCash = 0.000001 CCH (10-6) 1 MilliCash = 0.001 CCH (10-3)  Coin symbol: CCH    Hash algorithm: CryptoNight-Heavy  Emission scheme: The block reward changes every 6 months. Coins are released by an algorithm called “Camel distribution”. This algorithm has been inspired by the mining of rare commodities - for example, oil, precious metals, etc. Initially, fewer coins are released, later more coins, then a steep decline occurs, until there is full exploitation.
