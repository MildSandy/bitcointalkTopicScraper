Since then, our the first game integration Ether Online has gone on to be the top grossing game on the Ethereum blockchain—and DappRadar doesn’t even show PLAT spent. For this post, we wanted to share a quick update on our current progress and plans going forward.  In the past week, we have been focusing on improving and polishing the portal, migrating to the new infrastructure and deployment pipelines, and more. Some of the key changes include new chatrooms for different languages, richer analytics, and upcoming Ether Online airdrop functionality.  Most of these things are scheduled to go live today, along with our second game integration: Magic Academy! This is an exclusive game for the BitGuild portal created in partnership with another great studio. Yeah, we move fast.  Here’s a sneak peek of what to expect next: *Three more game integrations we’re working on with our new partners Axie Infinity, Eth.Town and Mythereum.  *Better mobile support. We realize that mobile adoption for Ethereum wallets is on the rise, and more and more players are using apps like Cypher and Trust Wallet to play crypto games. With that in mind, we’re going to focus on optimizing the mobile user experience and work with game developers to ensure that as many games as possible can be played on mobile.  *Marketplace! We’re currently working on our own marketplace for ERC721 tokens that will use PLAT as the main currency. All the games on the portal will benefit from this marketplace by default; no need to build your own if you integrate with us!  In other exciting news, we welcomed two new members to our team this week! We’re thrilled to have Shain and Calvin (both Senior Engineers) on board to help us build a new home for cryptogamers.

Like so many ideas or innovations before it, such as the transition to online services and Free-to-Play models, blockchain and crypto are going to be making an impact on games as we know them today — and if BitGuild has anything to say on the matter, it’ll be a change for the better.  There’s an inherent challenge to face though, because currently, blockchain games aren’t really games as your typical player would define them. Early blockchain titles such as CryptoCountries and CryptoKitties are shining examples of new ideas springing forth from the trenches in order to make an early impact, but can fall short in the eyes of someone like a seasoned console gamer.  These types of games have garnered a fair amount of popularity in enthusiast communities. However, while these new blockchain titles are doing something that hasn’t really been done before, and are quite profitable while doing so, daily active users are at relatively low number when compared to traditional gaming spaces. That’s hardly going to make much of an impact on gaming as a whole.  This isn’t because the games are bad, per se. It’s an expectations issue resulting from the fact that traditional gaming audiences and crypto gaming audiences are currently two very different groups.  Today’s mainstream gamer knows what to expect from their chosen experiences — they want good stories, tight and gratifying gameplay, and charming graphics. They generally believe games should be free, or have a fixed cost, optionally supplemented with DLC or cosmetic microtransactions. The type of games they play have roots reaching as far back as the days of coin operated arcade machines, and represent a natural progression based on the same concepts that were seen back then. This type of gamer isn’t generally accustomed to an entire genre based around the idea of gamified transactions that have real world value — it’s just too different!  Cryptogamers on the other hand, are currently represented by an audience that primarily comes from cryptocurrency enthusiasts — people fascinated with a new technology that facilitates true item ownership in online games. They play these games for a chance to win cryptocurrency prize pools, the main goal being to get higher returns than what they spent on the game in the first place. Player counts are still low, yet average amount spent per user is relatively high when comparing with more traditional formats, such as PC, Console, and Mobile platforms.  At BitGuild we believe there is room for both types of players, and our ultimate goal is to slowly bring the two together as we release innovative and fresh experiences. We aim to provide playable blockchain titles in a wide variety of flavors — hopefully offering up something appetizing for gamers from all walks of life.  Though early titles to make their debut on BitGuild, such as Ether Online and Magic Academy, are strictly in the “crypto” genre, we have several other titles in the pipes for people who are more interested in more traditional gameplay experiences.  Games such as Mythereum, a trading card game, are going to be among the first blockchain games that truly appeal to current core gamers. It’s akin to something like Hearthstone — the most striking difference being how assets are handled. In most current major digital card games, you don’t truly own your cards, and trading is restricted — all in an effort to promote more sales instead of creating a compelling ecosystem that will in itself drive sales. In Mythereum, you truly own your cards, and are free to buy, sell, or trade them as you please.  We also have ETH.Town coming soon, and while this title veers more towards the crypto side of the gaming spectrum, it incorporates a number of unique and innovative features that are aimed at melding classic gameplay systems with elements of newer crypto and trading focused titles.  As we progress, we hope to gradually merge the two groups of gamers, creating an audience and ecosystem that will pave the way for future generations of blockchain games to thrive in.  We invite you all to start playing games on www.bitguild.com right now!

Hundreds of completely free games with wildly varying degrees of quality hit the market, first on mobile devices, and later seeping into both console and PC ecosystems as well. This has helped introduce video games to a much wider audience, but it is also slowly shifting the scene into something scarcely recognizable to the original core audience.

Currency from one user can be converted to PLAT for sale to another user in another game.  This kind of transaction happens a lot today in gaming.  Some players of MMOs will offer trading of currency from the game they are playing for another game they are considering playing.  Usually, a different player will agree to such a trade and give them an equivalent currency value in exchange.  All this trading is done without a proper platform to make the process easier.  Actually, gold farmers are very common but it's nothing short of a clean exchange that one would expect.
