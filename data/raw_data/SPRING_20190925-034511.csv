If it is no you are a good researcher of information. Actually, we cannot believe every information on the internet. Every information on the internet not true always. So, you have to follow a few links or other information sources to check whether the information is true or not. But the mission of the springRole protocol is to create a linked a world which is authentic and reliable.  What is this springRole? Would you like to know more about the topic? Then here it is. Here I am not going to explain what is cryptocurrency as it is familiar to most of the users. Now let us jump into “springRole”. SpringRole is a blockchain based professional profile authentication and validation protocol has originated in the year 2014. The founder of this is Karthik Mandaville, who was a graduate of the School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. This has created to endorse the trust between community and companies. Their major objective is to solve the problems related to the profile validation which occur in today’s world.  How the SpringRole works with Blockchain? There are many companies, institutions or any other related organizations need to attest or verify the professional profiles. A user profile generally consists of educational qualification, professional qualification and skills. When a user makes an assertion of their working experience, educational qualification or skills, an authentication system will assure it as a real information and it directs to a validation (attestation). There are a few ways to do attestations; •   User educational skill verification by an educational organization •   User work experience verification by an employer •   An online certification of the user can be verified by the course offering authority If any of above has done at a time the information is saved in the blockchain permanently. So, the re-verification of the information is unwanted afterward. Furthermore, Attestation can be divided into 2; •   Soft attestation – the user verification can be done by the co-workers or the other representatives of the organization. •   Hard attestation – the user is verified by the direct entities when assertion requested by the user.  Who are the attestors? Attestors are the group of users which verify the trustworthiness of assertions. They may be individual, companies, institutions, course providing institutions or any other related organization.  Technologies that are used for the Platform •   Ethereum •   Smart contracts •   Core elements •   The Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) •   Civic Model •   TestRPC (Ethereum testnet node) •   Web3 (etherum adaptable API) •   Infura  Methods to earn tokens •   Refer any person •   Refer an organization or a company •   Receive rewards for attesting others •   Be a validator •   Completing the profile and getting attestation  Token details •   Token name: Spring •   Token Sale: $1,827,650 (present raised volume) •   Tokens for ICO: 2,550,000,000 •   Price for Spring: 0.00002 eth •   Soft cap: US $1mm •   Hard cap: US $12mm  For further token information, visit the website https://springrole.com/",False

He was also a Technical Advisor for Science Blockchain, Science’s blockchain startup incubator. He also served as CTO of LetMeKnow.com, an online portal for Indian college students seeking internships, scholarships, and more. Vice President of Business Development and Strategy David Lewis is an online business veteran. He started as a product manager for Software Technologies Corp, which was acquired by Sun Microsystems for nearly $400 million. He was the Director of Business Development for Overture Services, the first paid search engine that later ended up being sold to Yahoo for $1.6 billion. He was the Founder and CEO of 77Blue, which owned coupon and cash back websites AnyCoupons and Cashbaq. 77Blue was acquired by Ebates, which was later acquired by Rakuten for $1 billion. Lewis also served as Director of Business Development for Shopzilla, which at its peak was a $200 million+ revenue comparison shopping site. Having such an experienced business development expert will be of great help to SpringRole.  Advisors Advisors include the following:     Mike Jones – Mike Jones is CEO of Science, Inc. and has tons of experience not just as CEO of Science Inc. but as Senior Vice President at AOL, CEO at Myspace, and investor in companies like Goodreads among others.     Toni Lane – Toni Lane is a known name in the blockchain space and among other accomplishments, is the Co-Founder of CoinTelegraph, which also runs properties like Coinmarketcap, and was advisor to companies like Tether and Mycelium.  Verdict Below is a breakdown of the risks and growth potential of SpringRole.  Risks     No information on presale lockups or vesting – combined with relatively large contribution limits, a bit worrisome. (-0.5)     In terms of platform growth, who would pay to endorse someone’s skills or validate one’s credentials? Perhaps this would be of great use to employers and HR departments but adoption looks like it would be tough for regular users. Though it looks like a large portion of SpringRole funds is going towards adoption and market development. (-0.5)     Granted it’s still presale, but hype is a bit weak. (-0.5)  Growth Potential     Has a beta, which is promising from an implementation perspective. (+3.5)     Good team and advisors. (+3.5)  Disposition Though SpringRole has a relatively strong team and advisory board as well as a beta, lack of current hype and questions about the platform’s long-term viability don’t make it a clear winner for now. However, it could be something to keep an eye on if interest starts to grow. SpringRole receives a 5.5/10.

But can the workforce maintain its trust and integrity? https://bitcoingarden.org/the-freelance-economy-will-disrupt-workplace-realities-as-we-know-them-but-can-the-workforce-maintain...  It’s 2018, and the freelance workforce is taking over industries. According to a number of reports, independent consultants and freelancers will become a majority workforce within the next 10 years in countries like USA and India. In fact, many employees believe that their current jobs may not even exist in the future. They are constantly upgrading their skills as per industry demand and picking up various skills with earning potential.  While today’s freelancers are prepared for the future, there is a problem. Many of them find so-called “gigs”, mostly through references based on their past work. Gigs are short-term consulting projects largely based on a consultant’s skill and a company’s short-term goals. The problem is the frequency of gigs a freelancer can get. The unpredictability of work is the main area of concern for today’s freelancers. Many turn to online platforms to find work. These online platforms are basically freelancer-curated workplaces for companies to find reliable contact workers. On the other hand, there are many online curated short-term job platforms where freelancers can connect, pitch and get gigs.  [...]  Thankfully, there can be a solution for all the problems the freelance economy is facing today. Modern technologies, such as the blockchain, can complement the growth and support the highly unorganized, human-controlled industry. The company that I advise – SpringRole – intends to solve this problem. They believe that if offline verification of skills and genuinity can be eliminated, they can help carve a way for a trust-based economy. And that is why SpringRole is using the blockchain to build an attestation protocol for verifying professional profiles....",False

SpringRole is a decentralized attestation based professional network platform powered by the blockchain. People can view, share and get attestations on their professional profile, thereby creating a verified resume that they can share and use. A user’s educational qualifications and work experience are verified by the organizations themselves and written directly to the blockchain. To assess a user’s skill set, SpringRole has a system of weighted endorsements that let users objectively look at people’s profiles and assess their skill level. SpringRole empowers users in three key ways: They control and own their data - they decide on who gets access to their personal data. Users can create their verified professional profiles that help promote trust and genuineness. Users get paid for engagement on the platform for actions like messaging and endorsements.  I would advise you to go and read through our whitepaper, because a lot of your questions will be answered there, attestation is playing a big part of this.

It is a platform on which people can view, share and receive attestations in their professional profile, thereby creating a verified CV that they can use. SpringRole could be decribed as Linkedin but on the blockchain.  As you know, when hiring a job, the employer is primarily interested in genuine, reliable information about the candidate. Now with the help of the new platform all information about yourself can be stored in the created profile.  On the Spring platform, companies can post freelance projects on the vacancy board with Spring token rewards. Applicants can seek such opportunities and sign a smart contract with the company. After the completion of the project or the terms of the contract is fulfilled, the parties can exchange the work done for an appropriate reward.
