If this catches on, it will go to the moon! + Really good price on stock right now. Its 60 cent per share. I dont see this go much lower. If this gets on a bigger exchange the price to multiply several times depending on the size of the exchange. Now its just on 2 minor exchanges with a total 24h volume of 120.000 dollars. The small ones on Binance has x100 the trading volume. EDIT: While its a good price it was not so good price as I thought considering the majority (almost all) of tokens got sold at 10 cent in presale. I saw the rest ICO were priced at 35-85 cent, however just 9% of these got sold. I still think its a good price, but not so good as I originally thought. + Its seems like a very legit project. Very strong founders +Low market cap. I dont know how big circulating supply is right now. But maybe 50.000.000? If so, then market cap is around 30.000.000. Very good potential. +Crypto crow recommends it. BUT its a big setback that it was a paid review. However he is completely open about it. I feel Crypto Crow is one of the few legit ones on youtube. So my opinion is that he wouldnt recommend it if he really didnt like it. He seems very sincere and enthusiastic in his review. Judge for yourself.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAEjmxRLZv4&   - Horrendously bad ICO funding prices. The first ICO were sold at 10 cent (presale), while last ones were priced at 85 cent. Lowest were 35 cent for us that missed presale (general public?). According to this site https://icodrops.com/vezt/ only 9% of 25 million got sold. Well the ICO model is to blame for that one. People dont want to invest when they see others get in at atleast 350% discount. Why should i buy at 35-85 cent when I know alot got sold at 10 cent? Then i just feel like I get robbed. You see other ICO operate with like 5-25% discount. Very few has over 100% discount for early birds compared to the later ones. And this has up to 850%?? Completely price blunder  if you ask me. - Few updates and news last month Been trailing the internet and most of the news and updates is around october and november. New people can get the impression that this has died out. When they also see the graph being up to 4 dollar when it got to exchange and then below 1 dollar first day it just looks like all the support just sold and run. However this is very common to pump and dump when it gets to exchanges. -Hard marked to get into I dont know much about the music industry, but the labels will probably fight this hard. This means alot less money and control for them. This will probably result in billions of dollars less for the biggest labels.  I bought around 1000 VZT right now. I am considering 4000 more. How much VZT do you guys have?",False

As i wrote in my post most news and fuzz were around october and november. So i think alot of people have forgotten this project. Being on a small exchange with a total of 120.000 dollar 24h volume doesnt help either.  If it hits any major exchanges, the price will x2/x3 instantly, maybe even more. The marked cap is still very low. But as long as nothing major happens the price will sink slowly.  But i still believe this has a huge potential. The price can x100 if many artists get into this. However this doesnt happen over night. x100 is far from unrealistic. x10/x20 is very likely in 2018. But its all up to the team. ",False

What price were those tokens? We had a private sale via SAFT and PPM for accredited investors. We closed the SAFT round at around $3.5 million for equity and accredited investors.The earlier investors (equity investors and accredited investors) got a blend of 10, 20, 25c+ tiers. Equity being the lowest as they are owners in the company and are a blend of venture capitalists and hedge fund investors. A lot of material information and business decisions were not available yet, which meant higher risk for early backers which was rewarded with higher discounts. These investors helped fund the Vezt team to hire more team members and developers, as wellas cover the marketing and legal costs for setting up the TGE.  So the pre-round was $3.5M and the general token sale will be for $11.45M.  You can also find more info on their Telegram  https://t.me/joinchat/F_38d0NlVp_oQfB0S5u1Fg",False

Thanks for sharing your thoughts.  We encourage you to check out full playlist of Veztimonials. Two artists were so excited about Vezt that they recorded special shout-outs right away on their own: Hip Hop Artist King Chip and Superstar Producer and Rap Star Dre.  Another thing you'll want to consider is the deep industry experience we've got on our team. Jeff Blue, for instance, is our SVP of Artist Relations and produced Korn and Linkin Park, wrote songs for Macy Gray, Better than Ezra, and more. Our Head of A&R is Tim Devine, an industry legend who has worked with everyone from Paul McCartney, the Beastie Boys, Bonnie Raitt, and Katy Perry. We guarantee you've listened to music these guys helped bring to the world in the last day or two.  Finally, there's one last thing to consider: we are not building a music library. Our focus is not on distribution. We're not trying to become iTunes or Spotify. Instead, we focus on the financing. We are buying rights to various tracks to demonstrate the power and reach of the platform. Our aim is to give artists more control over their work and help get them paid more efficiently. Even that singer-songwriter you dismissed out of hand (and who has been busting her ass for 10 years to make it in the business) realizes the far-ranging possibilities that will come when she can share ownership of her songs with her fans.  If you have any questions, please feel free to drop me a line personally at michael@vezt.co. We also encourage you to talk to other investors in our Telegram channel. Thanks again for your interest!

Spot on!  However, we do want to correct what seems to be a common misperception: we are not trying to become a music service like iTunes or Spotify. That's distribution. Our focus instead is on the financing and the intellectual property.  We are buying rights to various tracks to demonstrate the power and reach of the platform. Not to build a music library.  Our ultimate aim is to give artists more control over their work and help get them paid more efficiently. We've held meetings with unsigned artists, young artists still in the early phase of their career, and well-established artists. They've all realized the far-ranging possibilities that will come when they can share ownership of their songs with their fans.

Instead, we are focusing on our core mission: letting music fans share ownership with artists in their favorite songs.  Incidentally, that's not licensing a song or paying for access to listen. It's actually owning a portion of the rights to it.  Here's a little more on how it works:  Artists and rights holders choose how much they’d like to raise from a part or fraction of their song, the reversion term and set a date for the Initial Song Offering (ISO™). Rights-buyers (including fans, music professionals and brands) on Vezt, buy song rights during the ISO™, and the artists receive funds credited to their account immediately. The song rights information is encoded on Vezt’s blockchain. Song royalties are then collected from Performing Rights Organizations (“PROs”) in 137 countries around the world, as well as STEM.is, which aggregates digital performance royalties from Spotify, iTunes, YouTube, Pandora, etc. Vezt transfers those earnings back to the artists and rights-buyers, creating a new marketplace, with no limits on new and exciting music artists will create.  You can also take a look at this blog post for more details on how it works as well as our new FAQ.  Thanks for the great question!

Fractional song monetization for artists through Initial Song Offerings (ISO™) Social media sharing of both artist and rights-buyers activity and playlists Royalty tracking and collection in 137 countries around the world Allows fans, rights-buyers and brands to buy rights across a wide variety of songs and playlists  Vezt lets artists choose which portions of their songs to offer for sale to fans, friends, rights-buyers and brands in a monetization process called an Initial Song Offering™ (ISO). On the back-end, Vezt provides tracking and royalty collection on all ownership interests through its blockchain-based smart contract technology. Earnings are received quickly and transparently.  Here’s how an ISO works: Please see this blog post for details and infographic Artists select a song and choose the ISO date, how much of their rights to raise (ex. $10,000 for 10% of their songwriter rights), and the reversion term (3 years, 5 years, 10 year, or in perpetuity). Rights-buyers on the Vezt platform (including fans, music professionals and brands), buy the rights during the ISO. The artist receives the funds immediately. The song rights information is encoded on the Vezt blockchain and royalties are collected from both Performing Rights Organizations (“PROs”) in 137 countries around the world and STEM.is, a service which aggregates digital performance royalties from streaming services such as Spotify, iTunes, YouTube, Pandora, etc. Vezt registers the rights with PROs and digital platforms, and pays them through to artists and rights-buyers. Please see this blog post for details and infographic.   Video Testimonials  Producer Johnathan Greenaway on Vezt  Music producer / DJ Johnathan Greenaway on why he'll be putting his songs up on Vezt: ""As a song they've purchased rights for becomes more successful, they reap the monetary benefits as well”  Independent Music Artist Brittney Bouchard on Vezt (click to view)  Independent Music Artist Brittney Bouchard explains why she is putting her music on Vezt: ""Vezt is great because my fans can actually have part ownership in my songs.""

Vezt is a company building an app-based platform that lets artists offer percentages to the rights of their songs for sale to fans, friends, rights-buyers and brands. Vezt plans to track and collect royalty income via its blockchain-secured, app-based platform starting in Q1 2018.  What is Vezt's mission? We believe that music is one of the few mediums that can literally transform life. It can provide solace and comfort to those hurting or in need, joy and excitement to an experience or event, and even has the ability to transcend time and space with the emotional nostalgia that hearing a favorite song can trigger in one’s mind. It’s powerful and magic and we think it’s worthy of our efforts to provide its creators with the ability to be fairly and transparently compensated for their work and talent.  Our mission is: To provide artists with an equitable and transparent platform to easily and quickly monetize new or existing songs To allow fans, friends, rights-buyers and brands to partner with artists on a song-by-song basis, sharing directly in whole or fractional IP ownership To create a true marketplace for songs, where tracking and collection of royalties and licensing income is transparent and in real time To deliver to artists the opportunity to make a living from the fruits of their work, without unnecessary impediments that keep them from focusing on what truly matters - their music To strengthen the relationship between artists and those that appreciate their music, in a meaningful way, where a true partnership can be formed and mutual benefits derived  What are the problems Vezt aims to solve? Today’s music industry is fragmented, leaving most artists with few options to generate real income growth. Record labels and music publishers are only focused on a few blockbuster releases. Both developing artists and successful, established artists alike are constrained to heavily unbalanced deals that rely on antiquated protocols which lack transparency. Individual songwriters often have copyrights in numerous compositions, but have no way to directly monetize their rights, or to develop new income streams outside the traditional publishing model.  Vezt aims to provide a solution for all of this.  How does Vezt help solve these problems? Vezt lets artists choose which portions of their songs to offer for sale to fans, friends, rights-buyers and brands in a monetization process called an Initial Song Offering™ (ISO). On the back-end, Vezt provides tracking and royalty collection on participation interests through its blockchain-based smart contract technology. Earnings can be received quickly and transparently.  Who does Vezt primarily benefit? Vezt primarily benefits three groups: ARTISTS: Any artist can benefit from Vezt. With the ability to finance music creation and collect royalties without unnecessary intermediaries, music creation can become a profitable business again for the artists. RIGHTS-BUYERS: Savvy music professionals (producers, A&R, promoters, managers, etc.), institutional rights-buyers (pension funds, mutual funds, etc.), and brands can benefit from a robust song marketplace, where tracking and collection of royalties and licensing income is transparent and in real time. MUSIC FANS: United in their love for music on a meaningful level, music fans now can translate their passion into true partnership with artists on a song-by-song basis.  What is the Vezt's development roadmap and timeline? We expect to have a demonstrable prototype in September of 2017, and a fully-functional MVP by the end of Q4 2017. Q3 2017 - Complete back-end and blockchain development and integration Q4 2017 - Onboard and white-glove 3 artists through the platform, complete MVP Q1 2018 - Beta launch, add selected artists and rights-buyers, product testing and improvements Q2 2018 - Release platform to all artists and rights-buyers  Why is the Token Generating Event only open to non-US purchasers? Even though we do not believe the VZT is a security, our legal team has recommended this TGE structure to as an abundance of caution to comply with US securities laws..  What will the funds raised during the Token Generating Event be used for? Funds will be used to further software development (including back-end API and blockchain development and integration, node development and integration), international expansion, marketing and business development, legal and accounting, operational expenses and customer service costs  Please visit our website at vezt.co[/list]",False
