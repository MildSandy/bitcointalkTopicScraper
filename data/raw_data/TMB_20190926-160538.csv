What market is the development target for? The potential market, covering Smart Green House (SGH), seems to be growing rapidly on the horizon of the next 5, 10, 15 years. The observed trends unequivocally point to the formation in the near future of the Smart Green House (SGH) industry, which will have a decisive influence on the nature of production processes, the types of joint activities and the way of life of people in general. In this regard, we not only develop a platform, but also study how the future industry of Smart Green House (SGH) technologies can be organized, which sectors of the new market will be most promising, and what types of new business projects may be most in demand. • At the same time, works are performed in related areas, the systemic effect of convergence is not obvious and the space of the new industry is still a ""blue ocean"" - a space with low competition, in which it is possible to place a strategic stake of both the state and business • The global market potential is estimated at billions of dollars, covers all of humanity and relies on ""eternal"" needs.  4. Financial model The financial (economic) model of the project is based on sales of three types of products: 1. Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL) - high-strength composite structural material, based on solid wood. 2. Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) - cross-glued wooden slabs for walls and ceilings for residential and non-residential buildings. 3. Smart Green House (SGH) - a unique integration of the latest developments in the field of wood processing and carcass construction. In general, the collection of funds is planned to be completed by 2019. In the first half of 2019, work will be carried out to modernize production. Thus, the start of sales is planned at the end of the second quarter of 2019, and the first profit will begin to accumulate in the third quarter of 2019. When carrying out profitability calculations, we considered two scenarios -stable and positive. A stable scenario is the case when, as a result of the ICO, we manage to raise 3 million dollars by 2019. In this case, we manage to complete all the necessary work on the modernization of production and the start of production, but for mass production of SGH and sales of collected funds is not enough. As a result, revenue per 1 token in 2019 will be 0.4 cents, in 2020 - 2.7 cents. In a positive scenario, as a result of the ICO, we are able to raise $ 7 million by 2019. In this case, we manage not only to complete all the necessary work for sustainable operation and production start-up, but also for mass production of SGH. As a result, revenue per 1 token in 2019 will be 0.9 cents, in 2020 - 5.7 cents.
