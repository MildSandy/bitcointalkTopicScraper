Its function is to:  Accept orders; Find matches among the orders as quickly as possible; Create a trade when a match is found.  Order matching works in such a way that every trade is made at the best price possible. For example, if someone offers to sell ETH at price $100, and a user places an order to buy ETH at price $120, then the engine will match the orders and make a trade at $100 if the algorithm determines that $100 is the best price for order execution. Our objective is to provide high-performance order matching engine allowing users to trade instantly even during a high load period. As such, the entire exchange architecture is built upon the exchange engine and will include:  Implementing advanced order types; Managing user balances, moving the funds from one trader to the other when a trade is made; Calculating the fees, subtracting them from the trades; Recording user trades, generating reports on individual trading profitability; Processing deposits and withdrawals, which includes running a full node for every coin traded on the exchange; Market history generation, providing the market data over time and via various timeframes; Margin trading and lending (to be introduced later); A high quality front-end environment that provides an instant-response user interface.  To maximize security, our exchange will use cold wallet storage, multi-signature wallets, and smart contracts. The exchange will also provide a high-quality API to allow automated trading.

Regarding Xera, though most of the features are included in whitepaper, I would like to mention a few here. Every industry has problems and exchanges are no different. In existing or upcoming solutions, how many exchanges have we seen with so many order types, liquidity solution, notification mechanism, auto-trading feature based on defined indicators and preferred trading strategies? There are gaps and we are trying to fill them. Apart from this, we see poor engine capacity and high latency. We have worked hard to optimize our engine to bring to a speed of 2.6 million transactions per second. Speed is important, latency is important, especially when crypto market is still so volatile and price fluctuates multiple times with every second. Our POC engine is already uploaded on website and that shows functionality and speed of engine. We will more than happy, if you want more explanation on this. Another great part is Off-chain Database Layer. Given the expected volume of orders, the expansive selection of order types, and the required analytics components of the XERA platform, it is prudent to utilize an off-chain database layer to mitigate possible network bottlenecks and congestion. Implementing an Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) would allow higher throughput as only a hash reference to the data is sent to the blockchain layer. This all improves throughput.  Despite hundreds of exchanges now to choose from, traders and investors continue to seek out the best, most convenient and efficient platform. XERA enters as a major upgrade to existing exchanges on the market and expects to see rapid adoption in near future. XERA solves the most pressing issues faced by exchanges; including data security and protection from hacks, lack of liquidity, high latency, limited automated trading functionality, and rising fees. We are still way behind in customer support in comparison to traditional trading. Even with few biggest exchanges, try to get your password reset or any other technical issue and we felt, that is area, we have huge scope of improvement.  Eventually, we are going to integrate fiat integration, which again, will make XERA different from many others. Along with this, DEX is on the way, as we understand importance of Decentralized system. Consequently, XERA team is in the process of mapping the technological infrastructure for a DEX that provides access to a larger cryptocurrency market while also implementing a substantial number of additional order types that mirrors what traders would expect from a traditional exchange. We strongly feel we are different and while development is still in progress, we have full confidence that we will implement what we are promising.  In our team, we choose proven partners and everybody is legit and you can see their LinkedIn profiles. We are proud to have such experienced people in our team. We are initial phase of crypto world and we are way behind in comparison to traditional trading.  SEC states - The Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change because it does not find the proposal to be consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interest""  That means, commission found that the proposed fund was too susceptible to fraud and market abuse. Unless we fix this important issue and give more confidence to Government, it is difficult to regulate virtual currencies.  These are few things, we feel, we are doing better. Hope I was able to explain. For more details, please refer our whitepaper or feel free to ask more.",False

It is a centralized exchange, which will be changed into Decentralized in next phase. There is reason behind, why we are not launching DEX directly. Several of the current DEX systems have a narrow cryptocurrency focus. For example, Airswap is a P2P DEX for trading ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Certainly, given the number of ICOs that have launched their enterprises by using the ERC20 compatible token protocol, this severely limits trader choice to a single cryptocurrency type. 0x is also a P2P DEX that centers on ERC20 tokens and the Ethereum blockchain, which presents the same limitation issue as Airswap. The reason for using Ethereum is evident; aside from the number of ERC20 compatible tokens issued between 2017 and 2018, Ethereum’s smart contract logic has the longest proof of concept to date and allows for more complex auto-executed and auto-enforced transactions. Of the 244 DEX systems listed on the Index Github repository, 49% of decentralized exchanges are still in the development process, while only 36% are currently live and in operation. These facts support the reality that designing and launching a DEX is a protracted process which contains a number of iterative steps from conception to deployment. Our objective is to be a comprehensive cryptocurrency trading platform that is not limited to one type of token, facilitates the execution of variety of different order types (from the most basic to the more complex), contains all of the benefits of a DEX, while also being easy to use for beginning traders. That being stated, we have chosen to initially launch a centralized platform as the first step in our iteration towards a DEX platform. We are confident that the features we offer to beginning and advanced traders, along with a compendium of trading pairs, holds a unique value proposition amongst the current centralized exchange competitors.",False

That's how, we have so many features embedded in this solution. And these are very prominent issues, which users face on current solutions. Apart from this, you mentioned few other problems. One aspect of Price Manipulation is because of front running. It is already in our discussion to keep order book on blockchain, which will prevent exchange to place any order. But timeline of this solution is not yet finalized on developent discussion so we have not mentioned in whitepaper yet. Coin shilling is not contolled by just exchange, but there are various external factors, which will impact hype and price. At exchange level, we have our standard internal process of project evaluation, without which, any project will not be listed on our exchange. You can see on our website, we have finalized 7 projects so far. We evaluated them, had discussions with their developers and then finalized. We are committed to present trading only with good projects, not just by hypes. It is a centralized exchange, which will be changed into Decentralized in next phase. There is reason behind, why we are not launching DEX directly. Several of the current DEX systems have a narrow cryptocurrency focus. For example, Airswap is a P2P DEX for trading ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

Authenteq’s identity management system requires people to verify that they are human in a sign-up process that takes 90 seconds. You have to use your smartphone to capture your image, selfie style. Then you take a picture of your some other form of sovereign identification. Authenteq verifies that the images are of you, and that the ID card is legitimate. Then it associates you with a login account that you are creating, without giving away your identity. Authenteq stores a hashstring on the blockchain that, if checked, simply verifies that you are a human who opened an account. It will not keep your picture or your identification information once it has been put through the verification. If it ever becomes necessary to re-verify your identity, it will look up the hashstring on the blockchain, which is a secure and transparent decentralized digital ledger. With passports, Authenteq can read an encrypted chip for verification. By not storing the data, Authenteq ensures that it won’t force customers to give up their privacy. For instance, if law enforcement comes to the website and demands to know the identity of a person behind an account, neither the platform owner nor Authenteq will be able to turn that information over because they won’t have it.

I explained similar question earlier and would like to mention here again for you. We agree that there are many ICOs for Exchanges, in process or releasing soon. Regarding Xera, though most of the features are included in whitepaper, I would like to mention a few here. Every industry has problems and exchanges are no different. In existing or upcoming solutions, how many exchanges have we seen with so many order types, liquidity solution, notification mechanism, auto-trading feature based on defined indicators and preferred trading strategies? There are gaps and we are trying to fill them. Apart from this, we see poor engine capacity and high latency. We have worked hard to optimize our engine to bring to a speed of 2.6 million transactions per second. Speed is important, latency is important, especially when crypto market is still so volatile and price fluctuates multiple times with every second. Our POC engine is already uploaded on website and that shows functionality and speed of engine. We will more than happy, if you want more explanation on this. Another great part is Off-chain Database Layer. Given the expected volume of orders, the expansive selection of order types, and the required analytics components of the XERA platform, it is prudent to utilize an off-chain database layer to mitigate possible network bottlenecks and congestion. Implementing an Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) would allow higher throughput as only a hash reference to the data is sent to the blockchain layer. This all improves throughput.  Despite hundreds of exchanges now to choose from, traders and investors continue to seek out the best, most convenient and efficient platform. XERA enters as a major upgrade to existing exchanges on the market and expects to see rapid adoption in near future. XERA solves the most pressing issues faced by exchanges; including data security and protection from hacks, lack of liquidity, high latency, limited automated trading functionality, and rising fees. We are still way behind in customer support in comparison to traditional trading. Even with few biggest exchanges, try to get your password reset or any other technical issue and we felt, that is area, we have huge scope of improvement.  Eventually, we are going to integrate fiat integration, which again, will make XERA different from many others. Along with this, DEX is on the way, as we understand importance of Decentralized system. Consequently, XERA team is in the process of mapping the technological infrastructure for a DEX that provides access to a larger cryptocurrency market while also implementing a substantial number of additional order types that mirrors what traders would expect from a traditional exchange. We strongly feel we are different and while development is still in progress, we have full confidence that we will implement what we are promising.  In our team, we choose proven partners and everybody is legit and you can see their LinkedIn profiles. We are proud to have such experienced people in our team. We are initial phase of crypto world and we are way behind in comparison to traditional trading.  SEC states - The Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change because it does not find the proposal to be consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interest""  That means, commission found that the proposed fund was too susceptible to fraud and market abuse. Unless we fix this important issue and give more confidence to Government, it is difficult to regulate virtual currencies.  These are few things, we feel, we are doing better. Hope I was able to explain. For more details, please refer our whitepaper or feel free to ask more.  Thanks",False

The purpose of securing a proper authorization ensures that regulations should not interrupt operations and affect financial assets of our investors. We would break the answer in two parts:  1- We are already associated with an entity, who is helping us to secure Crypto trading license. To align with timelines, we also mentioned same on our Roadmap (2018 Q4 - Establishing regulatory adherence for Fiat acceptance in various countries). Since it's still in process, we would keep updating its progress. There are various licenses depending upon the jurisdiction and we would announce that on our newsletter as soon as it's finalized.  2- Banks are blocking accounts due to suspicion of money laundering. This is true for few countries and there are some valid reasons behind it. Money laundering is a real headache for government. But if we have proper KYC/AML in place and in alignment of the licenses, we should be in a stronger position with our investors. Please note that we are in an early phase of the Crypto market and the Governments are opening opportunities for Crypto trading. We will be in alignment with regulations with valid paper work in place.",False
