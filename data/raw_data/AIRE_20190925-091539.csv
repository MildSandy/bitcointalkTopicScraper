The referral program works as follows: After you performed the KYC process (identity verification) successfully on your token sale account, you see a link. Share them with your friends or followers, our system tracks how much they invested, and you receive 5% of the BTC they spent directly after the token sale. The requirement is though that they spend at least 1 BTC collectively through your link.  You can already get your referral link, just sign up on our website.  Hope that helps  ",False

We facilitate a new concept called data-transactions, which makes it economical to store data directly on the blockchain. This means, unlike file storage solutions like STORJ which only store a hash of your file on the blockchain while storing the file off-chain, we store the entire data directly and immutably on the blockchain. Your data can not be lost, that is the huge advantage compared to STORJ which can only guarantee that your file was not corrupted.  You can learn more about Data Transactions here: https://docs.wavesplatform.com/technical-details/data-transaction.html",False
