Product manufacturers purchase checkitsreal products and QR codes using CIRTokens.  This is the only form of payment we accept.  This means that there is a significant demand created for CIRTokens by the business / manufacturing community.  This demand increases significantly year on year, as the company grows.  The amount of CIRTokens issued is fixed.  Given the constant demand by manufacturers for CIR, considerable market liquidity will be created, helping to add value to the CIRTokens themselves.
