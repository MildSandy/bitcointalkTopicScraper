From the legal point of view we already have signed over ten NDA agreements with official regulatory bodies. Our GG World Lottery will be available on national lottery websites. You can get acquainted with our white paper https://ico.gg.international/whitepaper .  In the near future we will release Token Smart Contract source code.
