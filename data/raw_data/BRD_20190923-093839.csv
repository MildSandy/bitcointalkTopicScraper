This new feature builds on a partner integration with Simplex to allow high limits and near-instant delivery. Based on user feedback We designed this new feature by listening to our customers and basing our decisions on the most common customer complaints: 1) It’s difficult and time-consuming to get “verified” on an exchange or online brokerage. 2) The daily limits are often too low to permit acquiring substantial amounts of bitcoin. 3) Delivery of bitcoin can take a week or more when purchasing with a bank account. Bread solves these problems by providing same-day delivery of bitcoin with limits up to $20k per day and $50k per month, and by having users complete identity verification right in their Bread. No more copying and pasting deposit addresses or switching back and forth between desktop and mobile devices. Another thing we discovered is that service fees were not a top concern for our users. Since the volatility in crypto markets is so drastic, people are less concerned with the price than they are with having the ability to get bitcoin quickly the instant they want it. We’ve used this feedback to offer a solution that best balances fees against the other advantages of using the service. This new feature joins two existing purchase options in Bread: ACH transfer in the US, and in-person purchases through ATMs and convenience stores in multiple countries. By offering multiple options that differ in terms of cost, speed, and convenience, we enable our users to make a choice based on what is most important to them. Why use Bread instead of an exchange? In the crypto community, you’ve probably heard something along the lines of “If you don’t control your private keys, you don’t control your bitcoin.” This means you should never entrust your bitcoin to a third party (custodian) for longer than necessary. Exchanges offer great services for trading digital assets, but this creates a security problem. Custodians must hold large amounts of cryptocurrency all in one place, which presents a target for hackers and thieves, and any time an exchange is targeted customer funds are put at risk. With Bread, your bitcoin is delivered directly into the safety of your personal wallet, where you alone control the private keys. You get the service of an exchange without taking unnecessary risks. As we expand, we will offer a broad set of financial services that enable you to use digital assets seamlessly in your daily life, and this is one more step in that direction. At the core of our model is gold-standard security, giving you the confidence to utilize cryptocurrency in the real world.

Crowd sale to begin December 15th, raising $20M.  Bread is one of the largest and fastest growing digital currency companies, with 750,000 customers in over 140 countries, protecting billions of dollars worth of bitcoin.  The Bread team announces a large scale expansion of their platform, transforming the company from a simple bitcoin wallet to a fully functional decentralized financial platform for cryptocurrency holders. The expanded platform will retain the ease of use that is so compelling for entry-level cryptocurrency adopters but will now provide the support, functionality and flexibility that can be found in more traditional fiat based financial institutions. The added ability to manage Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum-based tokens within your Bread wallet will be the first of several improvements.  Many banks and credit card companies offer loyalty programs to retain users and increase the value of their products. As Bread progresses towards becoming the world's largest, decentralized financial institution, they will now launch their own loyalty rewards program, Bread Token or (BRD). This will be a digital asset built on Ethereum that users will be able to hold in their Bread wallets.  Token allocations A maximum of 160,000,000 (160M) bread tokens will be issued, and will be priced at 900 BRD tokens per 1 Ethereum.   ● Up to 106 million tokens may be sold to participants.   ● 32M tokens will be used for administrative costs surrounding the token sale, including giveaways in marketing campaigns, airdrops to current Bread users, partners, etc.  ● 22M tokens will be retained by Bread to support future roadmap development, operations, and grow the Bread brand.  Bread tokens will bring various benefits to Bread customers. For instance, paying with Bread tokens will provide a large discount on service fees when buying or selling bitcoin or Ethereum through the app. Secondly, the more BRD held by an individual customer, the greater the perks, such as a dedicated support phone number, access to early pre sales of qualified ICOs, and exclusive invitations to events around the world. Additional premium services will be rolled out gradually.  Join our Telegram https://t.me/joinchat/HclhZw3y3wyfPchdgyTOcg  Learn more about Bread's expansion and Bread Token rewards.
