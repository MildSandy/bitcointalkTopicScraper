This roadmap will outline Iryo’s core development for the upcoming year. The team is looking forward to surpassing the milestones set below and will ensure to keep the community updated as frequently as possible in regards to future partnerships and new devlopments.  The development team currently consists of our CTO, Dominik Žnidar, two backend developers, a front-end developer, product manager and UX designer. We recently shared a post that discusses how we’ve designed 3rd-party access, which gives secure and transparent access to a person’s health data to those who are not part of the Iryo Network.   The first version of the Network will be deployed in refugee camps throughout the Beqaa Valley in Lebanon in the beginning of May. The platform will be piloted by the Walk With Me organisation (run by the non-profit organization Tying Vines, Inc.), an NGO that has close to 6,000,000 displaced refugees that will be able to test the platform.  The deployment will feature a front-facing application for healthcare providers (doctors, nurses and administrators), a secure and distributed storage protocol (on local servers and Iryo’s cloud) and a patient app for Android that will enable efficient patient identification. The platform will cover different types of workflows and support healthcare data specifically for primary healthcare services. See appendix for the complete list.  After gathering feedback and testing within the environment, Iryo will extend the network to Jordan in June, and then to four more countries by fall of 2018 (Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Djibouti).  Roadmap Q3 2018 · Integration with EOS mainnet. · Utilizing EOS public ledger for a distributed access control list. · Data fingerprinting on EOS to ensure data immutability. · Healthcare providers IRYO token staking. · Testing of Nucypher’s SDK for proxy re-encryption.

In the event of a health emergency, there is a doctor at their side with knowledge and access to the President’s entire health history and who can ensure the best delivery of medical services. But, what about the rest of us without the luxury of having a doctor on our payroll?  In the event of a health emergency, the portability and interoperability of our medical history and records will greatly impact the health outcome. I recently experienced how the lack of portable and interoperable medical records in an emergency situation endangered the health of my child. In describing the experience, I will be intentionally vague on some details in order to protect the privacy of my child.  On a Thursday morning, my child was experiencing severe pain. We immediately went to the pediatrician’s office. An MRI scan was performed. The pediatrician was unsure how to treat the situation and instructed us to come back if the condition got worse. The condition did get worse on Saturday night. As the pediatrician’s office was closed, we went to the hospital emergency room. Neither the hospital nor I had access to medical records generated at the pediatrician’s office a couple days ago, so another MRI was ordered and evaluated as well as other tests. The team of doctors at the hospital recommended immediate surgery but wanted to get the opinion of a specialist before proceeding.  However, another complication arose. It’s late Saturday night and there isn’t a doctor in my region with the needed speciality. Even if a specialist was found, it was unknown how the hospital would be able to immediately transmit my child’s medical records to the specialist with full data integrity and security. Fortunately, the hospital staff found a specialist still awake in a city 130 miles away and figured out a way to transmit the medical records.  Thankfully, once the specialist saw the MRI scan, he saw that my child had been misdiagnosed and didn’t need surgery. Instead, my child fully recovered from the condition about a week later. Despite this fantastic outcome, I was shocked how the inability to access and share medical records posed a significant health risk to my family and almost caused my child to have an unnecessary surgery.   To address this issue, Iryo is building the tools that create unified health records of globally interoperable medical data with openEHR archetypes that empowers patients to take their medical histories with them. Unified health records, solidified by the adoption of blockchain enable patients to have secure access and allows them to selectively share their medical history with any medical professional, anywhere in the world.  In the case of my child, with the adoption of the Iryo network, I could have possessed the MRI scan and other medical records generated at the pediatrician’s office. I could then have instantly shared that medical data with the hospital emergency room doctors and the specialist and arrived at a quick and accurate diagnosis. With Iryo, we could have avoided 5+ hours in the emergency room, wasted MRI and other medical tests, and wasted hours of several medical professionals’ time.  Iryo will not only aid in better health outcomes, it will also make healthcare delivery more efficient and reduce waste.  https://medium.com/iryo-network/iryo-delivering-better-health-outcomes-d5aeb55cab63",False

When talking about interoperability in healthcare, the key problem lies in how data is written in the first place. Universal interoperability could be achieved if all doctors recorded data in the same structure. This is a very generalized description of what openEHR is: an agreed set of forms for different specialties, defined by surgeons for surgery needs, cardiologists for cardiology needs, and so on. OpenEHR is not a standard for engineers but a standard for medical professionals.  As stated on openehr.org »OpenEHR is a virtual community working on means of turning health data from the physical form into electronic form and ensuring universal interoperability among all forms of electronic data. The primary focus of its endeavour is on electronic health records (EHR) and related systems.« The idea of a global EHR In a previous post I shortly touched upon interoperability. Well, in an ideal world, interoperability would not be important at all. Can you imagine a one ubiquitous EHR system all over world that serves all mankind? In this scenario, every one of us would have access to their medical data at any time and any location. But as we all know, the reality is so far from this utopian dream (at least for now).  Lock-in based business models as the unfortunate reality in healthcare! Medical records management systems have traditionally been developed by software developers that typically designed a database and a user interface on top of it in order to support the work processes of healthcare personnel. And as time passed by, they were doing business as usual and introduced changes to the data model and to the user interfaces. And developers were the ones who knew what the data model actually means. Even more, these data models were not owned by healthcare organizations but by the software companies — in spite the fact that healthcare organizations are typically the owners of the data they produce. So imagine what you can do with raw data without the data model schema that tells you what this raw data really means!  100% article you get here : https://medium.com/iryo-network/what-is-openehr-6927822b1c69",False

Iryo delivering better health outcomes There’s an important reason the Presidents of the United States travel with their personal physician. In the event of a health emergency, there is a doctor at their side with knowledge and access to the President’s entire health history and who can ensure the best delivery of medical services. But, what about the rest of us without the luxury of having a doctor on our payroll?  In the event of a health emergency, the portability and interoperability of our medical history and records will greatly impact the health outcome. I recently experienced how the lack of portable and interoperable medical records in an emergency situation endangered the health of my child. In describing the experience, I will be intentionally vague on some details in order to protect the privacy of my child.  On a Thursday morning, my child was experiencing severe pain. We immediately went to the pediatrician’s office. An MRI scan was performed. The pediatrician was unsure how to treat the situation and instructed us to come back if the condition got worse. The condition did get worse on Saturday night. As the pediatrician’s office was closed, we went to the hospital emergency room. Neither the hospital nor I had access to medical records generated at the pediatrician’s office a couple days ago, so another MRI was ordered and evaluated as well as other tests. The team of doctors at the hospital recommended immediate surgery but wanted to get the opinion of a specialist before proceeding.  However, another complication arose. It’s late Saturday night and there isn’t a doctor in my region with the needed speciality. Even if a specialist was found, it was unknown how the hospital would be able to immediately transmit my child’s medical records to the specialist with full data integrity and security. Fortunately, the hospital staff found a specialist still awake in a city 130 miles away and figured out a way to transmit the medical records.  Thankfully, once the specialist saw the MRI scan, he saw that my child had been misdiagnosed and didn’t need surgery. Instead, my child fully recovered from the condition about a week later. Despite this fantastic outcome, I was shocked how the inability to access and share medical records posed a significant health risk to my family and almost caused my child to have an unnecessary surgery.    https://medium.com/iryo-network/iryo-delivering-better-health-outcomes-d5aeb55cab63",False

CAUTION: A LARGE NUMBER OF ATTEMPTED SCAMS HAVE BEEN REPORTED. THE IRYO TEAM WILL NEVER CONTACT (PM) YOU FIRST. DO NOT SEND ETH OR EOS TO ANYONE WHO MESSAGES YOU PRIVATELY ON TELEGRAM OR VIA EMAIL.  Presale As previously mentioned this presale window will be open for 1 week, starting March 28th and will carry a 30% discount. Only those successfully whitelisted are able to participate.  There will be a minimum contribution of 1ETH or 80 EOS. The maximum individual contribution will be capped at 1,300 ETH or 104,000 EOS.  The contribution will have a floating ETH and EOS exchange rate. This means we will not be converting your contribution to IRYO tokens immediately. We will wait until the ICO and convert your contribution to IRYO tokens based on the price of ETH and EOS at that time. If, for example, the ETH or EOS price in USD will double by then, you will receive twice the amount of IRYO tokens you would based on today’s price at the same fixed supply of IRYO tokens with the same hardcap. The same principle applies for a movement of the ETH and EOS price in the other direction.  The funds raised in this round will be held in an escrow account and will be returned in full if the softcap during the ICO is not reached. The escrow account will be officially managed by IUURI Legal.  You will always be able to check the balance on the publicly available ETH address and will be able to verify that the funds have not been moved or used.  Contributing to the Presale To contribute to the presale during this window, please ensure you have successfully been whitelisted and have a non-exchange wallet address registered in your Iryo whitelist portal.  The official Iryo Contribution address is: 0x5944410fF48Cb8bc0A99Be6a31A2eD11CeA8Cd54 The address will be listed on this post, in our Telegram alerts channel and on our presale video found here. For your safety, verify the accuracy of the Iryo Contribution address from at least two sources before sending your contribution. Once ready, please send your intended contribution amount to the official Iryo contribution address.  Min. Contribution: 1 ETH / 80 EOS Max. Contribution: 1,300 ETH / 104,000 EOS  You will receive a confirmation email shortly after contributing  Acceptable Wallets & Security Measures Please note that contributions made from an exchange wallet (i.e Binance, Bitstamp, Bittrex etc.) will NOT be accepted. These wallets are incompatible and we will be unable to send future EOS based tokens to these addresses.  Based on the fact the Iryo will hold its crowdsale on EOS mainnet, contributors must have an EOS compatible address to contribute to the general crowdsale. We recommend that you set up your wallet after EOS mainnet goes live in June and update your contribution address accordingly. We will communicate further instructions closer to the general crowdsale.  For people that already have an EOS public address, you will be able to register your wallet once the presale opens. You can update or change your wallet address by logging in to your whitelist portal here.  If you do not have a wallet, some popular choices are MyEtherWallet, MetaMask, and Jaxx.  Security Measures  Iryo Team members will NOT contact you directly. Beware of scams that offer a higher bonus rate. The team will never ask for funds through email or Telegram.

Both sectors lag behind in digital development compared to other industries, which is why we wish to be the frontrunners or even co-creators of advancements in practice. In Iryo, we found a forward-thinking strategic partner who shares our views on the needed paradigm shift around the patient experience in the healthcare system and our high expectations of healthcare data protection and ownership in the future,” says Gabriel Škof, President of the Management Board of Adriatic Slovenica.  https://medium.com/iryo-network/iryo-teams-up-with-adriatic-slovenica-insurance-company-to-disrupt-healthcare-e5568d0e8e85",False

This transforms on-the-ground care, while keeping costs low, and facilitating opportunities for medical professionals and education experts to help from anywhere in the world; an incredible way to walk with us on the journey.”  During the preliminary research phase of Iryo, the decision was made to dedicate a substantial portion of Iryo’s efforts to improving the foundational elements that will be needed in order to improve and advance modern day medical research. As part of the yearly inflation, Iryo will dedicate a minimum of 50% of the newly minted Iryo tokens to internal or external medical R&D initiatives that will pave the way for new innovative products. The first practical example of that is the partnership with the Ljubljana Simulation Centre, with which Iryo’s special team of IT-researchers is developing one of the first practical cases of augmented reality in the medical world.

This presale window will carry a 30% discount. In order to participate, contributors must have passed the KYC/AML checks during the whitelisting process. If you were successfully whitelisted you would have received a confirmation email from Iryo stating the status of your whitelisting was successful.  If you have not whitelisted yet, you can still do so by going to this address: https://whitelist.iryo.network. Please note that whitelisting will take some time and you should not send any funds before your whitelisting is confirmed.  Below you will find information regarding the presale and how to participate. Please be advised that the general crowdsale dates have been moved, find out why here.  CAUTION: A LARGE NUMBER OF ATTEMPTED SCAMS HAVE BEEN REPORTED. THE IRYO TEAM WILL NEVER CONTACT (PM) YOU FIRST. DO NOT SEND ETH OR EOS TO ANYONE WHO MESSAGES YOU PRIVATELY ON TELEGRAM OR VIA EMAIL.  Presale As previously mentioned this presale window will be open for 1 week, starting March 28th and will carry a 30% discount. Only those successfully whitelisted are able to participate.  There will be a minimum contribution of 1ETH or 80 EOS. The maximum individual contribution will be capped at 1,300 ETH or 104,000 EOS.  The contribution will have a floating ETH and EOS exchange rate. This means we will not be converting your contribution to IRYO tokens immediately. We will wait until the ICO and convert your contribution to IRYO tokens based on the price of ETH and EOS at that time. If, for example, the ETH or EOS price in USD will double by then, you will receive twice the amount of IRYO tokens you would based on today’s price at the same fixed supply of IRYO tokens with the same hardcap. The same principle applies for a movement of the ETH and EOS price in the other direction.  The funds raised in this round will be held in an escrow account and will be returned in full if the softcap during the ICO is not reached. The escrow account will be officially managed by IUURI Legal.  You will always be able to check the balance on the publicly available ETH address and will be able to verify that the funds have not been moved or used.  Contributing to the Presale To contribute to the presale during this window, please ensure you have successfully been whitelisted and have a non-exchange wallet address registered in your Iryo whitelist portal.

For your safety, verify the accuracy of the Iryo Contribution address from at least two sources before sending your contribution. Once ready, please send your intended contribution amount to the official Iryo contribution address. Min. Contribution: 1 ETH / 80 EOS Max. Contribution: 1,300 ETH / 104,000 EOS You will receive a confirmation email shortly after contributing Acceptable Wallets & Security Measures Please note that contributions made from an exchange wallet (i.e Binance, Bitstamp, Bittrex etc.) will NOT be accepted. These wallets are incompatible and we will be unable to send future EOS based tokens to these addresses.  Based on the fact the Iryo will hold its crowdsale on EOS mainnet, contributors must have an EOS compatible address to contribute to the general crowdsale. We recommend that you set up your wallet after EOS mainnet goes live in June and update your contribution address accordingly. We will communicate further instructions closer to the general crowdsale.  For people that already have an EOS public address, you will be able to register your wallet once the presale opens.

Don' miss the train     Iryo’s all-inclusive concept provides new ways of medical data monetization possibilities while at the same time minding the user privacy and security. This is why you won’t regret supporting Iryo.  1. Company recognized on the governmental level  Alongside the community driven recognition, we are now officially recognised by the Government of Slovenia, which highlighted the Iryo project in the “Implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” government report, mentioning Iryo as a company “taking an active part in achieving Sustainable Development Goals in 2018.”  2. A growing developing industry  E-health market is on the rise. Mordor Intelligence predicts an annual growth of 15% till the year 2021, when the market value will reach more than 200 billion USD. Similar to Mordor, Grand View Research Inc predicts the market value to grow up to 250 billion USD by the year 2022. At the same time more and more countries are encouraging the investments from the political point of view, with US, China and Germany leading the pack.  3. Iryo stellar partnerships  Iryo has established several partnerships in the last few months in it’s pursuit of impacting healthcare globally:  - Iryo will provide the IT infrastructure needed to improve the quality of healthcare for the refugees in the camps in the Middle East. The first deployment is predicted to be implemented in Lebanon in May 2018. - The first practical example of that is the partnership with the Ljubljana Simulation Centre, with which Iryo’s special team of IT-researchers is developing one of the first practical cases of augmented reality in the medical world.  - Iryo is joining forces with Adriatic Slovenica health insurance company (AS) to offer patients in Slovenia better and safer access to their health records.  See Adriatic Slovenica’s press release At the same time, our seed investor is the Slovenian tech company 3fs, we are partnering up with tech companies ZeroPass and Microsoft to further our development, improve on the existing version of Iryo network and reach worldwide implementation.  4. Privacy-first product  Iryo offers an effective and proven answer to the industry-wide problem of secure storage of patient data. Iryo is building a decentralised, zero-knowledge data storage with using blockchain as a permission control tool. Your data. In your hands.  5. Expanding token economy potential  The Iryo token will be used in many ways. You can use it as a patient for medical services inside the Iryo system. You can use it as a researcher to purchase medical data needed for your research.  A rich token ecosystem guarantees frequent and wide token usage. The token usage is focused on frequent events, insuring an active and vibrant market.  With a vision of building a strong company, Iryo is allocating 90% of the tokens to the community. As part of the 2% yearly inflation, Iryo will dedicate a minimum of 50% of the newly minted Iryo tokens to internal or external medical R&D initiatives that will pave the way for new innovative products.",False

Crowdsale Update So far more than $18 Mio USD worth of ETH & EOS have been committed to Iryo’s crowdsale. We are thrilled to have such strong community support, however, after careful and thorough consideration the team has decided to push back the dates of the upcoming crowdsale.  The Iryo ICO will now officially be held on EOS once mainnet is live and stable (June or July of 2018). The exact date and time of the new crowdsale will be communicated as soon as possible. The softcap of $8 million USD and hardcap of $26 million USD will remain unchanged.  Why are we changing the crowdsale dates?  The State of the Market: Current conditions are turbulent, even for crypto standards. We have seen the price of Ethereum plummet from an all time high of over $1,400 USD in January to a current price of just over $500 USD, more than a 60% decrease in price. At the same time, the crypto community has been facing increasing legal uncertainty (e.g. https://www.coindesk.com/icos-iced-12-month-freeze-us-token-trading-just-beginning/). However, there have been positive signs in terms of regulation and adoption such as the recent G20 Summit and news coming out of South Korea. (e.g. https://www.coindesk.com/south-korea-may-lift-ico-ban/). Iryo aims to be highly compliant to ensure the long term value of its token for its future holders. Whales: We are thrilled over the amount of funds that are currently committed and are looking forward to increasing that number. However, we have had a relatively large share of so called “whales” in the current whitelist and would like to see a more even distribution of IRYO tokens. EOS Mainnet: Moving forward with this decision, we will be one of the first ICOs to hold a crowdsale on EOS. The team initially debated on which platform to hold the ICO. By holding it on Ethereum, members would have had to eventually perform a token swap to migrate over to EOS once launched. This seemed feasible given the bull market in Q4 2017 but now the costs and risks involved with doing a double issuance of tokens and a token swap are becoming prohibitively high. After careful consideration and weighing the benefits, we have decided to wait and hold the ICO directly on the EOS platform. Are we still going to have a presale? Yes, as many of you have already whitelisted and have shown interest in participating, we will still be holding a pre-sale for everyone who has successfully whitelisted or will attempt to whitelist in the next few days.  This pre-sale round will hold a 30% discount as a courtesy to those who have shown their confidence in the project. The contribution will have a floating ETH and EOS exchange rate. That means that you can potentially receive a higher discount than you would have in the originally planned pre-sale. If the ETH/EOS appreciates between now and the ICO in June, you will get additional IRYO tokens. The ETH & EOS price will be fixed shortly before the crowdsale.  The funds raised in this round will be held in an escrow account and will be returned in full if the softcap during the ICO is not reached. You will always be able to check the balance on the publicly available ETH address and will be able to verify that the funds have not been moved or used.  We will share the detailed instructions on how to participate in this new pre-sale round tomorrow. Until then, we are available on our Telegram channel to answer any questions you might have.  In order to support the ongoing product development and community building, we will potentially also hold an additional private round and sell up to 5% of total token supply.  Conclusion Pushing back the crowdsale dates was a tough and controversial decision, however, the team strongly believes it will be the right call moving forward and appreciates the support we’ve received around this decision. We excel through community driven feedback and are always open to hearing what the community has to say.  Best regards,  Vasja, Iryo Co-founder & CEO",False

Refugees are one of the most vivid examples of the importance of medical data being accessible to the patient first. All across the world, patients currently have little or no power over access to their own records. Furthermore, medical data is scattered across different institutions among different care providers — all struggling with a lack of interoperability. Medical experts consequently do not have an accurate picture of their patients. Doctors have no option but to work with incomplete information about an individual’s medical history, medication and needs when treating people abroad, for instance.

He worked for a Swiss startup, delivering a music streaming service shortly before joining 3FS, where he was directly invovled in supporting the biggest social media network in Mexico. At its peak, the network was supporting more traffic than Wikipedia globally. Vasja has recently worked as a consultant to Fortune 500 companies and strongly believes that blockchain has the potential to revolutionise industries that have traditionally seen little advances through IT. As leader of the Iryo team, Vasja will aim to build the next generation healthcare platform, addressing current downfalls like data security, global interoperability and self-soverign medical identity.   Dominik Žnidar (CTO) is a senior backend developer, specialised in Golang, Erlang and PHP programming. He has been with 3FS for over 3 years, working shoulder to shoulder with Vasja on highly demanding, large-scale IT projects.

We are thrilled to have such strong community support, however, after careful and thorough consideration the team has decided to push back the dates of the upcoming crowdsale.  The Iryo ICO will now officially be held on EOS once mainnet is live and stable (June or July of 2018). The exact date and time of the new crowdsale will be communicated as soon as possible. The softcap of $8 million USD and hardcap of $26 million USD will remain unchanged.  Why are we changing the crowdsale dates?  The State of the Market: Current conditions are turbulent, even for crypto standards. We have seen the price of Ethereum plummet from an all time high of over $1,400 USD in January to a current price of just over $500 USD, more than a 60% decrease in price. At the same time, the crypto community has been facing increasing legal uncertainty (e.g. https://www.coindesk.com/icos-iced-12-month-freeze-us-token-trading-just-beginning/). However, there have been positive signs in terms of regulation and adoption such as the recent G20 Summit and news coming out of South Korea. (e.g. https://www.coindesk.com/south-korea-may-lift-ico-ban/). Iryo aims to be highly compliant to ensure the long term value of its token for its future holders. Whales: We are thrilled over the amount of funds that are currently committed and are looking forward to increasing that number. However, we have had a relatively large share of so called “whales” in the current whitelist and would like to see a more even distribution of IRYO tokens. EOS Mainnet: Moving forward with this decision, we will be one of the first ICOs to hold a crowdsale on EOS. The team initially debated on which platform to hold the ICO. By holding it on Ethereum, members would have had to eventually perform a token swap to migrate over to EOS once launched. This seemed feasible given the bull market in Q4 2017 but now the costs and risks involved with doing a double issuance of tokens and a token swap are becoming prohibitively high. After careful consideration and weighing the benefits, we have decided to wait and hold the ICO directly on the EOS platform. Are we still going to have a presale? Yes, as many of you have already whitelisted and have shown interest in participating, we will still be holding a pre-sale for everyone who has successfully whitelisted or will attempt to whitelist in the next few days.  This pre-sale round will hold a 30% discount as a courtesy to those who have shown their confidence in the project. The contribution will have a floating ETH and EOS exchange rate. That means that you can potentially receive a higher discount than you would have in the originally planned pre-sale. If the ETH/EOS appreciates between now and the ICO in June, you will get additional IRYO tokens. The ETH & EOS price will be fixed shortly before the crowdsale.  The funds raised in this round will be held in an escrow account and will be returned in full if the softcap during the ICO is not reached. You will always be able to check the balance on the publicly available ETH address and will be able to verify that the funds have not been moved or used.  We will share the detailed instructions on how to participate in this new pre-sale round tomorrow. Until then, we are available on our Telegram channel to answer any questions you might have.  In order to support the ongoing product development and community building, we will potentially also hold an additional private round and sell up to 5% of total token supply.  Conclusion Pushing back the crowdsale dates was a tough and controversial decision, however, the team strongly believes it will be the right call moving forward and appreciates the support we’ve received around this decision. We excel through community driven feedback and are always open to hearing what the community has to say.  MORE https://medium.com/iryo-network/crowdsale-update-ef12ee4a19b8",False

Sometimes for a good reason, if consumer applications are not clinically validated and additional data can bring more noise that signal.  In the States, where healthcare system is private, more market-driven than in Europe, medical institutions are leveraging from innovation and digital health solutions more. By encouraging their doctors to be creative, they have all the resources to create clinically validated apps and platforms. If these new solutions succeed, they create a new revenue stream to the medical institution. They can improve patient care and lower costs.  Increasing the quality of care is tightly connected to the data gathered from these institutions. If data formats are effectively used, data gathering and data analysis can lead to better treatment decisions. Proper data analysis will hopefully lead to crucial discoveries around the root causes, not just the triggers, of diseases. This will eventually speed up the time it takes to find cures for current and future diseases.  However, connectivity and interoperability among institutions and platforms is still far from an optimal state.  Blockchain solutions are offering new opportunities that can help address some of these issues. More than 40 projects utilizing blockchain technology in healthcare have been started in the last two years. Their ultimate goals are to assist in redefining access to healthcare, health insurance, efficient treatment, increasing transparency and protecting patient data.  “Innovation, when done right, will make technology invisible.” As a former journalist and podcaster, I constantly research and follow how different medical experts and creative specialists around the globe think, how different healthcare systems work and how they approach innovation.  It is clear that there is no one size fits all solution to solving the issues related to healthcare IT. There are just too many varieties of healthcare systems, payment models, culture, patients and doctors. But one can always learn from best practices.  This thought — “Innovation, when done right, will make technology invisible,” stuck with me most this year during an interview with Rasu Shrestha, CIO of UPMC (University of Pittsburg Medical Center). It is a thought reflecting what is needed for doctors to reclaim time for their patients and patients to reclaim time to live. In some respects we are already there: ingestible, implantable, surroundable sensors and implantable drug release mechanisms are what allows chronic patients to forget about their disease.

What’s the story?  We believe that so far technology has actually let down the whole healthcare community. Whereas IT has really helped other industries become more efficient and helped consumers use services more effectively, the same is not the case in healthcare. There are many reasons for this, including cultural and political barriers, but it is certainly true that most European citizens can think of examples of healthcare IT failures in their own systems.     Coinschedule: What is Zero-knowledge data storage and how is it different from distributed data storage methods?  The notion that privacy and control come through centralized regulation is an incorrect one, the effective management of data happens when an individual has full control over his or her device.  Iryo perceives the medical data it holds as a “toxic asset”, because we believe that holding too much data in one place presents too large a liability risk.  The solution to managing this risk is zero-knowledge data storage which is resistant to all attacks, including state-actors or “inside jobs’’. This works by way of users encrypting their data on their mobile device(s) with a public key.  A private decryption key remains on the patient’s device. Whenever someone wants to access patient data (a doctor or researcher, for example) the patient has to approve their access. This will be done by the patient clicking “yes’’ in their Iryo EHR app. This gives a re-encryption key to the doctor’s public key. You can read more under the “Private key management section” to understand the details of this process and the application to the edge cases.  Copies of encrypted health records are stored on three geographically and managerially redundant storage nodes.     Coinschedule: Does Iryo network store data on public blockchain? If yes, isn’t it contrary?  Contrary to popular belief due to aggressive marketing, blockchains are not a good solution for storing data. Each piece of information that you store in the blockchain sits in hundreds or more nodes (more than 100 000 in case of the Bitcoin), making it very costly. This is why the Iryo Network doesn’t store data on blockchain but uses blockchain to ensure the transparency of transactions.  Some projects pretend to be using blockchain by using ’private chains’ which are usually just re-branded databases. Private chains use some elements of blockchain technology but miss key elements thereof like the oversight offered over the validity of the stored data.  Public blockchains are mainly used for two things; value transfer (including initial creation and distribution) and trustless timestamping of the messages.     Coinschedule: How are you planning to implement Artificial Intelligence over it?  Iryo network is using the AI learning on the distributed and encrypted data from the users of Iryo network. Since the data is encrypted and not even AI can access it without patient permission, we are using the so-called “analyze in place” anonymous query which takes data, applies a formula to it and then only sends back the result of the query without leaking any personal information that can be compared with other databases.  At the same time, the researchers are using Iryo tokens to incentivize the patients to share their anonymized data, which is then used in clinical research.     Coinschedule: From each side, what benefit does it provide to medical practitioners and patients?             Researchers will have access to larger research populations which would result in more robust research results. They will be able to use the Iryo Research Portal to enroll people with specific health conditions as determined by parameters selected by them. Direct access to EHRs of specifically defined patients can decrease the time required for patient recruitment, thereby potentially decreasing pre-recruitment process costs. Typically, recruitment agencies and services need to first attract potential patients and then check their eligibility. This can be a lot more time consuming than a query in the Iryo Network.  Patients will be alerted to their identified modifiable risk factors for disease and indicators that may suggest the early onset of disease. Once correlations are clinically verified, users would get the anonymous queries that would seep into their data and present them with actionable advice. For example, they will receive information on which health care provider they need to consult and which tests would be beneficial for them to have. Those queries would not be reported back and would remain on the patient’s phone. With Iryo’s innovative design, patients now have the option to not share their health information but still receive research results – something that has not been achieved until now.     Coinschedule: What is the utility and mechanics of IRYO tokens?  All institutions would have to provide a stake of $10 000 worth of IRYO tokens for their accounts (this value is adjustable). This would serve as spam protection – the app won’t ‘talk’ to 1 000 fake institutions that do not have IRYO tokens who would most likely be attempting to spam users. It would also act as a transparent metric on the chain. More accounts with enough tokens should mean more institutions are using the system. Institutions would include organizations such as hospitals, clinics, and research institutes. The clinic staking requirement would be used to cover the cost of storing EHR data for their patients. Should the data per patient exceed the threshold, clinics would have to stake more tokens to cover the cost of data storage. Patients would be able to cover their storage costs by staking coins themselves; that way they can become independent in storing as much data as they want to (as long as a sufficient number of coins are staked). If they exceed the limit, or the staking requirements suddenly change, they would not lose the data but, over time, their access would be increasingly limited until the stake is supplied. Actual hardware costs would be covered with 1% yearly inflation. Therefore, more data stored would mean more coins staked, which, in turn, provide price pressure to make that 1% yearly inflation worth enough to cover all the storage cost (and then some). With health record query tokens researchers would be able to incentivize end users to allow anonymized queries. Health data never leaves the patient’s device (phone), or the device of the doctor whom the patient has assigned access privileges to. Researchers would have to buy the tokens from the market and distribute them to the users that allowed the queries on their health data to be executed. The amounts can be very small and sent to thousands of people at the same time. High fees could kill this model. Cases of medical emergency. When a patient can’t give consent for access to his health data, the hospital can lock $1 000-worth of tokens (adjustable) in the smart contract which gives the patient permission to withdraw the tokens in one month’s time if the access was not illegitimate. If it was a true emergency, the patient (or their doctor with pre-approved access to the patient’s medical records) would confirm access the next day and the smart contract would return the funds to the hospital. If no action is taken within one month, the funds are refunded to the institution that staked them. Services in the clinics who have adopted Iryo could be paid with IRYO tokens instead of credit cards. Volatility, usability challenges with the security of tokens and the limited ability of the end user to purchase tokens on short notice would probably result in this option being used infrequently and/or when patients is traveling abroad. Coinschedule: Will your clients (clinics and patients) be able to pay through IRYO tokens for the services?  When it comes to the token economy aspect, we now have thousands of different tokens or coins or cryptocurrencies out there. Clearly, not all of them will survive but what is important about the growth of the token economy is that using tokens helps to align the interests of end users with other actors in the system.  Our current, outdated health systems usually have a top-down approach that doesn’t incorporate the users’ point of view at all. Healthcare IT solutions are sold business-to-business so they tend to serve the needs of the system rather than of the patients. By issuing tokens, suddenly you involve patients directly in their care and you are telling them that their opinions matter. End users can be part of the system and influence how it operates which will drive change from the bottom up and fundamentally alter the landscape of healthcare technology.  When a patient can’t give consent for access to his health data, the hospital can lock $1000 – worth of tokens (adjustable) in the smart contract which gives the patient permission to withdraw the tokens in one month’s time if he deemed access unjustified. In case of a legitimate emergency access, the patient (or their doctor with pre-approved access to the patient’s medical records) would, when able, confirm the emergency access and the smart contract would return the funds to the hospital. If no action is taken within one month (or other specified timeframes), the funds are returned to the institution that staked them.  Volatility, usability challenges with the security of tokens and the limited ability of the end user to purchase tokens on short notice would probably result in this option being used infrequently. With mature adoption, we could see tokens being used in situations where transaction costs using traditional payment methods are prohibitively high.     Coinschedule: Can you brief us a little about  1% yearly inflation rate mentioned in your whitepaper?  The aforementioned 1% yearly inflation would cover the storage costs and offer the development subsidy to ensure continuous Iryo Network development and provide sustainable future for IRYO token holders, even when the initial funds run out. Until the platform is unavailable to the public, the inflation tokens would be burned.  The 1% inflation recipient would be a multi-signature account controlled by Iryo. Iryo would issue reports on how this money was spent. Should the token holders not be pleased with the development of the service, they would be able to fork the token contract to a new one, which doesn’t have a development subsidy or has a different group who collects the inflation.     Coinschedule: What are the security risks associated with it? What if the patient loses the key or device?  If you lose your keys, you lose the data, credentials, and value that is encrypted. It is for this reason that encrypted services provide a nerve-wracking experience for most people. Some services are trying to solve this problem with recovery codes that should be printed out and put into a safe drawer.  It is safe to say that there is no mobile printer on your phones, and there is no mobile safe drawer. Most people don’t have “safe drawers”, not even in their homes. In reality, this approach is not practical for the user and rather has a stronger role in providing the service provider with immunity against legal and reputational liability.  While many other projects re-introduce centralized solutions for key recovery, the Iryo Network takes a different, more distributed route.  In the Iryo Network, private keys are everywhere. These keys can be grouped into patient keys, doctor keys, clinic keys, Iryo keys and token holder keys.  Assuming that the patient doesn’t have a second device with the same key, (patient medical data encryption key), the simplest answer is that they can visit their doctor, who can use his device to issue a re-encryption key back to patients’ new device. Together with signed permission message, this would replace patient’s wallet private key with a new one.  If a patient doesn’t want to visit his doctor every time their device gets destroyed, they can save (and move) the key to the ZeroPass app (explained later in this paper) using a one-click magnet link. When keys are protected with ZeroPass, a patient can revoke the ability of his doctor to re-assign his key, leaving the patient in full control.  If the patient’s personal doctor performs an ‘access recovery’ instead of recovering a master key via ZeroPass, the patient’s wallet would be emptied. This is because the doctor can’t recover the actual keys but can only give access to patient’s new key. Using ZeroPass solves this problem. Whenever a patient receives an IRYO token he will be asked to secure them within the ZeroPass web of trust.  The ZeroPass’ distributed and trustless recovery service can be used. In practice, patients would simply click on the magnet link inside the IryoEHR app, that would save (and move) all his/her keys; from IryoEHR to the ZeroPass app, automatically.  For clinic and Iryo keys, the ZeroPass 4Teams app would be used.     Coinschedule: We’re also excited to know about your current and future partnerships.  Right now, we are most proud of our partnership with a global NGO Walk with me which is helping out refugees throughout the Middle East. We are providing them with the IT infrastructure needed to improve the quality of healthcare for the refugees in their camps. Medical care is currently provided in prefabricated containers with fully stocked with basic medical equipment.  Tele-consults are provided through the collaboration with Ver2 — Dubai based telemedicine company, whose CEO Brian de Francesca is in the Iryo advisory board. Initial deployment of the Iryo EHR system will begin in refugee camps located throughout the Beqaa Valley of Lebanon, soon followed by the implementation in five other countries (Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Egypt, and Djibouti).  Iryo is discussing deals with telemedical providers which would like to use Iryo network for a structured, safe and transparent mean of exchanging data between the supply and demand side. Iryo is also in talks with some other healthcare providers and will share more information as soon as we are able to. Iryo has a contract signed around R&D of augmented reality using holo-lens for the purpose of accessing and presenting medical data in medically stressful environments, demanding extremely fast response (ER activity).     Coinschedule: And who are the brains behind this exceptional idea? Can you run us through their credentials?  The Iryo team was assembled and initially funded by 3FS — an innovative Slovenian IT firm focused on providing digital consulting to Fortune 500 companies across the globe. The products & services deployed by 3FS are extremely robust and large-scale, built by some of the most talented developers in the world. The Iryo team is fortunate to have access to its R&D ar and proud to have such a collaborative and supportive team backing its efforts.  Slovenia currently ranks 3rd amongst the number of ICOs per million inhabitants. The strong tech community gives Iryo immense support with the development of blockchain solutions and access to legal experts.  Vasja Bočko (CEO) was a product lead at 3FS for over two years. Soon after, joined Bitstamp as a senior product manager — one of the oldest and most respected cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.

Coinschedule: Any last word on blockchain technology and how excited you and your team are to be the part of this revolution?  Being involved in the Iryo project, presenting it all over the world in New York, Singapore, London, Geneva, Dubai, San Francisco, Bangkok and Austin we could see the genuine interest in the problems we are trying to solve with Iryo. The digitalization of healthcare across the world is plagued by many problems that exist because of vendor lock-in, legacy software, insufficient privacy, and security awareness. At the same time we have been talking to doctors and medical staff, decision-makers and users of medical services noticing the prevailing sentiment – we can do better. We are hoping Iryo will be a small piece of the puzzle.",False

A universal health network Building a truly open and global healthcare network requires some out of the box thinking. Since the Iryo Network is being developed from the ground up, one of the challenges we were faced with was developing a way for doctors outside of the network to interact with Iryo patients.  This will be one of the most necessary yet challenging aspects of initially scaling the network. In order to keep the patient in firm control of his medical data at all times, we had to design a universally accessible network that allows permissible access yet remains protected by several layers of security and privacy.  Iryo’s platform enables patients to leverage their medical data by allowing them to store their encrypted medical histories within the Iryo mobile app. The encryption presents a barrier for doctors that practice outside of the Iryo Network, however, with patient enabled permissions, doctors will be able to view and re-encrypt regardless of their network.  Proxy re-encryption powered by NuCypher, would enable doctors to generate a set of temporary, private & public keys through the Iryo portal. This would allow a view request that would be sent to the patient via an instantly generated QR code which the patient would then review and either approve or deny the request directly on his device. After approval by the patient, the doctor would be able to view the relevant sections of the patients medical record. After the session runs out (enforced by the issued blockchain access permissions), the re-encryption key gets wiped out, and storage nodes stop serving encrypted data to that specific source.  There are no passwords involved at any point, and doctors will not be able to view data if the request is denied. This presents a revolutionary change in the way that sensitive data is handled and assures total control and ownership by the patient.  Additionally, this type of 3rd party access request is view-only, the new doctor does not have permission to write any new data into the medical file or modify the existing data contained within the file, preventing any sort of tampering.",False

Iryo proposes to create a participatory healthcare network with a modern electronic health record system. Refugee camps in the Middle East is its first real-world use case.  By adopting openEHR medical standards and being open-source, Iryo hopes to address the issue of medical record interoperability as well as offer an improved user experience for patients, healthcare workers, managers and researchers.  The problem Iryo faces Across the world, patients have little or no control regarding how they interact with their medical records. For example, in the UK, GPs and hospitals own medical records – not patients. The same applies in the US. In effect the majority of medical data scatters across different institutions and amongst different healthcare providers – all struggling with a lack of interoperability.  To complicate matters further, many patients may have to see multiple specialists. This obliges them to carry around copies of their records (if they are even provided by their doctors or specialists) as they travel from one healthcare provider to the next.  From a medical perspective, doctors often have little option but to work with incomplete medical histories. This runs the risk of hindering the level and relevance of medical care provided.  The Iryo proposition By providing ownership of the medical record to the patient, and using a consistent medical standard known as openEHR, Iryo wishes to redefine the value of medical data across the healthcare industry. To do this, Iryo is partnering with an NGO called Walk With Me to provide the IT infrastructure needed to improve the quality of healthcare provided within camps managed by the organisation.  These camps exist throughout the Middle East. The objective is that Iryo will enable patients and their families to store their medical records, securely, within their own mobile devices. Medical records in this form become ‘a bearer instrument’ – independent of identity and always controlled by the holder, the patient. Secure access to medical data exploit blockchain and modern encryption protocols.  Patients will be able to choose how they interact with their medical history. They can:  share medical histories with hospitals, specialists and researchers – and anywhere in the world selectively reveal what the patients consider to be the relevant parts of a medical record, and with a predefined time limit. The Iryo Network will become a global repository of openEHR data. Since few people are prepared to provide their medical data to a ‘GoogleEHR’-type of capture, with ‘Google-like’ reaping of users’ data for commercial purposes, Iryo has committed to surrender its own access to the data.  Its solution to mitigating this risk is zero-knowledge data storage resistant to all attacks, including state-actors or ‘inside jobs’. This works by users encrypting their data on their mobile device(s) with a public key. A private decryption key remains on the patient’s device. Whenever someone wants to access patient data (a doctor or researcher, for example) the patient must approve access. This occurs by the patient clicking ‘yes’ in their IryoEHR app which will provide a re-encryption key to the doctor’s public key.  Storage nodes What increases believability is that patient has the data securely backed up. This happens on two geographically and managerially redundant storage nodes plus the patient’s device:  one encrypted backup copy stays on IRYO cloud node; this is the default backup location (it can be changed by a clinic or end-user to point to another storage API) with the Iryo-offering being centralized in a cloud with tight and audited provisioning controls a second encrypted copy will stay in the home clinic storage node; with this local copy, a clinic does not need to rely on an internet connection and it is distributed end user devices (most likely mobile phones) are already all over the world; they are decentralized (not centrally controlled) and protected by their owners (though there must be concern about enough storage for raw data as well as infected or stolen devices). What does this mean Patient health records are one of the most sensitive kinds of personal information. Should personal health data leak, it could defame an individual’s reputation, jeopardize employment options, influence insurance premiums, or end up as a marketing tool. All potentially exploit an individual’s health status.  What is interesting is Iryo’s attitude. It perceives the holding of medical data as being a ‘toxic asset’. Too much data in one place presents too large a liability risk.  One challenge will be patient acceptance. The issue here is whether utility will overrule skepticism, especially when mobile devices are so easy to steal. A different challenge will be the medical profession – from doctors to medical staff to the institutions which employ them. Which of these will be most resistant is an open question. In this context the Iryo challenge is immense.  Nevertheless, the Iryo concept, at its most fundamental – patients owning their own medical data, makes sense. The data travels with the problem – the patient. But this does presume that the need for healthcare cybersecurity works.",False

An airdrop is the free distribution of cryptocurrency tokens. In this case, you will be receiving Iryo tokens which will allow you to participate within the Iryo Network. An airdrop is a great way to build community support and spread the word about Iryo.  How do I participate?  You must interact with Iryo Airdrop Bot and complete the following steps in order to receive your tokens:  https://t.me/iryoairdropbot  Join t.me/IRYOnetwork Join t.me/iryo_alerts  Register your ETH wallet address with Iryo Airdrop Bot(i.e Public Key) (Warning: An address from an exchange will not work, i.e Binance, Kraken etc.) IMPORTANT: In order to limit Sybil attacks and build a truly collaborative and involved community, the Iryo airdrop campaign will have the following locked safeguards in place.  In order to be eligible to receive Iryo Tokens, participants must have EITHER ONE OR BOTH of the following predefined amounts in your public addresses on March 1st, 2018:  A minimum of: 0.1ETH or A minimum of: 1 EOS ** Block 5174125 - etherscan.io/block/5174125 **  There will have to be a minimum of 3,000 participants with a capped maximum of 22,500. If less than 3,000 participants claim tokens, an additional campaign with less strict pre-conditions will take place. If the campaign hits 22,500 participants, it will automatically lock down.   What do I need in order to participate?  An Ethereum compatible wallet in order receive your tokens. The Iryo team will only ask you for your public address in order to send you tokens. They will never ask you for your private key, EVER.  How many tokens are up for grabs?  5% Total Campaign Allocation (15,000,000 Tokens = +/- $1,650,000 USD)  3% General Iryo Airdrop Bot — LIVE (9,000,000 Tokens) 1% Distributed on EOS to EOS token holders* (3,000,000 Tokens) 1% Reserved for Iryo Meetups** (3,000,000 Tokens) * Airdrop for EOS token holders will take place after EOS launches, which is expected to occur in Q3 of 2018.  ** If less than 1,000 people attend the meetups, the remaining portion of the tokens will go back into the general Iryo airdrop pool. Be sure to give an Iryo team member your email address during the meetup in order to receive the necessary information to participate.  ** Referral codes are no longer valid. Find out why - here.  How many tokens will I get and when will I get them?  The number of tokens you will receive will vary depending on the final number of participants. The same rules apply to everybody! Tokens will be distributed shortly after the token sale has closed.  Additional info:  No fake users please! We will routinely sniff around and delete fake users at our own discretion. Being raided is no fun, even if it makes our metrics look good! We reserve the right to shut down the airdrop at any point in time if we feel that it is getting taken advantage of. Before we import addresses, we will publish a detailed explanation on how the final token distribution numbers were calculated. Why no bounties?  The team came to the conclusion that typical bounties: “retweet this,” “like that,” result in increased levels of spam and bots that ultimately dilute core values and the community with it. Iryo would rather airdrop the coins to real people who would like to contribute to the growth of the network. Most people are too lazy anyway, but bots sure are not!  Why the special treatment for the EOS community?  Iryo believes that the only way to build and deploy a truly meaningful product is to have strong and collaborative support from its community. Iryo wants to give back to the platform that it will be using to build the network on. As with any new project, bootstrapping the community is no easy task, hopefully the airdrop will act as a token of appreciation and incentive to join the Iryo community. Therefore, Iryo has decided to aim a portion of the airdrop towards the EOS community with the following:  • 10x Lower pre-conditions in order to participate.  • 1% Will be allocated for meetups. (Majority of them being EOS Meetups)  • 1% Of tokens will be distributed on the new EOS chain to all EOS holders.  And remember, this is not Iryo’s final platform, members will need to move their tokens to EOS once the migration plan is revealed so stay tuned!",False

Look at this amazing update    Investment in R&D is Imperative People often mistake modern medicine as something that has existed in one form or another since the beginning of mankind. A large majority of the population find it extremely surprising that modern medicine actually began to take shape not too long ago. Pinpointing the precise shift over from traditional medicine has been a subject of debate within the scientific community for some time, however, a pivotal transformation took place sometime during the first half of the 19th century around the time that Bacteriology was introduced.  Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian/Austrian doctor discovered that by performing the simple act of hand washing before a medical procedure, in this case childbirth, greatly lowered the mortality rate of new mothers. That small yet incredibly significant change happened a little over 170 years ago. At the same time, Honoré de Balzac, Edgar Allan Poe, Hans Christian Andersen, all magnificent artists were in the midst of their most productive years. The following year, Thomas Edison was born. Romanticism as an intellectual and cultural movement was in full swing and rapidly changed the “old continent” (Europe) forever.  Medical science has come a long way since the days of washing hands as the primary form of fighting disease. A long way since Mr. Ignaz himself, indirectly insulted members within the medical community with the ludacris suggestion that something as trivial as washing hands was indeed vital. Advances in medicine and technology can be heavily attributed to incredible individuals dedicating their lives to various forms of scientific research.  During the preliminary research phase of Iryo, the team began to define current deficiencies within the realm of medical IT. The inefficiencies of both for profit and non-profit medical research became evidently clear. The decision was made to dedicate a substantial portion of Iryo’s efforts to improving the foundational elements that will be needed in order to improve and advance modern day medical research. This decision has impactful implications on the utility of IRYO tokens. As part of the yearly inflation, Iryo will dedicate a minimum of 50% of the newly minted Iryo tokens to internal or external medical R&D initiatives that will pave the way for new innovative products.

Together with the Ljubljana Simulation Centre, Iryo will dedicate a special team of IT-researchers to develop one of the first practical cases of augmented reality in the medical world. Specifically, through the use and application of the Microsoft HoloLens alongside the proprietary simulation software that will be used to replicate life-threatening events as accurately as possible.  Iryo initiated the preliminary research needed in order to assess the impact of combining augmented reality with the use of the HoloLens alongside Iryo’s software and the extensive knowledge of medical staff within the Ljubljana Simulation Centre. We also applied for Microsoft mixed reality program where Microsoft supports the leading inovation in the field of augmented reality. The first publicly available demonstration should take place before Q3 of 2018, exact dates will be published by the Simulation Centre. After that, Iryo will begin to expand on the technology that will help cover additional medical emergency scenarios (planned for Q4 2018) and in 2019 we can expect a bigger push by the AR industry around the accessibility and capability of augmented reality devices, specifically around the use of AR goggles. I predict that 2019 will be revolutionary in terms of the sheer advancement of AR products and solutions.  We’ve come a long way from the beginnings of modern medicine. Iryo was established to play a global part of the never-ending evolution of medical science, hand in hand with incredible individuals from the world of medical research.  www.Iryo.network    Very wise words!",False

Walk With Me When I started working with refugees, I was shocked to learn that less than 5% of all funds raised globally help with education and healthcare combined. I decided to make those my top priority. As a Tying Vines Inc. board member, I launched projects under the title: Walk With Me.  This project title had a unique meaning; I wanted to build a network of partners who would walk with me on the journey to help refugees, providing assistance in specific areas of expertise. In 2015 we launched a small medical clinic in Jordan, serving a remote area of approximately 30,000 refugees.  Shortly before the launch of our second medical clinic in Lebanon, I met Brian de Francesca, Chief Executive Officer at Ver2 Digital Medicine. Brian is one of those smart, Johns Hopkins education experts who specializes in digitalization and connectivity to improve healthcare. He joined me and a small group of doctors on a trip to the Beqaa Valley to assess healthcare needs of refugees. The healthcare need in the camps was overwhelming. We called our small team, Real Sustainable Impact, and we began to dream of a way to bring more efficient and more effective care to refugees in remote areas. It was there the vision to connect 700 refugee camps world-wide was born.   https://medium.com/iryo-network/walk-with-me-68c2d0d88762",False

Tjaša: We are currently working with a non-profit organization called, Walk with me, that is active in refugee camps in the Middle East. It was introduced to us by one of our advisors, Brian de Francesca. Facing a severe lack of resources, most needs are tended to before an EMR system in a refugee camp. On the other hand, patients with chronic conditions tend to spend many years in these camps. Offering a system, in which they will be able to have their medical data stored on their smartphones is a step forward to improving their continued care. When they leave a refugee camp, they will be able to take all their medical data with them. Blockchain technology will be the primary solution enabling them to become the decision makers around their data. They will be able to grant or revoke access to their medical records based on their needs.  Vasja: Refugees have minimal resources, but one thing that holds a significant amount of to them is their smartphones and having internet access. The turn over of healthcare professionals in refugee camps is high, as they come through various NGOs. We are building an IT system that will be user-friendly for healthcare professionals and patients alike, consequently helping with the accuracy of medical records.  Given the number of refugees, and the capacity of smartphones, how can they store all this data?  Vasja: Big files such as imagining diagnostics results, will not be stored on the phone directly. Iryo provides a cloud-based platform that can store the additional data from the patients free of charge. The refugee project is our pilot project to prove the concept and eventually design a model for scaling to other places with similar challenges regarding connectivity and infrastructure.  What are your target segments and business model?  Vasja: Our software will be available as a SaaS freemium service. If a healthcare provider has IT capabilities for maintenance, they can use it as such or pay us to service them. Additional revenue streams will be local customization, tailor-made solutions. The most prominent potential we see is for Iryo to become the global platform for researchers who would have to pay for the access to patient records by incentivizing patients to open their medical files in exchange for Iryo tokens.",False

In 2015 we launched a small medical clinic in Jordan, serving a remote area of approximately 30,000 refugees.  Shortly before the launch of our second medical clinic in Lebanon, I met Brian de Francesca, Chief Executive Officer at Ver2 Digital Medicine. Brian is one of those smart, Johns Hopkins education experts who specializes in digitalization and connectivity to improve healthcare. He joined me and a small group of doctors on a trip to the Beqaa Valley to assess healthcare needs of refugees. The healthcare need in the camps was overwhelming. We called our small team, Real Sustainable Impact, and we began to dream of a way to bring more efficient and more effective care to refugees in remote areas. It was there the vision to connect 700 refugee camps world-wide was born.  Read more interesting stuff: https://medium.com/iryo-network/walk-with-me-68c2d0d88762",False

Based on the current levels of participation and community driven feedback, the team would like to address some concerns and announce changes that will be implemented immediately.  The improper use of referrals While referrals programs can drive large amounts of positive traffic to a project, they can also have unintended consequences. In regards to the ongoing airdrop campaign, the referral portion of the campaign created unintended consequences when some community members began sharing their referral codes within a number of EOS community-based groups. The sharing of referral codes happened to be in clear violation of group policy, and as a result, certain users were either banned or criticised for posting their codes.  While the team believes it is up to the individual to ensure they adhere to a group’s specific policy, we were surprised by the level in which it occurred. For this reason, the team has decided to permanently suspend the issuing of new referral codes for the Iryo Airdrop Campaign effective 24:00 GMT March 5th, 2018. All referral codes given out until this point will no longer work, however, if your referral code had been claimed or used prior to March 5th, you will still be eligible to receive your bonus.  Resuming the campaign The airdrop campaign will resume at 24:00 GMT March 5th, 2018 with a 2,000 member daily participation limit. If you were unable to participate yesterday or the day before, we kindly suggest that you interact with IryoAirdropBot again. The locked pre-conditions of having a minimum of 1 EOS or 0.1 ETH on your public address on March 1st will remain in place. Full details on the airdrop campaign can be found here.  We want to sincerely thank the members that contributed and gave us feedback on how to improve upon the existing framework of the campaign.

Iryo’s ecosystem is putting the patient in the center and in complete control of their valuable data. By adopting openEHR medical standards and being open-source, Iryo is solving the issue of interoperability in Healthcare IT from the ground up.  The use of a public blockchain will enable the network to employ a distributed access control list (preventing internal exploits that are common in centralized systems) and provide data immutability through digital fingerprinting. Iryo Tokens will add an additional layer of security (healthcare providers will need to stake a certain amount of tokens to be considered a legitimate actor) and will incentivize data sharing for research purposes.  How it works             Healthcare providers will use Iryo software in their workflows to capture patients’ data. The software will use a technology called proxy re-encryption to encrypt the patient’s health data with the patient’s private key without the patient sharing their key. The encrypted data will then be stored on the patient’s device (Iryo app), on the healthcare provider’s server/cloud and, as an encrypted backup, and stored on Iryo cloud, again as an encrypted backup,. At the same time, a digital fingerprint (hash) of that data will be created and stored on the public blockchain to ensure immutability of data.  Patients will be in complete control of their data and will be able to grant and revoke access to their data via their mobile app. The grants and revocations will be stored on the blockchain, which will remove the possibility of internal fraud that centralized systems inherently harbour. Data will be stored in OpenEHR format, which will provide interoperability and future compatibility.  Researchers will be able to tap into this global repository of healthcare data by buying tokens and offering them as reward to users who are willing to share that data. In practice, this will look like  a simple app notification on the phone asking the user whether they are willing to share a certain piece of information for the purpose of a specific study. If they reject the request, nothing leaves the patient’s device and absolutely no data is ever shared. If they share it, they get the token reward offered by the research institution.   and  almost 10k ppl on telegram   ",False

Positive offcourse  Iryo is giving away $1.6 mio of Iryo tokens  Iryo Airdrop Walkthrough 🎯 This guide will walk you through the process of participating in the Iryo airdrop which will take place from March 3rd until all of the tokens allocated have been claimed. There will be no registration or KYC needed to participate in this campaign.  For those of you who are new to the community, Iryo is an old Japanese word that means - medicine. Welcome aboard.  What is an airdrop? An airdrop is the free distribution of cryptocurrency tokens. In this case, you will be receiving Iryo tokens which will allow you to participate within the Iryo Network. An airdrop is a great way to build community support and spread the word about Iryo.  What do I need in order to participate?  An Ethereum compatible wallet in order receive your tokens. The Iryo team will only ask you for your public address in order to send you tokens. They will never ask you for your private key, EVER. A telegram account. If you’ve never used telegram before, it is a simple and secure platform that lets you communicate with people around the world, similar to a WhatsApp or Viber. You can find it here. You will not be able to receive tokens if you do not have telegram! How many tokens are up for grabs? 5% Total Campaign Allocation (15,000,000 Tokens = +/- $1,650,000 USD)  3% General Iryo Airdrop Bot — LIVE (9,000,000 Tokens) 1% Distributed on EOS to EOS token holders* (3,000,000 Tokens) 1% Reserved for Iryo Meetups** (3,000,000 Tokens) * Airdrop for EOS token holders will take place after EOS launches, which is expected to occur in Q3 of 2018.  ** If less than 1,000 people attend the meetups, the remaining portion of the tokens will go back into the general Iryo airdrop pool. Be sure to give an Iryo team member your email address during the meetup in order to receive the necessary information to participate.  How do I participate? You must interact with Iryo Airdrop Bot and complete the following steps in order to receive your tokens:  Join t.me/IRYOnetwork Join t.me/iryo_alerts Register your ETH wallet address with Iryo Airdrop Bot(i.e Public Key) (Warning: An address from an exchange will not work, i.e Binance, Kraken etc.) IMPORTANT: In order to limit Sybil attacks and build a truly collaborative and involved community, the Iryo airdrop campaign will have the following locked safeguards in place.  In order to be eligible to receive Iryo Tokens, participants must have EITHER ONE OR BOTH of the following predefined amounts in your public addresses before March 1st, 2018:  A minimum of: 0.1ETH or A minimum of: 1 EOS ** Block 5174125 - etherscan.io/block/5174125 **  There will have to be a minimum of 3,000 participants with a capped maximum of 22,500. If less than 3,000 participants claim tokens, an additional campaign with less strict pre-conditions will take place. If the campaign hits 22,500 participants, it will automatically lock down.  Nice! Conditions met, I got some tokens, now how do I get more? After successfully interacting with Iryo Airdrop Bot, you will receive a referral code to pass around. You will be able to earn additional 20% bonus tokens from everybody that uses your referral code and successfully satisfies the locked conditions. If you yourself can’t satisfy the safeguards in place, don’t despair! You will still be able to receive 20% from each individual that was referred by you by pasting the referral code into the Iryo Airdrop Bot.  How many tokens will I get and when will I get them? The number of tokens you receive will vary depending on your referral bonus and the final number of participants. The same rules apply to everybody! Tokens will be distributed shortly after the token sale has closed.  Additional info:  No fake users please! We will routinely sniff around and delete fake users at our own discretion. Being raided is no fun, even if it makes our metrics look good! We reserve the right to shut down the airdrop at any point in time if we feel that it is getting taken advantage of. Before we import addresses, we will publish a detailed explanation on how the final token distribution numbers were calculated. Why no bounties? In reality, the referral code can be used as a bounty. Are you writing the blog? Reviewing Iryo? Tweeting about it? Publish the link and your referral code for the Iryo Airdrop Bot and get rewarded!  The team came to the conclusion that typical bounties: ‘retweet this’, ‘like that’, result in increased levels of spam and bots that ultimately dilute core values and the community with it. Iryo would rather airdrop the coins to real people who would like to contribute to the growth of the network. Most people are too lazy anyway, but bots sure are not!  Why the special treatment for the EOS community? Iryo believes that the only way to build and deploy a truly meaningful product is to have strong and collaborative support from its community. Iryo wants to give back to the platform that it will be using to build the network on. As with any new project, bootstrapping the community is no easy task, hopefully the airdrop will act as a token of appreciation and incentive to join the Iryo community. Therefore, Iryo has decided to aim a portion of the airdrop towards the EOS community with the following:  • 10x Lower pre-conditions in order to participate. • 1% Will be allocated for meetups. (Majority of them being EOS Meetups) • 1% Of tokens will be distributed on the new EOS chain to all EOS holders.  And remember, this is not Iryo’s final platform, members will need to move their tokens to EOS once the migration plan is revealed so stay tuned!  https://medium.com/iryo-network/iryo-airdrop-walkthrough-16dc6d6f946d",False

When talking about interoperability in healthcare, the key problem lies in how data is written in the first place. Universal interoperability could be achieved if all doctors recorded data in the same structure. This is a very generalized description of what openEHR is: an agreed set of forms for different specialties, defined by surgeons for surgery needs, cardiologists for cardiology needs, and so on. OpenEHR is not a standard for engineers but a standard for medical professionals. As stated on openehr.org »OpenEHR is a virtual community working on means of turning health data from the physical form into electronic form and ensuring universal interoperability among all forms of electronic data. The primary focus of its endeavour is on electronic health records (EHR) and related systems.« The idea of a global EHR In a previous post I shortly touched upon interoperability. Well, in an ideal world, interoperability would not be important at all. Can you imagine a one ubiquitous EHR system all over world that serves all mankind? In this scenario, every one of us would have access to their medical data at any time and any location. But as we all know, the reality is so far from this utopian dream (at least for now).  Lock-in based business models as the unfortunate reality in healthcare! Medical records management systems have traditionally been developed by software developers that typically designed a database and a user interface on top of it in order to support the work processes of healthcare personnel. And as time passed by, they were doing business as usual and introduced changes to the data model and to the user interfaces. And developers were the ones who knew what the data model actually means. Even more, these data models were not owned by healthcare organizations but by the software companies — in spite the fact that healthcare organizations are typically the owners of the data they produce. So imagine what you can do with raw data without the data model schema that tells you what this raw data really means!  And if you think up a project in which you want to exchange data between different systems, there is a high chance that an integration will not be fully possible because now you have to harmonize two different data models that are under control by two different software companies.  Such data hostage situations are the basis for the lock-in based business models. You find a hook for your customers that makes them dependent on your solution and services and then you are good for years to come because they will not be able to get rid of you. All good for you, if you are the software provider. But everyone else suffer. Not really a sustainable behavior.  Industry standards? If we take a look at other industries we can quickly find out that there is something we call industry standards. All the service providers implement the standards and then the end customer can choose the service provider based on e.g. how well their customer service is doing, or how user friendly their user interface is etc.  You get a true market where customers can switch between providers without much issues. Telco companies have evolved quickly to support such level of maturity. So, what is OpenEHR? This brings us to OpenEHR. It is a standard that enables a one global model of EHR data that can be used by anyone. It is based on the concept of archetypes and templates. Archetypes are very broadly described medical concepts. Each concept is described by as many possible specialists in order to obtain a maximum data set for the concept. And if you have such a database of archetypes that is used globally, you have a common definition for data models that contain not only different data elements and structures but also mappings to the international terminologies like SNOMED. An archetype is modeled by using a common OpenEHR reference model — the core of OpenEHR.  How do software providers use OpenEHR? When using OpenEHR, software providers design templates with the help of archetypes.These templates as the basis structure that can be represented to the user by means of a user interface. Whatever the end user enters in your system is validated by the OpenEHR engine.If the validation fails, error is triggered. If not, data is stored.  Each system that conforms to OpenEHR will be able to receive and understand all the data. Ergo, technical and semantic interoperability in action!  OpenEHR — the open industry standard? So by using OpenEHR, the data models are not locked by software companies, but are publicly available to any provider that wants to design a software based on OpenEHR. The company that will provide a better use interface or provide better algorithmic services etc. on top of OpenEHR will win more customers.  Where is OpenEHR used? OpenEHR is not a new invention. Work on its development has started in 1994 in England. Unfortunately, England chose to try a very costly approach instead of OpenEHR but lastly found its way back to the original idea. OpenEHR is used in countries like Australia, Brasil, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Russia, India, and Slovenia. Even more countries participate in different projects both in academia and industry.  OpenEHR in Slovenia Slovenia has started using OpenEHR almost 10 years ago. The Ministry of health has co-funded a research project focused on building an OpenEHR based platform. It has then provisioned the development of a brand new hospital information system that was based on OpenEHR. OpenEHR has been used as the basis for the national eHealth where OpenEHR is used for defining national documents that need to be exchanged between the healthcare providers. One example of such of a document is the Patient Summary. The data set is a European Commision recommendation for cross-border exchange. Slovenia used OpenEHR to model all the data. Now, every provider of EMR systems in hospitals and other healthcare providers is sending different parts of the Patient summary to the national EHR. This data is then accessible to all healthcare providers and patients on an online portal.  Practical example One of the sections of the Patient Summary is the Vaccination data set. Patient Summary thus holds information about your vaccinations. Based on this, Slovenia was able to create a national vaccination registry by tapping into the Vaccination section of the Patient Summary.  The beauty of OpenEHR lies in the fact that it is not a standard for engineers but a standard for medical professionals. The OpenEHR community provides great tooling support and also a vast network of medical professionals who are working all over the world on a common knowledge database that holds the OpenEHR archetypes.  Since OpenEHR is organically growing since 1994 it is not a hype but a strong hold in healthcare that supports the idea of a ubiquitous EHR.",False

Patients will have the ability to anonymously share their medical history/results with researchers in exchange for Iryo Tokens which can then be used to pay for medical services within the network.  Iryo Research Portal Research institutions will have access to vast quantities of highly relevant medical data at their disposal. ""Analyse in Place"" queries will decrease the expenses associated with acquiring large sets of medical data making AI & Big Data research more affordable, while preserving complete anonymity for the patients who share the data (preventing de-anonymisation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-anonymization).  Iryo Clinics Iryo Tokens will enable hospitals & clinics to participate within the network. Blockchain access controls will enable healthcare providers to securely access a patient’s medical record in real-time, enabling them to treat patients in ways never before possible. They will also provide way to get emergency access to a patient's health records in case of the patient being incapacitated to grant access.  I see utility token to use this is my first plus side.

Healthcare has been a big part of my life ever since. Managing a chronic condition is time and thought consuming. You have to constantly arrange a variety of appointments across many different institutions, spend time in waiting rooms and wait for results and medical feedback. Luckily, technology is decreasing the disease burden on many levels. Point-of-care devices, telemedical solutions and healthcare platforms are improving communication and reducing time spent in healthcare institutions.  While innovation is making care more effective, addressing the human aspects remains a challenge. Technology, for better or worse, has directly affected the way we traditionally interact with one another.  Today, nurses from the Children’s hospital tell me, patients socialize less because they have smaller, more private rooms in the hospital. Patients have more privacy, but the ward is less lively and becoming increasingly more isolated. How to keep empathy as a primary focus during care is an important question that needs to be addressed.  https://medium.com/iryo-network/as-a-patient-i-hope-for-the-constant-improvement-of-the-healthcare-industry-e0371ba1f873",False

People live longer and better lives all over the world, and this trend is going to continue.  The information age brought new challenges, opportunities and set new customer expectations in all areas including healthcare. We all create and collect infinite ammounts of data on our phones in addition to visits at the doctors.  Key problems with data in healthcare The key problem of data in healthcare can be summarized in lack of widely adopted open standards for health data, leading to poor interoperability. Patients are often left carrying around records on paper to show their medical history to doctors treating them. OpenEHR, which Iryo is building upon is an effort to tackle this.  The second major challenge is inadequate security and often outdated architecture. This presents an opportunity for Iryo to leapfrog existing solutions with a decentralized architecture as a backbone for new services.  Poor interoperability, inadequate security and lack of control over personal data limits the scope of using this data for research purposes. It’s less about giving your personal data away for research and more about making sure that the data doesn’t get abused in one way or another. Cardiogram is a good example of what is possible when data becomes open. Iryo will enable much more of that.  Why and when decentralization of healthcare data makes sense It’s a very fair question to ask why would you even want to decentralize healthcare data, given the fact that the US and most European countries have information systems in place that do a reasonably good job at storing and exchanging health records.  Decentralization and anti-fragility by design are specially useful when developing systems where no central authority can have control over data, no registry can be tampered with and most importantly can still be accessed if parts of the system are not online at the time.  Imagine a centralized EHR not being available in the middle of a crisis, where lives depend on getting their medical history right. A decentralized and resilient design, like the one Iryo has, can prevent that.  The second key component of a forward looking EHR solution is privacy. The Iryo team choose to leaverage zero-knowledge storage and anonymous query interfaces to guarantee that.  Helping those who need it most first Despite Iryo still being in early phases of development it already attracted the attention of several institutions and projects that will benefit from a decentralized EHR system.  The first official deployment of the Iryo sistem is with Walk With Me — a partnership that will provide a modern, distributed electronic health record system to refugee camps in the Middle East.  The Walk With Me organisation currently operates 12 projects in 6 countries — Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, and Djibouti, totaling 11 million refugees. Additional clinics are planned to be established in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Pakistan and Turkey, with a long-term vision of reaching 700 camps worldwide.  Onwards I’m excited about the opportunity to help Vasja and the team building this ambitious project as an advisor.  3fs has long been known as a studio where extraordinary talent built digital products with fantastic user experiences, powered by the latest technologies. Lake (2017 Apple design award winner), TrickyTribe, Toshl (backed by 500 startups) and many telecom services at scale in partnership with Ericsson.  When Andraz Logar, a long time friend and partner in many projects, first shared the conceptual idea that eventually became Iryo, it just seemed crazy ambitious. At the time the key focus was still research of pain-points and problems in the space. Andraz and the team were actively interviewing doctors and health professionals to gain deep insights in the domain.  In the summer of 2017, I met with Vasja and was impressed by his positive attitude, desire to work on something impactful and infectious energy. Vasja used to manage products at 3fs before joining Bitstamp, and eventually assembling a strong team for Iryo.  I’m looking forward to contribute, sharing the lessons learned at Layer in building a scalable platform, enabling great user experiences, used by both developers and large organizations.  https://medium.com/@tomazstolfa/iryo-the-decentralized-future-of-healthcare-8baf03b96bd3",False

This meant that people or organizations could grow their internet presence knowing the rules of the game wouldn’t change later on. Huge web properties were started during this era including Yahoo, Google, Amazon, Facebook, LinkedIn, and YouTube. In the process, the importance of centralized platforms like AOL greatly diminished.  During the second era of the internet, from the mid 2000s to the present, for-profit tech companies — most notably Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon (GAFA) — built software and services that rapidly outpaced the capabilities of open protocols. The explosive growth of smartphones accelerated this trend as mobile apps became the majority of internet use. Eventually users migrated from open services to these more sophisticated, centralized services. Even when users still accessed open protocols like the web, they would typically do so mediated by GAFA software and services.

Due to the large quantity of individual service providers, each with their own unique data type, data becomes fragmented and quickly loses value for medical research. Iryo removes the silos by building its network on the back of openEHR archetypes. These data types are universally consistent and help drive the next generation of medical AI & big data research.  Creating Consistency in Healthcare The use of an openEHR framework prevents medical institutions from reformulating existing data types. Having consistent frameworks across medical institutions allow domain experts (medical researchers and clinical specialists) to accurately define and use specific data points in their practice. This ensures global interoperability and increases the intrinsic value of health data.  Public Blockchain Accessing Data Patients can now choose how they interact with their medical history.  Share medical histories with hospitals, specialists, and researchers, anywhere in the world. Selectively reveal relevant parts of a medical record with a predefined time limit. Acquire Iryo tokens offered by research institutions for the collection of anonymous health data. Pay for medical services with Iryo tokens. Access to a variety of cross-platform health apps within the Iryo Network. Scaling with EOS EOS will allow for the creation of an extremely efficient and scalable network. EOS “shards” will enable Iryo to create an extremely dynamic yet super lightweight chain resulting in lightning fast transactions. Sharing vast quantities of medical data between subjects of trust, such as doctors, specialists, and researchers will ultimately be less expensive, less time consuming and yield greater value for patients around the world.

Necessary properties: 1.) Open standards Making interoperability achievable in practice. An example is the OpenEHR standard.  2.) Open source app to store local copy of health record. You have the ability to check app doesn’t have a kill switch, doesn’t lie about syncing, and doesn’t delete or rewrite anything the user did not authorise. The prerequisite is also the ability to export data.  3.) Local copy of your medical data. Some patients might not care, but those who do matters here. Default (opt-out) patient phone storage. Only encrypted cloud/server backups are allowed.  4.) Real-time data writes Doctor (or device in the future) that produces the data needs to write that in your record in real time. If there are delays and permissions need to be granted between the production of data and writing to your health records; two divergent copies might be in the production, and you can’t control the second one.  5.) Control enforcement through permissions and encryption  • Zero-knowledge: once you have the data, you can encrypt it with your key and back it up to the network/server.  • Giving doctor the ability to read the data means giving him either the private key or even better sharing just re-encryption key (public key cryptography).  • your access revocations should at least mean that the revocated parties can’t read the newer data.  6.) No ID and third-party controlled accounts  Things you really own won’t ask you for the government issued identification or ask you to sign in to your account which might be subject to deletion at the service discretion.  https://medium.com/iryo-network/the-case-for-bearer-health-records-d692414ad924",False

Most tokens on these platforms have a centralized team behind them, which means that if their token contract is compromised, they should be able to roll it back. Alternatively, this team could just issue a new contract taking into consideration factors like pre-hack balances.  Having a token that is solidified with PoW presents additional liability if something goes wrong. This is not a feature that a startup raising capital should go for.

All institutions would have to provide a stake of $10 000 worth of IRYO tokens for their accounts (this value is adjustable). This would serve as spam protection - the app won't ‘talk’ to 1 000 fake institutions that do not have IRYO tokens who would most likely be attempting to spam users. It would also act as a transparent metric on the chain. More accounts with enough tokens should mean more institutions are using the system. Institutions would include organisations such as hospitals, clinics and research institutes.  2. The clinic staking requirement would be used to cover the cost of storing EHR data for their patients. Should the data per patient exceed the threshold, clinics would have to stake more tokens to cover the cost of data storage. Patients would be able to cover their storage costs by staking coins themselves; that way they can become independent in storing as much data as they want to (as long as a sucient number of coins are staked). If they exceed the limit, or the staking requirements suddenly change, they would not lose the data but, over time, their access would be increasingly limited until the stake is supplied. Actual hardware costs would be covered with 1% yearly inflation. Therefore, more data stored would mean more coins staked, which, in turn, provide price pressure to make that 1% yearly inflation worth enough to cover all the storage cost.  3. With health record query tokens researchers would be able to incentivize end users to allow anonymized queries. Health data never leaves the patient’s device (phone), or the device of the doctor whom the patient has assigned access privileges to. Researchers would have to buy the tokens from the market and distribute them to the users that allowed the queries on their health data to be executed. The amounts can be very small, and sent to thousands of people at the same time. High fees could kill this model !!",False

And even this, by itself, is not a trivial task to achieve. In fact, healthcare is probably one of the last industries where data lock-in based business models are still the norm and data is held hostage by different IT companies. In Slovenia, a country of 2 million, eight EMR providers offer solutions for a total of a 10 million EUR market. Then there are also laboratory information systems providers, pathology information systems providers, etc. And each provider developed its own data model that captures some/all the data points that occur in the business processes that are the core activity of each organization. Processes are often not defined regarding standard operating procedures and can be very different from organization to organization, even from doctor to doctor. Even more, the processes can also be dynamic and ad-hoc which suggests we cannot prepare a common process model that would describe them precisely. As healthcare systems are trying even further to distribute care towards patients homes and other environments, even more information systems are being added to this set of different databases.

Due to the large quantity of individual service providers, each with their own unique data type, data becomes fragmented and quickly loses value for medical research. Iryo removes the silos by building its network on the back of openEHR archetypes. These data types are universally consistent and help drive the next generation of medical AI & big data research.  Creating Consistency in Healthcare The use of an openEHR framework prevents medical institutions from reformulating existing data types. Having consistent frameworks across medical institutions allow domain experts (medical researchers and clinical specialists) to accurately define and use specific data points in their practice. This ensures global interoperability and increases the intrinsic value of health data.  Zero-Knowledge Medical Data Medical Record Ownership With the use of public-key encryption, the Iryo Network gives patients complete control and ownership of their electronic health record. This empowers patients to leverage their own medical data to better suit their healthcare needs.  Decentralised Data Storage Zero-knowledge storage protocols will ensure that sensitive medical data will remain secure and completely impervious to cybersecurity breaches, including state-sponsored attacks. All medical data is stored on the patients device and securely backed up on two geographically & managerially redundant storage nodes.  Patient Mobile Device Node Decentralised, tokenized incentives, 24⁄7 access to medical record. Encrypted Iryo Cloud Backup Node Audited, maintained, securely backed up. Encrypted Clinic Backup Node Locally stored copy, evenly distributed, accessible with/without a network connection.   Public Blockchain Accessing Data Patients can now choose how they interact with their medical history.  Share medical histories with hospitals, specialists, and researchers, anywhere in the world. Selectively reveal relevant parts of a medical record with a predefined time limit. Acquire Iryo tokens offered by research institutions for the collection of anonymous health data. Pay for medical services with Iryo tokens. Access to a variety of cross-platform health apps within the Iryo Network. Scaling with EOS EOS will allow for the creation of an extremely efficient and scalable network. EOS “shards” will enable Iryo to create an extremely dynamic yet super lightweight chain resulting in lightning fast transactions. Sharing vast quantities of medical data between subjects of trust, such as doctors, specialists, and researchers will ultimately be less expensive, less time consuming and yield greater value for patients around the world.    Iryo Tokens Patients The Iryo Network will usher in a new era for medical research. Patients will now have the ability to anonymously share their medical history with researchers in exchange for Iryo tokens which can then be used to pay for medical services.  Iryo Research Portal Research institutions will have access to vast quantities of highly relevant medical data at their disposal. Specifying medical parameters will decrease traditional expenses associated with acquiring large sets of medical data and enable a new, targeted approach to large scale A.I & Big Data research.  Iryo Clinics Hospitals & clinics will be able to securely access a patient’s medical history in real-time enabling them to treat patients in ways never before possible. In case of a medical emergency, Iryo enables hospitals & clinics to access personal medical records incase the patient is unresponsive at the time of treatment. This system is based on a token-locking scheme that holds the institutions responsible of any wrongdoing.    Roadmap 2015 Preliminary Research 3fs executed preliminary research on establishing common interoperability between international medical systems.   2016 Seed 3fs provided initial capital and support to establish Iryo. The team began by validating several proof of concepts and pilot projects.   2017 Pre ICO The Iryo Network was introduced to the public in order to address common downfalls of inoperable medical systems.   2018 ICO + Production Grade Implementation Official crowdsale of Iryo tokens. Production grade, fully scalable implementation for Iryo partners.   2019 Iryo Public Release Integration of interoperable unified health records, zero-knowledge storage, and blockchain permissions.   2020 Network Expansion Iryo Network system support and adoption of value-added services. Design and execution of Iryo certified clinics.",False

The software will use a technology called proxy re-encryption to encrypt the patient’s health data with the patient’s private key without the patient sharing their key. The encrypted data will then be stored on the patient’s device (Iryo app), on the healthcare provider’s server/cloud and, as an encrypted backup, and stored on Iryo cloud, again as an encrypted backup,. At the same time, a digital fingerprint (hash) of that data will be created and stored on the public blockchain to ensure immutability of data.  Patients will be in complete control of their data and will be able to grant and revoke access to their data via their mobile app. The grants and revocations will be stored on the blockchain, which will remove the possibility of internal fraud that centralized systems inherently harbour. Data will be stored in OpenEHR format, which will provide interoperability and future compatibility.  Researchers will be able to tap into this global repository of healthcare data by buying tokens and offering them as reward to users who are willing to share that data. In practice, this will look like  a simple app notification on the phone asking the user whether they are willing to share a certain piece of information for the purpose of a specific study. If they reject the request, nothing leaves the patient’s device and absolutely no data is ever shared. If they share it, they get the token reward offered by the research institution. ",False

How does it apply to healthcare? In this meetup, we will discuss how blockchain is shaking one of the most regulated sectors - healthcare.    AGENDA 6.00 - 6.15 Registration  6.15 - 6.20 Welcome remarks  6.20 - 6.35 Global digital health market overview (by StartupHealth)  6.35 - 6.50 Blockchains, EOS and the growing community in New York  6.50 - 7.05 How does blockchain fit into healthcare  7.05 - 7.50 What will get disrupted in the highly regulated healthcare industry first (panel discussion with Q&A)  7.50 - 9.00 Networking    SPEAKERS StartupHealth is a global army of Health Transformers to solve the world’s biggest health challenges. The vision of the organization, which is currently active around the world and has more than 200 companies under its umbrella, is to improve health and wellbeing of everyone in the world.  Rick Schlesinger is the Co-founder and Head of Strategy at EOS New York. EOS New York is a blockchain startup aimed at securing the EOS network by becoming a community-elected EOS Block Producer. Rick leads the business strategy and oversees operations across capital investments, governance, finance, and legal. Rick co-founded EOS New York after a successful career in management consulting advising Fortune 500 companies on business strategy and M&A. Rick also worked in the capital markets space where he focused on efficient asset allocation strategies and for a period of time analyzed the Life Sciences sector across healthcare delivery, medical devices, insurance, and pharmaceuticals. Rick has been following blockchain technology since 2010 after learning about the interesting economic incentives the Bitcoin protocol created for its users. Rick is a student of economics and libertarian philosophy and envisions a blockchain enabled world will create freer societies, institutions, and people.  Vasja Bočko is the CEO of Iryo, a Slovenian startup building the world’s first participatory, blockchain driven healthcare economy. He was a product lead at 3FS, an innovative Slovenian IT firm focused on providing digital consulting to Fortune 500 companies, for over two years. Soon after, joined Bitstamp as a senior product manager — one of the oldest and most respected cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. There he gained a deep understanding of blockchain and cryptocurrency related processes. He has a background in finance, IT and political science. He briefly worked in the financial industry before diving headfirst into disruptive tech. He worked for a Swiss startup, delivering a music streaming service shortly before joining 3FS, where he was directly involved in supporting the biggest social media network in Mexico. At its peak, the network was supporting more traffic than Wikipedia globally. Vasja has recently worked as a consultant to Fortune 500 companies and strongly believes that blockchain has the potential to revolutionise industries that have traditionally seen little advances through IT. As leader of the Iryo team, Vasja will aim to build the next generation healthcare platform, addressing current downfalls like data security, global interoperability and self-sovereign medical identity.    About the organizer:  Iryo (https://iryo.io/) is a Slovenian blockchain startup centred around improving the state of technology in healthcare. The company is creating a new global healthcare network with an improved, redefined user experience of patients, healthcare workers, managers and researchers.

The use of a public blockchain will enable the network to employ a distributed access control list (preventing internal exploits that are common in centralized systems) and provide data immutability through digital fingerprinting. Iryo Tokens will add an additional layer of security (healthcare providers will need to stake a certain amount of tokens to be considered a legitimate actor) and will incentivize data sharing for research purposes.  How it works             Healthcare providers will use Iryo software in their workflows to capture patients’ data. The software will use a technology called proxy re-encryption to encrypt the patient’s health data with the patient’s private key without the patient sharing their key. The encrypted data will then be stored on the patient’s device (Iryo app), on the healthcare provider’s server/cloud and, as an encrypted backup, and stored on Iryo cloud, again as an encrypted backup,. At the same time, a digital fingerprint (hash) of that data will be created and stored on the public blockchain to ensure immutability of data.  Patients will be in complete control of their data and will be able to grant and revoke access to their data via their mobile app. The grants and revocations will be stored on the blockchain, which will remove the possibility of internal fraud that centralized systems inherently harbour. Data will be stored in OpenEHR format, which will provide interoperability and future compatibility.  Researchers will be able to tap into this global repository of healthcare data by buying tokens and offering them as reward to users who are willing to share that data. In practice, this will look like  a simple app notification on the phone asking the user whether they are willing to share a certain piece of information for the purpose of a specific study. If they reject the request, nothing leaves the patient’s device and absolutely no data is ever shared. If they share it, they get the token reward offered by the research institution.  Key characteristics  1. Iryo is fully committed to being open-source (back-end & clients). 2. Iryo is built on open standards & medical archetypes (OpenEHR) for health data formats. 3. Using a public blockchain (EOS) 4. Solid private key management & recovery solutions with ZeroPass. 5. The Iryo ICO will be on Ethereum with ERC20 while the Iryo application will use EOS based tokens. The reasons behind utilizing EOS are the low fees and fast transactions associated with their infrastructure.  Token use cases  Patients The Iryo Token will usher in a new era for medical research. Patients will have the ability to anonymously share their medical history/results with researchers in exchange for Iryo Tokens which can then be used to pay for medical services within the network.  Iryo Research Portal Research institutions will have access to vast quantities of highly relevant medical data at their disposal. ""Analyse in Place"" queries will decrease the expenses associated with acquiring large sets of medical data making AI & Big Data research more affordable, while preserving complete anonymity for the patients who share the data (preventing de-anonymisation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-anonymization).  Iryo Clinics Iryo Tokens will enable hospitals & clinics to participate within the network. Blockchain access controls will enable healthcare providers to securely access a patient’s medical record in real-time, enabling them to treat patients in ways never before possible. They will also provide way to get emergency access to a patient's health records in case of the patient being incapacitated to grant access.  Mission  Our mission is to make healthcare sustainable by developing healthcare IT solutions worthy of the 21st century.  Vision  We want to disrupt the landscape of traditional health IT by promoting standardised health-data archetypes, redefining medical data ownership through encryption and zero-knowledge data storage and providing an order of magnitude increase in security, transparency and auditability of healthcare IT by using blockchain technologies.  Values  - Healthcare IT vendors should use vendor neutral, open and community driven data standards and formats which promote and improve global interoperability. - We believe open source software is more secure, more agile and more trustworthy. It also promotes faster adoption and reduces vendor lock in. Healthcare IT should be open sourced.   - Personal health data is one of the most sensitive types of personal information and so every possible measure must be taken to protect it. We believe that means zero-knowledge data storage. - The patient should be in the centre of the data distribution. - The patient should not only legally own the data, but must also be the one who controls it. - Granting access to that data must be done in a way that is transparent and auditable and leaves no room for “centralized fraud.”  Market potential  The global healthcare IT market size is anticipated to reach anywhere between $100 billion on the low end and $200 billion on the high end by 2020. The compounded annual growth rate of healthcare IT globally is between 7 and 13 %. The global electronic health records market alone was estimated at $23 billion in 2016 and expected to grow to almost $40 billion by 2025.  USA is currently the largest and most valuable market, but digitization of healthcare is on the rise and the Asia Pacific market is expected to be the fastest growing regional segment over the next decade. Emerging economies in this region including China and India have been experiencing strong economic growth and high demand for healthcare IT services is expected. Similar growth trajectories are expected in South America and Africa.

Iryo has partnered with a US based NGO Walk with me (https://www.walkwith-me.org/) to deploy our solution in 12 locations in 6 countries (total addressable market of 6 mio refugees). It was a good pilot project for Iryo to prove the hypotheses around patient-centric data storage. The refugees spend between 5 and 7 years in refugee camps, while the NGOs come and go and the churn rate of doctors is very high. Having possession of their personal health records over time improves the quality and effectiveness of their treatment. Effective treatment becomes limited if the medical professionals are using outdated or incompatible software. With Iryo, the refugees will be able to hold on to their health data regardless of how many doctors come and go within those 7 years. Even more importantly, they will be able to take that data with them once they move to a more permanent location. The token economy will enable new models of help - it will be possible to make donations with Iryo tokens for a variety of medical services that benefit refugees.  Other deployments  Iryo is discussing deals with telemedical providers which would like to use Iryo network for a structured, safe and transparent mean of exchanging data between the supply and demand side. Iryo is also in talks with some other healthcare providers and will share more information as soon as we are able to. Iryo has a contract signed around R&D of augmented reality using hololens for the purpose of accessing and presenting medical data in medically stressful environments, demanding extremely fast response (ER activity).

We are using EOS.  From our whitepaper:  Quote EOS will offer ""shards"" (they call it blockchain apps), which users would be able to utilise on their partitioned network - user nodes can discard all other messages, making them as light as the chain is designed to be. A lightly designed blockchain app would have the ability to spread more nodes since it's easy enough to verify, even if the entire EOS network gets ""bloated"". Instead of transaction fees, EOS chooses a smarter way to charge its users.  Every blockchain app (shard) must deposit coins for their users. Practically, 1% of locked coins means that users of this app can get 1% of all bandwidth of block producers... and until your app only uses 1% of the whole EOS ecosystem, all transactions are free for end-users. That way new users don't need to pay for anything. However, the blockchain app developer still has to mind the resources, or else the requirement to buy more and more EOS tokens to stake would ‘kill’ his blockchain app’.  More in whitepaper",False
