The platform is good for content creators, advertisers and users alike. Flixxo incentivizes all users to create, seed and advertise video content. Advertisers pay users to watch their ads for a specified amount of Flixx tokens. In addition, if the user downloads and keeps the video, they can earn Flixx tokens for sharing (this is called seeding). There is no need to buy tokens from an exchange and we have already deployed the p2p network, which is monetizing for sharing.  Flixxo removes the intermediary for sharing content and payment. Flixxo is using BitTorrent for video distribution and ethereum blockchain for settlement.

Progressive decentralization, progressive capitalization of a smart contract, progressive complexity And that is how we have approached Flixxo.Blockchain would not be scalable for a video platform in 2018, it could take years. Meantime we are exploring off chain transaction and even centralized transactions (using the same mechanism than any exchange). The same with p2p video distribution, as we learn how to build a compelling decentralized network we may lean part of the distribution on “classical” CDNs. Lumino may be ready in some months, but yet we cannot rely on Lumino until it is fully tested. We aim on a 100% decentralized p2p network having all the transactions settled on a public blockchain. Reaching that objective we would have a platform with no growth limits, bigger than anything seen before.'

If you are so desperate to sell, why not at least get a decent price by putting up a sell order instead of just relentlessly dumping. My Husband did a video for FLIXX but no way in hell he is going to sell his FLIXX for like ten bucks worth of Ethereum, his time and effort are worth a hell of a lot more than ten bucks that's for sure. In Europe we can just bout buy a cup of coffee with that lol,  So am hodling and growing my bag, we gonna double up at these discount prices. By the way are there more exchanges listing FLIXXO at the moment or is it just available on ED? I might wanna grab a few of these dumps and increase our stash.   When there is price value drop, this is when whales buy in!!!   I can't wait to watch videos and get paid in Flixxo, for watching them. I look forward to this one being a  winner coming into 2018.

It is all up to them  Here is an example: So Adam creates a video and sets a price of 100 Flixx and decides to share 50% with the community. Lisa wants to watch the video and pays 100 Flixx. Now she keeps the video on her device, and if someone gets the video through her device, she gets 50%, so Lisa gets 50 Flixx and the author (Adam) gets 50 Flixx.

The propositions I have heard in presentations about flixxo include: Gradual trust ramps (having users build up rep before flix sale allowed) and the mention of user behavior heuristics, but both of these are relatively simple to exploit.  Something more complex will be needed, Turing tests within the videos; a general comprehension test at the end of the video (would also encourage users to be more attentive).  Or perhaps make the videos have interactive components within them, make the ads into a game.

Probably because the subjective meaning of “high quality” is being pushed higher and higher every day. Remember when watching video in VGA quality in full screen was like science fiction? “In the future, it will be possible for a home PC to do it”, we said. But we didn’t imagine that we would so soon do it in 4K and over the internet!  Nevertheless it’s still a difficult task, in the sense that cutting edge technology is necessary to keep and push the quality bar even higher. With that in mind, Flixxo is proud to say that we’re going to leverage iExec’s expertise to help with the processing of video content. Before sharing on the network, videos need to be transcoded — decoded and then encoded again — into different formats so the viewers can select the best ones according the their screen sizes and bandwidth. This is required for smooth playback without pauses for buffering and stuttering, usually the video players automatically switch between streams with varying video quality in real time according to network congestion. Video encoding is a computing intensive task: its objective is to compress a video in a way that it uses little space and is fast to decode, usually at the expense of being hard to encode.  Enter cloud computing! iExec makes it easy and affordable to assign computing power for the encoding task and pay for the work with ERC20 tokens. And this is just one application that can interact with Flixxo, they are working on a decentralized marketplace for cloud resources.  The possibilities go further than that, as Flixxo nodes may even choose to participate in iExec’s network contributing their unused computing power. All this will be explored during the next months  “The possibilities go further than that, as Flixxo nodes may even choose to participate in iExec’s network contributing their unused computing power. All this will be explored during the next months.” said Pablo Carbajo, Flixxo´s CTO. In the future, we are also aiming at streaming of live feeds. This represents another challenge: real time transcoding. This means that one stream from a single source needs to be converted on the fly to different resolutions to better serve different devices with different bandwidth and screen sizes. However with a powerful cloud computing backbone it is currently possible to do that more affordable than ever before.  In the words of Jean-Charles Cabelguen, Chief Innovation & Adoption at iex.ec “Flixxo is the perfect example of dApps proposing needed services that will define new standards of the future of the digital. At iExec we are pleased to provide a platform allowing Flixxo to fulfill its mission.”  Even farther in the future… how soon before we are transmitting holografic content over the internet? For sure the Holodeck could use a good encoding platform and good p2p sharing network for multiplayer support…",False

First, there is lock time collateral for uploaded video (copyright protection). But video producer will receive it back after a certain period. A producer can lock his collateral and decide to give the video for free. But users may not want to distribute the video without the incentives.

This model doesn't even work for advertisers! But there is no competitor for YouTube. We propose a new model in which the flow of revenues helps advertisers reach their audiences, users to watch the content they really want to watch and authors to monetize and therefore raise the quality of their content. No one dared on rethinking the logic of this flow because it is impossible to confront Google in the fight of infrastructure needed to host and distribute videos.  Flixxo is unique because, for starters, video makers will be able to earn more money. They will be the ones that will set the price of their videos and decide whether they want and how much to share with the community.  So Sam, for example, creates a video and sets a price of 100 Flixx and decides to share 50% with the community. Lisa wants to watch the video and pays 100 Flixx. Now she keeps the video on her device, and if someone gets the video through her device, she gets 50%, so Lisa gets 50 Flixx and the author (Dan) gets 50 Flixx.

Relying on unlicensed videos since its inception, Popcorn Time has found on smart contracts the right technology for shifting to legit content and building up a sustainable business model.  Flixxo is a decentralized network for content distribution, based on Bittorrent protocol. Instead of leaning on high infrastructural costs in bandwidth and storage space - like other video platforms such as Netflix or YouTube - Flixxo gets rid of centralized servers by incentivizing its users to actively become distributors (or “seeders”), rewarding them on Flixx token. Flixx are needed in order to watch new videos.  On Flixxo every author uploads his work to the network and chooses the revenue model: how much Flixx it would cost to watch his content and which percentage of its earnings will be shared with the distributors. The more they share, the more incentives for the network to distribute and make a video go viral. If a user ran out of credits, he can also give some seconds of his attention to sponsored content in exchange of Flixx. This structure creates an organic market, as advertirsers need to buy Flixx from content creators in order to showcase their sponsored content.    Flixx, an APPTOKEN  Use Flixx for watching the content you want to watch on Flixxo Earn Flixx by sharing content or watching advertising Send and receive Flixx from family and friends  1,000,000,000 Flixx tokens are issued. There will never be another Flixx issuance.  300,000,000 Flixx to be sold on Token Sale 100,000,000 Flixx to be held by Flixxo team vested on a two years period 100,000,000 Flixx to cover bounty program, partnerships and costs of Token Sale Event 500,000,000 Flixx vested over 10 years on an incentive program to track users and authors into the platform  To gain early access to the platform, test the functional MVP or get more info on Flixxo, visit www.flixxo.com  Follow us on Twitter: @twitter twitter.com/flixxo Join the conversation on Telegram: t.me/flixxo Learn more on Facebook: facebook.com/FlixxoOk More info info@flixxo.com",False

Incentives for seeding will result in incentives for content creators. Early adopters, both distributors and creators, will be rewarded. This will help develop a true decentralized network for content distribution, and will attract authors for making their content available and choosing their own business model. - Users who engage socially: Gamification is the practice of applying game mechanics in non-game situations. These typically include points, achievements, high score table and other trappings of modern gaming. The game industry has spent a great deal of time refining what makes a game engaging and entertaining, and applying these principles to other business contexts. Then, earning Flixx and participating in the community has to be seen as a game, there are benchmarks on your social engagement that will be rewarded with incentives. It pushes members towards behavior that benefits the community. Tailoring the rewards set up for Flixxo community can allow us to reward things like good behavior, reaching a certain amount of shared videos, strong contributions, inviting friends, posting material that receives positive feedback and many other things. Providing both extrinsic (such as merchandise, movie tickets, etc.) and intrinsic (tokens) rewards for the behavior we want to see is a great way to build a positive community culture.  Incentives will progressively decrease to zero along the first ten years.  During the first three to six months, access to Flixxo will be granted by invitation. Having the responsibility of deploying good quality video and satisfying content demand, we must control the flow of users until reaching a massive amount of media. On the side of the incentives and economics of the platform, such a mechanism will allow us to reward with Flixx those users who invited new active users.
