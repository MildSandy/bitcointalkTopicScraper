It successfully works from 2016 in Russia. Inspeer team is experienced in creating online lending financial institutions in Spain, Germany, and Russia with more than 3 million users acquired. Only in Russia, about 200,000 loan applications were processed during the first month. The problems of the Russian P2P lending market are primarily related to the lack of a developed credit scoring system that has a reliable and robust format that is comparable to existing lending approval frameworks such as FICO in the US which aggregates and analyzes the data from the three major credit bureaus: Experian, Transunion, and Equifax. So , we successfully solve all this problems in Russia, and with all this experience we won't have risks on other countries. As for our roadmap, depending on ICO results we will have enough resources to start working in all mentioned countries.",False

The first P2P companies, “Кpeдитвceм” [Creditvsem] and “Биpжa кpeдитoв” [BirjaCreditov], entered the market in 2010. “Биpжa кpeдитoв” had switched to another business model, becoming a plat- form of online loans for online shoppers7. Searching for “Кpeдитвceм”, today you can find a large number of similar services, which are not related to the original company. The company “Bдoлг.py” [Vdolg.ru], established in 2012, with the participation of banki.ru and the Runa Capital fund, faced regulatory problems and suspended the loans issuance in April 20168. New users registration on the platform is still closed. The problems of the Russian P2P lending market are primarily related to the lack of a developed credit scoring system that has a reliable and robust format that is comparable to existing lending approval frameworks such as FICO in the US which aggregates and analyzes the data from the three major credit bureaus: Experian, Transun- ion, and Equifax. Under such conditions, the credit repayment scheme in which the borrower sells the asset at a reduced cost and redeems it with interest is more widely spread in Russia.",False
