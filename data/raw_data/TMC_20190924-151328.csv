The main difference is the way Tomochain will build consensus compared to Ethereum, which has great advantages regarding scalability. Ethereum builds consensus via POW (Proof Of Work) like Bitcoin. In a network that builds consensus via POW every node has to save the whole chain, this is why the Ethereum network is only able to process 7-15 transactions per second. Tomochain will build consensus via POVS (Proof-of-Stake Voting) meaning that Coin-holders of TOMO will be able to vote for masternodes which will work much more flexible than nodes in a POW network. If a masternode creates a new block, only one other masternode will have to validate the integrity of the new block, this will make it possible for the Tomochain to process more than 2.000 transactions per second.

It would require :  - an add-on for users to send and receive tokens. Ideally the add-on should be available for browsers like Google Chrome, Firefox and Firefox 52 (Tor). It would be fine to also have mobile apps for smartphones on Google play store and Apple store.  - the possibility for final users to send tokens for free 2 or 3 times a day, without having to buy anything. It could be done by a free rechargeable reserve of Tomo coins, enabling 2 or 3 transactions a day. If users want to send more often, they would have to purchase some Tomo coins.  The idea is that influencers could easily distribute tokens to their fans. Fans would just load the browser add-on or the mobile app, and they would easily receive and transfer tokens, without buying Tomo coins except if they use the app more than 2 or 3 times a day.  Will it be possible to do such things on Tomochain in the near future ?  Thanks",False

Tomochain Whitepaper:  Quote Proof of Authority  In Proof of Authority (PoA), all node validators are chosen based on collaboration between parties. PoA consensus is suitable for an organization who want to build a transparent blockchain supporting external auditability but control who can join the node network (permissioned public blockchain). TomoChain opts to use PoA and build nodes in multiple locations to make sure the database in a highly secure, immutable state. In the future, other organizations want to utilize this architecture can join to be a partner and and operator of TomoChain.  Kovan is an open-source based on Ethereum codebase and developed by Parity. Kovan is using PoA, however Parity only allows selective partners to join the network. Consequently, Ethereum foundation created Rinkerby Testnet, also using PoA and allowing a wider range of partners to join. Tomo plans to use Ethereum-based, POA consensus to build a customized TomoChain. This is a good choice given the level of maturity in documents, code bases, smart contracts within the Ethereum ecosystem.

This is transparency, efficiency, availability, scalability. TomoChain is one of such companies that wants to create a decentralized social network with its financial system that will not have scalability problems, and at the same time will interact with the Ethereum network, which gives another advantage. The task is huge. There are reasons to believe that this will work, as there is a good, experienced team (as a result - a good site and a well-prepared whitepaper, clearly and clearly visible action plan), and there are already real results in the form of a demo version of TomoWallet.

The first one is by reputation rating. The second one is much more interesting. The key understanding is that the general model of Tomo is to collaborately build a knowledge network that can be helpful to many. So if an asker asks an expert, for example Andrea Antonopoulos, a question and get an answer. The question and answer pair will become public knowledge and later viewers will pay coin to view that content and that coin will go back to both asker and the expert. So there is an incentive to both the asker and the expert to make the content interesting and valuable for a long-term revenue.
