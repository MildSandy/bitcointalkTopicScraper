Introduction  When medical data is generated, for example from a doctor’s notes or patient’s wearable device, a digital signature is created for verification. This data is then encrypted and sent to the encrypted cloud storage where a pointer to the health record is registered in the blockchain along with the user’s unique ID.  Similarly, when a patient’s data is requested, the ID on the blockchain is used to retrieve the data from the encrypted cloud storage. The data is decrypted and displayed on the relevant device or application. The patient will be notified every time data is added to their blockchain, or when there is a request to access the data.  Moreover, the users will be able to grant or revoke access on multiple levels of their data using their web or mobile applications. There are several different options for private keys. The private keys can be stored on behalf of the patient or it can be put on offline storage at the patient’s convenience.  H+ has been meticulously designed to do this in a legally compliant way. Patient consent is recorded on the blockchain as are records of any health information that is accessed or shared.
