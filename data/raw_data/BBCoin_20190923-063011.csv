At this point im praying for Kent to scam someone with brain to buy this shitty company, just like he tricked us to give him 52M$, but lets be honest no one will buy this company, because they can start their own and be at the same level or better for less than a 3 months and it will be much cheaper, because Kent probably think this shit is worth 100M$+ when in reality all his work is probably worth a couple thousand dollars at best .. so we are fucked",False

Let us not be concerned on the short term prize dip, every project I have seen so far has gone through this process. Its always good to always point out the errs of the team for improvement purposes but it should be done in admonishing way",False

Before to invest, I would like you to know the situation I’ve went through with the BBC team. As it's crucial and many people ask the same concern.  Everything started when people were getting ban in telegram because they have seen BBC didn't do proper communication with community. When you have a concern they will simply ban you whenever they disagree with you.  Even when we ask them to do regular updates for whatever their news, event and quotes to know what is happening behind the scene to show us(investor) a sign that they are actually working on the project. They wouldn’t give any appropriate response whenever you ask them  but simply ban us and said ''we do updates our medium twice a week do you want it per hour ? ""  There’s a problem that I have realise with the team is that there’s no transparency about the project to the community. It's not about how often they update news, we raised our voice and have seen some improvements like getting a news from email. It's a good start after no updates on project since the end of ico. But what we meant here is like regular updates on the project in professional way.  I want to point out a few example: There may be some ‘news’ but there’s no other pictures or appropriate / professional way to deliver the message that give us futher information.  I don’t have the thought that they are trying to scam us, but I just want to let you know that it is terrible when it comes to communicating to community and solving the problem. another example is they even have 5 different Twitter account. Make community confuse about which twitter account is the active one And one account is active for now @tradove_ico and keep repeating old post like a bot over and over again. We can see the same post get posted 2-3x times a week. Old bio still about pre-sale & ico, This is how bad it is. You will never see their team picture on any event, or their team in the office or the meeting, or some human interactions working on the project We understand that tradove have a very hardworking team to deliver but in this crypto space, communications is everything.    Now let's see to their medium. Even when they have launched their wallet there is no picture of visual arts to show how it looks and why tradove developped the app or whatever proper explanation because the admin wont explain or maybe don't understand their project.   there are example from other token medium's article compare to tradove : PRL MEDIUM : https://medium.com/oysterprotocol/oyster-mainnet-update-87961e0379da  Cardstack medium : https://medium.com/cardstack/building-on-blockchain-for-the-real-world-92593b2a16ba  https://medium.com/cardstack/building-a-token-vesting-contract-b368a954f99  Electricify medium :  https://medium.com/@EthereumECF/the-ecf-family-is-growing-f9f16b805111   Credits medium : https://medium.com/@credits/just-what-snowden-ordered-4d53d62e77ae    Tradove medium :  https://medium.com/@tra_dove/tradove-partnership-announcement-a7e8169158c6  This is a request by community to post this issue, we all want the best for tradove hopefully the team will hear the community and improve.   Good article about tradove : https://perhalic.com/blockchain-b2b-social-network-tradove-making-business-so-simple/   We would love to suggest the team to hire better admin to do social media engagement/PR (PUBLIC RELATION) with community so they would provide better customer service in future, it would be good for all of us to attract new investor  and will produce dedicated community that will always support this token.

Every ICO is a money grab, thats the purpose of the ICO's, companys collect money to realise the ideas they have. Not having a smart contract was a good thing, that allowed them to reach the hard cap, because this way they can accept fiat, which if they actually reached the hardcap (i have a theory they didnt, u can check my post from the last month, but i cant be sure about it, so i take it as they say) according to etherscan was most preferable way to deposit because of the crypto crash. First time i see about hard cap being modified and im following this ico since early January? The cap was always 52M. Now at first i didnt like the fact they extended the ico because serious companys have to stick to what they say, but when you think about it, it is good long term. If you are a long term investor you want them to have the money to achieve what they aim for, you dont want the company to run out of money and not being able to complete their roadmap. It is clear from the start that tokens will be unlocked after distribution, there was a discussion if we should lock them, but only that, never a tradove member said that the tokens will be locked. And about the exchanges...

Firstly, thank you for reading our whitepaper and for the time you are taking to engage with some quite detailed thinking about our project.  To a certain degree you have a point about the nature of trust in trade relations. There is always trust involved, including trust in the blockchain. Essentially, we propose to use ERC-20 Smart Contracts to replace the existing international letter of credit system.  There will not be a 'time lag'. The exchange rate will be locked at the time of the contract. We don't regard variations in value of BBCoin as a significant impediment to it's use as a utility coin in our system/ Businesses will not need to buy in advance and hold coin. Many will choose to buy at the time of the transaction. Naturally, any business might buy BBCoin in advance (as they might choose to store cash reserves in any fiat or cryptocurrency of their choosing, consistent with any fiduciary or regulatory obligations). In that case, they like any other holder of any currency take the good with the bad as any currency they hold fluctuates in the market. There is in principle no significant difference between storing assets in fiat currencies or a crypto. But I repeat, no user of our B2B blockchain solution will be required to hold significant reserves of BBCoin in advance.  Finally, and given our published roadmap, we will not be releasing detailed technical specifications at this early stage. Partly because we still have some choices about exactly how we configure our solution but mostly because all the options under consideration are commercial-in-confidence.  I think the crucial thing you have grasped is that we intend BBCoin to become a genuine utility coin with progressively greater utilization for Tradove services and then direct B2B transactions over time. It's an exciting project.  Good Fortune to you and to all,  -Kent J Yan CEO, Tradove Inc.",False

We have done a lot of legwork on our own and I personally am very proud of what we have achieved. However, you are right, we need to grow our website along with our product - that is why people conduct capital raising ventures such as this. If you read the roadmap you will see that one of our main priorities is gaining a critical mass of users through advertising and development - this will be achieved with the funds we have raised here.  Perhaps you could think about it this way - the Tradove ICO offering is actually far stronger than many others because we already have an established architecture and website whereas most of the time when you invest in ICOs it is the idea alone you are investing in.  The Tradove concept is strong, but the difference is that we have plenty of functionality already in place that we wont have to spend ICO capital on.  Hope this clears up your doubts on this topic  Please try to include a question next time, this is a discussion board after all  Best Wishes  -Kent",False

Just to clarify the situation regarding refunds (as explained early in this thread and elsewhere): I chose to offer refunds to investors for a limited period in our early presale (that period ended on 14 January).  I did so because of FUD and early claims that we were a scam which alarmed some investors.  Pleasingly, many of those who received refunds were so reassured of our honesty when they got their money back they chose to re-invest.  There are posts to that effect in this thread.  I can't agree though with you speaking of a lack of momentum.  We have raised over US$ 20 million in our pre-sale period so far. I'd say that's great momentum.  I think sometimes people here in the crypto community are prone to confuse noise and hyped marketing on discussion boards with actual business fundamentals. Clearly a lot of investors have decided to trust us with their money.  We may not have started with the slickest ICO marketing campaign..  but we have since appointed experienced ICO people to assist, like Nathan Christian and David Drake and we are now going well.

First off, there is nothing simple about B2B; companies come in many different shapes and sizes, payments occur in all sorts of different ways, business relationships cross borders and overlap regulatory bodies, trust is difficult to earn in a single business transaction.  When you zoom out enough, you see that what we have here is a disorderly pile of businesses across the world unable to properly market to each other and connect. The main issues stem from lack of visibility, lack of trust and the relative difficulty of arranging and enforcing payment.  Until recently this has been the status quo - B2C sales are straightforward as customers are not complex agents in the business space and can be paid efficiently and simply - however the structuring and security needed for an efficient B2B space has not been properly addressed by the market, until now.  Tradove turns a disorderly pile into an interconnected network. We provide an architecture; something sophisticated enough to capture the complexity of the B2B space and far reaching enough to transform the way that businesses connect.  The use of blockchain technology is key, and businesses are taking notice, research has found a dramatic increase in business awareness of blockchain technology (https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2017/juniper-research-blockchain-corporates/). BBCoin will find a natural home in B2B as a means of exchange that is dynamic enough to take the myriad input channels of businesses across the world and liquid enough to provide stable outputs.  Companies will be able to find each other using the network and can easily judge the trustworthiness of a potential business parter through an analysis of their Tradove profile and surrounding internet presence. They will then be able to easily market and do businesses using the emerging blockchain technology.   To tie this all together, technology is set to revolutionise the B2B space, and Tradove is leading the way - stay tuned!  Good Fortune -Kent        ",False

You demanded details of our blockchain team. A post with their photos, full work histories, LinkedIn profiles and company name has been on this thread for a while now yet you appear not to have read it or engaged with any of its content. DO you care to analyse anything of substance or do you prefer always to find fault?  What do you think or our blockchain team? Isn't their experience and capacity important?  Isn't that why you wanted to know more details?  In relation to your specific compaints, yes, I did once mistype Slovakia for Slovenia in the Telegram group. Once. I have consistently stated that the blockchain team were Slovenian. And yes, we did believe that KickICO would list us on 20 January. Turns out that KickICO will not list ICOs until they start. We will be listed there on 1 Feb.  I understand that you and many others mistook my humour at the end of my AMA interview when I said 'show me the money'. But I was right about large investors. We have now raised over US$20 million in our pre-sale period. You may be right that we could do some slicker marketing. Pretty good fundraising with 'bad' marketing, right?  Maybe the business idea, Tradove's company record over 5 years, our established tight-knit team are significant to some investors?  Maybe that's why Forbes, ICOBench, Neon Exchange and others rate this ICO highly?  Since your initial complaints we have appointed Nathan Christian as ICO Manager, appointed David Drake as an ICO Advisor, responded to requests to institute a referral program, replaced our bounty manager and announced a new bounty program. All of these announcements were made in this thread and you have commented on none of them.  You are free to decide not to invest. But why so much vitriol directed at me and my team? Have we met and did I offend you some how??  Will you now engage with some issues of substance? Or are you merely trying to find fault?

Firstly there is a price discount. During the presale period (until 31 Jan), a BBCoin costs only US$ 0.12. During public sale each BBCoin will cost US$ 0.16.  But in addition to this price discount there is a bonus depending on when you buy:  If you buy on or before 20 January, you get an additional 20% bonus.  If you buy after 20 January but before 31 January you get a 10% bonus.  If you are a large investor (total spend of US$48,000 or over you get a 30% bonus)  Only one bonus is ever applicable.  So basically, if you know you want to buy BBCoin, you are smart to place your order before 20 January.  Please let me or our Telegram team know if you need any further information to make your decision.  Good Fortune,  -Kent",False

As you can understand now I've done a lot of money in the last 4 months   Last time I've invested money was in the 2000-2003 years (it was a bad period for the ""dot com"" markets) But I put myself in the shoes of a new investor who wants to invest now in cryptocurrencies. There is 99,9% scam alerts. Bitcoin itself is a scam (Jp Morgan said it's the bigges fraud ever...and a lot of famous financial newspaper said it)..and I can read on Reddit etc..scams alert about all the exchanges (Coinbase, Bittrex, Bitstamp etc..)  But I know it's impossible to do thousounds% of gains without risks....so I've invested some money into TraDove. I've read about their team and advisors and I've decided to trust them. Maybe it's a scam...maybe not...but I try. If it's not a scam I'll gain a lot of money when TraDove will be traded on exchanges (because now only little investors are putting money on ICO for fear of scam). If it will be really a scam, patience!  I will have lost only a very small part of what I have earned.

The ETH contribution address is: 0x90b12787fa2067ccb46f017f70c07529a562c6c9  If you do some digging through transactions you'll spot a pattern. Eth is being sent to staging wallets. Once a wallet reaches 100ETH, it is being split into 3 different wallets. Two of the three are large, about 98ETH total, and the third is the small remainder. In the new wallets for the two large amounts, the process repeats until it reaches 100 ETH, and again it splits.  What's interesting is where the small amounts are going. If you follow them, they bundle into wallets that reach about 4 ETH, then it goes to Binance.

All accounts found with duplicate or repeat Transaction ID numbers will be subsequently and immediately frozen until such time a user can validate that they made the initial transaction. All other delinquent accounts are frozen, their transactions cancelled and will be liquidated as soon as possible.  We’re aware that this is a concern that has been brought up by members of the Telegram chat group, and wanted to assure our investors that those attempting such an action have been caught in the act through the approval system and the spectacular efforts of our verification team.

I've read through the ICO details and the WhitePaper. It does appear legitimate to me - although much of the team, founder and investors do not look like they are particularly clued into the altcoin business and could easily have been persuaded by the pitch around the potential return that attaching their name to such an ICO could yield, but they do look like genuine senior and reasonably well connected people in the banking and tech business - so I guess the hope is that with the presale money in hand they can go out and engage properly with the technical expertise. I struggle to see how this will have the kind of expected growth if it remains tied to a single portal. I'd like to see BBCoin become more of a Ripple for the BTB sector, able to be applied to several or all BTB platforms and not tied to the fortunes of TraDove company and site - developing a standard in blockchain code for verifying and logging trust histories that can be adopted by multiple platforms, and even a job for miners in operating a decentralised verification mechanism against public records of supplier registrations, trading, court judgement, bankruptcy, etc . Likewise I think the tokens will only be credible as a means of exchange for BTB transactions if something can be done to manage wild fluctuations and speculations on the token. I know a lot of us considering the ICO want to see this token shoot through the roof, but that kind of volatility will be a killer to supporting BTB transactions!  I'm also keen to see if this could be a platform/product/approach that could have particular benefit in developing markets/poorer countries. Trading volumes will be much lower here - so perhaps an action under the social responsibility line rather than profitability. Poorer countries suffer massively from lack of trust and in ability to achieve fair access to foreign exchange to trade products or import factors of production. That's why the most successful companies in these areas are large family owned conglomerates - keeping the supply chain in house and relationships within the family is the least bad trust and assurance system you can rely on. This is not available for small and medium sized operations or those without the resources for vertical and horizontal integration. This is where this technology and approach could see social outcomes: improving ease of doing business, inhibiting ability of elites and established players to raise prohibitive barriers to market entry, and even the chance to provide a degree of insulation of supply chains from the volatility of a poor macro-economic environment (such as inflation through poor regulation of money supply, etc).

I came to this conclusion by thinking what are the green flags and what are the red flags?  The only red flag to most people is the fact that there was one 4chan member stating this was a scam due to the fact the ICO funds were immediately being moved to hundreds of different wallets.  The reason is fairly simple - the ICO funds (as confirmed when emailing Kent) have been moved onto CoinBase after they hit the TraDove accounts. Doing this is much more secure than storing the funds of an ICO in a single wallet. CoinBase spreads large amounts of funds into multiple wallets - however this is done in the backend of CoinBase - it is a blockchain security feature to spread risk, so if one wallet is compromised, the loss is minimal. Remember when Bittrex was hacked? This is because Bittrex did not do this - they had far too many funds stored in a single wallet point containing millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin. So, this is why you are seeing funds moved from the TraDove ICO wallets into CoinBase and then CoinBase moving them in the backend into Binance wallets.  The only other red flag I can see raised by people is the poor grammatical skills on parts of the ICO website - please remember that the CEO of TraDove is Chinese and sometimes there may be slight spelling errors due to English being a second language - hardly a red flag in my view but I can see how others may interpret that.  Now if anyone has any other issues they would like to bring up I am more than happy to try and get answers for you or even answer them myself.  Finally, I am not in any way affiliated with TraDove, but I went through the entire range of emotions by investing, asking for a refund when I panicked and now am 100% back on board.

Please be patient - your refund will come. When it does come can I please ask that you share this with the rest of the community?

It seems amateurish, what really is unusual for such a high-level team (when all the team members really are involved in this project). I suggest, tradove hired Ms. Kristen Colwell (director of marketing at Brian D. Colwell) to make some advertisement for their coin (her husband? brian is a team member of tradove’s facebook page), but she is not really into this subject matter and are not able to answer the questions by herself.

I'd like to point out that their website, tradove.com, has an Alexa ranking of 31k at the time of this writing. That is VERY low for an Alexa ranking, and means they have a very high amount of website traffic. It's extremely difficult and requires a lot of traffic to get enough users to one's site to get an Alexa ranking under 100k... and the Tradove website's traffic has given them a super low ranking of 31k. That tells you something GOOD about how established their biz must be and the number of users who are using their website every single day (hint: it takes a crap ton of users to get an Alexa ranking that low). So in that context, accusing them of making their money by email spamming is totally delusional.  And those same users are going to be what gives Tradove's coin a much better-than-average chance of success.  (Yes, I'm brand new to the forum - this forum was one of my research stops prior to investing in the ico and I couldn't resist commenting.)

Because it is much more secure than storing the funds of an ICO in a single wallet. CoinBase spreads large amounts of funds into multiple wallets - however this is done in the backend of CoinBase - it is a blockchain security feature to spread risk, so if one wallet is compromised, the loss is minimal.  This is why you are seeing funds moved from the ICO wallets into CoinBase and then potentially into Binance wallets.  Jeez chill out and educate yourself on back-end blockchain security.",False

Eth is being sent to staging wallets. Once a wallet reaches 100ETH, it is being split into 3 different wallets. Two of the three are large, about 98ETH total, and the third is the small remainder. In the new wallets for the two large amounts, the process repeats until it reaches 100 ETH, and again it splits.  What's interesting is where the small amounts are going. If you follow them, they bundle into wallets that reach about 4 ETH, then it goes to Binance.

Today after listening to this idiot (stupid me, I know), I freaked out and immediately requested my investment back from TraDove.  I was REFUNDED my ENTIRE AMOUNT from TraDove after telling them I was concerned with the negative press. It took maybe 9 hours for this to arrive.  DID YOU HEAR THAT ""ENTERTAINMENT""? THEY REFUNDED ME IN FULL.  Not only has this user ""Entertainment"" provided me with undue stress, but I have now wasted the time of the TraDove team who are frantically putting together this ICO and manually approving transactions.  Entertainment - you have to realise that if you do not have any concrete proof of what you are saying, then please be quiet - you are causing so many problems to future investors as well as the TraDove team who are putting together a product that can really help businesses work together. These baseless assumptions have cost a lot of people time and money.  So now after this fiasco, I will be re-investing back into TraDove by investing more than my original amount.  If anyone has any questions for me I am happy to answer them.  PS - If you are currently in the process of getting a refund - they have told me that it may take 24 hours due to the volume in coping with the ICO.  Thanks  PPS - If you see this comment I have written on multiple threads it is because I can see this guy is spreading FUD on nearly every forum page for TraDove...so given the amount of time I have taken from the TraDove team, I feel this is the least I can do to help them out.",False

See Telegram message below:   1.  About the scam issue. There are false claims that we are a scam. We have done our best to present our information. Many of them are self proving like those videos from our advisors. We cannot prove to every claim that we are, so you should make your own judgement. We will defend legally any false claims that cause damage for us. Fortunately, up to now, this has not happened as those people could not provide any evidence.  2.  About our process. Because we take both BTC, ETH and Fiat, we have to manage the process semi-automatically. A. You have to upload your KYC info so we would be SEC compliant by approving you. Meaning we have to read your passport or ID, that cannot be done automatically  especially with obscure picture. Build a machine reading system will take lots of time and resources.  B. After you place the order and upload the proof, we have to proof read and compare it with our wallets and bank accounts. BTC and ETH are easy. But Fiat wire is more tedious and time consuming as we have to compare it with our bank account. So we cannot do smart contract for multiple channel verification. It has to be done semiautomatically. We actually prefer wire as we don’t need to convert BTC and ETH to cash to finance our operation. Again building an auto proofing connection to banks will take a long time and lots of resources.  3.  About multiple wallet addresses. We use Coinbase to receive money and may add Gemini soon. They provide higher security and ease of management than we do ourselves. Coinbase use multiple wallet address per account. That is why people see money are distributed right after arrival. Please consult Coinbase for that matter for further questions.  4.  About Investment. Please invest responsibly and invest only the amount you can afford to lose. We have seen investor borrowed money to invest. That is not right. We are happy to refund any one who have doubt about our project, who regret and who have other difficulties. Fortunately so far we have only done 3 times.  I hope I have clarified major issues you concerned about. Even though we welcome every one to participate, I apologize that we cannot make every one happy due to our limited bandwidth and overwhelming demand. Have fun!  Kent J Yan Founder and CEO",False

See Telegram message below:   1.  About the scam issue. There are false claims that we are a scam. We have done our best to present our information. Many of them are self proving like those videos from our advisors. We cannot prove to every claim that we are, so you should make your own judgement. We will defend legally any false claims that cause damage for us. Fortunately, up to now, this has not happened as those people could not provide any evidence.  2.  About our process. Because we take both BTC, ETH and Fiat, we have to manage the process semi-automatically. A. You have to upload your KYC info so we would be SEC compliant by approving you. Meaning we have to read your passport or ID, that cannot be done automatically  especially with obscure picture. Build a machine reading system will take lots of time and resources.  B. After you place the order and upload the proof, we have to proof read and compare it with our wallets and bank accounts. BTC and ETH are easy. But Fiat wire is more tedious and time consuming as we have to compare it with our bank account. So we cannot do smart contract for multiple channel verification. It has to be done semiautomatically. We actually prefer wire as we don’t need to convert BTC and ETH to cash to finance our operation. Again building an auto proofing connection to banks will take a long time and lots of resources.  3.  About multiple wallet addresses. We use Coinbase to receive money and may add Gemini soon. They provide higher security and ease of management than we do ourselves. Coinbase use multiple wallet address per account. That is why people see money are distributed right after arrival. Please consult Coinbase for that matter for further questions.  4.  About Investment. Please invest responsibly and invest only the amount you can afford to lose. We have seen investor borrowed money to invest. That is not right. We are happy to refund any one who have doubt about our project, who regret and who have other difficulties. Fortunately so far we have only done 3 times.  I hope I have clarified major issues you concerned about. Even though we welcome every one to participate, I apologize that we cannot make every one happy due to our limited bandwidth and overwhelming demand. Have fun!  Kent J Yan Founder and CEO",False

BBCoin will facilitate Corporate sales, marketing and trade.  1.  In our business social network, sales people can pay buying people in BBCoins for their effort to look at products/services or listen to their pitch. Buying people can deposit those BBCoins into their corporate account so their sales people can use it to pitch to buying people from other companies. Sales people or companies can also buy BBCoins from open markets for that usage and thus opening up corporate demand for our tokens. TraDove will make a small facilitation fees.  2. Companies can pay buying people BBCoins to take a look at their advertisement on our site. Buying people can deposit earned BBCoins into their corporate accounts so their companies can use that or bought BBCoins to pay for advertising to buyers of other companies. Again open up corporate demand.  3. We plan to use BBCoin for international trade especially with developing countries when dealing with local banks and sending money in and out of the country is a stress. It can also be used with block chain tech such as smart contract to make sure that you get paid for what you deliver. Solving the trust problem.  We acquired a close competitor Globial.com. There are some other distant competitors. We are leading the way in this field of B2B 2.0.  I will find out listing exchanges from our ICO team and let you know ASAP..  Yes USD 3000 applies to all investors. But we welcome all interested people to participate and are not too strict especially if you could help us spread out the word and provide other helps. Email us at bbcoin@tradovemail.com to discuss.  Take care,  Kent",False
