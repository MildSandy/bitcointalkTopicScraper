We want people and brands to engage in a more complex mission and only after the item has been purchased, they'll mark it as complete and get their bonus. So the platform will not be focused on: click this and get money, but instead on: accept this challenge, enjoy the ride and get rewarded for a great job done.",False

Impetus One is a revolutionary advertising engine that allows advertisers and publishers to reward their customers based on a mission completion principle.    Quick overview  Whitepaper Lightpaper  Impetus One is an online advertising platform that offers brands direct means of interaction with their customers by providing crypto rewards for fulfilling their life goals. The brands no longer need to spend their budgets on inefficient ad-campaigns that offer little to no real interaction with their customers. Brands can choose to directly engage with their communities by providing rewards for completing missions in line with people‚Äôs life goals.  Impetus One is replacing Pay Per Click (PPC) with Pay Per Mission (PPM): a unique concept to the online advertising industry.    In simple words: the brand sets out what the customer needs to do, and the customer gets rewarded when completing the mission. Both parties interact and develop a special bond. This is how brand loyalty and emotional attachment is fostered. The more creative and customer-oriented the missions are, the higher the quality of interaction and chances for the mission to be completed.  Impetus One is being developed by a team of serial entrepreneurs. Our achievements so far:  Several exits to date Existing businesses in online advertising, online sales, real estate and payments Members of the diplomatic corps PHDs in behavioral economics National Security Advisors Security experts that work for the European Parliament    TEAM  How does Impetus One work?  1. Loading the ad details - AI-powered recommendations Registered advertisers (brands) will load campaign details into the web app and choose the audience they want to reach, based on AI suggestions made by the platform. Starting from the parameters we are able to track (location, speed, weather, number of steps, time, calories burn), advertisers will decide on mission fulfillment criteria.  2. Request review Online reviewers, will be requested to review new ads, which will be validated based on a consensus mechanism.  3. Review results Ads can be accepted or rejected. Accepted ads are automatically fed to selected publishers. For rejected ads, reviewers will be able to see why the ad was rejected and adapt it according to our guidelines. Reviewers will be remunerated, regardless of the outcome of the review process. For rejected ad campaigns, advertisers will be charged $1 for resubmission.  4. Ad campaign publishing The platform starts pushing the ads to selected publishers through the Impetus code snippet. The system, based on AI algorithms, will match the campaigns with the best publishers.  5. Ad impressions Users are being served the ads in the layout space selected by the publisher. The AI system will collect data through our code snippet, and adjust impression rates based on user behavior. The user will also be able to tweak ad types and categories through his in-app control panel.  6. User mission enrollement When tapping an ad, a landing page generated from the campaign data will be displayed in a Webview Window for mobile devices or through a web page redirect for desktop computers. On this page, the user will be able to join the mission.  7. Enrollement confirmation The publisher app is notified of the customer enrolment, and the app starts tracking the required parameters. When the mission fulfillment criteria are met, the publisher app notifies the platform, and the platform marks the mission completed for the specified user.  8. Advertiser mission charge After successful mission completion, the advertiser is being charged the mission cost, consisting of the mission bounty, publisher revenue, and platform revenue. Advertisers will be charged less frequently, once they have a positive payment history in the platform. 90% of the amount charged from the advertiser, will be used to buy Impetus One coins from our reserve, to be used to reward platform participants.  9. Revenue distribution According to the mission settings, the blockchain smart contract is triggered and the user‚Äôs and publisher‚Äôs rewards will be transferred to their wallets, in Impetus One, at the fixed platform rate.  10. Cashouts Platform participants will be able to sell their coins back into the platform or transfer them to external exchanges.
