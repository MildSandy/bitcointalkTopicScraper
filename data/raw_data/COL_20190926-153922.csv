Apple of Blockchain!!,"The First Color Airdrop Event Was Successful! https://i.imgur.com/fOGF3w1.jpg  Hello, Color Supporters! Did you enjoy our first Airdrop live last week? On June 25, the Color Team picked five of the lucky winners who will receive 6,000 COL randomly on Facebook Live. We were grateful that as many as 600 people applied in just the first week! It was our first Airdrop event, so we were a little nervous but had so much fun. Today, we have a short interview with two Airdrop live hosts, Jay and Cindy.  Q. How did you prepare for the first Airdrop Live? Jay: We saw several Airdrop videos to see how others have done it. We put up the Airdrop tracker sheet and a Google random number generator on a big screen so that all of you who are watching our live streaming could see it clearly. Also, Cindy and I practiced several times before we went on live.  Q. What was your biggest concern? Cindy: I was responsible for the background music during the lucky draw lottery. Playing a wrong song in the middle of the live was my biggest concern. lol  https://i.imgur.com/WzACCnn.png Color Airdrop Live Screenshot(www.facebook.com/colorsorgmx)  Q. What did you consider the most for the fair draw? Jay: We’ve excluded our Color Team employees to give as much benefits as possible to our Color supporters:) Basically, we ran the Google random number generator during our live streaming on Facebook. I’m sure anyone who watched the live could’ve noticed that the process was very fair!  Q. Please say a word to those who are waiting for the next Airdrop event. Cindy : Please note that the live streaming itself is quite short. It doesn't take long to draw five people, so the broadcast ends very soon. If you're not on time, it may take a while for you to access the live on Facebook, so it might be faster to check the Airdrop tracker sheet. Thank you for supporting us!  Watch the Airdrop Live on every Wednesday at 3:00pm KST on the Color Facebook page!▼ https://www.facebook.com/colorsorgmx/  Go any suggestions or want to learn how to get involved?

The Color Platform was designed with the slogan “Colorful dApp Store”. The Color Platform provides the Color Development Kit (CDK) to enable the easy development of blockchain services. The CDK makes it easy to develop dApps and Smart Contracts, thereby reducing overall development costs. The Color Platform is developing more than 10 Mega DApps including Color Legal, Color Medical, and Color TV. Color dApps will use a single unified cryptocurrency COL that aims to provide collective synergy to the platform.  The Colorchain is also a hybrid blockchain that combines software and hardware. Traditional blockchains have been characterized by slow transaction speeds and poor scalability. To solve this problem, Colorchain has adopted Peer-to-Peer transactions and cryptographically secured PUF Chips. By avoiding third-party intervention, P2P will enable transaction speed is as fast as Visa or MasterCard.The PUF Chip acts as a “digital fingerprint” generated during the manufacturing process.  The Color Platform also utilizes the “Pixel Program” to ensure fair distribution of Color Coins. Decentralized technology is becoming controlled by a centralized minority and is treading the same path of centralized fiat currency. Pixels utilizes a conditional distribution mechanism that promotes the distribution of Color Coins to other individuals. The Pixel Program addresses the unfair distribution of wealth, but also for giving organizations, voluntary organizations, and startups.  ▼ Download Whitepaper ▼ https://colors.org/Color_Platform_White_Paper_v0.73_180521.pdf",False

Apple of Blockchain!!,"COLOR PLATFORM Decentralized App Store! Apple of Blockchain!!  ""Color"" is a 3rd generation blockchain platform that focuses on developing dApps. The Color Platform runs on the ""Color Engine"" that enables non-technical users to easily develop Smart Contracts. Utilizing the revolutionary simple mechanism of Color Engine technology, the ""Color dApp Store"" aims to create a wide array of enterprise-level dApps. Instead of hosting a plethora of unrelated services on a single platform, Color dApps will be powered by a single unifying cryptocurrency, the ""Color Coin (COL)"". Think Color.

Color Engine technology enables users to easily create ""Auto Smart Contracts"". Users can utilize the ""Color Design Tool"" to create ""Smart Contracts"" and ""Smart Contract Templates"" without any programming.  SMART CONTRACT The Color Platform aims to create a new economic blockchain paradigm by enabling almost anyone to create Smart Contracts. By drastically lowering the technical barrier to entry, ""Auto Smart Contracts"" will finally enable non-technical users to unleash the power of Smart Contracts. ""Auto Smart Contracts"" integrate data layers capable of storing information beyond the contract itself. Combined with an interface layer capable of accessing and verifying the state of external blockchains, the Color Platform is capable of computationally enforcing the terms of the Smart Contracts. Every Auto Smart Contract will operate on standard metadata and will be interoperable with every other Color dApp.  PIXEL PROGRAM Fair distribution of tokens has always been a problem. The Color Platform is focused on the fair distribution early tokens and the continued usage of tokens. The ""Pixel Program"" is a network effect driven referral program that distributes ""Pixels"". Pixels are awarded on a periodic basis. Unless Pixels are given to a new users, sent to fund projects, or used for other community functions, they will disappear. The ""Conditional Sharing Mechanism"" aims to disincentivize hoarding and increase overall user participation in the system.  P2P CONSENSUS ALGORITHM To minimize power consumption and  transaction costs, a new solution to the Byzantine General’s Problem (BGP) is necessary. Researchers for the Color Project are currently at work testing a system that is a vast improvement to any currently implemented solution to the BGP. Most importantly, this solution maintains decentralization, security, and allows for scaling and speeds surpassing centralized payment providers such as Visa/Mastercard. The new consensus algorithm solves what the PoS (Proof of Stake) model originally hoped to achieve at scale, while still maintaining decentralization and security.   DAPPS We are still reliant on prototype level dApps that are plagued with scalability issues. Color aims to revolutionize the dApp ecosystem by developing Enterprise-Level dApps. The Color Team has dedicated massive amounts of resources to build ""Mega dApps"".  Currently, there are already more than 10 Mega dApps being developed on the Color Platform. Color dApps are powered by the single unifying Color Coin (COL), thereby making all the applications interoperable.  COLOR LEGAL “Color Legal” stores various legal records on the blockchain. Color Legal will provide notarization, certification, and confirmation date. Everyone has to deal with large and small legal contracts in our daily lives, however in order to legally receive & submit documents we must visit the court, registry office, ward office, and submit a seal certificate or letter of proxy. Additionally, for notarization you need the help of yet another administrative agency. Color Legal simplifies all of this and reduces costs. For example, a real estate contract or a money lending contract can be processed as a smart contract on Color Legal. When the conditions are met, interest payments or contract terminations can be automatically executed. Another notable example is legal executions of wills. If you place your will on Legalchain, if the conditions are met, Color Legal will ensure the immutable execution of your smart contract will.  COLOR MEDICAL “Color Medical” is a dApp that keeps your medical records secure through blockchain technology. First of all, we can make a big contribution to the medical industry by making it possible to obtain big data about medical care. When using personal medical data from universities, laboratories, etc., the individual who agrees to provide the data will receive compensation for the medical data in Color Coins. In addition, Color Medical enables accurate and efficient medical treatment based on data recorded individually from birth to the present. As the number of users increases and more data is accumulated, Color Medical will lay the foundations for developing into an artificial intelligence treatment platform.  COLOR TV “Color TV” is a global content distribution platform focused on K-Pop videos. The major global content distribution platforms used in various countries have two major problems: One is the lack of convenient payment methods to handle each country's currency and the other is that within that platform content consumers do not get any compensation. By using Color Coin as a payment and reward mechanism, Color TV makes it easy to purchase content from within your app and use it as a donation to content-creators via Color Coins. In addition, Color Coin contributed by consumers is distributed securely to the copyright holders, since the contract of copyright is concluded in advance with the content copyright holders (suppliers) through the Smart Platform of the Color Platform.   WHITE PAPER  Color's approach to writing the white paper is to first review and benchmark decentralized applications from different platforms. After careful review, we select and design few decentralized applications to present as our use cases. Once the design step is done, we use the combination of Color Engine Technology and Auto Smart Contract on Ethereum protocol to build and test the use cases. The final step is to evaluate, verify, and analyze the outcome from each use cases. Until all these steps are complete, we don’t start with writing the white paper because our goal is to back up our claims with real use cases and verifiable results.
