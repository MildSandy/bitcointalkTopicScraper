Low-level API   A low-level API is necessary for integration of mobile operators into the blockchain platform. As a basis upon which the entire system operates, the low-level API is a generic API for integration that allows for support of a wide range of business scenarios to work with a blockchain node.   The API sets out the procedure for interaction between software components to provide common functionality, but at the same time, the API allows us to abstract functionality away from specifics of implementation. The API documents how software components interact with each other. Software components that implement this low-level API have been built and are already functioning as expected.   The low-level API developed by our team is available at the following link: https://wiki.blockchaintele.com/index.php/Low_Level_API_JSON   High-level specifications   A high-level specification is technical documentation that describes in detail a specific business scenario for interaction between participants via the blockchain. For each use case that will be implemented on our platform, it is necessary to develop an appropriate high-level specification.   Having pursued a large number of negotiations with telecom operators, we have learned what services are now in highest demand. As a result, two high-level specifications have been developed — one for TeleChain Broker, a joint solution with Nexign, and the other for Global coverage with local rates for subscribers.   TeleChain Broker   Many telecom operators hold conservative views and are not ready to immediately implement disruptive solutions and change the established mechanism for providing services. The solution allows operators to easily connect to the blockchain platform — the traditional roaming infrastructure is preserved, and at the same time, they receive access to a new revenue stream. We called such an easy way to connect to our Bubbletone blockchain platform TeleChain Broker.   Within the TeleChain Broker marketplace, operators can create wholesale offers that consist of, for example, seasonal packages, and are valid within a specified period. In addition, deals are closed immediately, and prices can be changed at any time. Thus, TeleChain Broker allows operators to immediately bring products that are demanded by subscribers to the market, i.e. provide a short time to market, and receive additional revenue.   We are going to publish a blog post dedicated to this solution.   Global coverage with local rates for subscribers   The decentralized platform allows mobile network operators, even those who do not have roaming agreements, to interact securely and directly, without any complex integrations or intermediaries. The operators use multi-account SIM cards and distribute them among their subscribers. These cards allow subscribers to upload local mobile profiles “over-the-air”, i.e. via encrypted special binary SMS messages or the data channel using an SMPD platform (eSIM standard). Thus, while travelling, subscribers can purchase service packages at the rates of local operators and use their existing SIM card all over the globe.   To implement this use case, we are working on integrating the blockchain platform into billing systems of several telecom operators.   Our legal experts have also almost completed development of a public offer. Operators need to sign this document to be connected to the platform. The public offer outlines conditions for connecting operators to the platform.   In addition, we are working on the implementation of the subscriber identification process. Before an operator starts servicing a subscriber of another operator, they need to be able to confirm the identity of this subscriber.

ITU News recently caught up with Clementvale Project Director Alexander Yakovenko to discuss how the company is addressing shifting market trends and how they aim to participate in ITU standards.   What are some of the most important trends for mobile communications in 2019-2020?  The telecom industry has changed significantly over the last few years. Currently, it is undergoing a digital transformation at an increasingly rapid pace. In my opinion, there is no doubt that 2019 and 2020 are to be years of drastic change. The power of the Internet of Things (IoT) and emerging technologies like 5G and eSIM will be leveraged, with Blockchain being no exception. Digital service providers will ensure implementation of these promising disruptive technological advancements to get access to new sales channels and lead in the market.   What new business models do you see emerging and how will Clementvale Baltic OÜ be part of them?  Currently, Clementvale Baltic OÜ is focused on the development of two innovative business models that leverage innovation solutions, including blockchain, and partnerships with other telecom players. Our business models provide telecom operators with the opportunity to receive additional revenue streams. These new business models will provide different levels of ease in terms of compliance with the established mechanism for providing services for telecom operators — one will be simpler, and the other more complex.   The easier-to-use model is a marketplace where wholesale deals to purchase and sell telecom service packages are made. The traditional roaming infrastructure is preserved and operators can create wholesale offers that consist of, for example, seasonal packages, and are valid within a specified period. This approach is unique since it opens up the opportunity to purchase service packages in bulk within existing roaming agreements. In addition, deals are closed immediately, and prices can be changed at any time. Thus, this business model allows operators to provide a short time to market for products that are demanded by subscribers.   The more complex model represents a marketplace where mobile network operators, even those who do not have roaming agreements, interact securely and directly, without any complex integrations or intermediaries. These operators use multi-account SIM cards and allow their subscribers to upload local mobile profiles over-the-air, i.e. via encrypted special binary SMS messages or the data channel using an SMDP platform (eSIM standard). Thus, while travelling, subscribers can purchase service packages at the rates of local operators and use their existing SIM cards.   To speed up implementation of these business models, Clementvale Baltic OÜ is developing a blockchain-based platform and participating in standardisation of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Our company continues to actively develop these business models and offer them to players in the telecom market.

We will continue to inform you about all the news. For your attention the questions and answers that were announced during the AMA session:  Q: Who is your potential competitor? A: The best world's project were described in the recent article published on Forbes  Q: Who are your potential partners apart from Shocard? A: At the moment, we don't develop deep cooperation with Shocard because we're developing our own solution for clients validation. The main problem within this solution has been solved, namely the opportunity to recognize various  lines from various documents. This option allows users not to type their personal details, exclude errors and manual labor of operators to retype the clients data from pdf copies documents. Also now we are working on implementation of mechanism for comparison of  selfie photos and passport photos. It is necessary to meet requirements of a number of mobile operators.  We are now working on PoC with SiMYO and several other mobile operators. Our potential partners are all mobile operators, especially small and medium ones (like MVNOs) and other service providers (insurance companies, booking companies, content providers - for example, TV, music, business apps etc.). Kasko2go, an insurance company, is our current partner and they will launch their project next year. And after that we will be able to integrate them into our system.  When it comes to telecom, we are working with Simyo (spanish MVNO operator), Mobily (SA MNO operator), Venta Mobile (Latvia), Mobifone (Vietnam). AT the moment PoC procedure is  passed with one of them and we will implement this procedure with others. We have a list of partners who are not ready to announce their names until the PoC successfully complete. We consider Nexign to be one of the most  important strategic partners. Nexign is one of the biggest companies that provide BSS (billing systems) for mobile operators. This company fully understands how the billing systems work and they help us to create low level API  of our BlockChain for integration of our BlockCHain part  into BSS of mobile operators. AT the moment, all our main BlockChain resources are focused on creation of this API.  This will allow mobile operators to  quickly implement to our platform. We hope to show real ready industrial use case during GSMA mobile world congress in Barcelona at the end of February on our joint booth.  Q: Do you have any plans to develop your own Blockchain or will remain in Ethereum? A: When it comes to the platform, we are developing a private blockchain for a special group of users - an industrial blockchain for telecom operators and service providers. This blockchain is for professional market players. Based on Graphene, it has very high performance .  Q: We invested in the whole “BubbleTone” which is in use in Russia currently “without” UMT. In previous posts from the BubbleTone team, only certain functions and or features explained as “certain services within BubbleTone App” will use “UMT”. Stated after the fact of investing. A: Nowadays the app of such level is very complicated and requires time for many integrations. First integration was with a Russian operator, that's why  their clients can call to PSTN using the balance within this operator. Also the development of the web-version of the BubbleTone has been taking a lot of time. We hope it will be available soon.  We have implemented a number of telecom functions into the app (e.g . conversion of voice codec OPUS into G.729, integration with our own SMS-server, etc.) and we have a delay with implementation  of personal balances into the app. As soon as the personal balances are implemented, the SIP out calls for other participants will be available. We hope it will take place in the first quarter 2019.  Q: What happened to your test with 'Virgin' Russia? A: Virgin Connect uses profiles that are not compatible with our our applet. As a result, the tests are suspended until we find a solution.  Q: Where are we in 6 months? I see no exchange trading action and increase, I don’t even know how much each umt is worth. A: During this time, the team was focused on negotiations with operators and the platform development. We do not expect the trading activity to increase until the token gets its utility purpose. You can find the UMT price here: https://www.livecoinwatch.com/price/Bubbletone-UMT  When it comes to UMT and token-economy - there were many questions about it. First of all, we're focused on the development of the platform and its launch. Secondly, we're working on our app. This app is a possible interface for operators. THE APP IS NOT BLOCKCHAIN-BASED. It will allow subscribers to choose and pay for offers. It is operators who use blockchain to make deals. When the platform is launched, more operators will be integrated into the platform and UMT token will get more value because it will be utilized and in demand.  Q: Where is your HP announcement? A: At the beginning, we planned to recommend operators to use HP equipment for nodes, but operators refused as they consider this to be protectionism.  Q: What was the treasury management of the funds raised during the ICO? Does the company still have enough fund to build the project (aka, did they cash out ETH into fiat or did they just hodl the ETH)? A: At the beginning of our ico, one ETH was 1350$. As of now, it's lower than 100$. The main amount of funds we received during the pre-ICO stage. As you can see, the exchange rate has significantly changed. The  organisation of ICO-process required a lot of money. We participated in many events and it was really expensive. The rest of the funds has been allocated to R&D. Our product is complicated, it requires time and resources, both human and financial. We have also allocated  a part of our resources to create joint solution with Nexign. As i mentioned above, we are going to showcase this solution in Barcelona in February 2019. Besides during the whole year the exchange rate was getting worse and worse, but we stored money on the accounts,  from which we received them. We have been spending funds  on an as-needed basis.  There are no standards of blockchain in the world. We understand necessity of  developing standards in this innovative technology. That's why we participate in different international organisations, such as ITU, TM Forum, SAMENA Council. In ITU we actively participate in the Focus Group on DLT. This process also requires many resources, both human and financial.  During the ICO we concluded several SWAP agreements. Once these companies are listed on exchanges and unlock our part of tokens we are going to partially sell them.  For our project to function fully and normally, we need to cooperate with banks, which take money from mobile operators and convert them to SDR tokens. There are no banks who are ready to do it now. That is why we have decided to establish our own payment institution which requires EMI (e-money license). It's very important task, it will take at least 6-8 month and additional investments.  We are also working on SDK for iOS and Android to let other operators integrate our application into their applications, as they want to promote their services using functionality of the Bubbletone appbuild in their apps. We are going to rewrite our WP in quarter 1 2019. As for the roadmap it will be rewritten by the end of this year.  Q: What is the current circulating supply of UMT? A: The circulating supply is 160 069 319, 28.  Q: How much % of UMT supply is still locked and when will all unlock? A: About 412 mln  (appr. 72%) of UMT supply is locked. All of them will be unlocked in 24 months (starting from september 2018). 3 %  is unlocked every month.   Q: Can you explained the top holders in etherscan? A: The biggest holder is Network development fund (locked for 24 months). No tokens are used from this fund now. From the very beginning the project was not focused on speculators. This a long-term project. We are not going to dump our token, we are going to work hard and to increase the token value and make the platform up and running.  We'll try to inform you more often about all the changes in R&D of Bubbletone platform. We'll have our roadmap corrected by the end of this year. We will updated our WP in Q1 2019. We kindly ask you to be patient.",False

Customized for the needs of mobile operators, the messenger provides additional revenue streams on voice calls and SMS messages from the app and other telecom services.  The Bubbletone team is glad to announce that a new version of our messenger has been released on October 26.  We have fixed a number of software bugs to make it easier  to use the application. So, what has been changed, exactly?  Interface  The first/main tab now contains a list of calls that a user has made, answered or missed;  New icons for the “make a call within the Bubbletone network” (peer-to-peer calls) and “make a call to PSTN” options;  The option “save gender information” in the “personal information” section in a user’s personal account now works properly;  The last message sent or received by the user now stays visible, even while the user is typing a new message with the pop-up keyboard;  There are a number of Android phones that have the following defect: their proximity sensors do not work properly. As a result, when calls came in, the screens of these phones would go black. This problem has been solved;  The settings menu includes a section called “additional info”. Among other information, this section includes the user’s Bubbletone number and balance. The Bubbletone number is the number which the user receives after they have signed an agreement with an operator. In the previous app version, this information disappeared from time to time. This problem has been solved.  Read the full story here:  https://medium.com/bubbletone-blockchain-in-telecom/bubbletone-new-version-released-a2788646cdaf",False

Just to let you know, access to contacts is needed to send peer-to-peer messages and make peer-to-peer calls (from the messenger user to the messenger user). Calls to the PSTN (to a subscriber’s mobile number or to a landline number) are paid features that are currently available only to customers of those operators who are integrated into the Bubbletone system.

ITU News caught up with Yuri Morozov, CEO and Founder of Bubbletone Blockchain for Telecom, about how blockchain can modernize the industry.  Why is Bubbletone partnering with Nexign to apply blockchain to business support systems (BSS) for telecom operators?  The joint solution will allow operators to get access to blockchain technology and make offers for new clients in parallel with current business processes.   The partnership with Nexign gives Bubbletone an opportunity to attract more operators to the ecosystem  without any additional expertise from the operator’s side. Nexign provides any operator with an easy start, even if the operator’s BSS, network switching subsystem (NSS), and security systems have strict development limitations.

In layman terms, Bubbletone is looking to eliminate the bottlenecks in today’s data roaming standards by using the blockchain to allow users to make calls at extremely low costs and at the same time, dramatically lower the fees for data roaming all across the world. Bubbletone is not only aiming to benefit consumers; telcos and service providers can also use the platform’s features to expand their network and reach globally without having to go through costly and complicated processes in today’s network integration architecture.  Simply put, Bubbletone aims to put a stop or at least cut down on the issues prevalent in the modern telecommunications industry.Bubbletone is a blockchain startup that is building a decentralized telecom ecosystem to connect end consumers and telcos directly. In layman terms, Bubbletone is looking to eliminate the bottlenecks in today’s data roaming standards by using the blockchain to allow users to make calls at extremely low costs and at the same time, dramatically lower the fees for data roaming all across the world.    Bubbletone is not only aiming to benefit consumers; telcos and service providers can also use the platform’s features to expand their network and reach globally without having to go through costly and complicated processes in today’s network integration architecture.  Simply put, Bubbletone aims to put a stop or at least cut down on the issues prevalent in the modern telecommunications industry.  As mentioned earlier, the entire basis of Bubbletone is to directly connect mobile network operators and end consumers on the platform’s blockchain-based marketplace.  To begin, any mobile carrier across the world can offer their own prepaid tariff plans on Bubbletone as smart contracts; these offers are aptly named “Offers” and are visible to all operators and users of the Bubbletone platform.  Whenever an offer is selected, a “Request” smart contract will be created to process the request. The smart contract contains the identity of the user who requested as well as payment information in regards to the offer.  Once the mobile carrier receives a request for their offer, they will identify the user who requested, accept the payment from the smart request, and then begin to service the user who now has access to the carrier’s services.  Bubbletone also allows non-mobile carriers such as cloud TV companies or music streaming services to use Bubbletone as a way to offer subscriptions to users.  Transactions in Bubbletone are done with the Universal Mobile Token (UMT) token, the platform’s official cryptocurrency. UMT tokens are used to pay for telco services in Bubbletone and they are also used as payments for sending messages or making calls in the Bubbletone messenger app.",False

We would like to share important news about the remarkable project dynamics.  After showcasing BubbleTone’s fully operational blockchain at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, we now see a growing interest coming from the large players in the telecom field.  We also did a number of dedicated product presentations for global mobile operators in Europe and received a lot of positive feedback. We are now drafting cooperation agreements with some of these companies.  This leads us to introduce the following changes:  1. We move the start of the ICO to 20 April 2018. By this time we will finalize the new strategic partnerships with large telecoms and will start joint pilot implementation of BubbleTone’s blockchain-based platform.  Firstly, this will secure an independent in-depth assessment and provide recognition from the leading industry players.  Secondly, this will help to protect the project participants from the bearish sentiment that is currently prevalent in the cryptocurrencies market.  2. The hard cap is lowered to 25 million US dollars. We estimate this amount to be sufficient, as the advancement of the platform and the development of the mobile application get ahead of the original schedule.  This will ensure that by the time the ICO starts, the product will have gained additional value for all participants.  Meanwhile, we emphasize that we do not shift the ending date of the ICO.  Therefore, the main target remains firmly in place. We hope to achieve it together!  Get ready: register, pass the KYC and join our Whitelist.",False

Proof of importance is a way of how the system ensures all computers in the network form a consensus.  Every account on a blockchain network is assigned an importance score.  This score will influence how individual users can “harvest” the blockchain. One could say harvesting on blockchain is almost the same as what miners do on the Bitcoin blockchain. The objective is to add people’s transactions to the blockchain, in exchange for a small financial reward. As people’s importance score grows higher, they will have a better chance at getting these rewards.  All the transactions are public domain. Proof of importance also provides onlookers a way to determine rating for the importance of individual accounts on the network and ensures the network remains decentralized at all times.",False

As a result, when the client goes to another country, there’s no need to provide their ID to get another SIM card. Roaming operators will only need to promptly offer their services and price quotes, and the network will distribute this information and use it to bill clients itself. The offers will be regulated by the law of supply and demand, so technical and market share dominance will become less important than, for instance, the quality of service. Isn't this the cellular communication we always wanted? We are making communication services exponentially more affordable and are fighting inequality. The cost to use and support our system is significantly less than what you'll find with other operators today. Our system has many technological advantages (and some shortcomings, of course).

We are negotiating with Orange and Vodafone and signed with LinguaLeo (English learning service) and 10+ mobile operators (Tesco Mobile (IE), Citic Telecom (HK), TruRoam Asia (AU) etc.) with 20+M subscribers who are totally ready for Proof of Concept (PoC) of the BubbleTone Blockchain in Telecom solution. They need stable token and a quick blockchain platform, and, like ourselves, they got tired of the many intermediaries that sometimes earn more than those who actually provide services and conduct business. Our project kills roaming just for a starter.  Initially we’re creating a community of small and medium-sized mobile operators that are looking for new services for their subscribers, such as global mobile coverage and value-added services, as well as new revenue streams on inbound tourists, Identity-as-a-Service and Voice-over-IP calls.  We are partnered with Morpho Oberthur - the world-leading SIM card manufacturer. We have approved with them our applet to be used with their SIMs. It will allow for downloading guest profile with the help of our OTA Platform onto SIM cards manufactured by Morpho Oberthur.  Morpho Oberthur is just one SIM card manufacturer, but the applet for guest mobile profile downloading must be approved with every SIM card manufacturer on an individual basis because they all use different crypto keys. There is no way to use one same applet with all SIM manufacturers and customization of the applet with every SIM manufacturer is a cost too.

BubbleTone Blockchain in Telecom - the first decentralized telecom ecosystem. It allows mobile network operators, phone users and service providers to interact directly.  >>>  WHITE PAPER | ONE PAGER | YELLOW PAPER  <<<  BubbleTone Blockchain in Telecom is for:   Project Vision   We directly connect mobile network operators and end users globally on our blockchain-based marketplace. As a mobile operator in Europe with over 20 years in telecom, we are going to leverage this blockchain platform to enter the global market and offer it to all operators.   Problem International roaming now means prohibitive expenses both for telecoms and subscribers around the world. Inter-operator charges for entering roaming market now exceed $20 million. Traditional roaming market is huge, but failing: according to research, 71% of all roamers globally remained silent, with just 1% of subscribers consuming 80% of all traffic in roaming.  SOLUTION With BubbleTone Blockchain, travelers can swiftly become legitimate local customers of any foreign operator in the country they are traveling to. They won’t have to replace their SIM card, and they retain their home number.   Any mobile carrier can publish prepaid plans as smart contracts on BubbleTone Blockchain. These offers are visible to all other operators and their subscribers. When subscriber selects offer, a new smart contract is created with the subscriber’s digital identity and payment transaction directly to foreign operator.  Our market   Every interaction between users, operators and service providers creates new smart contract in BubbleTone ecosystem. The potencial is over 1 000 000 000 smart contracts by 2020.  BubbleTone Mobile App  To make this process easy and comfortable for everyone, we created the BubbleTone Mobile App.  Beta-version is already launched available on iTunes and Google Play.  ●   Marketplace connecting subscribers and local network operators globally ●   Messaging and lifestyle app customizable for operators’ needs and content delivery  UMT Token     >>>  OUR SMART CONTRACTS ON GITHUB<<<  Our Team       >>>  READ OUR WHITEPAPER  <<<  >>>  READ OUR ONE PAGER  <<<  JOIN OUR 24/7 TELEGRAM CHAT   Partners   Contacts  WEBSITE | TELEGRAM | FACEBOOK | YOUTUBE | TWITTER | GITHUB| MEDIUM",False

The lower communication services cost for the user, the more he uses it. Thus, BubbleTone will help operators to sell more traffic.
