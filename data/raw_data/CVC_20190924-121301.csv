So if a service provider needs to verify somebody he could just ask another service provider give me the public key of the validator and then just look at the blockchain and verify it himself without paying something in a smart contract.  Example: Service providers could just share all public keys that they have (lets say on a website where all service providers register their known information, public key = validator). And when they then receive a PII from user they could just try to decrypt every attestation on the blockchain and check if the plain text of that decrypted text includes a hash that matches the hash of the PII that he has received from user. Like that service providers would lower their costs massivly and validators provit would decrease massivly.  Isn't that a HUGE problem? Normally in order to get this adopted goverments should join the party as validators. And the whitepaper states on page 13 paragraph 2 ""Civic's ecosystem will be designed to incentivice participation of trustworthy IDV providers known as validators, wo may be include financial instiutations, goverments...."".

Until then I was able to find some info on the website that might be helpful if it applies to your situation. From the FAQ:  ""How will I know if my purchase was successful? Both Bitcoin and Ethereum networks are overloaded.  For purchases made in BTC and ETH, we will deem a purchase to be successful when three confirmations have been received within six hours of the time that payment information is displayed to you during the crowdsale process. We reserve the right to refund your purchase if the transaction is processed after the six hour period lapses.  What will I need in order to participate in the crowdsale?  You will need the following:  1. Download the Civic App and register with Civic by providing your phone number and email address. To download the app, search “Civic Secure Identity” in the App Store for iOS or on GooglePlay for Android.  2. If you are paying in BTC:  A) Your BTC on an exchange or in a wallet, ready to be sent to the address displayed to you via the crowdsale widget.  B) Your BTC refund address which is your receiving address.  C) Your ERC20 compatible wallet address (please see examples of such wallets in the Technical Questions section below)  3. If you are paying in ETH:  A) Your ETH in an ERC20 compatible wallet (Note: It will NOT be possible to send ETH from an exchange)""  I sincerely hope this helps, but if not, you should be hearing from them soon. I know it's frustrating, so thanks for your patience.",False

Actually, I tried 3 times.  The very first time I tried to send, it just send ""Pending"" for over 3 hours.  So then I raised the Gas Price up to 60 Gwei, which allowed me to get further (and get those error above).  This is using myetherwallet.com and a ledger nano s.  I thought it might have been something about a bug in the MyEtherwallet client program, as I read you had to make sure to fill in the DATA field first otherwise the gas field gets wiped out.  But nothing I did made a difference.  In any case, I filled in the DATA field with the DATA info as instructed by civic, and I set the gas limit to 250000.  Civic did not say that I needed to up the Gas Price from 32 Gwei to 60 Gwei, but that is the only thing that enabled me to get the transaction out of the pending stage.

No need to put it in blockchain.

Though on the confirmation email from Civic, there is a star next to my payment and it says transaction fees may have been deducted from your payment.  So I don't know.

The ICO is planned to raise 11 million USD. This is for 110 million tokens. What will happen with the other 890 million tokens? If these are still in use and can still be sold (also if this will be in a later stage) than this will have an impact on the market again. So if the total supply of 1B coins can be distributed now or in the future this will have an impact on the price. That's why I calculate it as the toal supply valuation is 100 million. If the remaining tokens will never be sold (or burned) than indeed my statement was incorrect.,False

But think about the fact those partner tokens allocated to enterprises joining the network would serve as a strong incentive for them to implement Civic, which is likely to have a major positive effect on the Civic ecosystem more generally as it grows.

You want to benefit from the high BTC price from the pre-sale (around $2800) for the 66% of your order that is fulfilled, and then on the flip side you want to benefit from the low price of BTC at refund time on the 33% that didn't get allocated?
