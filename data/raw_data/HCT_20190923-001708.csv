The Platform “RET” (Real Estate Token) is created to solve the housing problem of a huge number of people. Since currently in the traditional rental market (as residential, as commercial) real estate tenants are a priori the losing side at real estate transactions. Tenants pay only for the right to use real estate within a limited time without receiving anything more in return.  ""RET"" brings together investors, property owners and tenants, providing services for concluding transactions for investing, selling and renting commercial and residential real estate:  investors - provides a hedging tool for risks associated with high volatility of the cryptic currency; prpperty owners - finds motivated tenants who provide stable income; tenants - allows tenants to save money for subsequent purchase of real estate.  The ""RET"" platform will become an alternative to the existing options for purchasing housing. Rent of real estate on the platform ""RET"" is comparable to the ""mortgage"" without obligations:  there is no down payment; there are no solvency requirements; there is no need to live in one real estate.  You choose real estate for rent in the country where you are now. From each lease payment, a part of the funds is converted into RET tokens that are transferred to the lessee and can be sold or used to purchase real estate (purchased with funds received during the crowdsdale of the RET token) presented on the platform ""RET"".  The platform ""RET"" will use 2 types of tokens – HAT и RET.  HAT  HAT Tokens (Hachiko token) are required to activate any of the smart contracts on the ""RET"" platform. A minimum number of HAT (1 HAT) tokens is sufficient to work with some smart contracts. In other smart contracts (lease auction, voting for the purchase of real estate) the number of HAT tokens used to pay for transactions depends on the placement of the ad in the search bar. The more a user pays for a transaction with HAT tokens, the higher the ad in the search bar.   HAT is a unique and first-of-its-kind crypto token  Like any crypto token HAT can be transferred from one e-Wallet to another. But as soon as the token HAT is used for the payment of any smart contract platform ""RET"", it is translated into e-Wallet first owner (the one who purchased HAT at Seed-ITO stages).  The release of HAT tokens will occur on Seed-ITO stages. In the future, HAT tokens will not be released.   The uniqueness of the tokens HAT displays the total ideology and mission of the platform ""RET"". Each participant is an important and meaningful part of self-developing and self-organizing ecosystem, the evolution of which is determined by the degree of interest of all people using the ""RET"" to serve their interests. Participants in the Seed-ITO stage, acquiring tokens HAT forever become their Owner. They can transfer their tokens for other people, but once the hat tokens are used to pay for smart contracts on the “RET” platform, in the same time HAT sent to Owner’s e-wallet.   RET  RET tokens are required to display the number of investments in real estate that will be placed on the “RET” platform. The income received from the rental of real estate will be distributed evenly between the entire volumes of tokens. The release of RET tokens will occur at the ITO stage:   without discount; without bounty companies; without the allocation among the project team.  All funds collected during the ITO will be used solely for the purchase of commercial and residential real estate. Further, the release of new RET tokens will occur during the registration of a smart contract for the purchase of real estate, with funds collected from rental payments and subsequent ITO.   The release will take place in 3 stages:  during the pre-ITO, the HCT tokens - HachikoCouponToken are released; HAT tokens are released during Seed-ITO; release of RET tokens will be carried out in the second quarter of 2018 during ITO. Pre-ITO  During the pre-ITO, the HCT tokens - HachikoCouponToken are released. The sale of HCT will be at a price of 0,0005 Eth. During Seed-ITO, you can exchange HCT for HAT in a 1:1 ratio. The purchase price, therefore, of the HAT on the Seed-ITO for you will be 0,0005 Eth (for those who buy HAT for the ETH/BTC the cost will vary from 0,0015 Eth to 0,002 Eth.   We do not recommend the transfer/sale of HCT, because HCT (unlike HAT) does not tie to the wallet of the person who bought HCT during the pre-ITO, then by transferring/selling HCT you will not be able to get it back to your wallet. Only HAT returns to the wallet (the one who purchased HAT during Seed-ITO or exchanged HCT for HAT) after it is used on the ""RET"" platform.   18 - 25 October 2017 Soft Cap - 800 Eth. Hard Cap - 1 500 Eth. 1 HCT = 0,0005 Eth. Buyers: 3 000 000 HCT Bonus: 1 600 000 HCT Total: 4 600 000 HCT  Funds raised during the pre-ITO will be used for marketing and preparation for Seed-ITO stage.   Seed-ITO  22 - 31  January 2018 Cap - 100 000 Eth.    Soft Cap - 160 000 Eth. Hard Cap - 210 000 Eth. 1 HAT = 0,0015 Eth - 0,002 Eth. Buyers: 115 400 000 HAT Team: 10 000 000 HAT Total: 125 400 000 HAT  Funds raised during the Seed-ITO will be used to develop the platform ""RET"", conducting a marketing company and prepare for the ITO round.   ITO  2 quarter 2018. The ITO will be issued tokens RET.  All funds collected at the ITO will go for the purchase of real estate.
