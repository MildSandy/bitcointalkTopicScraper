The main value proposition is that we generate profit from applying blockchain tech to disrupt old, tired banking products. The PROPX token sale is the driving force behind this value prop.  This is how we plan on doing it:  With our first product, we disrupt the property investment space, offering consumer the chance to buy into premium property assets for as little as $2 each.  Imagine you could invest $2 in same property portfolio as Warren Buffet invests in and get exactly the same returns (obviously on scale). That's the product that we will launch and the PROPX token sale makes that possible.  Our value proposition for the PROPX token is the following:  => The PROPX token sale generates a pool of funds. => The PROPX pool of funds is used to buy property shares (assets).  Now that we have assets the fun starts!  A few assumptions for our example => We raised $1 million in the PROPX tokens sale. => We spend $800 000 on assets. This gives us fully paid asset base with a minimum value of $800 000.  => We create a new token (we codename it ""TREE"") that we want to sell for $2 each. => We create 450 000 tokens. => 45 000 tokens are distributed equally between all the PROPX token owners (Bonus! Free tokens!  ) => 405 000 tokens are sold @ $2 each => We raise $810 000 from the sale. This income pays back the money spent on the asset purchase. And each of the 450 000 TREE tokens own a micro share in the $800 000 asset base.  Value prop for TREE: A TREE token owns a micro share in the asset base. The capital value share can increase as the share becomes more valuable. The asset base, being shares in property companies, earn dividends. The profit accrues to the value of the token. The profit is not paid out but reinvested. Even that accrues to the value of the TREE token. All this gives you a very strong investment.  Value prop for PROPX: PROPX tokens own the capital pool. Remember that the underlined bit, ""This income pays back the money spent on the asset purchase"". This $800 000 is now back in the bank and ready to be applied again. BUT... PROPX token owners earned 45 000 TREE tokens. These tokens are TREE tokens... they share equally in all the benefits of the TREE value prop. Plus the pool of cash belongs to all the PROPX tokens. The money in the pool is then reapplied to start another project/buy more shares earning another 10% of Bonus! Free tokens!   Guys, the blockchain unlocks so much potential to disrupt the financial sector. We can decentralise banking products and we can all make very, very good money from it.  All we need is your support in getting this ICO pumping.",True

Initially 85% of the value is still yours because the money is in a cash pool that belongs to all PROPX tokens that have been sold. Company gets 15% tokens, so at least 85% of the value is still there.  When we use money from the cash pool money to buy property assets, the property assets remain the property of PROPX tokens until the new tokens are all sold, which pays back the cash pool.  If for any reason the new tokens aren't sold, then the assets can be liquidated (sold) to pay back the cash pool.  So, $0.3 is an investment - and mark my words.... this token will be worth much, much more very soon! There as some big announcements coming soon about a property investment blockchain *nudge, nudge, wink, wink* ",True

Please correct me if I'm overstepping.}  If we were to launch a combo of signature campaign and affiliate marketing campaign that works on the following principles, would you consider taking part?  Concept: 1. We provide you with a signature | social media ad designs that you can use. 2. The signature campaign itself offers no bounty - BUT... 3. You earn 10% of the sale amount in crunchy crypto, in your nominated bitcoin account.  A campaign like this will be completely self maintained, no disputes, no enquiries. You will need to register to receive the campaign materials. Your UID embedded in links, but you will also get it to share - something easy like AC123D.  When someone clicks through to the ProsperiProp.com website we register your UID with that visitor. If the visitor buys during that session you get the commission. Simple. Should the visitor come back later to buy (not from the link), they'd have to provide your UID in the ""referral"" field for you to get the commission. It sucks but it cannot work any other way.  You will be able to ""log into"" a page that shows your stats, commission earned and commission paid.  Reward: 10% sales commission, paid in crypto once a week.  Rules: 1. You would be free to post/blog/tweet or use the signature as and wherever you want. 2. No limits to where you can promote as long as the designs are not changed - and you don't harm the company's reputation. 3. Payments are made once a week. 3. Other rules may need to be added as we go about creating the campaign.  BUT IN ESSENCE.... Would you participate? Please feel free to comment.  But be kind in criticism, please :-)  I want to just test the waters on this concept.",True

ProsperiProp wants us to be investors in property 2. Invest using ProsperiProp 3. ProsperiProp appoints Grant Thornton  ProsperiProp in a nutshell?  In one sentence ProsperiProp is an African fintech initiative that uses cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies to invent next generation financial products for the global market.  Where we are positioned? We apply blockchain tech to create next generation financial services.  What we have to offer? We’ve created a two token business model where investors in the one token creates investment opportunities for buyers of the second token. Cash from the first token sale is used to purchase premium global property assets - assets that one can only buy if you can afford the minimum investment criteria. The second token is then marketed to people that can pay $2 a token - and those tokens own all the wealth. (Read the whitepaper for details)  Ethos We believe that there is a lot of money to be made by all of us when we make it possible for the lower and middle income earners to access the same wealth creation opportunities available to the super rich.  In general ProsperiProp SA (Pty) Ltd is a company registered in South Africa. We are run by Llew Morkel, Thembi Kahimbaara and JB Smith. We are part of the AlphaCode FinTech incubator, situated in Sandton, South Africa.  Why you should join?  We believe in sharing the wealth, sharing the spoils and sharing the glory. PROPX’s success will lead the way to many other such blockchain initiatives. We invite you to help us pioneer next generation financial services that live on a blockchain.  The Business Model  There are two tokens:  Token 1: PROPX: This is the investor token. The investor token receives special shares in the company and can earn dividends, it earns free TREE tokens, it also earns profitshare - and will be traded on crypto exchanges (we are in the process of registering with -  and applying for US SEC approval).  Token 2: Code name TREE. : This is the consumer token. This is the token that the average person will buy as an investment.  Putting it all together: 1.   Revenue from PROPX sales are pooled and put out on loan to an SPV (special purpose vehicle, a company specially constituted for the purpose). 2.   The SPV uses the money to buy property assets (shares, interests, etc) in some of the world’s top performing property companies. A professional fund management team makes these placements. 3.   TREE tokens are generated. The total issue is a mathematical equation but comes down to 115% of the total share value. 10% of the TREE tokens are allocated to PROPX owners. 90% are sold in the market at a slight markup to cover the value of the 10%. 4.   Income generated from the sale of TREE tokens repay the loan (described in point 1). The assets in the SPV now belong to the TREE tokens and  as such they own all dividends. Dividends are not paid out but reinvested. TREE tokens own the interest and all the compound interest. *SPV runnning cost is paid from dividend revenue. 5.   Once the loan has been paid back the PROPX cash pool can be re-applied to buy more assets in the current SPV or start a new SPV.

We create decentralised investment products using blockchain and cryptocurrencies.  PROPX is our shareholder token. By selling the PROPX token in the ICO we are inviting people to invest in our business. Each PROPX token represents a special share in the business. Each PROPX token, therefore, has the ability to earn dividends (paid in crypto), earn free project tokens (like TREE) and earn capital growth on their investment.  The money that we raise from the ICO is used to provide the capital backbone for the investment products create.  The first of our products, which will launch quarter 1 of 2018, is codenamed TREE. It is a new cryptocurrency (second token) that allows normal people from all over the world to invest in top global property assets - for only $2. Imagine being able to invest in the same property portfolio that Warren Buffett is invested in, but instead of having to fork out $100 000 minimum investment, you can buy TREE tokens @ $2 each and buy a micro portion of the same assets. You'd get the same growth, same returns percentage-wise.  So, to finally answer your question :-) ProsperiProp is different to other Property ICOs in that we're not asking you to invest in the building of a city, an office block or student accommodation. We are asking people to invest in a company that uses blockchain tech to build and market next generation investment products. Products that won't exclude the majority of the world's population with high buy-in costs.  Hope this helped.  Llew",True
