The CLN is a payment system that is powered by everyday consumption. The network allows communities to issue their own currency and use it to incentivise merchants and consumers for buying and selling locally with fiat. The CLN aims to utilize the power of cryptocurrencies to create a better, more transparent payment system and encourage local spending to keep more money circulating in the community.  Introducing The CLN Token The CLN token is the first currency attached to real life consumption. The token will be issued on the Ethereum network and will provide access to the CLN network and will enable communities to bootstrap. It will also represent an index value of the community currencies issued on the network and provide instant liquidity to new currencies.  https://i.imgur.com/r8nODSY.jpg https://i.imgur.com/Pt8XEtL.jpg https://i.imgur.com/54qsgFQ.jpg  As Seen In The Media: https://i.imgur.com/hT3okN4.jpg",False
