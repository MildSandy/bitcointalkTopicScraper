We issued tokens on our private blockchain with a manual due diligence and onboarding process, consulted on legal and compliance issues, and took on the job of marketing the opportunities on the platform as well. This was an amazing learning experience, as we got to see how difficult it can be for token issuers to actually launch a compliant digital securities offering. We also realized this model cannot scale. As a non-profit (we've always been one), we see our role as one of bringing together the various pieces of the puzzle to move toward the ""tokenization of everything"", or at least make that possible. We took the lessons we learned and decided to offer issuance, compliance and governance functions that are blockchain agnostic. Essentially we want to empower any blockchain (and non-blockchain projects like Hyperledger) to be able to create compliant digital securities. Hence we developed MAP and the issuance dApp you speak of, but also the fiat gateway, custody solutions for institutions, our initiative to standardize token fundamental data, and other efforts. The success of the Art Token validated the model that when the right pieces are in place, it can work. With this model, our experience since launch, and forming the right partnerships, we feel there is a solid path forward for Swarm to provide the necessary infrastructure for the mass adoption of digital securities. This is a brief summary of the thinking behind our evolution to where we are today. Hope that answers your question!

I don't know why in the crypto space no one is talking about it except, as I said, Swarm's telegram and SWM's holders. It make me angry when useless  or overrated project (coff...EOS...coff...transaction on that 4B bullshit are not even cryptographically verfied lol) get attention worldwide while some projects are left behind by ""the people"", some examples, Swarm, Ark, Waves, Komodo, I want to add NEO and TRON as well because despite what people are saying they're doing a good job. Wanna talk about prices? It's even worse, eth is at #2 marketcap, devs don't even know when they will implemente PoS and sharding, #3 XRP, useless coin, if banks will use Xrapid or other Ripple Labs' products they won't need to use xrp...#4 BCH, Bitcoin with big blocks...fail! People will start using BTC everyday to buy coffees when they won't need to spend 12 minutes for 1 confirmation, maybe it will be ok if I can use BCH with 0 conf, #5 EOS, centralized database, not even a decentralized blockchain, #6 Stellar, I like this one , IBM want to use it for microtransactions, plus everyone can use it to issue tokens/coins, plus low fees and fast confirmations, plus our beloved SWARM issue Security tokens there, #7 Fuckin' Cardano, their consensus protocol (a PoS one, Ouroboros) isn't even implemented, no one talk about it, but I wonder how blocks are confirmed there, there are many blocks validator? Are they connected to each other since there is no PoS yet so they must force blocks' validation? IF this is the case, it means that they have a singol point of failure? You know how is called? Database, like EOS. #9 Theter, I don't even know how to start, we're talking about a company (whoever is behind Bitfinex) printing tokens and avoiding audits every years....#10 and I'll stop here, Monero, really untraceable, with low fees, it just suffer BCH's problem, long confirmation.

You can find a ton of information on the website, but in a nutshell, Swarm is the blockchain for private equity. We are laying the building blocks for the future Investment Economy using a network of AI, workflow automation as well as novel governance. We bring high-return private assets to everyone and and solve problems for institutional and crypto investors alike. Swarm is creating a unique market infrastructure model based on blockchain tech that enables (1) to invest crypto assets into real assets and (2) deploy traditional capital into real markets in a new way. With Swarm‚Äôs infrastructure investors can create and operate asset-backed tokens. Unlike other funding models, the Swarm platform can bridge from blockchains into real world assets and stage the funding to meet actual capital needs or milestones. At the same time, Swarm makes it incredibly easy to participate in the composite of wealth creation of the crypto space and enter opportunities that present new categories of asset classes to the broader cryptocurrency landscape. This can lead to attractive options for investors to enter into alternative risk-reward profiles. Pilot projects include syndication partners from categories such as crypto hedge fund, distressed real estate, solar renewables and impact investing. We are introducing core innovative financial market infrastructure, by creating blockchain governed swarm intelligence, giving any investor open access to attractive returns, while ensuring compatibility with institutional investors and automating every aspect along the way. As a result, Swarm strives for the ultimate democratization of finance and investment automation.  Swarm is also running Masternodes!

""... at Swarm we are working on some ground-breaking endeavours. 1. MAP (Market Access Protocol)  is an elegant data oracle and distributed ledger that is used to qualify investors and allow for the regulatory compliant issuance and trading of security tokens. Only a non-profit like Swarm can approach an effort like MAP from the perspective of opening up access to investing for all, while keeping fees in the network.  2. Swarm Masternodes support the decentralized infrastructure on top of which we will see the tokenization of eveything. Masternode operators stake SWM on the ethereum blockchain but process transactions on the Swarm blockchain, earning block rewards and rewards from governing and investing 10M SWM tokens via the Market Development Fund. They are curently in Alpha phase and we are extremely close to moving to Test and Mainnet.   3. Swarm's open platform is coming soon. While our Swarm Invest platform is a curated selection of premium investments that we have individually done all due diligence on, the future lies in the ability for anyone to tokenize virtually any asset you can imagine (and we've had some pretty wild ideas here) with far less friction, while still being fully regulatory compliant and legal. This is really exciting.""",False

Right now, there is nothing stopping someone sending you a security token which you may not legally be compliant to hold. This is one of the challenges of trading security tokens. MAP deals with this by requiring every trade (before proceeding) to confirm that both the sending and receiving wallets are qualified, and will even go further and require the receiving wallet to approve (or somehow indicate approval) the transaction, to avoid the above situation.

A masternode is a compute resource that meets the minimum technical and network requirements to run the Swarm core software and validate transactions. As the network grows, masternodes will also provide resources for other data services relevant to the network.  A collection of interconnected masternodes forms the distributed infrastructure that powers the Swarm network. Running a masternode requires resources, resulting in hardware and network costs. In order to bootstrap the process and create a sustainable operational model we needed to first create an appropriate model of incentives and rewards.

However, this partnership is a more formal arrangement, and also adds a second functionality. This will allow investors to lock in the price of the crypto they invest on Swarm, with Bitcoin or Ethereum converted to Dai, locking in the price at the time of commitment to an investment, or automatically based on ceiling and floor prices set by the individual investor. What this means is that where the current model of crypto funds invested in the various Investment Opportunities are only pegged once the fund closes, the DAI stablecoins will be treated in the same way as fiat. Their value will not fluctuate in the way that ETH and BTC and others do.",False

We are in touch with the journalist from Coindesk, have provided the detail on how Swarm works, and specifically how these individual equity tokens will work. Timo is speaking with him directly in the morning. We expect an update from his side with a balanced view of the story. Bottom line: everything is moving forward as announced. There's also some rousing conversation on twitter between Pomp and Andrew Byrne on this.  One takeaway (of many) for me is we need to prioritize telling our story in a simpler way. We know this is nuanced, and early days, but we need to do a better job with the entry level overview of what we do and how we do it. I will proiritize this when back from Asia.

Here are the first things happening, just in the next few weeks:  1) we released Swarm Invest v1.0 yesterday and are rolling new features out daily. Major UI/UX improvements. DAI stablecoin now supported. Developer features added including a javascript SDK.  2) Property Coin (PCX) decided to bring their token to Swarm and issue an SRC20 security token. We're psyched to be working with them.  3) SPRK goes live. This is SparkLabs Smart Cities Smart Planet Fund, previously announced, now live on Swarm. This marks the first security token launched in this area of VC, representing the largest accelerator in Asia.  4) FARM goes live. This is the FarmCoins project also previously announced, putting us front and center with millions of unbanked people.  5) MULTIPLE BIG INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY ANNOUNCEMENTS. We will announce multiple tokens representing fractional ownership of name brand things. More info soon, but this will be huge.  6) New advisors to be named. Like, people who actually are working with us to grow Swarm and the real asset tokenization ecosystem.  7) and more.  So get psyched, and get the word out. This 'hidden gem' will be hidden no more. This 'underrated' project will get the attention it deserves. You've helped us deliver the first live security token platform, and now we're tokenizing new projects every week. June will be huge, and this is just the beginning. Spread the word, join the swarm.  GO SWM",False

Swarm is a blockchain that allows real world objects to be ‚Äútokenized‚Äù using the SRC20 protocol, a cryptographic standard for security tokens, and a world first. Tokenized objects become ‚Äúassets‚Äù that can be easily managed, governed and traded. Swarm is creating a unique market infrastructure model based on blockchain tech that enables 1/ to invest crypto assets into real assets and 2/ deploy traditional capital into real markets in a new way. With Swarm‚Äôs infrastructure investors can create and operate asset-backed tokens. Unlike other funding models, the Swarm platform can bridge from blockchains into real-world assets and stage the funding to meet actual capital needs or milestones. At the same time, Swarm makes it incredibly easy to participate in the composite of wealth creation of the crypto space and enter opportunities that present new categories of asset classes to the broader cryptocurrency landscape Swarm is built on TokenD and the Stellar blockchain.",False

They are the ones who will decide on the parameters of the system, fees, investment opportunities that will come into the platform, assets that will be supported and much much more. The benefits of blockchain for creating a fully decentralized network where the participants are the actual stake holders are enormous, not to mention the necessity for transparency in the voting module that has been implemented where all these decisions will take place. I can understand it is hard to grasp this at first, specially because Swarm is so similar to any web app at first glance.

I think people know that SWM tokens are quite undervalued at the moment and will not dump for peanuts. Users who have received a lot of tokens are already heavily invested in the platform and users who got 10 SWM because of KYC can't really take them out of the platform because of the 20 SWM minimum.

The SRC20 is a standard for security tokens that Swarm is developing. It extends the ERC20 standard by adding different parameters to it in order to behave as a security token. For example a SRC20 token can check if the wallet is KYC compliant or it can hold properties about the asset it represents.  The SWM is a utility token that will be used as payment for gas, reward and voting in the Swarm blockchain, where the SRC20 tokens live.  You can invest SWM, ETH or BTC into any Investment Opportunity (IO) on the Swarm Invest Platform (https://invest.swarm.fund). Once the IO is funded you will receive a SRC20 in proportion to your investment.  The airdrop will be of SWM tokens, based on the amount of SWM you hold in your platform's wallet.  SRC20 is not compatible with the Ethereum blockchain because it is a different standard, but we have plans to enable compatibility by wrapping SRC20 in an ERC20. When this happens the SRC20 tokens will only have the properties of the ERC20 token and will not be considered a security token on the Ethereum blockchain‚Äîusers won't be able to receive dividends from the ERC20 equivalent.  You can find more details about the SWM token mechanics here: https://medium.com/swarmfund/swm-574d25800d8c  And more information about the different aspects of the platform here: https://medium.com/swarmfund/the-swarm-blockchain-or-how-to-tokenize-a-football-team-10aba29dcafb",False

Bancor is a decentralized liquidity network that provides users with a simple, low-cost way to buy and sell tokens.

I also think that Bancor will have a fundamental role once blockchain services are fully operational. For example, you can imagine Swarm utilizing Filecoin in order to host its invest platform in a decentralized way. In order to pay for the hosting in $FIL the Swarm foundation can use $SWM that it collects through fees on the platform and automatically convert to $FIL through Bancor under the hood.

We are laying the building blocks for the future Investment Economy using a network of AI, workflow automation as well as novel governance. We bring high-return private assets to everyone and and solve problems for institutional and crypto investors alike. Swarm is creating a unique market infrastructure model based on blockchain tech that enables 1/ to invest crypto assets into real assets and 2/ deploy traditional capital into real markets in a new way. With Swarm‚Äôs infrastructure investors can create and operate asset-backed tokens. Unlike other funding models, the Swarm platform can bridge from blockchains into real world assets and stage the funding to meet actual capital needs or milestones. At the same time, Swarm makes it incredibly easy to participate in the composite of wealth creation of the crypto space and enter opportunities that present new categories of asset classes to the broader cryptocurrency landscape. This can lead to attractive options for investors to enter into alternative risk-reward profiles. Pilot projects include syndication partners from categories such as crypto hedge fund, distressed real estate, solar renewables and impact investing. We are introducing core innovative financial market infrastructure, by creating blockchain governed swarm intelligence, giving any investor open access to attractive returns, while ensuring compatibility with institutional investors and automating every aspect along the way. As a result, Swarm strives for the ultimate democratization of finance and investment automation.

Many species make heavy usage of multi-track systems to incentivize socially positive behavior. This allows complex life to develop and evolve in a dynamic fashion. In many ways, this is similar to the mathematics behind fractals. This formalization of rules happens at the level of harmonic principles, rather than at the specific structural level, as often happens with hierarchical organizations.  https://www.swarm.fund/swarm-101/index.html",False

Hope everyone is having an awesome day. We are making great leaps and bounds on Swarm, and it's time to give you the latest enws with the February 6th edition of the Swarm Newsletter.  /SwarmNews6Feb][Suspicious link removed]/SwarmNews6Feb  Swarm has live product, an active global community, and gratitude - It's the Swarm Newsletter for February 6, 2018  Happy February, dear community! Let's dig right into the highlights from Launch Week:   Product  We launched our MVP (alpha release) on the evening of Monday, January 29th. It felt incredible throughout the day to see the community support on our Telegram, with people from all corners of the world waiting in anticipation.  Within the first hour, we had 84 users create accounts from 28 different countries.  Within the first 24 hours, we had a whopping 1,450 users from 53 different countries.  And the numbers are growing every day.  The success of our launch was fueled by the authentic relationships we have with our supporters - this includes friends, family, ambassadors, professional connections, fellow blockchain projects, our online community and the new friends we meet at every event we attend worldwide.  We want to sincerely thank each and every one of you for supporting Swarm as we grow together. Your support, feedback and authenticity helps us be a better project every day.  Read more about our two inaugural funds, available for your investment now, in our launch blog post. /2Bg3PLX]http://[Suspicious link removed]/2Bg3PLX.  Current live MVP features include:  Create a User Account Deposit cryptocurrency into your Wallet Browse, explore, and *invest* in featured opportunities Access real-time support from the team   Airdrop  Thank you to everyone who signed up over the course of last week. For those of you who created an account between Monday, January 29th - Feb 4th 11:59pm SST, you will receive a 100 SWM Token airdrop into your SWM wallet on the platform by February 29th, 2018. No further action is needed at this time.    Swarm on Bancor  We‚Äôre also thrilled that SWM is now live on the Bancor Network. As you may know, this allows SWM to be instantly converted for dozens of other tokens without an exchange, counterparty or added fees.  Check out the Bancor Web App here http://[Suspicious link removed]/2C17mdx, and here is a nice tutorial on how to use it: http://[Suspicious link removed]/2FSsAg2 .  Airdrops: Fair or Unfair?  We have spoken some in the community who were unhappy about the airdrop, since new supporters are receiving free tokens for creating an account on the portal. We believe it benefits everyone to have as many people using our Alpha release as possible, helping us iterate quickly and continuously improve. The airdrop helped us do just that. As SWM token hodlers, it is in your interest for the platform to be growing and active - remember every transaction will require SWM, and every incentive will be funded by SWM. It is also in everyone's interest for the foundation to be responsible with the budget. Some projects spend millions of tokens (and dollars) on hype & promotion without even having a live product, often giving influencers large piles of free tokens. We wanted to incent real users to come join the community and spread the word, and have focused much of our spending on product.  We also aim to be inclusive, which is why this airdrop was open to everyone, not just new members of the community. And as it worked out, the highlight of the airdrop for us has been that it has not dominated the discussion online. The bulk of the discussion has been about the product, and we are so appreciative of all the detailed feedback on the alpha, bug reports, and questions and ideas about investment opportunities. Keep em coming!  United States Crypto Landscape  On the tip of everyone's tongue in the US blockchain space is the movement this week in the regulatory environment. Today, the Senate Banking committee is meeting to discuss the regulatory oversight role of the SEC and CFTC when it comes to crypto and virtual currencies. This meeting is rumored to become a greenlight for institutional investors. ETH is back over 700 at the moment, so let's see if this is a start of a rally.  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is an independent agency of the US government which regulates the securities industry and stock and options exchanges. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates futures and options markets. An institutional investor is defined as a large organization, such as a bank, pension fund, labor union, or insurance company, that makes substantial investments on the stock exchange.  The walls are coming down, people. The cryptocurrency space will soon become open to the same players that dwell in the world of traditional finance. And just as it benefits SWM hodlers for more people to come onto the platform, it benefits us all for more investors to jump into crypto.  The question is, where can an individual investor find sovereign stability in the ever-changing market?  The answer is - within the Swarm Ecosystem.

November is over. Bitcoin is hovering around $10k. Life moves fast in the world of blockchain!  Since we completed our Token Sale in the last week of October, most of our time has been spent heads down in product development. In addition to delivering a game-changing platform that bridges cryptocurrency to real assets, we also want the platform to reflect the ideas and values of our community.  To do that, we know we need to improve our level of communication. You can expect Newsletters every week, and we value your feedback on how we can best connect to and build the Swarm Fund community. ----- * Exchanges *  Many of you have asked questions regarding the SWM token being available on exchanges. We hope the community understands that we are not able to comment on trading and transfer of Swarm Tokens for legal and regulatory reasons. We also need to be clear that transfers are not currently allowable in the US or to US persons unless in compliance with an exemption under the securities laws. Purchasers have to make that determination themselves. Non-US purchasers should check the laws of their home country to ensure they are in compliance with any laws restricting transfers.  ----- * Swarm Fund Ambassadors * - currently represent 29 different cities on 4 continents. A huge thanks to this global crew who worked so hard from July through October on Swarm Fund Ambassador Program 1.0.  ~ Stay Tuned for SFAP 2.0, Coming Soon ~ ----- * Swarm Fund Roadmap *  A detailed graphic of our product roadmap will be on our homepage by Friday, December 8th.  In the beginning of January, our full Liquid Democracy Voting Module (LDVM) will be onboarded to the Swarm Fund Platform as an integral part of participating in hosted funds. You may recall our first vote being held directly after the close of our Token Sale on October 28th, 2017. The LDVM is our signature voting engine.  As promised, we‚Äôre on track to launch the first token-based funds on Swarm in late January. Stay tuned for further announcements within the next few weeks as we will publish more details on the funds and their token structures.  Alongside, likely early January, we will be giving updates on the Swarm platform and give insights on the components that will be delivered in the first release. ----- * Swarm in the News *  Swarm Fund brings institutional investment opportunities to crypto investors https://www.alphaq.world/2017/11/23/258631/swarm-fund-brings-institutional-investment-opportunities-crypto-investors?utm_medium=email&utm_source=sharpspring&sslid=MzUxMDU2NDAxNzEyBwA&sseid=MzQzMTU2MLc0MAcA&jobid=199de7d1-a34c-4673-a4dd-9ddd8a31997a An interview with Swarm Fund CEO Philipp Pieper Nov 27, 2017 Beverly Chandler, AlphaQ, Insititutional Asset Manager  Swarm Fund Announces Results of Public Token Sale, Appoints Philipp Pieper CEO https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/16/business-wire-swarm-fund-announces-results-of-public-token-sale-appoints-philipp-pieper-ceo.html?utm_medium=email&utm_source=sharpspring&sslid=MzUxMDU2NDAxNzEyBwA&sseid=MzQzMTU2MLc0MAcA&jobid=199de7d1-a34c-4673-a4dd-9ddd8a31997a Press Release Nov 16, 2017 CNBC, Yahoo Finance -----  We‚Äôre enjoying being in a flow of creation, inspiration and focus.

Speaking of voting, read more below about the amazing team at SecureVote and what they‚Äôre up to.  Partner Spotlight: SecureVote: Sydney, Australia We‚Äôre proud to be partnering with the award-winning team of SecureVote (http://bit.ly/2AMblvA) in the development of the Swarm Fund Liquid Democracy Voting Module (LDVM). The LDVM is a universally applicable and decentralized voting engine which can be used for any part of the Swarm platform.  SecureVote‚Äôs mission is to ‚Äòdemocratize the world‚Äô by developing the world‚Äôs most scalable, secure, and resilient blockchain-based voting systems. The team is addressing the problems currently associated with pen and paper voting, as well as with existing digital voting methods, by taking advantage of industry leading technology and proprietary innovations of their own.  The SecureVote team is on a roll, recently winning the Cyber Security Award at the 2017 Australian Technologies Competition.    On December 7th, the team participated as a Top 3 Finalist of Best Ideas to Watch in the 2017 Talent Unleashed Competition! http://bit.ly/2C1ZVUK Selected by judges Sir Richard Branson and Steve Wozniak in late October as Regional Finalists, SecureVote is going big with their mission.

Happy New Year! The Swarm Team is starting off 2018 with a bang!  The markets are hot, our product is almost ripe, and we‚Äôre feeling solid going into the new year. Two themes for us this week at Swarm were A.I. and the SWM token. The Distressed Real Estate fund that will launch with our platform uses AI to identify the optimal opportunities for purchase. Other funds in the pipeline use AI to make smarter trading decisions, learning from signals in trading and from places like influencer Twitter feeds. Where Swarm opens up opportunities once available only to a select few, AI is what really drives the economy ‚Äì recommending and making decisions faster and better than any middleman could. And the Swarm token, SWM, is the essential element which powers this whole ecosystem. Look for a blog post from us this week detailing our plan to maximize the utility of the SWM token. Hint ‚Äì it‚Äôs gonna be a gas!  Product On Schedule  Version 0.6 of the Swarm Platform was delivered this past Friday, a day ahead of schedule. Account creation, funding, review and allocation to individual funds are all coming together. Props to our friends on our Telegram channel for asking about v0.6, and sorry it was only an internal release! But we are excited to demo the platform on stage at the North America Bitcoin Conference in Miami next week and give a sneak peak! We remain on schedule for the public release of the MVP (v 0.61) of the platform on January 29.  Game of Coins @ CES  Philipp & Chris are flying to Las Vegas today to attend CES. Once a consumer electronics show to see the latest gadgets, CES has become a place where emerging technologies are discussed and announced. And yes, there are still the cool gadgets too.

If it is this thread, please think of keeping up with your reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/swarm/ or creating a forum with one topic per thread. Then stop using Telegram, it is the wrong platform to ask and answer responses or you'll keep answering the same questions over and over. A 2000-user channel is a nightmare. I have voted. I mistakenly closed the browser tab so I cannot verify it. Try to make a universal ""verify your ballot"" because it does not work to redo the whole process and use my original txid. I think it's because of conflictual ballot ids, right? It would be nice to have a ""how-to"" for people using local wallets (e.g. mist/Ethereum wallet). I personnally don't like the concept of myetherwallet, particularly with all the trolls trying to phish on your wallet (remember Slack?).

We came to this decision after conferring with our legal and institutional partners, and realizing we needed additional time to accommodate the shifting regulatory landscape.  On September 7th Swarm briefly opened a public sale and then switched to an ambassador-only pre-sale. Refunds were given to any unsatisfied participants in the short public sale, which were taken up by 5.3 percent of all crowdsale transactions, representing $75K. Since then, additional pre-sale funds of $2.5M for a total of $4.7M have been committed to date.  We chose this revised schedule in light of the following:  Continued Token Swap: To accommodate Swarm token holders who were unable to participate in our token swap; particularly since Poloniex has now agreed to allow holders of Swarm 1.0 tokens to transfer them off their platform. More information to be released shortly.  Asia: In consideration of investors in Asia who have requested more time to participate in the sale as they navigate the regulatory situations across the region.  US Investor Accreditation: As we want to be as inclusive to the investor community while legally compliant, we are using the additional time to make the process as simple as possible for US-based investors to navigate any accreditation hurdles to participation. More information to be released shortly.  Community Involvement: We have received ample feedback on the liquidity release feature of the SWM Token. Since we are building Swarm as a platform based on community participation, and are launching with a product that puts decisions in the hands of the Swarm community, we are taking this time to incorporate relevant suggestions that will improve all aspects of this offering. As we close the sale, our liquid democracy platform will be operational with the Swarm Token holder community voting to decide on the liquidity schedule, as well as the appointment of board members.  We believe this new process and timeplan gives the community the best access and time to participate, while simultaneously providing us with the opportunity to do this in a much more safe and compliant way, via auditing all steps of the process. Within this new procedure and time schedule, we are able to continue with the pre-established token pricing curve, while holding true to the initially promised first token liquidity (moved by three days to November 6th).  As part of our roadshow, we have traveled to Los Angeles and New York City, as well as six other countries over the past week. The reception has been extremely positive from the institutional finance world, private wealth management and others in the broader financial community.  We strive for transparency in our processes, and are equally committed to deliver real value from day one, particularly in the current, and dynamic landscape. When the first liquid democracy vote goes live on 10/31, Swarm Token holders will be asked to participate in their first voting process, in order to appoint the Board and the go forward liquidity schedule for Swarm Tokens. This indoctrinates them as a part of liquid democracy, engaging all Swarm members directly in deciding the future of the platform.  We are very excited about the overall community‚Äôs enthusiasm for this project, and the positive feedback we are receiving. It‚Äôs truly helping us shape this venture and ensures it evolves in the best possible way.  OFFICIAL SALE TIME SCHEDULE:  Pre-sale will continue until 10/18 23:00 UTC Swarm public sale opens 10/21 14:00 UTC and closes 10/27 23:00 UTC Liquid democracy voting on Board selection and Swarm Token liquidity release begins 10/30 14:00 UTC until 11/3 23:00 UTC First liquidity release for token tradability 11/6 15:00 UTC    Read This News Release On The Swarm Fund Website",False

The initial process lead to the influx of over $750,000 in addition to the ~$2mm achieved via fiat and other accounts.  Despite incredible work from our developers and partners, we were forced to make several late accommodations due to the changing regulatory environment. Despite a full smart contract audit from coinspect we were unable to fully audit the UI.  Additionally the following issues surfaced in the initial software release:  - Incorrect countdown timer due to discrepancies between block time and UTC time - Incorrect display of starting dollar price ($4.00 per SWM was displayed instead of $1.00) - The registration form on fiat landing page was partially inaccessible - Issues with ‚Äúagree‚Äù button on mobile devices - No clear communication over appropriate gas price to use with some lost transactions  Consequently, we decided to take more time and prolong the process to accommodate a fuller testing phase before a full public release, including user testing.  We will continue our private ambassador referral-only presale at the pre-established pricing tiers. The public token sale is expected to reopen on 9/21.  Additionally we will be using the revoke capacity of the MiniMe contract to issue refunds and invalidate transactions for those who don‚Äôt wish to lock in the current rate. This process is expected to be established and available starting tomorrow.  Ultimately we believe that the combination of rolling sales, open presales, tiered models, embedded governance and drip liquidity will make a more robust offering.",False
