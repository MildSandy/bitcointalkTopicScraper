[ANN] [ICO] ALTINDEX | THE FIRST AUTOMATED INDEX FUND OF TOKENS,"Hi everyone, bitcointalkers.  http://i63.tinypic.com/2nbh99d.jpg  ALTINDEX is a token index fund that uses the transparency and low costs offered by the blockchain technology, the index fund automatically monitors the token market as a whole. ALX is the token of ALTINDEX and its value is directly related to the value of the 20 best tokens of the moment by real market capitalization.  The peculiarity of ALTINDEX compared to other index funds is that it only tracks tokens. The word “token” in English defines objects similar to the coins that give the right to enjoy a certain property of goods or services, created by the distributor of said goods or services.  http://i66.tinypic.com/jfevbq.png  An autonomous weighted index fund that does not require an extensive human capital for its correct development, with a portfolio composed of the 20 main tokens by total capitalization and with weekly rebalancing produces a combination with ample exposure to the market and an acceptable billing without allowing one asset (and, for therefore, a single source of risk) dominates the others.  ALTINDEX is about to establish a new standard for investments in crypto actives, as a transparent, safe and directly linked to its assets. ALTINDEX aims to invest in tokens with low commission costs and a wide exposure to the market with its innovative offer of individualized tokens.  http://i68.tinypic.com/kedvua.png  Suscribe to our newsletter and follow us in telegram: https://t.me/altindex  www.alt-index.com  http://i67.tinypic.com/kedtm0.png  http://i67.tinypic.com/4ugwt2.png  http://i68.tinypic.com/71mbs6.png  http://i66.tinypic.com/292bejp.png",False
