It's a great question! However, at the moment there is no need, as the device works with all electrical appliances. Thank you Brother.  Quote from: koralan on May 18, 2018, 01:12:57 PM I read the project and found in the project that the price of a device is $ 42 and also an HMT token and also equal to the value of a HMC coin. According to the test results, 33.5 days are possible to recover average of equipment. As a result, miners are able to recoup capital quickly. It attracts everyone to participate without a large or long-term capital but can still have passive income. This will attract a lot of participants. When miners exploit that equipment, do they have to pay another fee?  I do not believe the equipment can be exploited, please read our Whitepaper for further details: https://homemine.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Whitepaper_Homemine_EN.pdf Thank you friend.  Quote from: Hwario on May 18, 2018, 08:15:07 PM Do you have any bonus, for instance if I purchase now?or its too early?  Yes. The current bonus offers a 10% discount from the normal $42 USD price. This means, you can still purchase HMT for under $42 (at $37.80 USD per HMT). If you're looking to find a cheaper price, there's a possibility to purchase HMT on the Waves Decentralized Exchange here: https://beta.wavesplatform.com/dex?assetId2=7Gz3kn8btkrLLF2v3m9xHWzvSotSMdkC9JBzNsQnt81R&assetId1=Ft8X1v1LTa1ABafufpaCWyVj8KkaxUWE6xBhW6sNFJck You will need to create a Waves account, it's free.

The device is connected to ordinary household power network. To initiate the process of passive mining, you need to connect the electrical appliance that you are going to use to the network filter. The device is managed through a special application where all the data on earnings, electricity consumed and mining efficiency is displayed.    HomeMineCoin (HMC) is the crypto-currency of HomeMine system which is mined during the use of any household appliance connected to the power supply through the HomeMine network filter. HMC may be exchanged for fiat money through the HomeMine application at a guaranteed fixed rate;   HomeMineCoin Wallet (HMC) is a hot wallet for storing the coins mined in the official application (cloud) of HomeMine. A cold wallet has already been developed and used in testing the device, and it will also be available for use by HMC owners.   Mining Pool HomeMineCoin (HMC) is the mining pool of the HomeMine system to be used for collective HMC mining. Mining algorithm: stratum. The fee is paid using an official application in HMC or in fiat currency. The pool exists at the expense of a commission of 1% levied on all participants from the total amount of coins mined.    HomeMine Application is an official application for the web (site) and mobile devices, allowing you to monitor the parameters of the device and withdraw earnings. Monitoring of the computing speed of equipment, profitability, power consumption parameters and device temperature will also be available in the interface in real-time mode.   HomeMineToken token (HMT) is a utility token purchased for participation in ITO HomeMine. Subsequently, HMT may be exchanged for 1 HomeMine device, 1 HMC, or may be sold at the foreign exchange. The basic cost of the token is USD 42.    The administration of the HomeMine project establishes a fixed exchange rate for 1 HMC, equal to USD 42, and guarantees the buyout of coins from the pool at this exchange rate. At the same time, the volume of daily redemption is limited and cannot exceed the number of coins mined during the current day.",True

Quote from: peperushing on May 20, 2018, 06:05:00 PM What I've understood about the project is that the device you designed can be integrated in ordinary electrical appliances and will enable people mining without high electricity bills like in the traditional methods. I'm I correct?  Yes, correct. Imagine you're using your computer and mining, but nothing has changed except the electrical socket. No increase in bills or electricity use.

The energy flow passes through current and voltage meters that transmit data to the device running under a Linux operating system where the power consumption metering program is working. When the circuit is closed as a result of connecting any appliance to one of the device outlets, the operating system exits the hibernation mode, activates the electricity metering systems and the mining program, as a result of which the mining chip working process is started. The time taken to start the system when the circuit is closed is 3-5 seconds. When the circuit breaks (when the connected device stops working), the mining program is disabled, and the work of the mining chip is stopped; the program for consumed electricity accounting is turned off and the device goes into a sleep mode until the next connection. The indicators recorded by the system for consumed electricity calculation are synchronized with the cloud data store, where they are combined with the data received from the mining pool, after which the funds spent and earned are calculated according to the selected tariffs.

The energy flow passes through current and voltage meters that transmit data to the device running under a Linux operating system where the power consumption metering program is working. When the circuit is closed as a result of connecting any appliance to one of the device outlets, the operating system exits the hibernation mode, activates the electricity metering systems and the mining program, as a result of which the mining chip working process is started. The time taken to start the system when the circuit is closed is 3-5 seconds. When the circuit breaks (when the connected device stops working), the mining program is disabled, and the work of the mining chip is stopped; the program for consumed electricity accounting is turned off and the device goes into a sleep mode until the next connection. The indicators recorded by the system for consumed electricity calculation are synchronized with the cloud data store, where they are combined with the data received from the mining pool, after which the funds spent and earned are calculated according to the selected tariffs.",True
