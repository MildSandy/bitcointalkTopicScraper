WWW.GRANITE.LC | WHITEPAPER | ROADMAP | TELEGRAM | TWITTER | FACEBOOK   What Is Granite?  Granite is a decentralized platform for creating a global human capital development system in the era of the digital economy.  The ecosystem aims to transform all organizations into educational ones and bring fundamental changes to the human resources market. One of the main features of the ecosystem is that all the qualifications and skills that a person has acquired in any organization or community are shown in their personal competency map.  Organizations participating in the ecosystem will have the opportunity to use unique tools for monetizing their expertise and knowledge, automating the procedure of assessing employees’ skills and building an effective internal system for recruiting and developing their staff. Decentralized technologies and the blockchain system enable companies to participate in the market without using any intermediaries. Also, they provide reliable services to end users.  Problem  Experience and skills that an individual has acquired at different companies and organizations are very difficult to verify and easy to falsify. This situation negatively influences the transparency of the human resources market and significantly increases the costs of recruiting new employees and fitting them into the company. This problem becomes especially serious when the company employs a candidate with a long professional history because it will have to teach them methods and practices different from those used in their previous jobs.  Solution  Granite enables both organizations and individuals to solve a lot of different tasks. Let us have a look at a number of ways in which the platform can be used:  1) Creation of an electronic register of certificates, diplomas and other types of qualifications for educational and certification organizations.  2) Reliable verification of qualifications, experience and competencies. This option becomes especially important in the domain of international cooperation.  3) Provision of training to clients and partners with the aim of earning additional income and increasing an average amount of money earned per client (for example, in medical and financial services).  4) Assessment of employees’ competencies and skills with the aim of managing human resources more effectively, making an objective evaluation in terms of the cost/quality ratio and determining ways to develop human resources.  5) Automation of candidate selection based on formal requirements. Employers use a list of competencies that is stored in the open taxonomy (a list of skills and competencies) to analyze a candidate’s Smart CV (an electronic resume).  6) Use of organization rankings in order to detect false claims on Smart CVs and falsified recommendations.  7)  Analysis of big data on the supply and demand for specific competences helps individuals set goals for professional development and gives organizations an understanding of the situation in the labor market.  Tools  The Granite ecosystem provides all the necessary tools for creating an effective system of assessing skills and developing people’s competencies throughout their professional lives. Open Taxonomy is a structured list of professional competencies and skills to which any organization registered in the ecosystem can make additions. Smart CV is an individual competency map which stores data on skills acquired by a person throughout their professional life. Data are added and verified by the organizations which hired or trained this person. Granite Platform is a set of decentralized applications for course design and delivery as well as project management and analytics. Granite Marketplace is a platform for purchasing ready-made course templates and services provided by external professionals in the field of education and development. The data shown in the open taxonomy and personal competency maps are added to and stored in the Ethereum blockchain in order to create a reliable and trusted environment. Interactions between users of the ecosystem are based on smart contracts.  Drivers for the Development of the Platform  The e-learning market is one of the most attractive for investment, which is confirmed by analytical data:  The size of the global e-learning market (2016): USD 165 billions; The size of the global market for learning managements systems and technologies (2016): USD 5 billions; The growth in the market for learning managements systems (by 2020): more than 20% per year; The percentage of U.S. companies using learning managements systems (2016): more than 90%.  Tokens  Granite Learning Chain tokens (GLC) are based on the ERC20 standard and are a necessary tool for the commercial use of the platform, managing the development of the ecosystem, and interaction with organizations outside the Ethereum network.  It is assumed that there will be both internal and external demand for tokens, which will grow along with the number of platform users. This will make GLC tokens an asset with high liquidity.  History and Team  The project was launched in 2015. The team has developed a PoC (proof of concept) and aims to complete the development of the first version of the platform in mid-2018.  Alexander Shabanov (LinkedIn) - product management and business development Boris Strelchik (LinkedIn  Github)  - technology development Oleg Geranin (LinkedIn) - product design Mikhail Chekanov (LinkedIn) - adviser and coordinator Vyacheslav Apanyuk (Facebook) - marketing communications Alexey Kureev (LinkedIn  Github) - lead developer Andrey Klemenok (LinkedIn)  - quality control (QA Lead) Andrey Vorontsov (LinkedIn) - financial adviser  All the team members have more than 10 years of professional experience. Key team members have developed and launched several products, including ones in the field of e-learning, that are now sold in the U.S., Europe and Asia.  ICO  As a result of the ICO, 40% of the total number of tokens will be distributed.  The ICO date will be announced after the completion of the Pre-ICO. The ICO period will last for 2 weeks and it will be divided into several stages:  Pre-ICO: 200 GLC = 1 ETH (50% bonus) Day 1: 120 GLC = 1 ETH (20% bonus) Day 2: 115 GLC = 1 ETH (15% bonus) Days 3 to 7: 110 GLC = 1 ETH (10% bonus) Days 8 to 14: 100 GLC = 1 ETH  The ICO is considered to be successful upon reaching a soft cap of 11,000 ETH. The use and allocation of funds raised in the ICO will depend on their amount. The ICO may be terminated early at reaching a hard cap of 100,000 ETH.",False
