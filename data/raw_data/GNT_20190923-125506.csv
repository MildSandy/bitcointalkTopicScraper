Launching Brass Beta into mainnet, for instance, was not envisioned in our first plan. But we understood that in order to progress, we needed to go out of our comfort zone — that is, obviously, testnet and the lab environment, and see how Golem behaves in the wilderness of mainnet.  Now that we accomplished this, that we introduced 2 major updates after that first Brass Beta mainnet launch and a couple of patches, we sat down with our ever-growing team and planned differently. We are not reinventing the wheel but dismantling it and tracking the progress of each piece, while we never stop working and progressing, sticking to our core values and premises.  Golem and Ethereum are evolving, new challenges and solutions pop up every single day. Consequently, we decided to be realistic and honest, and this “roadmap revamp” in Kanban format is aimed to communicate our mid-term goals better. Our whitepaper and original roadmap are not replaced. Goals are planned differently and in a more mindful manner. https://blog.golemproject.net/golems-mid-term-goals-in-detail-fbed7a67f992",False

The Brass Beta version of Golem went live today, April 10, 2018, the project announced on its website(https://blog.golemproject.net/ready-set-launch-b14d73ca5400). On November 11, 2016, Golem raised 820,000 ether — worth $8 million at the time — in 29 minutes. “We’ve come a long way. From being one of the first crowdfunded projects, way past the challenges we had to face while navigating the uncharted territory that is building Golem, the time has come to take the big step: mainnet launch is here,” the project wrote. Initially advertised as an “Airbnb” for computers, the idea behind Golem is to create a global market for your idle computing power. You can rent out your unused computing power and you will be paid for it in cryptocurrency — in this case, the Golem Network tokens (GNT). Ultimately, the goal for Golem is to make just about anything that requires heavy computer lifting — think computer generated images (CGI) rendering, scientific calculation, machine learning and more — both affordable and accessible. Supercomputer on a Blockchain. During its early concept phase, Golem saw itself as a “supercomputer on a blockchain.” Combined with other technologies, “it will replace the huge data centers that currently power the internet, and become the decentralized (and therefore non-monopolized and more secure) computing power behind the entire internet and just about everything on it,” Eddy Azar, a former Golem spokesperson wrote in describing Golem in October 2016. That said, every project needs to start somewhere, and, for now, the single use case for the Golem Brass Beta version will be rendering 3D computer graphics, allowing a user to distribute the CGI processing of any Blender and LuxRender scene over the Golem network.  Risks are inherent in any beta version of a software, and Golem is clear in letting people know about those. The project states, “... even though this new stage will expose our project to diverse risks, it is not possible (or responsible) to say a product is finalized without real users.”  Will It Scale? Of course, scalability will become a potential issue for Golem — and the big question is, will Ethereum, which slowed to a grind when the popularity of CryptoKitties exploded, be able to handle the increased use?  Brass Golem is the first stage in the project’s roadmap. The next big leap will be Clay Golem, then Stone Golem, and finally, Iron Golem. With each release, the platform will be upgraded and become more powerful as it approaches its full potential.Alongside the release of Brass Beta, Golem has also announced a bug bounty competition, where users can earn money to spot and report bugs in the software.

As the project evolved, we kept adding new features and improvements that required new ways of interacting with the blockchain in order to maximize efficiency and provide better security. To deal with that, we implemented additional smart contracts with the necessary requirements, that will be deployed on the mainnet and connected with the Golem app.  And to make sure the newly created contracts are safe and meet our needs, we engaged with an external company to perform an audit.   Golem’s ready to evolve! The audit has now been concluded by Trail of Bits — a security firm of professionals with very reputable history predating the recent burst of popularity of smart contracts audits. They conducted a detailed security analysis from the perspective of an attacker with access to the public Golem documentation and source code. Moreover they sought to identify risks, and ranked their severity based on their likelihood and potential impact.  Covered areas Is it possible for an unauthorized third party to gain administrative access to deployed Golem contracts? Are tokens managed and stored securely within the contract? Can these newly added contracts be manipulated to distort token balances? Is it possible to cause the contract services to enter an unrecoverable state? Final result Reported findings were ranging from the strictly informative to high severity and priority fixes. They have been addressed by us and Trail of Bits has performed a final run over the contracts to confirm that there are no more any vulnerabilities. This will help to ensure that our contracts are safe to deploy and use.",False

Like, not in the literal, skynet’ish, space-oddysey’ish, matrix’ish way. At least for now.  How then? Well, in the ordinary, economic’ish way. Data is pouring, algorithms are trained, money is being made.  And since Golem is the future of computing, we would like to be able to run ML tasks on it.  There is, however, a problem. Ordinary machine learning algorithms are, at least at this moment, not trivially parallelizable. They can be run in parallel, but for a large part of them, it is only possible with high-bandwidth, low-latency connections.¹  But, there are algorithms, which can be easily parallelized, and which are crucial in the modern machine learning workflow, even if hidden behind the scenes. I’m talking about hyperparameter optimization stuff.  “What’s that?”, you may ask. Short answer: they are algorithms for optimizing algorithms. Let’s say, we have a toy neural network, with only one layer, for which we want to set a number of hidden neurons. If we set it too high, the network will overfit, if we set it too low — it will not learn as much as it could². Since the network’s training algorithm — gradient descent — doesn’t change the structure of the network, it just optimizes parameters (weights) of the model, we have to find it in some other way. How then?  Well, we can guess. If you are an experienced machine learning engineer or researcher, the guess will probably we quite good. But, that’s obviously not the best way to do it.  Another way is to just check all possible configurations (in some range, since there is an infinite amount of them). This will produce the best possible answer, but will take too long to be practical.  We can combine these two approaches by guessing a number of configurations, based on our intuition, then try them all and select the best.  So, how do we guess them? We can base it on our intuition, we can select them randomly… or we can use one of many hyperparameter optimization algorithms that exist to do this job for us.³  Since “trying out” every configuration in practice means training the whole network with this parameter, and then checking the result, the whole procedure can be easily parallelized.  So, this is our first, proof-of-concept machine learning algorithm working on Golem. We implemented it over the summer, so you can see how it works here. And here⁴ is the full description of the ML task, with experiments justifying various implementation choices.  If you have any comments or doubts, send them to contact@golem.network and we would be happy to address them.  [1] Better algorithms are developed all the time, but we have yet to see a real distributed gradient descent. However, the prospects are looking good, for example see Lian et al.  [2] Yes, we currently control the overfitting by using other techniques, but this is only a toy example.  [3] In fact, these algorithms usually perform better than random search or even human experts. See Bergstra et al. or Snoek et al.  [4] It is one of our many research resources we made publicly available, to ensure the company and our process of developing Golem are more transparent than ever.

The difference is in the Hype SONM team are good at creating, and their approach and presentations are much more attractive to investors, which I truly understand. But lets be rational, if Golem would have putted out a few stuff like a road map and hyped it up like SONM you would probably have had a different position. This is why they hired somebody to take care of this particular part they have not been that good at this year.

Basically all the Top500 computers are just a collection of computers working together. Trinity a supercomputer in the top 10 of supercomputers has 979968 Cores and uses Intel Xeon Phi 7250 cpu's. 64 cores per processor,  that means they need 14411 cpu socket. So basically its just a datacenter full of servers working as one.  We still cant make babies in 1 month with 9 women, but we sure as hell can create a supercomputer from multible compute nodes.

Of corse some of you will say ""then some amount of people renting or consuming computing power will leave it until price fall/raise"" but isn't it better option to base future golem growth just on the overall cloud computing power growth and make it totally resistant to speculator games ? Golem price then could raise even rapidly, but real computing power cost per TFLOP not.  Mybe there is already such kind of though about computing power price calculation but I'm not sure about that. Can anybody clarify it ?  Golem price growth/dump shouldn't affect it's basic renting power purpose. Golem per TFLOP should be reflection of total computing power and Golem price itself where their sum always gives thypical USD computing power cost to make it stable and usable in a reasonable way.  If golem price raise too fast, renter of computing power receive relatively less golems. If it falls, he receives more - always just the equivalent of thypical computnig power cost multiplied by his rig's performance. The more people participating in the project then overall cloud power and golem price raise......stability both for renters and users. Speculators can ""do their job"" too, but do not affect power renting/using profitability. This is what I think",False

Well, experience thought me to become patient. You know how many times in the past, when I was a green crypto enthusiast, I lost money cause of my impatience, selling too early or buying too early. Since then I ve learned to follow crypto waves and wait for the big time prize instead of trying to hunt down few satoshies here and there. This is why I choose only long term projects which generate corresponding rewards to be part of my portfolio. I belive Golem, Factom, DMD Diamond and a few more definitely to be part of this group. So dont be stupid, if you belive in Golem, wait until price goes up at least 5x until you even touch your coins. Until then, preserve your energy and focus in to other interesting stuff. ",False

TRST and KMD (before I sold that junk) gave me nice mid-peak gains from trading but GNT only really goes up, and when it corrects it's so minimal you'd have to trade such large amounts at a time to gain any real profit, that IF you misstep and bet wrong, it could end up costing you $500+ just to buy back in cause you tried trading to make $200.  What I'm saying is I don't think price targets even matter with this one unless you're trying to trade, which I wouldn't advise unless it gets more volatile.

Golem is like an old Jewish-myth creature that would fight for you. You made it out of materials and did some sort of magic and it would protect you and your loved ones and vanquish your enemies...

When was golem .02? I bought in around .07 and .09 sold at .25 and repurchased when I saw that Golem isn't really following the trends of other 'coins'. It doesn't really go very far down (generally) after going up. I too think it'll hit $1 EASILY but I think we can see $2-5 prices just because people with TONS of money in the world who know nothing about crypto are learning about it every day, seeing the money being made, and getting even greedier! So, when those kind of people start coming in, they'll see ANY project with a high market cap, and go $1/token is nothing psychologically for someone with billions who knows that a single Bitcoin was once 'worthless' and is now almost $3k....  I'm about to stock up on some, even at .60 I'll do anything under $1 at this point, and just hodl it for the long run. I'm thinking in a year $2-5 is easily within reach, especially with just current trends.  I'd bet if they can do what they're trying to do, then GNT price cant be predicted it could even be $100/GNT if big enough money comes from the outside and believes in it enough or thinks they can make enough money by buying it at X dollars",False

The IBM computer is not decentralized (in the coming years I believe the public will view decentralized systems with the same trust dynamic as they view the green SSL bar. Right not, it's not a big deal, but in the future, if a company isn't built on the blockchain, I believe they risk being left behind - perhaps in 5-7 years we will see this. I think sentiment is already showing signs of this starting to develop.) 2. The IBM quantum computer is a development in *hardware* and fundamental computer process. 3. Referring to point 2, I surmise that Golem (being software) can be adapted to quantum hardware in the future. 4. Golem, I think, will have great social interest in the future due to the fact that it will be one of the market providers in this new age of renting out computing power from regular desktops (which is rapidly being ushered in) 5. Like the article mentions, we're not quite there with quantum computers being competitive. Look at just that alone (time-frame) Golem has advantage.

Over 500k coins out of a billion at the current price as I post this. They may not be able to buy that many very quickly at times where as tens of trillions of dollars exist. Of course as they bought hundreds of thousands of coins the price would go up, but you get the idea of what I am saying. One thing that could happen in the beginning of this is that as people bought many coins to use for the golem program they would grow distracted from their projects and become traders, at least temporarily. This is why I am worried that someone will copy this idea but accept cash. Is there a reason this will not happen? They would be able to start more quickly and here is why. If one golem coin we valued at $10 then you would still need a 1000 coins to pay for a million dollars worth of computing power, but what if in between your buying the coins and your looking to pay for your project the price drops? This is inevitable is it not? How many times must someone complain about this before some of its users complain about it and scare everyone off? Am I crazy to think all of this or is everyone else really really stupid. Some will say the price could go up but what if they wanted to something done now and the price went down ten percent a minute later? So on the one hand as my title implied this coin could gain a great deal of value, but I worry that these problems could prevent the whole thing from gaining traction after a certain point. I do however have a solution. If someone can guarantee that their computing power would be priced in golem as opposed to dollars then this would bypass all of this. For instance, I don't say I am willing to sell computing power for $5 worth of golem. I say I am willing to sell computing power for 5 golem. Has anyone figured this out yet? Please tell me it is so. A lot of bitcoin fans believe that because you can buy something in bitcoin that the products are priced in bitcoin, but the retailers that take it turn it into dollars as quickly as possible. They only take dollars worth of bitcoin. Golem devs can not fall into this trap or someone will steal their technology and simply accept dollars for it. If it gets investment then it will bypass this attempt at it and Golem will be totally forgotten. I am willing to follow the hype for now but someone tell me the devs understand this, which is the single most important issue, for golem?",False

Or 1 cent per coin?  When an asset starts to approach previous highs it is tempting to rationalise its worth as such. Technical traders may sell and declare: this is normal.  In truth however, the wild west of the cryptospace doesn't quite work like that.  The 38.2% retraction from Golem's ATH held confidently and thereafter upwardly rebounded, and the fact we're now knocking on the door of 0.0001 proves that GNT's worth is likely to be much higher. If that weren't the case, the price would have descended a long time ago.  We're in a process of price exploration. The combination of mainstream Golem exposure in publications such as Bloomberg and Wired is something that is likely to be built-upon and further compounded - an example of a successful Ethereum asset with demonstrable practical usage.  These are the ingredients of a luxurious asset rich in speculative energy that is prime for the new mainstream.  It starts with 10 cents per coin, and suddenly it is 20 cents per coin. And soon after it is 40 cents per coin. And in time speculators are wondering whether 80 cents is too high or too low, before it finally becomes clear that a 1 dollar Golem is actually a pretty good price for the current climate.",False

On another note, I really wonder how Golem team is going to address verification of the output for rendering jobs. Reputation system isn't something that can be fully trusted. The main problem is that in order to verify the final image (or frame), it needs to be fully rendered by requester, or some other worker. Any partial results will simply not work in this case, and additional full renders will be huge overhead for the system.  [EDIT: Golem actually says ""Such reputation systems are vulnerable to numerous attacks. There is the famous sybil attack, where the attacker creates a large number of identities and fakes those scores via a large influence on the network. There is also the re-entry attack, where the attacker starts fresh with a “neutral” reputation by abandoning the old identity. So far, we are aware of no system resilient to all attacks. Reputation systems in decentralized applications remain an open problem. Golem’s reputation system too is still a subject of research, and we plan to cooperate with the best teams in the field to come up with the best solutions."" https://blog.golemproject.net/the-challenges-ahead-933f040cba95]",False

They need to create a service that runs scripts on host machines, sends data across these machines, and is secure enough not to cause any harm. Data communication speed is crucial - internet is not as fast as data transmission within one computer. If the goal is to analyze big data or decode video then a lot of data need to be spread across the network. It may happen that because of communication speed limitation this project will only be usable only as a ""remote miner"" (i.e. run computational tasks that do not require a lot of transmitted data).  Another problems in case of running this project in real economy are reliability and price. Real enterprises need to make sure that this service is 99.99% available and is always at affordable price in fiat currency. Maybe they would be able to guarantee availability in case of running hundreds of thousands nodes, but the price may be a problem. With these pumps and dumps everyone understands that something that costs $100 may cost $1000 in just a month. Maybe individual nodes will set their own price and compete in this way, but swings would be very high anyway.  In any case if they launch a working application I think their market cap would be around 80 mln. just because of that, even if it acts just a ""remote miner"".",False

With Elastic-PL the Elastic project developed exactly that, an own language, that makes it possible to submit all kinds of work to the network.  Golem has its advantages too obv. Its a big team of skilled developers, they have done an excellent marketing so far and used synergies with the Ethereum network and last but not least they have been funded with a very good amount of ETHs.  So just quit that silly hostility between different projects that work in the same field, eventually they can even help each other. If not from a developing point of view then maybe they both raise awareness of each other in the broader crypto and investment field.",False

Difference is, BOINC is free. There's no incentive for people to add their computing power to the BOINC network except a desire to help science. Which means that BOINC will never be used for anything but sciences, and even in that it will not be very powerful compared to the potential power of a global computation network.  Golem creates a sharing economy for computing power, thereby supplying incentive to add your computer to the network.

If Bitcoin had of been written this way it would have been ignored by just about everyone but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt here and assume you've thought this through.  So my question is: how do you ensure the results from the outsourced computations will be correct? This is not explained any where in the paper and its the most important part of this idea. I mean: its not like people haven't had the idea to do this before. I myself have and researchers have used these clusters before for years for lengthy problems.  I know you mentioned Filecoin in your paper but the reason why we can so easily do decentralized cloud storage compared to decentralized computation is because the trust problem of proving that a node is still storing content (and proving that retrieved content is what we originally stored) is all easily solved by basic cryptography. But with outsourced computation there are no simple ways to validate the results are correct without wasting as many cycles or more than the original computation.  Am I to assume that this network is going to be based on a reputation system? I suppose you could also outsource the same computations to multiple nodes and choose the majority consensus but I'm not sure if the economics will work in your favor since having to pay to repeat a computation multiple times may work out to be more costly than just firing up an Amazon cluster.  You also can't rely on a pseudo-anonymous reputation system instead since this could poison the work for an entire computation and there would be no easy way to detect it (outsourcing random problems won't be enough since someone giving out faulty work can just selectively alter random results which is a similar problem that online market places face.)  How do you solve these problems? Or do you envision a reputation system will be enough?  Edit: This didn't occur to me before but if you were to focus exclusively on distributed computations for graphics rendering it would be easy to see which chunks of information weren't rendered correctly so you could outsource it to another node. But the problems I listed still apply to general purpose computation.",False

Would you honestly advise we take time away from working on building the technology we raised 820,000 ETH to build and instead work on the nearly valueless project of getting GNT listed on exchanges?  How does GNT getting listed actually benefit Golem or those who want to use it? It benefits short-term crypto-traders.... but that is not who we are here to benefit.

Just take ZEC, for example. Trading was frantic in ZEC futures before the token went live on Poloniex. ZEC was changing hands at absurd prices, and yet it crashed and burned as soon as it hit a major exchange. It went from an intraday high of over 3,300 BTC to a fraction of one Bitcoin now.  I expect GNT to follow a similar (if somewhat less extreme) trajectory.  Also, as far at the actual tokens are concerned, the price is going absolutely going nowhere on Liqui.

As more computational power enters the Golem Network, the cost of computational power will go down.  As more computational power enters the Golem Network, the value of the network (and thereby the currency it relies on) will go up.  So the cost of computational power will go down a lot because a) its cost is going down b) it's being bought in GNT, and the value of GNT is going up  No one is earning a percentage of transactions. If there was one, then someone would simply fork our open sourced code, remove that transaction fee, and release a Golem variant that is cheaper and more profitable for everyone (except those who got the fee)",False

I mean, huge professional mining farms in low electricity cost countries will be profitable while it will be unprofitable for the average Joe?    The more datacenters offering their services on Golem, the more supply of computing power. Simple market logic dictates, that prices fall if supply increases. So GNT price would go down.  If more customers want to use Golem network, but there are too few datacenters, then price of GNT could go up.  Which one is more likely is a pure gamble. I think it will be easier to get the datacenters excited and on board, because they are always looking for ways to optimally use all their available capacity. Getting the word to users of blender etc. and make them use Golem however looks more difficult to me.  Replace GNT with USD. And replace Golem with market for computing power. An abundance of computing power and shortage of customers, results falling prices in USD of. Vice versa, a high demand of customers but short supply of computing power, results in falling USD prices for computing.  (Okay, well, the supply of USD is insanely, incalculable and arbitrarily inflated, but that is besides the point here. If someone wanted to use a currency with a known sane inflation, they could just buy bitcoin or if they wanted zero inflation, there are other coins for that.)  Why should I buy the internal currency (app token) as an investor?  What will the people owning the company behind Golem earn? If they earn an percentage on all GNT transactions, then this seems much more profitable to me. Investments into startup companies makes sense to me, but investments into app tokens not so much.",False

What are we actually buying here? Equity? Doesn't look like. So we are not going to own the company behind this. Therefore we are also not eligible for dividends. Later they may actually sell equity like others did on bank to the future.  Due to the recent spam of ICO's, I wonder if it is useful to join this one. Most ICO's were traded below ICO price right after they were distributed. So even if I like this project, I wonder if it would not be better to just buy on exchanges after the initial major dump.  So it is an apptoken we are buying here, right? A token that can be purchased by someone interested in getting cheap cloud computation power? Then I don't see the developers interest in a high token price since that would hinder the project. And if this project succeeds, it will not be long until huge data centers start providing their services and thereby driving the token price down.

There will also be a reputation system to detect bad behaving users, and a class of user called Validators who will analyse new programs and whitelist or blacklist them.

Maybe I've got something wrong in my thinking. Let's see.  Like I said in #1, Requestors don't install anything on the Providers' computers.  Exact method of payments hasn't been decided on yet (it may be micropayments, or it may be lottery, depending on tech advances in ETH). But, whatever the method, Providers will be paid for the work their computers do.",False

It is good for supporters, because it aligns incentives of all parties involved.  And keep in mind, besides the one-time income burst from the upcoming GNT Sale, we won’t actually make any money by building the Golem Network itself.  It’s an open sourced technology that anyone can copy… so if we tried to make a profit by, say, taking a percentage of every GNT transaction, then someone would simply fork our code, remove that percentage, and create a version of Golem that is cheaper for everyone.  So, just like the Ethereum Foundation develops and builds Ethereum without directly profiting from its use, we will build the Golem Network. Our long term income will come from being the first to understand the potential uses of Golem tech and use it to Author software on the Application Registry.  With Ethereum, Developers endowment gave them long term capability to work on the project, even without foundation support. They are doing a lot of great stuff, sometimes starting own companies.  Foundation endowment gave it extra stability. I do not know the numbers, so this is only my educated guess, but I do not think Ethereum development would be progressing at this pace (maybe project would not be progressing at all) if not for Foundation endowment. AND Ethereum crowdfunding had no cap.  This is R&D. And this is crypto. It is hard to plan for the next quarter, not mentioning 3-4 years of basic development needed. Endowment gives extra security and stability, which is beneficial to token holders.",False

In other words, we do not yet know all the risks, but we feel that this is a reasonable cap, given the state of the project, the plan ahead, and the current situation within the Ethereum community. We also echo Vitalik’s call to not create smart contracts holding more than $10M, not just on purely technological grounds (security), but also because of wider community considerations: We ourselves have no wish to take in anything more than we believe we can put to use, and we certainly don’t wish to exhaust the pool of ETH available to other important projects.""",False
