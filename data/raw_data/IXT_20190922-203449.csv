The site provides information to current and future self-insurers in an easy to follow format, as well as providing listings of the service providers who are able to assist companies who wish to become self-insured. The site’s unique Business Enquiry and Provider Search facilities allow companies seeking a self-insurance solution or professional firms seeking partners to direct business enquiries to self-insurance service providers who can then respond directly to the enquirer.  Market Metrics - In the USA 65% of all employers self-insure their employee medical benefits through a Federal Act known as ERISA which allows companies to establish trusts which are then protected by stop-loss insurance. - The size of the stop loss market in the USA exceeds $15 Billion - There are over 5,000 captive companies in the world today with 25 main captive domiciles globally - There are over 250 Risk Retention Groups in the USA - More than 40 categories of Service Providers operating in this space  With Dominic, we have identified several ways to improve the platform technically, including blockchain, marketing, and a potential launch date and we see tremendous value when combined with right resources, network, and technical expertise. Dominic Higham, Founder and Managing Director of Self Insurance Market said, “The deployment of blockchain and distributed ledger technology into the insurance sector is gaining momentum and we are excited to be part of this. Partnering with iXledger will allow us to be at the front of this movement whilst at the same time creating a value-add proposition for companies operating in this space.” Ingemar Svensson, CEO, and Founder of iXledger said, “Dominic is a former senior Lloyd’s insurance and reinsurance broker. Since leaving Lloyd’s he has created a number of successful ventures which have won industry awards and we are looking forward to having him and his experience with us. At the same time, our strategic partnership with selfinsurancemarket.com will provide us with another channel for our technology in a specific and large sector with a global reach”.",True

It is a good partnership they announced though and an Insurance marketplace shouldn't be too difficult.  A more involved option is designing insurance solutions for the sharing economy. For example if you rent your home/room out through Airbnb, your standard insurance policy doesn't cover damage by paying guests, the alternative is business insurance but this is far too expensive for people just renting out a room and even those renting out their property unless their occupancy rate is very high.  A blockchain based solution linked to airbnb/other would allow insurers to automatically, accurately and immutably record the times your home/room is rented out for very little additional administration on their part and so allow them to offer cost effective insurance tailored to the rapidly growing sharing economy.",True

As a consumer looking for insurance, why would I use your service over another service? There are various services out there now that allow you to search the market place for different insurance companies. Do I get to pay for medical insurance in bitcoins? Or IXT? What is the appeal? Other than you are using blockchain technology?  2. As a holder of your coins, what is the benefit? I see mention of  reward pool (there's not a lot information on this) and small rewards given in the form of IXT when using the service through transactions. Is the main benefit? Does accumulating these coins allow me to purchase something in your market place? Do I get a discount? Do I get dividends? What is the driving force to increase the value of the coin?  3. Is this PoS? Is there a return of some sort? 4. As more of a side question, one of the selling points was to connect the insurance company directly to the customer, which I get (cut out the middle man), but it looks like the broker can also utilize your service?  I guess, I'm not seeing the immediate appeal of the coin or the service. Not to say there isn't - I'm not trying to come across the wrong way, maybe I am just not understanding it, but it feels like the coin is just being used as a primary way to fund the company without much benefit to the coin holder.",True

It is normal that it will go up and down. I was encouraging others to remain calm; hold and wait even though it looks like it is selling off. No worries here.  What I was trying to say is that the way I understand it is that since the IXT price is traded in ETH (IXT/ETH trading pair) the price for example .002 ETH per IXT will vary depending on the ETH/USD pair value. When funds are pumped into ETH the value of ETH/USD goes up. If the proportionate amount of funds is not put into IXT then the IXT/ETH ratio goes down. This does not necessarily mean the USD value of IXT is going down. In other words IXT value can remain the same while ETH goes up and down causing IXT/ETH to go up and down.  I guess my explanation was just another way of saying the price action is normal and there is no need to sell in a panic. We will see many more natural pumps. I look forward to them.  Thanks for your reply.,True

Since IXT was sold for ETH the IXT/ETH value it was sold for during the crowdsale will remain the same. However the IXT to Satoshi/Bitcoin price will fluctuate as the ETH/BTC value changes. Its best to calculate the newly created token value against the token (in this case the IXT sale was in Ethereum) that the ICOsale/Crowdsale was priced in.  You can calculate the Satochi/Bitcoin value on a day by day calculation, which is probably what you have done.  I hope for the best IXT value in the exchanges in the short term and long term. As per other ICO's it will likely go up and have a pull back and then go up again. I cant suggest an investment strategy, as it is different for each person. I personally think that at least a portion of IXT should be held long term. All good ICO's achieve a much greater value on exchanges over time than their initial pop.",True

But I still have some questions. Although I dont believe p2p insurance is a sound business like p2p lending, especially in the cases where insurees need service help from the insurer (not just the claim payment) and with this perspective it is more realistic that Insurex builds its business proposal by including insurers and reinsurers, but this comes along with some fundamental problems. First of all, by recreating entire insurance business on a blockchain but with all the actors remaining the same, actualy it is not decentralization of the process but perhaps increasing the efficiency and hence lowering the operational cost. Insurex can really do this by making insurance operations on blockchain and so eliminating the cost that arises from trust issues between the parties. If this is the case, then we should determine how big the cost savings that Insurex targets, because that will show us the potential market of Insurex. We have to know operational costs both on global scale and in Europe (because Insurex initially targets European insurance market). Then we can assess the real value proposition of Insurex. Also, if Insurex explains its plans to expand to markets other than EU then we can also have an idea of present value of its longer term operaitions.  I believe Insurex with its core and advisory team has the capacity to handle with EU market. When they try to expand to say US or Middle East, the regulations will be different. So even they achieve to make insurer partners and draw insurees' attention in those regions they need to persuade the regulatory bodies. Because, If Insurex will store personal information on the servers located in London or even on blockchain and not on the local servers then it might lead to some legal problems. How will they cope with them? If they cannot do it and stuck in EU market, then, is the value proposition still good?  I understand business issues better and I am not a tech-savy person. There is one thing that I believe people over here can easily help me. Considering ICOs generally, if investors buy the tokens as an investment tool and if the platform operates on those tokens, then, dont these two interests contradict each other? If everybody hoards the token then how can platform operate? I have the same problem with BTC or ETH as well. If everybody holds their BTC as an investment tool, doesnt it kill its value proposition as a payment and money transfer system? Lastly, when I read through explanations here, I understand there are some whales who buy big chuncks so that small investors are left out of the game. How much on average (as a percentage of the transaction) should I have to pay as a fee to make sure my transaction will go through?  Thank you.",True

Please see our responses below:  >> As I understand (and please correct me if Im wrong), confidential private insurance information won't be stored on the blockchain itself, but in the Nosql storage instead? So things like pricing, parties involved in an insurance deal, addresses and contacts of people will be stored in Nosql and not on the blockchain?  This is the approach we have have taken to meet various regulatory challenges related to for example GDPR.  >> So the follow on question then would be: what type of backups/redundancy or contingency plans will you have if the ethereum network has issues? For example, bottleneck issues which we've seen recently. If a lot of data is purely on ethereum, and ethereum slows down or has other problems (which is possible because its still a third party and a work-in-progress), companies wont be able to access what they want  This is a very critical issue for us. Our initial approach is to run a consortium blockchain which would lend itself well to the industry we are in. Data and process can still be shared by all the market participants who are connected in the consortium and we will be isolated from the issues we have been seeing on the public chain.  >> In essence, how are you ensuring data integrity and the ability to access the information a company needs on insurex in case something goes wrong on the blockchain or somewhere else?  Our team has extensive experience of providing mission-critical, fault-tolerant systems so we will leverage this experience to the fullest. Well-known techniques will be applied to ensure that we can provide a 24/7 marketplace. Hot standby's, load-balancing, multiple levels of redundancy would be part of this.  >> What are your anticipated insurance transaction volumes on the insurex platform once the concept takes off? Because ethereum at the moment is showing some slowdown at 300,000 transactions a day (obviously that will improve with updates)  It is very difficult to predict the volumes, even as an estimate. It will be driven by the number of participants and their size and activeness. What we don't anticipate millions of transactions a second but rather in the thousands per day.  >> I would think some insurance companies would also want to use a sidechain to store their insurance information. So have their own private blockchain maintained in the cloud which covers all its sensitive information etc instead of a centralised nosql concept. So they would get the benefits of blockchain, but also keep control over their data in case things go wrong with a more standard public blockchain tech like ethereum  Im thinking something like Factom's blockchain technology to store insurance information as an add-on to insurex would also be good, so data is stored securely in an independent way, but also a smart way.  Exactly our thinking.  >> So..insurex is a great concept but I have some questions there....it doesnt say enough in the whitepaper about the extent of the blockchain implementation and whether everything's been thought of in regards to contingencies and how the control, safety and security of the data on it will work  Thank you for these encouraging words. Yes it is early days yet and we're working very hard at trying to address many of these challenges. And we intentionally left the white paper light on specific details in some areas but will keep the community updated on our progress with this.  Regards, InsureX - IS",True

Or am I missing something or I don't understand it?  Insurance means that if you pay for insurance, you get insurance almost without any risk. Insurance is secured by multiple levels. Insurance companies have insurance by other insurance companies which have insurance by higher level of insurance companies which have further insurance on global level. All risk is spread through global level insurance organizations which will break only if global economy totally collapse. This is why it is called insurance. Unless world economy doesn't collapse totally (I mean really totally), you still have insurance.  But we can not say the same for digital assets which are highly unpredictable.

They are just trying to collect 88888 ETH or around USD 30MM in todays rate. As it started to get media attention I think the ICO won't even last an hour and most of small investors like us won't get chance unless they put measures to favor us. You can take example of last 2 ICOs BAT & Bancor . People were paying $6,800 just for transaction charge. There was even one transaction for Bancor with $10K transaction fee, though the transaction was unsuccessful because of max 50 Gwei gas price. I think InsureX should put similar 50 Gwei gas price cap other we won't be able to participate in this ICO.",True

Each InsureX token holder is eligible for a share of the IRP’s underlying value based on the number of their tokens. They can redeem a portion of the pool’s value in exchange for their tokens.   The IRP will be fueled by the activity on the platform. Each executed transaction will have an associated fee, and a portion of that fee will be exchanged to one of the large ERC20 tokens and allocated towards the Reward’s pool. Overtime the total amount of the IRP will grow and provide a strong foundation to support IXT.

InsureX is a marketplace created for the insurance sector and powered by blockchain where insurers and reinsurers can connect and trade insurance products.    - Why is your technology valuable? Currently the processes in the insurance sector are very inefficient, costly and prone to errors. This is because a lot of the work is done manually with multiple intermediaries in addition to a large amount of documentation which is passed between these parties.   InsureX solves these problems by providing a fast, reliable and direct way for the market participants to conduct business together. Our platform will support their processes securely end-to-end as well as reducing their overall costs.    - Who will be using InsureX? InsureX is mainly targeting insurance and reinsurance providers. There will be a possibility for brokers to interact with InsureX and provide specialist services.    - What is IXT? The InsureX Token (IXT) will fuel the InsureX marketplace. We will offer IXT in our upcoming crowdsale.    - What will IXT be used for? IXT will be used for paying transaction fees and services offered by the platform.    - Is IXT ERC20 compliant? Yes, IXT is ERC20 compliant which means that it is compatible with all ethereum based wallets.    - How many tokens are issued? The total amount of token we are going to issue is 130,000,000.    - What currencies are accepted in the crowdsale? We are only accepting ETH during the crowdsale. If you want to participate but have another type of currency such as BTC you would have to exchange it for ETH first.    - How do I get in touch with InsureX? You can get in touch with us through our community channels on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn or Slack.",True
