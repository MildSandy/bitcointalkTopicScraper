It was named as ""ANN moderation"", we were told to leave positive comments regarding the project. Sounded strange to me, but I looked in the most common rating sites and assumed the project was legit and wasnt promoting a scam. I saw high rating in ICObench and KYC passed, was enough for me. #1 mistake: always do my own research  Now i have been looking deeper, looking at the previous messages in bitcointalk ANN and this seems very fishy. Seem they really changed the concept of the project, AFTER raising some funds, and that is why they were asking for positive comments.. to cover the bad comments from harmed investors! They also did dupplicated payments to bounty members after bounty campaign ended, which would make me very angry if i were an investor, as price of token is diluted. I also realized now that the message of bounty thread was edited. Where it appears ""You can help the team explain to other users how Tombala works"".. and i can promise for my babys life, this is very different of what was stated previously as task( something sumarized as: "" post positive comments about Tombola""). I am already dissapointed with myself as i think that i was helping this team raising money by not being honest to people. I promise i regret it very much and hope you havent invested a cent on this.  i checked the balance.s.and seems 94% concentrated in few accounts... this seems strange!  I also hope investors accept  my apologies (+ also for my bad english).    Sorry for the long message and best regards",False

If you read the old whitepaper you have to read the new edited one they have now, which doesnt have this part anymore:  Quote B-3. Problems of the existing blockchain lottery services As for the conventional blockchain lottery services, they use bit coin and ethereum for their services. First of all, as for companies that use Bitcoin for their services, they manage the collected amount centrally through their own server that controls the amount of money due to the disadvantage of Bitcoin without smart contract function and distribute the prize money. This implies that they can manipulate the results at any time, or they can flee at night with the huge prize money. As for Ethereum lottery services, you must pay an Ethereum gas fee. Ethereum has an Ethereum Gas (Gwei) that you have to pay to run smart contract codes in your structure. In the order of the higher amount to be paid for this gas, the miners have a system where they establish deals and must pay accordingly a kind of fee in addition to the Ethereum they must actually use.

Problems of the existing blockchain lottery services As for the conventional blockchain lottery services, they use bit coin and ethereum for their services. First of all, as for companies that use Bitcoin for their services, they manage the collected amount centrally through their own server that controls the amount of money due to the disadvantage of Bitcoin without smart contract function and distribute the prize money. This implies that they can manipulate the results at any time, or they can flee at night with the huge prize money. As for Ethereum lottery services, you must pay an Ethereum gas fee. Ethereum has an Ethereum Gas (Gwei) that you have to pay to run smart contract codes in your structure. In the order of the higher amount to be paid for this gas, the miners have a system where they establish deals and must pay accordingly a kind of fee in addition to the Ethereum they must actually use. Although the lottery ticket amount includes fees, the user has to pay fees again. Currently Ethereum has a processing speed that can handle 100 transactions every 15 seconds. While Visa, a global credit card company, handles up to 25,000 transactions per second and China’s Alipay handles up to 50,000 transactions per second, Ethereum has a far slower speed. If a user receives a large amount of money as a jackpot, no one knows how long it will take to receive the prize money.  So now that it is on Ethereum nobody knows what it will be like.",False

Why did Tombola project launch as an EOS project and change a week ago to an ETH project? 2. Can investors in the ICO, before the project changed, have a refund? 3. Why was the whitepaper changed with no notice to investors? 4. Is a copy of the old whitepaper still available to view? We have one but they should have made it available when changing the whitepaper. 5. How does Tombola plan to handle regulation in each country that they plan to promote their lottery? 6. Why should anyone give your team $22 million dollars if they only dodge the EASIEST questions about this supposed project?  Your whitepaper said:  Quote B-3. Problems of the existing blockchain lottery services As for the conventional blockchain lottery services, they use bit coin and ethereum for their services. First of all, as for companies that use Bitcoin for their services, they manage the collected amount centrally through their own server that controls the amount of money due to the disadvantage of Bitcoin without smart contract function and distribute the prize money. This implies that they can manipulate the results at any time, or they can flee at night with the huge prize money. As for Ethereum lottery services, you must pay an Ethereum gas fee. Ethereum has an Ethereum Gas (Gwei) that you have to pay to run smart contract codes in your structure. In the order of the higher amount to be paid for this gas, the miners have a system where they establish deals and must pay accordingly a kind of fee in addition to the Ethereum they must actually use. Although the lottery ticket amount includes fees, the user has to pay fees again. Currently Ethereum has a processing speed that can handle 100 transactions every 15 seconds. While Visa, a global credit card company, handles up to 25,000 transactions per second and China’s Alipay handles up to 50,000 transactions per second, Ethereum has a far slower speed. If a user receives a large amount of money as a jackpot, no one knows how long it will take to receive the prize money.  You never explained why this was removed TOMBOLA, now the project is based on Ethereum and call us shit?  Fraudsters get upset that the fraud is starting to show to others and you have a limited time to keep committing it before authorities stop you.

Now, among many bad projects, there are a few that are worth  to invest.. Tombola is one of them!    ---------------UPDATE 24th sep 2018-----------  Dear cryptoenthusiasts  I took part on Tombola bounty campaign https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4837302.0  The task consisted of posting 10 messages weekly in Tombola's bitcointalk ANN. It was named as ""ANN moderation"", we were told to leave positive comments regarding the project. Sounded strange to me, but I looked in the most common rating sites and assumed the project was legit and wasnt promoting a scam. I saw high rating in ICObench and KYC passed, was enough for me. #1 mistake: always do my own research  Now i have been looking deeper, looking at the previous messages in bitcointalk ANN and this seems very fishy. Seem they really changed the concept of the project, AFTER raising some funds, and that is why they were asking for positive comments.. to cover the bad comments from harmed investors! They also did dupplicated payments to bounty members after bounty campaign ended, which would make me very angry if i were an investor, as price of token is diluted. I also realized now that the message of bounty thread was edited. Where it appears ""You can help the team explain to other users how Tombala works"".. and i can promise for my babys life, this is very different of what was stated previously as task( something sumarized as: "" post positive comments about Tombola""). I am already dissapointed with myself as i think that i was helping this team raising money by not being honest to people. I promise i regret it very much and hope you havent invested a cent on this.  i checked the balance.s.and seems 94% concentrated in few accounts... this seems strange!

We won't shill for an ICO like you though.

Transparency in the use of funds As for the existing state lotteries, on average, only 50% of the funds are distributed to the winners, and the remaining amount is not fully explained about its use, lacking in transparency. There are some companies that wrote about its approximate ratio of use of the remaining funds, but in reality, many lottery operators are wasting the funds on their excessive or unnecessary operating expenses, and they are paying a lot of taxes, too. They do not disclose detailed amounts and proof of expenditure to users who purchased the actual lottery tickets, either.  So the government lotteries aren't transparent enough but Tombola changing the whitepaper and protocol mid-ICO is TRUSTWORTHY?!?!

Ticket price: 0.0001 BTC, 0.001 ETH, 0.05 EOS, 10 TBL Gap of draw: 24 hours Distribution of game revenue  Now it says: Quote E. 5/20 Speed Lotto 10 % is tombola operating expenses . 20% of amount will automatically be transferred to the pool of next rounds. If there are winners, 70% will be paid to them. And the remaining amount is all will be transferred to the pool of next rounds.  Ticket price:0.0001 BTC, 0.001 ETH, 0.001 BCH, 10 TBL Gap of draw:24 hours Rewards of game  And under FAIRNESS OF TOMBOLA, it used to say:  Quote A. Fairness of Tombola A-1. Blockchain A blockchain is a data distribution processing technology. In other words, it refers to a technology in which all users participating in the network distribute and store data such as all transaction details. It is named as a blockchain because it is a connection of blocks in the form of chains. In a blockchain, a ‘block’ is a ledger where personal data and personal transaction (P2P) data are recorded. After these blocks are formed, they have a structure of ‘chain’ sequentially connected over time. Every user has a transaction history, so when verifying transaction details, you should check and verify the ledgers held by all users. For this reason, the blockchain is also referred to as a “public transaction ledger” or “distributed transaction ledger”. Like the existing banks, blockchains also store and prove. However, the transaction details are stored in each block for all the participating people rather than in the bank as in the existing method, and if 100 people are involved in one network, the transaction details of A and B are created as 100 blocks and transmitted to all the blocks for the 100 people and stored. If you want to check the transaction details later, you can connect and check the data saved in each block. The blockchain is characterized by distributed storage. In the existing trading methods it is possible to forge or alter data by attacking the central server of the bank. Considering the recent hacking of several banks, this is not an impossible threat. In blockchains, however, it is difficult to forge or alter data because many people store the same data. If you try to forge or alter them, it is virtually impossible because you have to forge or alter all the data of the innumerable people.  Tombola shortened it to: Quote A-1. Blockchain In   a   blockchain,   a   ‘block’   is   a   ledger   where   personal   data   and   personal   transaction   (P2P)   data   are   recorded.   After   these   blocks   are   formed,   they   have   a   structure   of   ‘chain’   sequentially   connected   over   time.   Every   user   has   a   transaction   history,   so   when   verifying   transaction   details,   you   should   check   and  verify  the  ledgers  held  by  all  users.  For  this  reason,  the  blockchain  is  also   referred   to   as   a“public   transaction   ledger”   or   “distributed   transaction   ledger”. however, it is difficult to forge or alter data because many people store the same data. If you try to forge or alter them, it is virtually impossible because you have to forge or alter all the data of the innumerable people.

Their whitepaper used to say:  Quote B-3. Problems of the existing blockchain lottery services As for the conventional blockchain lottery services, they use bit coin and ethereum for their services. First of all, as for companies that use Bitcoin for their services, they manage the collected amount centrally through their own server that controls the amount of money due to the disadvantage of Bitcoin without smart contract function and distribute the prize money. This implies that they can manipulate the results at any time, or they can flee at night with the huge prize money. As for Ethereum lottery services, you must pay an Ethereum gas fee. Ethereum has an Ethereum Gas (Gwei) that you have to pay to run smart contract codes in your structure. In the order of the higher amount to be paid for this gas, the miners have a system where they establish deals and must pay accordingly a kind of fee in addition to the Ethereum they must actually use. Although the lottery ticket amount includes fees, the user has to pay fees again. Currently Ethereum has a processing speed that can handle 100 transactions every 15 seconds. While Visa, a global credit card company, handles up to 25,000 transactions per second and China’s Alipay handles up to 50,000 transactions per second, Ethereum has a far slower speed. If a user receives a large amount of money as a jackpot, no one knows how long it will take to receive the prize money.  But they change the whole project with no info about why it isn't on EOS now or why ETH isnt a problem with what they wanted to do.  Ethereum was flooded with requests when crypto kitties hit and almost crashed the network.  And Tombola whitepaper said:  Quote D. Tombola with EOS DAWN. 3.0 Tombola plans to build coins and serve platforms based on EOS to solve the problems of existing block chain lottery and game services. Based on EOS blockchain Smart Contractor system, when the terms of the contract are met, it is designed to automatically send the amount of money at the correct time to the appropriate location. EOS has the advantage of being able to handle millions of projects per second and not having to pay for the Gas Fee the user has to use most often. Thus, users can eliminate the burden of double payment of fees and receive rewards quickly.  They had shills posting in here that EOS Lottery was so innovative for weeks in this thread! NOW THEY AREN'T DOING IT?!?!  @Tombola needs to refund people who bought the TBL token when they had the other whitepaper and project was different. Everyone knows the token will drop when the bounty and airdrop tokens get released and everyone sells that is shilling this thing right now.",False

Check out this gem that they left in the whitepaper  Quote B-2. Transparency in the use of funds As for the existing state lotteries, on average, only 50% of the funds are distributed to the winners, and the remaining amount is not fully explained about its use, lacking in transparency. There are some companies that wrote about its approximate ratio of use of the remaining funds, but in reality, many lottery operators are wasting the funds on their excessive or unnecessary operating expenses, and they are paying a lot of taxes, too. They do not disclose detailed amounts and proof of expenditure to users who purchased the actual lottery tickets, either.  So the government lotteries aren't transparent enough but Tombola changing the whitepaper and protocol mid-ICO is TRUSTWORTHY?!?!  TOMBOLA is not TRANSPARENT with investors and wont be transparent with customers if they act like this during ICO.  People that hold TBL Token will lose money before the shitcoin become worthless...  Here is another change to ""Speed Lotto"" they made: Quote E. 5/20 Speed Lotto The winning rate is higher than the Tombola 6/45, as the winning probability is lower if the five of the 20 numbers are hit. The second and third, fourth winners will be paid in advance, 20 percent will be turned over to the next game, 10 percent will be excluded as a fee, and all money will be received by the jackpot. Ticket price: 0.0001 BTC, 0.001 ETH, 0.05 EOS, 10 TBL Gap of draw: 24 hours Distribution of game revenue  Now it says: Quote E. 5/20 Speed Lotto 10 % is tombola operating expenses . 20% of amount will automatically be transferred to the pool of next rounds. If there are winners, 70% will be paid to them. And the remaining amount is all will be transferred to the pool of next rounds.  Ticket price:0.0001 BTC, 0.001 ETH, 0.001 BCH, 10 TBL Gap of draw:24 hours Rewards of game  And under FAIRNESS OF TOMBOLA, it used to say:  Quote A. Fairness of Tombola A-1. Blockchain A blockchain is a data distribution processing technology. In other words, it refers to a technology in which all users participating in the network distribute and store data such as all transaction details. It is named as a blockchain because it is a connection of blocks in the form of chains. In a blockchain, a ‘block’ is a ledger where personal data and personal transaction (P2P) data are recorded. After these blocks are formed, they have a structure of ‘chain’ sequentially connected over time. Every user has a transaction history, so when verifying transaction details, you should check and verify the ledgers held by all users. For this reason, the blockchain is also referred to as a “public transaction ledger” or “distributed transaction ledger”. Like the existing banks, blockchains also store and prove. However, the transaction details are stored in each block for all the participating people rather than in the bank as in the existing method, and if 100 people are involved in one network, the transaction details of A and B are created as 100 blocks and transmitted to all the blocks for the 100 people and stored. If you want to check the transaction details later, you can connect and check the data saved in each block. The blockchain is characterized by distributed storage. In the existing trading methods it is possible to forge or alter data by attacking the central server of the bank. Considering the recent hacking of several banks, this is not an impossible threat. In blockchains, however, it is difficult to forge or alter data because many people store the same data. If you try to forge or alter them, it is virtually impossible because you have to forge or alter all the data of the innumerable people.  Tombola shortened it to: Quote A-1. Blockchain In   a   blockchain,   a   ‘block’   is   a   ledger   where   personal   data   and   personal   transaction   (P2P)   data   are   recorded.   After   these   blocks   are   formed,   they   have   a   structure   of   ‘chain’   sequentially   connected   over   time.   Every   user   has   a   transaction   history,   so   when   verifying   transaction   details,   you   should   check   and  verify  the  ledgers  held  by  all  users.  For  this  reason,  the  blockchain  is  also   referred   to   as   a“public   transaction   ledger”   or   “distributed   transaction   ledger”. however, it is difficult to forge or alter data because many people store the same data. If you try to forge or alter them, it is virtually impossible because you have to forge or alter all the data of the innumerable people.

But not much were they really worth my attention? Probably, just a few of them were really hot.. but not as hot as Tombola can be.. a true game changer!  --------------UPDATE 24th sep 2018-----------  Dear cryptoenthusiasts  I took part on Tombola bounty campaign https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4837302.0  The task consisted of posting 10 messages weekly in Tombola's bitcointalk ANN. It was named as ""ANN moderation"", we were told to leave positive comments regarding the project. Sounded strange to me, but I looked in the most common rating sites and assumed the project was legit and wasnt promoting a scam. I saw high rating in ICObench and KYC passed, was enough for me. #1 mistake: always do my own research  Now i have been looking deeper, looking at the previous messages in bitcointalk ANN and this seems very fishy. Seem they really changed the concept of the project, AFTER raising some funds, and that is why they were asking for positive comments.. to cover the bad comments from harmed investors! They also did dupplicated payments to bounty members after bounty campaign ended, which would make me very angry if i were an investor, as price of token is diluted. I also realized now that the message of bounty thread was edited. Where it appears ""You can help the team explain to other users how Tombala works"".. and i can promise for my babys life, this is very different of what was stated previously as task( something sumarized as: "" post positive comments about Tombola""). I am already dissapointed with myself as i think that i was helping this team raising money by not being honest to people. I promise i regret it very much and hope you havent invested a cent on this.  i checked the balance.s.and seems 94% concentrated in few accounts... this seems strange!

Quote from: doge_shit666 on August 12, 2018, 01:23:23 PM Lottery and gambling are very attractive to the community and have great potential for investors. The problem of non-transparency in the industry was solved by Tombola with blockchain technology. The project distributes 50% of the profits for all lottery games and gambling for those who keep the tombola token regularly. Is that an incentive to attract users? What other incentives doe the project attract to the community?  The governments televise the lottery drawings for almost every country they're offered. To pretend this is a real world problem that is being solved by the blockchain is delusional.  Its just another lottery offering. A lottery that requires people to buy the TBL Token rather than buy a lottery ticket with money or bitcoin. How will the team compete with $100 million jackpots the government lotteries offer, that wasn't even a thought when the whitepaper was written.  Quote from: Rumayanhi on August 12, 2018, 01:42:38 PM what makes tombola special? why are you using EOS instead of Erc20?  Thats a good question that hasn't been answered.

If they make no money then the token becomes worthless, most people sell before a token or altcoin actually dies.  Almost every ICO has a 20% drop in token price after ICO because the people who get free tokens for advertising the ICO usually sell once the tokens hit the market.

Most projects appreciate questions for a product and business that haven't launched - to point out they are aware of potential road blocks. Tombola acts like this is slander when the whitepaper doesn't go over ANY details of the legal ramifications for their team trying to disrupt National Lotteries....that is more alarming than anything because governments will take issue after the ICO with this.  It is Tombola's responsibility to tell potential investors what their lawyers have said about legality of the project so far in every country they plan to offer service.  Sorry for having thought it was a ""scam,"" when it's merely a poorly drafted whitepaper, that is missing many important details and making up revenue estimates from thin air. With so much risk on investors, due diligence is always a good idea before blindly ""believing"" in new projects and ideas though.  ",False

Everyone must admit that it's a good project. Nobdoubt about it  Their profiles are faked from what it appears. One linkedin profile for all team members but no other details anywhere?!?! Why would an entire team somehow not exist online ?   They wont ANSWER ANY questions because the project has no intentions to launch and every ""positive"" post is just a shill.

Our exchange in the bounty thread was left with no answers to all the flaws in the projects ""business plan""  Quote from: CryptoGamblingSites on July 31, 2018, 08:48:06 PM Quote from: qqwx on July 31, 2018, 06:27:36 PM Quote from: CryptoGamblingSites on July 31, 2018, 05:34:53 PM Tombola ICO is a Scam waiting to happen. Anyone sending them money deserves to lose it.  People don't start gambling sites with the same name as existing gambling sites... they also don't put terrible math on their whitepaper to convince investors they have a chance to turn a profit. They can't even offer lottery games from Honk Kong where they claim the company is based....  This is fake news  Tombola (the bingo website) doesn't care they are launching an ICO for gambling and have the same name ?  They can offer gambling services in Hong King when there isn't even a licensing process because the government runs it?  Everyone getting hyped about how much money they are claiming people can earn might want some actual details how they actually plan to launch a lottery with the thousands of other options gamblers have.  Are tombolo.co.uk and their regulatory bodies (Gambling Commission of Great Britain, Gibraltar Gambling Commissioner) aware of the Tombola ICO? Could there be confusion in the gambling market with two companies having the same name?  Is there any potential Tombola (the ICO) will have to rebrand? Possibly costing investors time and money after having invested in a project showing little knowledge of international gambling laws and trademarks?  It sounds like Tombola is trying to ""sell"" a picture of tomorrow to investors and price it however they want, rather than explain any bottlenecks that are obvious to anybody.  There are indeed several red flags in this project, including the fact that the team seems absent from their own thread. Moreover they claim that their Platform would be EOS based and then they seemingly don't accept EOS in their ICO.  How will they gain any market share when all the other online lotteries have existing customers and they have no track record?  Who did the competitor revenue calculations on their whitepaper, that assumes FortuneJack made $8 billion dollars?  It is an obvious attempt to take crypto from ""investors"" and run. Doesn't matter how many paid shills pretend it's a good idea.",False
