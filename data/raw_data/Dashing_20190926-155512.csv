Large players in this market like Yelp, Thumbtack, Handy, Home ADvisor are all overlooking the need for innovation in this market and are coasting on their large reputations. Dashing is here to take this market head on and create a better way to connect and work with contractors.  ""Dashing plans to create an ecosystem of accountability in which both customers and service providers benefit from transparent, automated, and secure home services transactions with verified providers and a fair, crowdsourced resolution to their problems.  Existing platforms such as Angieâ€™s List, Thumbtack, and Home Advisor operate with a pay-to-bid business model. Vendors are required to pay to place a bid on any project on which they want to work. We believe this business model leaves customers and vendors vulnerable. The vendors are rewarded for underbidding, and customers are required to blindly trust the lowest bidder. We believe this business model is outdated, inefficient, and unfair to everyone involved.   1.   No longer do consumers have to rely on word of mouth or iffy online reviews when hiring help for home improvement projects. Contractors no longer have to worry about collecting payments or chargebacks.  2.   Dashing uses Ethereum smart contracts to automate the entire contract lifecycle so everyone can have less stress throughout the entire process.  3.   Dashing tokens are at the heart of these transactions and allow the use of a smart contract design to automate all aspects of the transaction from customer and vendor onboarding and vetting, dispute resolution, review verification and moderation of the payment cycle."" - Dashing Startengine Announcement https://www.startengine.com/dashing  We're looking for investors that are interested in supporting a stellar team who are eager to take on this industry.

We are absolutely looking for larger investors as well (Financial etc.)  We choose to go the SEC-registered offering route and US only investors for the first round so that we were compliant with US regulations.  We expect most investors to be individuals not financial or corporate investors at least initially.  Does that answer your question?  Happy to answer any other questions that we can as well.,False
