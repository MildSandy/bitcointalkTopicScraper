The conversion wizard for the original 11 tokens is at wizard.spacepirate.io and walks you through the conversion process, there's also a video for it too on the second step. After that date, you won't be able to convert your tokens as this represents the permanent fork for the migration from counterparty to ethereum.  You'll need the Enjin wallet on your mobile phone to see your new tokens, they'll show up under ""Collectibles"" and ""Age of Rust"".  Age of Rust moved from a text adventure on counterparty to a 3d game on Ethereum using the ERC-1155 standard for blockchain gaming. While the text adventure is still active, the project is moving on to the 3d game. A playable version of the game debuted at the Game Developers Conference in March 2019 and am alpha will be released soon of the first level of the game. The game will also be available on TheAbyss.com, a cryptogaming friendly platform for distribution.  The community has moved over to Discord and Telegram, not much is posted in this thread any longer since the cryptogaming community is mostly centralized elsewhere on social media platforms.

With respect to the token conversion process, I brought on another developer to just focus on the erc token contracts. The target date for having the token contracts completed and a process by which token holders can exchange counterparty tokens for erc20 tokens is slated for end of Q3 this year. The intent is still to have other games use and work with our tokens, that's still something that's in the works with other game developers right now. We have a great community of shared players in the crypto puzzle game space right now and it's growing. Moving to an erc token opens up the doors to interchanging tokens within games that are ethereum-based. There's more ethereum based games in dev than there are counterparty games right now and a lot of game asset trading platforms are ethereum only as well.",False

If another decentralized exchange shows up for counterparty, that would be great.  While we've reached out to other exchanges, there's only a few that take counterparty and they don't take requests (tux) or respond to requests (like bittrex or poloniex).  While I love counterparty because it's easy to develop on and use, there might come a point where we need to move to another type of token on a different blockchain. Simply because people want to buy the tokens and cards using Eth and Bitcoin and the counterparty DEX makes it hard to do that since you have to buy XCP before hand. So it's not easy for players... We certainly wouldn't change anything without a thoughtful token conversion process, plus with the game rewards in Bitcoin and the game engine in bitcoin, moving to something like Ethereum would be a fundamental change that would set back things considerably.",False

Here's a few recap updates that are probably key ones:  Quick updates: -A 4 BTC puzzle reward was added to Age of Rust in Jan -Update 1 was completed in March (you need cards to explore about 15% of the game) -Partnered with Blockade Games, Pineapple Fund, and Atari Movie to create Hack & Hash for Pineapple Arcade (1 remaining 100k rustbits prize) -Recently signed an NDA with Microsoft (I can't say more than that)  In the not so awesome news, yes, rustbits fell off the updates for coinmarketcap recently due to falling below $100k per day in trading. Not being able to get the coin listed on exchanges has been disheartening because, well, the exchanges don't want to list counterparty assets. I know that's tough for the counterparty fans here to hear, but it's the truth of things. Firstly, I'm a big believer in counterparty, I think it's the easiest platform to use for developers. However, from the player/buyer perspective, players have had not such as easy time being able to trade btc/eth for rustbits and or the cards. Less than $800 (as recognized by cmc) for *all* counterparty tokens has moved through the DEX for transaction volume in the last 24 hours. I've tried to get rustbits added to Bittrex (and just about every other exchange out there) but they just don't want to add any more counterparty tokens.  Also, I was at the Game Developers Conference this year and there were several blockchain game exchange token platforms at the conference this year, they're all Ethereum based. Counterparty was the gaming friendly platform, but that tide has turned and everything is ERC20 or ERC721 now. So, while I'm a huge banner waving fan for counterparty, it's time to have an open mind and change.  What's next: -Token migration (counterparty to Ethereum): Those of you familiar with STORJ did something very similar, so you'll be able to exchange your rustbits for ERC20 tokens and the cards will more than likely be converted to ERC721 (as opposed to ERC20). You'll have to go to a website, send your rustbits to an address and then the new token will be sent to your ethereum address. All the details haven't been worked out yet, include game support for both blockchains (in the current beta only) for those players that don't want to convert/update to Ethereum. I don't have a date for this yet, likely sometime in Q3 of this year. As soon as the plan and details are available, all the info will be released, including here.  -Age of Rust: We have another update coming in May, which will have a couple of fixes and the updated UI that a few of you may have seen in Discord.  We also took a lot of feedback in the early weeks of the beta to heart. While we added a new navigation menu to the game, new players didn't still quite understand that the retro aspect of the game. ""How do I play?"" and ""what do I do to move"" are still common. Players wanted a 3D environment to move around in, so that's what we're going to do in the final version of Age of Rust, deliver the experience as 3D game.

Quote It’s not a walk through the park to solve the puzzles, a lot of the feedback from the alpha was that the first few puzzles were too easy to solve. In Beta, we wanted to make sure the puzzles were not only difficult, but still engaging at the same time.  I know what you mean hahaha.   The upgradation on the art work is just marvelous i must say.  A question about the cards and rustbit. so to access some part and solve puzzle player will need to have cards and/or rustbits right? are these like the main story or side missions kind of thing.  if its the main storyline and you need them mandatory then what will be the price of each. say the price of card are in absolute rustbits then as time progresses so will hte adaptation and value of rustbits. These cards for a gamer(usually kids) would be quite difficult to obtain in order to move ahead in the game.  one of the things about integration could also be some side quest/ smaller puzzle through which one can get rustbit rewards and then this could be traded for cards. The game economics with rustbits must be quite seamless, will they be on blockchain comeplete or some kind of 2nd layer system?",False

There are subtle hints to tip off the player on which cards they'll need for a particular area/puzzle.  Some players will be able to solve a few hidden puzzles and unlock some rustbits and cards as rewards.  A limited amount of rustbits and series 1 cards were set aside to allow some players to obtain these in order to move through the game without having to buy them. I will say that these rewards are both limited and difficult to find and solve. Rustbits and cards have been exchanging hands through DEX/BoO for the past few months as well. While we want the game to be accessible, it's also a treasure hunt that if you consider the backend strategy involved, could go on for months or years to solve the puzzles. At the same time, there's 35M rustbits in circulation as well as thousands of cards that have been sold, traded, and collected too. It's a tough arrow to gauge between an open game and token controlled access, I think we got the formula as fair as possible, but I understand the late player may have to rely on their skills if they can't get them otherwise.",False

Our developers are continuing to work on the game with a focus on just getting what we need for the beta. Work right now is both technical and creative going into the game and at the same time testing for bugs. As soon as the game is ready for Beta it will be released and we'll announce it. Initially we wanted a mid to late december for the beta and it looks like we are probably close to 2 weeks away from the release.  Beta will have a couple of noticeable differences, the first is that there's an arrow-based navigation component now to move through the game areas. The second is that there's sound integrated into the game, sound effects for areas as well as a dark haunting ambient soundtrack in a few places. There's also the ability to have blockchain cards in the game, some are passive in that you need them to access specific areas, others you can use in a fight. There's also some rustbits integration as well, in that you'll need some tokens to access areas in the game. The last is that the reward in the beta is 4 BTC for solving the main puzzle which is intertwined into the others puzzles which allow you to move forward in the game.  I know everyone is looking forward to the beta, I've received hundreds of messages, dm's, pm's, emails asking for more details as well as ideas and things people would like to see. Some of your suggestions for the game will be in the final version versus the beta, since work on the beta has been ongoing, so don't despair if your suggestion or idea doesn't show up in the beta.

At this time, there are a handful of exchanges that offer counterparty tokens in an exchange platform. The best case is getting one of those exchanges to add the token through the submission process which I've done as well as following up with them on the status of the submission (which they don't really comment on). If it were something that I could do myself, it would have been done already.  The community here has also commented on the best way forward, which they feel is best to have an organic growth model that follows the rest of the counterparty ecosystem. I get a lot of requests to ""have you checked with xyz exchange?"" and if I haven't, then I'll reach out to them and see about it.

You need the cards and tokens in order to progress in the game, you can either buy/trade cards and the tokens, or find some of them in the game for solving complex puzzles. There's also a very limited amount of cards in the game, so there's not enough for everyone which means you'll need to get cards from DEX/Book of Orbs or trade with another player. The cards are only used in a counterparty-compatible wallet, like Book of Orbs, Freewallet, etc.  Ownership of the cards is handled through the bitcoin blockchain (through counterparty) and only the blockchain.  The game only works on top of counterparty and the bitcoin blockchain, some game events are even determined by the blockchain as well.  Here's an example, you may find yourself in an area of the game which has a door. In order to go through the door, you need to have the LASTLIGHT card in your counterparty wallet. Let's say you don't have the lastlight card, you can either try searching in the game or buy one through the DEX. Now, with the card in your counterparty wallet that you control, the game will let you through the door.  In this scenario, you never had to send your LASTLIGHT card to the game.  In the game, we determine which cards you own when you prove wallet ownership through signing a message from your wallet.  ",False

A lot of the information about the treasure in the game has been sprinkled throughout some of forums and other social media posts. However, an article will be coming out in the future that will just focus on the treasure hunt aspect of the game. Right now, this is the first game with Rustbits, other games made by us will always support rustbits. We're talking to some other indiegame developers about adding rustbits into games. One of the nice things about Counterparty is that adding support for rustbits is really easy, the platform is already there. It's actually more about educating developers in general about cryptocurrency in general, but it's more or less a second stage project.  Beta is the first milestone and the final version is the second one after that. There's also cross platform support as well, since Age of Rust will support Spells of Genesis cards, the SoG team wants to add our cards to their game as well in the future. So there's lots ahead on the roadmap. Keep an eye out in our Discord, Slack, Twitter, and facebook channels for updates.

Okay, so getting listed on an exchange is something that I am working on. I'm not sure where the information is coming from that this isn't a priority. That being said, filling out a form, submitting a support ticket, and sending an email does not automatically get you listed on an exchange. If that were the case, rustbits would be on all the exchanges. Bittrex, Cryptopia, Poloniex, zaif, shapeshift, etc... yes, I've followed all the proper submission guidelines, I've joined the slack forms, telegrams, etc. However Tux does not accept submissions, they have to find interest in it themselves. Here's the other thing, the exchanges are tired of getting coins and tokens submitted to them. In some cases, they've turned a deaf ear to new projects because of the volume of new projects. Getting listed is all about building community support and community interest. It takes a community to get things going to get listed on an exchange. Post in their forums, open a support ticket, join their slack, tweet back to them, and ask them to add rustbits. I continue to follow up weekly with the exchanges, persistence and perseverance is key.  I am working towards getting rustbits on an exchange as a goal for the project.  I've also posted a similar response here a few times and have talked about it on slack as well. To suggest that you haven't heard from me on this is not true.

The best way to deal with this is to just send sufficient BTC into your wallet address to cover as many TXs as you plan on executing in the near future. That way you won´t be getting those notices telling you that you don´t have sufficient BTC to place an order or send a card somewhere. Also it helps to time your TXs according to the mempool saturation level. I just sent out a bunch of transactions this morning with 3 to 6 sat/byte custom fee and they were confirmed in the next block.

What have you done so far to help get rustbits listed? I can tell you from experience working with several other Counterparty and Ethereum projects that it doesn´t work like you may imagine, i.e. dev contacts the exchange of their choice, tells them ""shut up and take my money"" and they will list your token. We first need to build awareness about this project, get some exposure in the crypto news media, and start building some serious trading volume on the DEX before exchanges will even start considering a listing. Just sitting around making accusations of ""dragging for listing"" doesn´t do anything to help move ahead.

We expect that soon also trading will open on the indiesquare Book of Orbs mobile app, which should help at least to make card trading easy. Also you should be able to trade on the DEX using Indiesquare mobile app already, i.e. trade rustbits for XCP. Once there is some volume this will bring the attention of exchanges that already have other XCP assets listed, such as Tux Exchange, Zaif, bittrex. I think it is not worth putting any effort in trying to get listed on any exchanges that don´t have any counterparty assets yet already, as it is not currently trivial to support counterparty for them. This should change fairly soon when a new CIP under development by counterparty devs comes out that will address these issues. I suggest everyone contribute to promote rustbits and the game on social media channels, retweet @SpacePirate_io tweets and comment to exchanges that you want to have rustbits listed.

Book of Orbs listing is expected soon (this will make trading of the upcoming cards on the DEX much easier). Once Rustbits trading on the DEX estabishes significant volume, bigger exchanges are more likely to become interested in listing the token. Having a new token listed is not something you can just do by calling up an exchange and telling them to list the token. The exchanges all have specific criteria to list new tokens. In case of Counterparty tokens like Rustbits, getting listed would be a lot easier if we concentrate on exchanges that already have other Counterparty tokens listed, as providing support for them is non-trivial for exchanges, at least until some of the upcoming CIPs are implemented that will make Counterparty more easy to handle and implement for exchanges. That being said, some exchange let users vote for getting new coins listed. We can all do our parts by upvoting Rustbits on our favorite exchanges.",False

Rustbits are assets/tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain using counterparty.  There's an ecosystem of counterparty games being developed, specifically around trading card games, and those are on the Bitcoin blockchain using counterparty. SoG cards and BCY are on the same ""network"" as Rustbits and our cards, so technically, they could be used in the same game.   For games to support gamecredits natively, game developers have to code their games to talk to a gamecredit wallet/node for transactions, there's additional cost and abstraction layer needed to support it to run a node for it. On the counterparty/bitcoin system, I can easily support any token (SoG, on counterparty without having to run an additional wallet or node for it.  As an example, our Age of Rust game could support Spells of Genesis cards and Pepe Cash without having to run a wallet for each of those because they're counterparty assets. However, if the game wanted to support Gamecredits and Ethereum, we would have to run wallets/nodes for each of those cryptocurrencies.",False

They actively participate in the Rare Pepe Traders telegram group too. They even have a bot to get the current price of pepecash and other tokens listed on tuxexchange shown in telegram groups. Another community that has been a great fans of counterparty assets and trading cards is the Japanese bitcoin community. Thanks to Book of Orbs mobile app made by Indiesquare (their founder is based in Japan), cards can easily be traded on the DEX without having to use the somewhat clunky counterwallet interface.    Also japanese exchange zaif.jp has a lot of counterparty assets that even can be traded for fiat (Yen) on that exchange. They were first to list Pepecash also, followed by tuxexchange. So if Rustbits starts getting some traction on the Counterparty DEX first trading against XCP, exchanges will start to notice and be more interested in listing. That is how Pepecash first got started, their great fan community do a lot of trading on the DEX.  Another great help with that is having rarepepewallet.com where you can actually buy the Rare Pepe cards for Pepecash or XCP from right inside the wallet, and at the same time be protected against accidentally buying scam assets with names very similar to the real game assets, as the wallet only lists the true certified Rare Pepe cards from rarepepedirectory.com in the wallet under ""my rare pepes"". I think it would be great if you could use some of the dev funds to commission someone (preferrably Joe Looney who made rare pepe wallet) to make a Rustbits themed special wallet for the Age of Rust cards so players can store and trade their cards easily on the DEX, and also easily discover new cards when they get released. If you can get Age of Rust cards listed on Book of Orbs that would be a great way to get a bigger audience for the game too.",False

We released SP: Age of Rust as an alpha test in April 2017 with about 20 puzzles and 2 bitcoin prizes in the game.  The game ran using bitcoin testnet coins for some basic game elements including purchasing hints to solve puzzles and buying weapons. The prologue of the game runs about 80 hours to solve the majority of the puzzles. That being said, many of the players   Prologue changed to an Introduction The prologue in beta has gone through a major overhaul. There will be a visual tutorial to play through the first puzzle with a voice narration and introduction. The introduction prologue is far shorter, the complicated puzzles have been replaced by a much easier this-than-that approach to scale up players that have never played an adventure game before. This will address the ""how do I play?"" aspects of starting the game.  Navigation This was a big request from players, moving in the game can be done in the traditional ""dungeon crawler"" sense with keys for directions (n,s,e,w,u,d) for moving in the game.  Updated commands General game commands will no longer require the ""/"" in the beta release, so to look around, ""/look"" will become ""look"". Many players would leave out the ""/"" causing some confusion and difficulty. System commands for the interacting with other players, will retain the ""/"", such as ""/seen""  Currency The in-game traditional currency will continue to be free, this is something that the players wanted to see. Right now, the game currency is bitcoin/testnet and this will shift in beta to simply 'credits' and will be free to acquire in the game (ie kill a bad guy, get credits). The free currency will be used for things that player need, like a weapon, armor, buying health kits, etc. There will also be a premium currency in the game as well, this will be for things that players want to enhance the game experience. Rustbits will also be used to purchase game cards that are used in the game as well as other things like hints to some puzzles.  Game cards Rustchain cards are bitcoin blockchain tokens (via counterparty) that players use in the game. Players don't have to transfer your cards to the game, they just verify their wallet and the game can tell which cards and how many cards players have. These cards give players the ability to enhance their character (add bonuses like additional health, armor, damage, etc) and also grant access to special areas in the game. For example, if players have the ""Keplar Canyon"" card in their counterparty wallet, it will allow players visit Keplar Canyon in the game. Quantity of cards will also unlock and give game modifiers too; as an example, if a player has qty 10 of the ""MD100 Pulse Rifle"" card, an additional 10 damage would be applied.  Rewards and Prizes In the alpha version, when a puzzle with a bitcoin reward was claimed, that was it. In the beta version, if someone solves a puzzle with a crypto reward, the reward will refill over time and the puzzle solution will change. The rewards will be very much like how free parking is sometimes used in monopoly, where game funds pool up waiting for a winner. As players purchase hints and game packs, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will fill up waiting for players to solve the puzzle and claim the prize. When players purchase game cards, a percentage of that purchase will go back into the game towards rewards and other prizes in the game.  Sounds and narration Environment sounds and narration will be in the beta release. If players are in a desert environment, they will hear the wind when inspecting the area. When NPC's are interacting with players, the voice will narrate over the text. Sound helps sets the mood for the setting players are in and enhances the game.  Character stats Character stats will show up in profile information replacing the tab ""social media"". This will display the important information about your character (health, armor, etc). The beta version will also introduce the leveling capabilities and upgrade options for characters.",False

Shapeshift automatically exchanged any coin in the game, like dash, into bitcoin without the need for players to go to an exchange. After talking to players and looking at other cryptocurrency games, most players preferred a game currency without any real-world value. However, they still wanted rewards with real-world value plus the ability to use those rewards to upgrade or provide advantages in the game. Other games have had this same issue too, so Spells of Genesis is a good example. They have ""gold"" in the game which only has in-game value, but you can still use cryptocurrency (in their case bitcrystals) to buy upgrades in the game.  With our game, Rustbits is the premium currency and tokens have several uses in the game:  Hints to premium puzzles - There are premium cryptocurrency backed puzzles in the game (in the form of rustbits, bitcoin, and ethereum). The alpha version had 0.2 btc in a few difficult to solve puzzles where players had to gather clues to win the reward. Players will be able to use Rustbits to buy hints to the premium puzzles.  Purchase blockchain cards - While some cards can be won in the game, other cards can be exchanged for rustbits to unlock player capabilities or special items in the game.  Token controlled access (TCA) - Those holding rustbits in their wallets (no need to transfer them to the game) will get bonus multipliers in several areas. You can get bonuses in experience, additional turns per day, and higher amounts of cryptocurrency prize rewards are some examples.  Some areas in the game can only be accessed by players that have rustbits in their out-of-game wallets.  Future expansion and other games - As the game world expands, rustbits will be used for other game enhancing features and activities. Other games we develop later on with incorporate rustbits into them.  During the token sale, people will be able to use over 40 different cryptocurrencies to get rustbits using shapeshift too. After the token sale, players can get them on the counterparty DEX exchange, win them in the game, etc.",False

There's a couple of reason for sticking with counterparty, the first is that working with Solidity (the language for Ethereum contracts) to manage tokens is still very, very rough, and very difficult to work with programmaticly. It's almost 100 lines of complex code to issue a token in Solidity/Eth whereas in Counterparty, it's about 6 lines of code. In fact, on the Ethereum page itself, it says ""The token contract is quite complex"".  I can appreciate that, Vitalik is a very smart guy, but it's not path I can really take at this point with the game development.  There are also some known issues with using Eth tokens that came to light with the Golem project that allows tokens to be transferred with a modified private key.  So for compatibility and low-risk, we're sticking with counterparty as the platform of choice for now. This is the same system that Book of Orbs, Spells of Genesis, Age of Chains, and Rarepepe uses.  This also allows us to work with those cards as well in the game if we want to adopt them into the gameplay.   The thing is that cards can be left in your counterparty wallet and you can use them in the game, so you don't have to transfer them to the game wallet to use your cards in game.  Rustbits themselves are used to buy the cards, so you won't be using the rustbits to buy a weapon in the game.  You can earn rustbits in the game and use them off-chain, or move them to your counterparty wallet later if you want.  So the use case for Storj is quite a bit different since that's only currency they will work on. I hope that explains a little more in the direction of the game and why we're using counterparty and not ethereum tokens",False

Will you be able to buy rustbits with Ethereum? Yes (via shapeshift.io) when the token goes on sale on May 22nd.  The tokens are Counterparty tokens which uses the Bitcoin blockchain for managing assets and tokens. This is the same system that Book of Orbs, Spells of Genesis, Age of Chains, and Rarepepe uses.  This also allows us to work with those cards as well in the game if we want to adopt them into the gameplay.    Why not Eth tokens? The tokens themselves are not Ethereum ERC20 tokens. There's a couple of reason for this, the first is that working with Solidity (the language for Ethereum contracts) to manage tokens is still very, very rough, and very difficult to work with programmaticly. There are some known issues with using Eth tokens that came to light with the Golem project that allows tokens to be transferred with a modified private key.  So for compatibility and low-risk, we're sticking with counterparty as the platform of choice for now.",False

I'll check it out though more in detail.  Yeah Tele Arena is great, there were many games that had similar functionality, too many great ones to name  So first, I know this game heavily resonates with a crypto aware gaming crowd. For me to suggest otherwise would be disingenuous, that being said, there is a community out there that likes these games but don't travel in cryptocurrency circles.  It was just to expose the project and cryptocurrency to a wider audience. It wasn't meant as a snub to the crypo community at all. I was concerned that a few people would see it that way, but I saw it as a way to build to bridge. I know it's viewed as a bit of a faux pas, but my history of supporting crypto and the crypto community is an honest one. My intent is to stay true to the bitcoin community and help support other communities too. I also built and ran bitcoinstarter (a kickstarter clone based on bitcoin) for a period of time, so I understand where you are coming from.

However, the initial set of cards will only be sold for a limited time, and any cards that are not sold during that period would be burned afterwards as planned.

Video Link: (will redirect you to youtube)   That sounds awesome, tell me more...  As is, the game is already 60% complete and by looking at our timeline (down below), you can see what's already been completed. We are working on more content (missions, graphics, voices) to round out the first chapter of the game. Earlier last year, we posted some information about the game and received some attention from social media on Steemit. The excitement about the game drew people in and follow along. People reached out and let us know they wanted to have an ""old school"" adventure campaign to play.    The prologue, is a small playable demo, which is really more of a pre-alpha release of SpacePirate. Keep in mind, doesn't have full functionality yet, but it's meant to tell a small story leading up to the events of where things start in the full release of the game. The prologue opened in April 2017 and already has more then 100 people playing the game. There are a few areas to explore and some puzzles to solve as well, plus a little bit of combat thrown in for good measure. I wanted to give people something to explore, and a mystery to solve while the rest of the game is in development. A few players have finished the prologue in about 100 hours of game-play.  You can sign-in and play the demo by visiting our site:https://spacepirate.io.    ""I believe the adventure game genre will never die any more than any type of storytelling would ever die"" - Roberta Williams (Sierra Games)  Why build a game like this? Like others, we grew up playing adventure and rogue-like games on the Commodore and later on desktop computers. These games captivated the imagination and got me interested in playing games online with other people. Playing games like The Pawn™,  Zork™ and The Hobbit™ and then reading books (Remember Choose Your Own Adventure™?) got us interested in science fiction and games. We really enjoyed playing multiplayer games like MajorMUD™, Kyrandia™ and Tradewars 2002™ too. Those games changed everything, because you played with others, you developed a camaraderie with other players in a close community that often continued for years. Recently, I found that people were still playing these games, but wanted more. They wanted to go on new adventures, and make new friends.   SpacePirate: Age of Rust is a dark sci-fi role playing adventure game in an intergalactic dystopian universe. It features turn-based combat against both game enemies and other players. It also plays like a dice-based D&D style game that you play with other people. Make no mistake, at its heart is an adventure and a mystery that rewards players with hidden treasures. The SpacePirate universe is an open game, a place where you can be as good or as evil as you want to be. You can seek lost treasures and solve puzzles, build a base to defend with other players or betray them and take over their empire, place a bounty on their ships or claim another bounty for your own personal gain, or wander around the universe and help other players.  The game takes place in the distant future (~2500 years from now) where space travel is common. There's exoplanet mining, colonies, privateers, rogue mechs, and bounty hunters. A lot of the technology has failed and is no longer well understood due to a large pandemic that all but nearly wiped out humanity. As a result, advancements in technology, science, and culture stopped, the ""Age of Rust"" is where things are now breaking down, in what is now ""present day"" in the game. There are dozens of colony ships in space that have tens of thousands of people on them that have been in a hibernation state for over a 1000 years. Some wake up and realize that things are worse now then from before they went into hibernation. Not everyone wakes up, some are dead as systems failed. Humanity is trying to get a new foothold and rebuild society, but there's quite a bit of lawlessness to contend with.   Fight or Explore...    Point your MD100 autorifle at a mech that's hell bent on tearing you apart, launch deadly missiles at your sworn enemies' spaceship to blow them out of the galaxy, or send drones into combat to weaken the defenses of another player's base. Fighting and combat within SpacePirate is turn-based, the roll of a dice determines who goes first, how much damage you do to them or them to you, and if you live or die. You can read more about how we make combat fair to ensure there's no cheating as we are using a provably fair system for dice rolls on combat and other gameplay.   There may also be times where you just want to explore and not get into it with another player or just avoid spending your days blowing apart artificial intelligence mechanical androids (mechs). Not a problem, within the game there's a dark storyline with puzzles to solve and a mystery to uncover. There are abandoned ships, lost mines, hidden space stations, and secret bases to go exploring in. Clues and puzzles are woven directly into the game, which you can share and work on with others or keep to yourself and explore alone.    Lost Treasures...  Another aspect to the game that I wanted to build in was a bit of a treasure hunt.  The thought of going on a treasure hunt and solving a mystery was often a lure that led me to other interesting works and projects. So for example, reading the book Ready Player One or reading about the Forrest Fenn treasure inspired me to create a game where some of those things were possible. I wanted to include a mystery and hidden treasures into the game for players to find and solve. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were also the perfect way for doing something like that; no need to pack a bag and go half way around the world. So the concept of hiding something within the context and narrative of the game was important. I didn't just want to build a ""hack and slash"" only game; while combat is still in there, the ability to explore and seek a treasure without combat was an interesting concept to me that is built into the game.   WELCOME TO THE YEAR 4429 Prepare to wake up in a future where intergalactic warfare, piracy, bounty hunting, rogue artificial intelligence, and the decline of human civilization is your reality.  RPG CHARACTER ATTRIBUTES - There are 13 character abilities such as IQ, Physical Strength, and Endurance which play a part in the game. These attributes help to decide if your character will be successful in an event or fight. For example, let's say your character has a strength of 8 and someone blows the airlock and you have to hang on for your life, the game rolls a number against your 8 to see if you make it. You also have hit points and your armor has points which decrease if you are hit in the game or increase as you level up or upgrade.   NOT A “PAY TO WIN” GAME - Luck, brains, and experience is the only true way to survive in the 43rd century. While some upgrades can ease the suffering, it can’t win the game for you. The game is not designed to force you to buy things in order to continue. You can buy some cool and fun things in the game, but they're not required to win. You have to use strategy to outplay others skill to solve puzzles. You can't buy the solutions to the puzzles, and those you have to figure out yourself.   MULTIPLAYER - Battling rogue AI, solving puzzles, and collecting bounties is hard work. You can play on your own or with others to cooperate or player vs. player combat. You can also form alliances together to take on other players. Like everything else in the game, it's optional, you can play solo and go off the grid lone-wolf style.  CRYPTOCURENCY INTEGRATION -  You don't need to buy any bitcoin, RUSTBITS, or the RUSTCHAIN cards to play SpacePirate. Rather the opposite, you might end up getting these as rewards for solving puzzles or completing actions in the game. Want to upgrade your weapon in the game and have cryptocurrency? Yes, you can do that in SpacePirate. The game also accepts 20+ other cryptocurrencies (Ethereum, Litecoin, etc) via ShapeShift.io.  TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION - Protect your online account and withdrawals from unauthorized persons via two-factor authentication from Authy. Two-Factor Authentication is a very secure way to protect your online accounts. It works by requiring you to identify yourself using two different things when you log-in to a site. The second factor is tied to something 'you have' (like a cellphone). So you can think of two-factor as something you know (your password) + something you have (your cellphone). Authy makes it really easy to use Two-Factor Authentication on your online accounts using your smartphone. They provide you an App that makes it easy for you to keep all your tokens and ""just"" works for a strong authentication.  MOBILE SUPPORT - SpacePirate can be played on mobile devices with WiFi support or with a 4G/LTE connection on the browser on your device. Mobile phones and tablet support may vary but have been tested on Apple devices.   FULL CHAT EXPERIENCE - Extensive chat options including private messages, the ability to ignore other players or add them to your friends list. Want to reward a fellow player who's helped you out? You can tip them with Bitcoin in the chatroom or reward an entire chatroom. The chatroom and the game experience are integrated to allow players to casually play and chat.   BLOCKCHAIN TOKEN CARDS  - RustChain Cards offer players the ability to collect, trade, and use cards in the game. These cards will also be on the blockchain as a limited series of digital tokens to trade outside the game. Cards can used in the game to award players special items and capabilities in the game. An example would be +1 to attack and +10 to armor or an in-game item such as an elite class of ship. Some cards will available for free in the game as rewards for solving puzzles or other achievements.   The worthy GM never purposely kills players' PCs, He presents opportunities for the rash and unthinking players to do that all on their own.. -Gary Gygax   Some the of the reasons why you will want to play SpacePirate: Age of Rust    Strategy, role-playing, and adventure   You barter your way into a VK-99F starfighter, jump into your flight suit, and set off to build your own outpost on the edge of the known universe. You upgrade the weaponry, shields, and beginning the mining operations on the asteroid belt. Everything was going to plan until someone unknowingly flew right into your trap, set off a dozen mines and found themselves stranded on your doorstep. They want to surrender, so you....?    Maybe you are scavenging on an abandoned colony ship that has been drifting aimlessly in the cosmos. You come across an AI-enabled mech is trying to defend the ship against your hostile invasion. You roll a 20 and it rolls a 4, your blaster melts a hole through its head and it slumps to the ground. Another steps out from the shadows, you fire your blaster again and roll a 1.   Or you're on a desolate planet, deep in the bowels of an ancient freighter that crash landed eons ago. You connect an ion pulse generator to the computer bank and a terminal lights up, you find the first officer's log where he talks about encoding the cache of bitcoins before an armed boarding party forced their way onto the ship. He mentions the first part of the unlocking code. You scribble it down on your notepad and look up at the clock, it's 3am. The log continues, it talks about an engineer who had escaped the boarding party with another code. You see a log where a lifepod had launched towards the Egrin system. You smile and wonder how long it will take you to find where the lifpod ended up.   A good portion of the game is already complete, you can see below what's already completed. Development started last year, but it's only in the last few months where the game really started to take shape from multiple development threads.   Ship's Crew Roster   We hope that you will see the story we are trying to tell, what we are trying to do, and that it resonates with something that you remember. The games we remember playing are ones that we were emotionally invested in, the games we remember playing all night and thinking about how to get to the next stage all the next day. Those games had something special and that's why I made this game, something to draw you into a new universe, a new story, something... special.",False
