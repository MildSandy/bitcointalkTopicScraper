The story of a Quantor community member.  So today I would like to share with you a story of a very very successful year of a miner and a very successful year as an investor.  https://i.imgur.com/44SIynH.png  It all started at the beginning of 2015 when I realised everyone around me was talking about this new amazing gig called bitcoin and later as crypto currencies. At first I was very enthusiastic but as soon as I delved deeper into these concepts I was quite honestly disappointed‚Ä¶ the hype did not live up to my expectations as I heard that this bitcoin thing will disrupt every industry and it will only be a matter of time before everyone owns, wants and uses one.  My other disappointment with crypto was bitcoin‚Äôs lack of physical foundation and the growing transaction costs. Later on the problem of scalability also arose in my mind because blockchain continues to grow infinitely. After a long debate I nonetheless, decided to give it a try, but not to buy tokens or crypto itself it was to mine it so, I decided to invest in computers and graphic cards.  I started with mining ETC (Ethereum). Not only I had learned a lot in the process I also realised that it was still the right time for me to get into crypto, hence it was the right decision however, a question arose. What to do with the money (crypto) I now had, which was worth a lot. I decided that trading would be the best option. My experience with bittrex to say the least wasn‚Äôt the best, my accounts kept getting frozen, deleted, suspended and flagged. I therefore decided to go for another trading platform Binance (which in my opinion is the best). The only thing I didn‚Äôt like was that my trading experience and portfolio management strategy weren‚Äôt quite cutting it, I was gaining sometimes, but I was losing just as much in both BTC and USD value.  https://i.imgur.com/JajECEq.png  One late afternoon after speaking to one of my pioneer friends who got into bitcoin in 2011 told me about the company called Quantor. An algorithmic trading platform and marketplace that is currently undergoing its token-sale, but is also testing prototypes, which after successful tests become profitable trading algorithms. And so I again decided to go ahead and contacted the project to understand the potential benefits and rewards of algorithmic trading based on blockchain.  After a few months of testing I can surely say that Quantor is not only an amazing project which has all of the possibilities to be the best, even now in the early stage of development the platform is able to do more than some ICOs after 2 years after the completion. Full alpha version of trading. The results of trading algorithms are stored in Ethereum blockchain. Full support. Amazing community. Not only great goals set, but great goals achieved! Thank you Quantor and let‚Äôs prosper together.  www.tokens.quantor.co",False

Using mathematics, s/he turns the intuition into a mathematical trading model for analysis, backtesting, and refinement. When the quantitative investment model proves to be likely profitable after passing rigorous statistical tests, the portfolio manager implements the model on a computer system for automatic execution. In short, quantitative investment is the process where ideas are turned into mathematical models and then coded into computer programs for systematic trading. https://quantor.co/courses/introduction-to-quantitative-investment/",False

Chan Dr. Ernest P. Chan is the Managing Member of QTS Capital Management, LLC. His career since 1994 has been focusing on the development of statistical models and advanced computer algorithms to find patterns and trends in large quantities of data. He has applied his expertise in statistical pattern recognition to projects ranging from textual retrieval at IBM Research, mining customer relationship data at Morgan Stanley, and statistical arbitrage trading strategy research at Credit Suisse, Mapleridge Capital Management, and other hedge funds.  While at the Human Language Technologies group at IBM T. J. Watson Research Center (Yorktown Heights, NY), Dr. Chan spearheaded IBM‚Äôs research effort to develop a system for searching large text databases such as the World Wide Web, catapulting IBM‚Äôs reputation as a top player in the field. His system was placed seventh among some forty competitors in a competition sponsored by the National Institute of Science and Technology and the Department of Defense in 1996. At the Data Mining group in Morgan Stanley‚Äôs headquarter in New York, Ernie pioneered the application of some of these sophisticated statistical algorithms to the complex task of extracting customer relationships in the Morgan Stanley customer accounts database.  Ernie was invited to join a proprietary trading group at Credit Suisse in New York in 1998 to develop statistical models for equities and futures trading. He later joined Mapleridge Capital Management Corp. in 2002 as a Senior Quantitative Analyst working on futures trading strategies, and then Maple Financial in 2003 as a senior researcher and trader.  Ernie writes the Quantitative Trading blog and was quoted by the New York Times, Forbes, and the CIO magazine, and interviewed on CNBC‚Äôs Closing Bell program, Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities magazine, Securities Industry News, Automated Trader magazine, and the CFA Institute Magazine on topics related to quantitative trading. In recognition of his expertise in statistical data mining, he was invited to serve on the Program Committees of the International Conference of Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining in 1998. He was an invited speaker at the Automated Trading conference in London, UK, in October 2009, the Market Technicians Association Toronto Annual Conference in 2010, the Quant Invest Canada conference in 2012, and QuantCon in New York in 2015-17.

If the coin shows tails, you lose $100. If the coin shows heads, you win $110. Is this gamble attractive? Would you accept it?""  (I have modified the numbers to be more realistic in a financial market setting, but otherwise it is a direct quote.)  Experiments show that most people would not accept this gamble, even though the expected gain is $5. This is the so-called ""loss aversion"" behavioral bias, and is considered irrational. Kahneman went on to write that ""professional risk takers"" (read ""traders"") are more willing to act rationally and accept this gamble.  It turns out that the loss averse ""layman"" is the one acting rationally here.  It is true that if we have infinite capital, and can play infinitely many rounds of this game simultaneously, we should expect $5 gain per round. But trading isn't like that. We are dealt one coin at a time, and if we suffer a string of losses, our capital will be depleted and we will be in debtor prison if we keep playing. The proper way to evaluate whether this game is attractive is to evaluate the expected compound rate of growth of our capital.  Let's say we are starting with a capital of $1,000. The expected return of playing this game once is initially 0.005. The standard deviation of the return is 0.105. To simplify matters, let's say we are allowed to adjust the payoff of each round so we have the same expected return and standard deviation of return each round. For e.g. if at some point we earned so much that we doubled our capital to $2,000, we are allowed to win $220 or lose $200 per round. What is the expected growth rate of our capital? According to standard stochastic calculus, in the continuous approximation it is -0.0005125 per round - we are losing, not gaining! The layman is right to refuse this gamble.  Loss aversion, in the context of a risky game played repeatedly, is rational, and not a behavioral bias. Our primitive, primate instinct grasped a truth that behavioral economists cannot. It only seems like a behavioral bias if we take an ""ensemble view"" (i.e. allowed infinite capital to play many rounds of this game simultaneously), instead of a ""time series view"" (i.e. allowed only finite capital to play many rounds of this game in sequence, provided we don't go broke at some point). The time series view is the one relevant to all traders. In other words, take time average, not ensemble average, when evaluating real-world risks.  The important difference between ensemble average and time average has been raised in this paper by Ole Peters and Murray Gell-Mann (another Nobel laureate like Kahneman.) It deserves to be much more widely read in the behavioral economics community. But beyond academic interest, there is a practical importance in emphasizing that loss aversion is rational. As traders, we should not only focus on average returns: risks can depress compound returns severely.   Original source: Read the original article on Dr. Ernest Chan‚Äôs blog here",False
