These currencies provide a 1:1 allocation of physical bullion, and the transaction fees accumulated whenever the currencies are sent, spent or traded are proportionately redistributed to Kinesis currency and token holders, incentivising use.   Holders of the Kinesis Velocity Tokens (KVT), currently being offered in an Initial Token Offering, receive the highest share, being 20 percent of the proportionate share of these fees.  MBAex are torchbearers for good governance within the industry, being fully compliant with anti-money laundering laws. Additionally, by integrating best practice from the banking industry, MBAex applies a variety of measures to ensure security. This includes industry principles including two-factor authentication, cool stockpiling and tracking to ensure end-to-end security in transactions. By listing the Kinesis digital currencies on their exchange, MBAex will engage participants looking for options which are both stable and secure.  MBAex also combines the concept of forex brokerage with blockchain asset trading; a powerful combination to encourage a rise in transaction and trading volumes of Kinesis digital currencies. This will allow Kinesis Money to cement its place in Southeast Asia and build on this solid foundation for enhanced global access.  Sebastian-Ionut Diaconu, Chief Executive Officer at MBAexcomments: “MBAex is pleased to announce this MOU, with the aim of delivering a superior stablecoin offering to our client base.  The new Kinesis currencies, KAU and KAG, are representative of physical gold and silver and can even be redeemed as such. With delivery locations for the underlying precious metals behind the Kinesis currencies including Singapore and Hong Kong, we see a great value-add for our clients.  We are also pleased to be discussing with Kinesis the listing of the KVT on MBAex. We see the big potential of the Kinesis currencies and the KVT gives our traders the opportunity to participate in the success of these.  Ryan Case, Chief Commercial Officer at Kinesis Money comments: “The Kinesis digital currencies, KAU and KAG, provide audited, liquid and secure stablecoins, with real-world utility, for traders on the MBAex exchange. This partnership opens up the Kinesis digital currencies to a large pool of new participants, amplifying our access to global markets and showing the continuing interest in and adoption of our currencies.  Bryan Feinberg, CEO & Founder of Etheralabs comments: “we are thrilled to be part of the both the structuring and execution of this partnership as it represents deep value for both companies and the communities each represents.

Noble Bank is trying to keep afloat and has been frantically searching for funding, according to two highly placed sources, including one at a large cryptocurrency exchange. The bank, with a large chunk of assets coming from Tether’s U.S. dollars, is said to have reached out to at least one large holder of the “stablecoin” in hopes of getting a cash lifeline, but the solicitation was rejected. The source would not elaborate on the size of the request.  Tether Watch“If Noble doesn’t get cash soon, they will only have a few days left,” said one source familiar with the matter to Modern Consensus. “They’re desperate.”  [We reached out to Noble Bank for comment but have yet to hear back. Check here again for updates.]  Meanwhile, Tether itself may be having troubles of its own. A top person at a major trading crypto desk has told Modern Consensus that one counterparty has been trying to unload “tens of millions of tethers” without successfully finding a counterparty. Read more here: https://modernconsensus.com/cryptocurrencies/tether/noble-funding-cash-tether/   As a benchmark, we have taken the cryptocurrency backed by USD, Tether, and looked at their velocity rates and then dramatically decreased them in our assumptions to remain conservative. Tether’s velocity stays high for one main reason, they provide a stable price that can be used by cryptocurrency users to liquidate volatile cryptocurrencies and hold a relatively stable one. Their model has been a success and their velocity is higher than any other cryptocurrencies.  Between 1 December 2017 to 17 January 2018 their velocity rate averaged at 199% per day. Backed up by solid argument and evidence, it is our strong conviction that the Kinesis currency suite offers a far superior substitute to Tether.  While Tether offers price stability for cryptocurrency users, they present no certainty with redemptions and have a product that is beholden to the fractional banking system that has proven for them to be laden with multiple layers of counterparty risk. In contrast, Kinesis offers similar or better price stability and tremendous liquidity provided by bullion industry participants.  These features mitigate counterparty risk (bullion and cash vaulted) and provide much greater incentive to trade, use, and attract capital.

LONDON, Nov. 13, 2018 /CNW/ - Today, Jakarta Futures Exchange (JFX), the leading futures and derivatives exchange group in Indonesia, have announced an expanded Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Kinesis Money and Allocated Bullion Exchange (ABX). The partnership will seek to develop an Indonesian based and regulated blockchain exchange using Kinesis technology.  Together, Kinesis and ABX have developed an evolutionary monetary system using real assets (gold and silver) as the basis for digital currencies. These currencies are transacted on the Kinesis Blockchain Exchange, a fork of the Stellar Network which is able to handle more than 3000 transactions per second. The system is also integrated with mobile banking and fiat currency exchange services.  ABX, the world's leading electronic institutional exchange for physical precious metals, has been working with JFX to expand gold investment opportunities in Indonesia. JFX is a leading exchange for gold futures contracts, and is now launching a spot physical Sharia Gold Contract, in partnership with ABX, having been granted approval by Indonesian regulators and the Indonesian National Shariah Board.  A blockchain exchange version of gold-based currencies, through collaboration with Kinesis and ABX, is a natural extension of the JFX and Indonesian government vision.  The expanded partnership between JFX, Kinesis and ABX envisions an Indonesian blockchain exchange based on the technical advances of the Kinesis Blockchain Exchange.  This partnership is part of JFX's future intention to create blockchain-based solutions in addition to existing infrastructure, allowing investors alternatives, in which to benefit from an increased ease, speed and security of transactions. The future development of this partnership propels institutional acceptance of blockchain technology, through the sharing of concepts, business models and technology solutions.  Stephanus Paulus Lumintang, President Director, Jakarta Futures Exchange, comments: ""JFX is committed to providing the best solutions and services in the futures and derivatives industry.  It's increasingly become clear to us that the benefits of distributed ledge technology, or 'blockchain' will unlock tremendous amounts of value for Indonesia and Indonesian people.  ""Blockchain regulation in Indonesia is currently in progress, and it is quite an important, yet difficult task. However, JFX is ready to be a blockchain exchange company in Indonesia, in compliance with any legal and regulatory requirements.""  ""Our future partnership with Kinesis and ABX will enable us to not only tap into these advantages but to create a secure and transparent blockchain network that provides a credible alternative to existing systems of exchange.""  Thomas Coughlin, CEO Kinesis; CEO ABX, comments: ""The bespoke blockchain network that we developed creates a complete monetary system which enables real, physical assets to be transacted and exchanged digitally, at speed and at low cost. We believe that the integration of physical precious metals and distributed ledger technology offers tremendous value to the Indonesian market, with its dual interest in gold and in blockchain. We look forward to continuing our partnership with JFX to bring this to fruition.""

The end date for the KVT public sale and the dates surrounding the Kinesis Currencies ICO have been amended. As Kinesis starts to pick up serious momentum, we have reviewed these dates and made some adjustments in order maximise value and extend the investment opportunity for the wider community and partners involved in the project.  We still intend to release a Beta version for user testing according to schedule, March 18th, 2019.  This will allow for user acceptance testing during the KAU and KAG ICO presale period before we officially launch the public ICO on May 15th, 2019.   With this in mind, we have revised the Kinesis Velocity Token public sale time-frames based around the following three key factors;  1. Currently KVT sales are continuing at a steady rate. Closing the token sale with the current momentum is counterproductive to the level of success that the Kinesis Monetary System could achieve with an extended timeline.  2. In line with the point above, the imminent release of a MVP Kinesis blockchain wallet allows for our teams to have more advanced and detailed conversation with interested parties.  3. As we will be launching the Kinesis Monetary System in mid-March for Beta testing, unless we sell out before this date, it makes sense to keep the token sale running right up until we launch the ICO presale on March 18th, 2019.  The new timelines:  KVT Public Sale ends: 23:59 GMT March 17th, 2019 Kinesis Currency ICO Pre-Sale begins: 00:00 GMT March 18th, 2019 Kinesis Currency ICO Public Sale begins May 15th, 2019 Kind regards,  Thomas Coughlin CEO",False

CSO Eric Maine: Maine is the chief strategy officer at Allocated Bullion Exchange. Soumya Reddy: Reddy has worked as a senior software engineer at SLK for four years, a technology and consulting company.  Partners The Allocated Bullion Exchange: ABX is a gold exchange which allows investors to buy and sell precious metals since 2013. Many Kinesis team members have worked or have been working for ABX.  Verdict Below is a breakdown of the risks and growth potential of Kinesis Velocity Token.  Risks     A hard-cap of $300,000,000 might be justifiable for a project with ambitious goals such as Kinesis, yet together with sequel ICOs planned for the future, the amount raised will be even higher when all is said and done. This might leave less room for token appreciation. (-1.5)  Growth Potential     Due to the mechanism of the buy-back program, token holders’ further possible losses shall be mitigated to some degree. (+1.5)     Distributing 20% of transaction fees to KVT tokens creates a truly great incentive to hold tokens. (+3)     Kinesis is planned to be a whole monetary ecosystem at the end and the team seems capable to deliver. (+2)     Backed by ABX, adoption to a certain degree can be expected. If the distribution of transaction fees goes without any problem, even higher adoption can be expected. (+1.5)  Disposition Central banks hold the right to print money as much as they like which creates devaluation of national currencies. Even if people deposit their money in order to mitigate losses, usually interest rates offered by banks are lower than price inflation. The Kinesis team thinks that this can be solved by a platform backed by traditional stores of value such as gold and silver. Aiming to create a complete monetary ecosystem, the first cryptocurrency the team introduces is Kinetic Velocity Token. The buy-back program and the distribution of transaction fees create huge incentives to hold KVT tokens even in the presence of great price volatility. Still, the investor should note that the platform is looking to raise $300,000,000 which can deter investors planning to participate in the ICO. Kinesis Velocity Token receives a 6.5/10.

The company says it has already attracted interest from key players in the gold industry, which is estimated at $6.8 trillion only on London’s gold market (70 percent of the global trading volume).  After the gold standard that once defined the value of currencies was abandoned in the 20th century, the monetary system became dependent on central banking policies. The Kinesis team decided to create its own “efficient, secure and fair monetary system” based on two of the most stable commodities in the world — gold and silver.  “There is [approximately] $15 trillion in gold traded every year, creating exceptional but untapped potential for investment and exchange if gold can be remonetized. Adding a yield to this exchange multiplies this potential exponentially,” says Thomas Coughlin, CEO of Kinesis.  Kinesis offers digital currencies based 1:1 on allocated physical gold (KAU coins) and silver (KAG coins). When users purchase Kinesis currencies, they actually purchase real metal. The ownership of the gold is digitized with blockchain technology, which allows the user to hold or transfer currency from their Kinesis e-Wallet. The Kinesis debit card allows the owner to make the instant conversion of KAU and KAG into fiat currency and spend cryptocurrency all around the world. The company states that, unlike other cryptocurrencies, the transactions through the Kinesis system will take just two to three seconds as a result of their bespoke fork of the Stellar network, which is able to withstand over 3,000 transactions per second. Kinesis believes KAU and KAG currencies could be used in day-to-day purchases  like buying a cup of coffee or even buying a car. Besides paying the bills, the Kinesis Monetary System can be used for managing international payments with lower transfer rates offered by banks and other international payment services.  Another option offered by the network is the ability to trade holdings on the Kinesis Blockchain Exchange. The cryptocurrencies can be transferred back to physical gold or silver as the system generates a 0.45 percent fee when these are transferred between the holders, accumulating in a pool to be distributed back to users of the system in the form of a yield.  Kinesis was founded by the Allocated Bullion Exchange (ABX), the world’s first electronic, institutional bullion exchange for physical precious metal. Which gave the new blockchain-based fintech company an exceptional start: extensive infrastructure and a fully operational exchange built for the trade and storage of physical bullion in seven locations around the world. The new — but experienced — startup is able to “bring back a truly decentralized, [digitized] stable asset, based on blockchain technology,” Kinesis says.  ITO Launch  Kinesis is currently in the public sale phase of their Initial Token Offering (ITO) of its Velocity Token (KVT), which will be the first cryptocurrency made available by the startup’s team. KVT is a utility token and is not backed by a physical asset but rather a whole monetary system.  With KVT, investors can get a share of the transaction fees generated by the system (maximum 20 percent). This income is distributed to holders of 300,000 KVT, and company promises there will be no future dilution.  According to Kinesis, there is a high demand of its first tokens. Kinesis says it raised over  $50 million just in their presale period by selling over 55,000 KVT.",False

Kinesis says these currencies — known as KAU and KAG — are based one-to one on allocated physical gold and silver. This means that the full, direct title to the bullion backing these coins is held by the person who owns the cryptocurrency. These coins can be loaded on to a debit card and instantly converted into fiat for payments to merchants who accept Visa and Mastercard, and the company says users will also be able to withdraw funds from cash machines.  In explaining its rationale for using gold and silver as the basis for a digital currency, Kinesis described these assets as “two of the greatest stable and definable stores of value for trade and investment.”  A proprietary blockchain network has been developed for Kinesis’s monetary system, which is forked off the Stellar blockchain — and the team behind the platform says its users stand to benefit from “very high” transaction speeds and customizable fees.  Yields for participation  Kinesis says that passive or active users in its ecosystem stand to gain a yield for their participation — and the company has split this into four distinct categories.  The first is known as the Minter Yield. When a user converts their fiat currency or physical bullion holdings into KAU and KAG coins — a transaction that can be completed on the platform’s Primary Market — they receive a five percent share of the transaction fees on the coins they create and use. Users also earn the same share when they make their first deposit into a Kinesis Wallet, and this is known as the Depositors’ Yield.  In a nod to passive participation, the Holder Yield enables owners of KAU or KAG coins to receive a 15 percent share of the transaction fees generated while they hold these currencies. Although this is calculated on a daily basis, the yield is credited to their wallet once per month. Users will also be incentivized to invite new customers to join the Kinesis platform, receiving a Recruiter Yield when someone has been successfully referred.  “An evolutionary step”  Kinesis’s founder, Tom Coughlin, is the chief executive of Allocated Bullion Exchange (ABX) — a company which says it aims to “connect and empower an international network of buyers and sellers by offering direct access to the wholesale bullion market.”  Much of the infrastructure that is going to be used for Kinesis — the technology used for minting silver and gold and storing it in physical vaults — already exists, and the company says it has been successfully used by ABX for a number of years.  Kinesis says it has four target markets in mind for its monetary system. The first is the precious metal market, where it is hoped that investors would become incentivized to use these assets if they had a yield attached to them. The company also hopes to appeal to the cryptocurrency market, and believes KAU and KAG coins could become a solid replacement for “questionably backed and non-yield-bearing coins.”  A presale for the Kinesis Velocity Token, an ERC-20 utility token, is taking place until Sept. 9, with an Initial Token Offering running from Sept. 10 to Nov. 11. The pre-ICO runs from Nov. 12 to Feb. 28, 2019, paving the way for the public Initial Coin Offering to commerce on 1 March 2019.  https://cointelegraph.com/news/platform-to-allow-users-to-spend-metal-based-crypto-using-a-debit-card",False

Purchasing KAU and KAG with USD Kinesis coins in the KAU and KAG currency systems are minted into existence from the Kinesis Currency Exchange or KCX. Kinesis currencies are a representation of physical precious metals which back the cryptocurrency 1:1, ie 1g gold to 1 KAU and 10g Silver to 1 KAG. The existence of the physical precious metal results in the availability of the Kinesis coins themselves.  In the KCX platform a minter is able to purchase a block of the Kinesis coins using USD deposited into their trading account. These Kinesis coins are then emitted into their Kinesis Wallet simultaneously as the equivalent amount of backing precious metal is purchased.     The KCX is an online trading platform modelled on the ABX trading platform called Metaldesk with ABX’s consent. The image shown below is the user interface for the KCX trading platform which requires a deposit of USD into a trading account to enable the purchase of an available block of Kinesis KAU or KAG, and the resulting emission of the coins into the minter’s Kinesis eWallet.  See image of the trading interface in the Kinesis Currency Exchange where blocks of kinesis can be purchased.  On the purchase of a block of Kinesis, an automated process is triggered whereby the kinesis coins are immediately transferred into the minter’s kinesis wallet and the equivalent amount of physical bullion is purchased within the Allocated Bullion Exchange (ABX).  The minter is then free to proceed with any transactions using these recently minted Kinesis coins through use of their Kinesis wallet and the Kinesis suite of applications available.

A link to the video can be found here on our YouTube channel      The Kinesis Currency is a stable/secure, real-asset (gold and silver) based cryptocurrency, which was created to be used for everyday purchases made across the world. How? Since the Kinesis Currency is easily transferable into any fiat currency and due to its stability, it makes it easy for anyone to use their Kinesis Debit Card for common transactions made around the world.   What Problems Does Kinesis Solve?   The evolution of cryptocurrencies has laid bare the time honored debate on what defines the value of money.  After the dissolution of the gold standard, Fiat currency across the world have perpetuated a continuous boom/bust cycle amongst economies.  The issue that cryptocurrencies have failed to address is one of the principal basis for money: an efficient means for transacting commerce.  Kinesis is established to address the two main principles of money:  -   A tool for the exchange of goods and services -   A stored unit of value  Whereas cryptocurrencies have done an extraordinary job of creating stored value, they have not addressed the need for the exchange of goods and services.  This exchange is commonly referred to as “velocity” and is the ultimate arbiter of the long term success of any currency.  The underlying long-term (stored) value of any currency will allow for greater velocity and success.  This is expressed through volatility, which is expressed in the change in value over a period of time of the currency.  If one expects that the value of the currency will appreciate over time, then the opportunity cost of exchanging that currency in some form of transaction is high. If, however, one expects that currency to depreciate over time, then one rapidly exchanges that currency for goods readily, further depleting the value of the currency.  The inherent issue facing the most cryptocurrencies is high volatility and low velocity, thereby classifying them from a currency to an asset.     See our whitepaper for more    How Kinesis Works   The Kinesis Currency is a stable and secure, real-asset (gold and silver) based cryptocurrency, which was created to be used for everyday purchases made across the world. How? Since the Kinesis Currency is easily transferable into any fiat currency and due to its stability, it makes it easy for anyone to use their Kinesis Debit Card for common transactions made around the world.  As a precursor to the Kinesis Currency launch, a separate crypto token was created: the Kinesis Velocity Token (KVT). The KVT is built on the Ethereum network. Holders of the KVT token will be able to earn an ongoing share in the Transaction Fees generated by the Kinesis Currency, and this will determine the Token’s perceived desirability and ultimately its value in the market. Its value is determined, implicitly, through the confidence in the Kinesis monetary system and by virtue of the future expected fees received due to the Kinesis Currency transaction fee; and therefore an increase in the desirability/future expected earnings of the KVT coin (and ultimately an increase in the quantity demanded of it).
