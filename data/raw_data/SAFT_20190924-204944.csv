Co-Founder and CEO Mance Harmon – Harmon also has an Air Force background as former Course Director for Cybersecurity. He was also Program Manager of a large-scale software program for the US Department of Defense’s Missile Defense Agency and senior executive for product security of an unnamed $1.7b revenue organization. President Tom Trowbridge – Trowbridge is President of the Hedera Hashgraph Council and has a strong finance background, having started and ran the New York Office of UK-based Odey Asset Management. He also has held positions at Goldman Sachs, Lombard Odier, Atticus Capital, Bear, Stearns & Co., and telecom and media private equity firm Alta Communications, where he was responsible for 10 deals.  Verdict Below is a breakdown of the risks and growth potential of Hedera Hashgraph.  Risks     Very bold claims but no working product (-1)     High hard cap and initial valuation but other projects that have done well have had the same (though uncommon) (-0.5)     Similar to EOS – bold claims, no working product, lots of hype – except the EOS team probably had a more relevant background (CTO Dan Larimer was behind popular and proven projects like Bitshares and Steemit) (-0.5)  Growth Potential     A lot of hype (e.g. large Meetup community) (+4)     Some DApps have already committed to the platform, and many developers are interested in the platform (e.g. their developer – not general public – Discord channel has nearly 5,000 members as of writing) (+4)  Disposition     Hedera Hashgraph promises to pack quite the punch similar to projects like EOS. The hype is definitely there, but can the team deliver?     Hedera Hashgraph receives a 6/10.",False
