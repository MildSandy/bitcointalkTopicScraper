In the process of optimizing and integrating resources, ONEROOT extends the idea of a shared economy and separates the right to use and the ownership of resources, and proposes the concept of a distributed business engine. With the help of blockchain technology, the co-builders can digitize the right to use resources, including software, hardware, manpower, etc., and establish transparent value exchange and cooperation rules, which greatly improve the resource utilization efficiency. In addition, participants have established a new cooperative relationship based on equal cooperation and common development, which has significant advantages compared with the traditional business model dominated by centralized entities.

Co-build layer / ONEROOT infrastructure:             ONEROOT team has been building the core infrastructure, facilitating co-builders' operation . With the growth of ecosystem, more developers will help with the infrastructure expansion and product diversification.     Consensus layer / ONEROOT protocol:             Consensus among all co-builders is the basis for ONEROOT ecosystem operation and data exchange.  Advantages     Professional and objective                Due diligence and quantitative multi-dimensional rating model make the reports more professional and the rating results more objective and fair.
