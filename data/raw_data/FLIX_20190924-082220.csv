I participated in two airdrop rounds, for the first round I got 166 FLIX. For the second 33 FLIX. They came from different contracts. Now I have two different FLIX tokens.  33 FLIX - 0x56Ce91f6e11D6319275F3a4aBD2eB2B3df853FDD 166 FLIX - 0xaE59D9B13583e86a2EB6710221C1E5AE3dD8C841  I look forward to clarifying the situation. Thank you.   are you sure is not some sort o scam one of them? some people are creating copies of the token  with the same name for all kind of bad purposes...  It's been not a scam, this is from their telegram channel: Hey everyone, we have found a vunerability in the FLIX token sent out for the first and second airdrop so we will re-do the transfers. The third airdrop will receive the new and improved token. Sorry for the inconvenience. We want to provide the best possible token for everyone. Take care, Christian 0x1c3c73fad529932de897ff7ebcf9292f5571ec35 is the CORRECT token address",False

First markets for CryptoFlix Indentified  We are pleased to announce that we have decided upon the location of our first regional HQ as well as the first 12 markets to approach.  We have chosen Singapore as our first regional HQ for CryptoFlix and we are currently in talks with local authorities to secure a soft landing.  We have also chosen 12 markets in Asia, which will be the primary markets for CryptoFlix. These markets have some common denominators:  -   Local films are in high demand -   There is a need for a trustworthy platform for foreign films -   There is a large population of un- or underbanked -   There is a high percentage of internet subscriptions and smart devices per capita  We especially see a huge potential in India and we will introduce CryptoFlix in India as the first or one of the first markets.  The total population of these 12 markets is close to 2.4 billion people:  India   1.354.051.854 Indonesia 266.794.980 Phillippines 106.512.074 Pakistan 200.813.818 Bangladesh 166.368.149 Malaysia 32.042.458 Thailand 69.183.173 Vietnam 96.491.146 Sri Lanka 20.950.041 Cambodia 16.245.729 Laos 6.961.210 Myanmar 53.855.735  Total   2.374.026.638   Local content  As local content has such a strong presence in the markets we have chosen, we are already in talks with local paid content providers and we already have confirmed interest in some markets including Indonesia (Thirteen Entertainment).   How will CryptoFlix reach the un- or underbanked?   There are other ICO's claiming to aim for the unbanked population of the world as customers and users. CryptoFlix are among the first to actually present a solution for getting the tokens out to the users in the underdeveloped countries.  CryptoFlix has entered into a global strategic supply partnership with DZ Cards, a giftcard supplier based in Thailand. The giftcards, which will be denominated in local currency will be sold via retail outlets throughout the markets and the balance of the giftcard, once uploaded on the user account, will be exchanged into FLIX tokens before payment on the CryptoFlix Platform.  We are also working on local distribution partnerships as well as a payment by smartphone plugin.   Timeline   The setup of the regional HQ and the local representatives needed will be done after the ICO has ended.  Thank you once again for your support. You can download our White Paper on our webpage www.cryptoflix.io, where you can also sign up for the early bonus announcement.  The ICO starts on May 15th. Stay tuned!  Hope this helps, Christian",False

Get Cryptos. Repeat.,"Hey everybody,  Once again thanks for your continued support. I have been following your discussions with great interest.  A few remarks:  1. The team is still the same as it was- We have added a few new faces since we started, but the core team is the same and will remain this way.  2. About a second token - We are only doing ONE public token - the FLIX token, which will be used as payment on the CryptoFlix Platform and which can also be used to invest in films on the CryptoFlix Film Market Place.  The way that we see the investment on the Film Market Place, is that the FLIX tokens are vested as a security for the investment and we will then issue an INTERNAL USD pegged token for each project. This is because filmmakers need FIAT to pay for the production and they will likely not take on a further risk of having to pay the term sheet yield in FLIX because of the volatility.  So when the investment recoups the income, the FLIX tokens will be released gradually and at the end there will be a USD pegged yield as projected in the term sheet. Meanwhile the FLIX token holder keeps all his FLIX tokens which will be released 100% when the investment is recouped.  I hope this helps. Keep up your support for the project - not long until the ICO now.  Best and have a great weekend guys,  Christian",False

Get Cryptos. Repeat.,"Hey everyone - Christian here - CEO and Founder of CryptoFlix,  Now that we are 12 days into Q2 I thought it was about time that I provide an update on where we are with our development and roadmap targets.  Since we began the journey towards the ICO we have naturally been very busy. Busy getting the right team together, something which we are still working on. But mostly busy fine tuning the basic concept of the platform and how to deliver the right tokenomics for the contributors and for the content owners and users.  Specifically, we are dealing with bringing a whole new crowd of users, but also content suppliers onto the block chain. This is a major change for many and therefore we are developing bridges between the FIAT world and the CryptoFlix Platform. We will keep communicating the developments to you as they are done. I am pretty sure that you will like what you see.  Here is an update on where we are with our roadmap targets for Q2, 2018:  1.   Content sourcing:  If you read my latest blog post, you know, that we are already working to get content on the CryptoFlix Platform. The content comes in two forms - free educational content and paid content in the form of Movies and TV.  For the free content we have already announced the first University Partnership with The University of Morelia, Mexico. More partnerships are being negotiated.  For the paid content we are already in contact with many content owners in US as well as around the world. So far, the interest for the CryptoFlix Platform has been very good and there are many content owners who have contacted us to get on the platform - amongst these are distributors in our core markets - the underdeveloped countries in Asia and we have confirmed interest in getting large libraries on the platform when we roll it out.  And local content is very important for us - because in the markets we will operate in, the domestic films have a large share of the box office.  Naturally, with 5 million+ titles available throughout the world, we will keep chasing content.  2.   Regional Partnership search  The regional partnerships are very central to our operations. We have already identified the location for our first regional HQ and we have begun talks with the authorities there. We still will need film labs as well as a network of local representatives.  3.   Further Platform Development  The test platform, which is available on our website www.cryptoflix.io, is being updated these days so that it will be possible to access the free content, which has been made available from the University of Morelia through our partnership. We are working on a number of things on the platform, such as:  -   Wallet integration -   Payment systems -   The YourDef software  The central element in the delivery of content, which is the YourDef technology will not be available until the official launch of the platform, but the free content trial mode will provide an insight into the future user experience.  4.   Development Anti-Piracy Tech  The basic idea for the Anti-Piracy Tech was already developed before the announcement of the ICO. We will fine tune the idea and software after the ICO.  5.   Payment solution partnership search  Now payment solutions is something that I have personally spent a lot of time on, because I truthfully think that when we are going to bring hopefully millions of new users into the block chain world, then it needs to be accessible.  We are in discussions with a number of possible partners to fulfil our goals for the payment flows on the platform - from getting access to the FLIX tokens to paying content owners.  We will shortly be announcing our payment solution as a part of the tokenomics of CryptoFlix so look out for that.  6.   Legal Market Due Dilligence  We have identified the first 5-10 markets which we will enter with the platform and we are assembling a database of legal information to assist with the easy roll out of the platform. This includes information about content restrictions, minimum requirements, payment and tax compliance etc.  You can see the full roadmap in our white paper, which can be downloaded from our webpage www.cryptoflix.io.  I really appreciate your support and interest - keep it up.  The ICO is set for May 15 - June 15 and we have now fixed the price to 0.0004 ETH per FLIX token. The minimum contribution is 0.1 ETH and there is no maximum contribution. There will be a bonus structure, which will be communicated before the ICO - please remember to sign up for the early bonus alert on our webpage www.cryptoflix.io  Take care, Christian",False

Get Cryptos. Repeat.,"Hey Guys - Just re-posting the below because the discussion about CryptoFlix vs. Netflix came up again. Sorry to the veterans here who have already seen it:  Hey Everyone,  Just a quick comment about Netflix and subscription models:  We do not consider Netflix to be a competitor. This is because Netflix is a subscription based service - like pay tv, but without a fixed schedule for when you can see the content on there. Netflix primarily license content for a one-off payment to the content owner and they also produce their own content. With a subscription you can watch the content as many times as you want.  For content owners, Netflix is one of the last windows of film distribution that you have - because as long as you are one Netflix - no one who is on Netflix will pay to watch your film or TV show on a pay per view basis. Netflix are very good at what they do and I have the deepest respect for them.  However it is important to say, that the films and TV shows that are on Netflix are not new - except for their own productions. So the new films on iTunes for instance will not be available on Netflix until many months after.  And the new films and TV shows are the ones we are going for for CryptoFlix. Therefore we will not have Netflix as a competitor because our content will be different from theirs.  In short - CryptoFlix will not be a subscription based streaming platform.  Finally a few more replies to the wonderful debate:  1) There will not be advertising on CryptoFlix 2) We will start the platform in under developed countries - and very likely in Asia first 3) The price will be determined by the streaming quality chosen by the users - and the content owners will have more control over the pricing. So we are expecting to be competitive - otherwise how can we expect to even have a market let alone to compete with piracy.  Take care guys and don't forget to sign up for the early bonus alert on our website www.cryptoflix.io  Best, Christian",False

Get Cryptos. Repeat.,"Hey Everyone,  Just a quick comment about Netflix and subscription models:  We do not consider Netflix to be a competitor. This is because Netflix is a subscription based service - like pay tv, but without a fixed schedule for when you can see the content on there. Netflix primarily license content for a one-off payment to the content owner and they also produce their own content. With a subscription you can watch the content as many times as you want.  For content owners, Netflix is one of the last windows of film distribution that you have - because as long as you are one Netflix - no one who is on Netflix will pay to watch your film or TV show on a pay per view basis. Netflix are very good at what they do and I have the deepest respect for them.  However it is important to say, that the films and TV shows that are on Netflix are not new - except for their own productions. So the new films on iTunes for instance will not be available on Netflix until many months after.  And the new films and TV shows are the ones we are going for for CryptoFlix. Therefore we will not have Netflix as a competitor because our content will be different from theirs.  In short - CryptoFlix will not be a subscription based streaming platform.  Finally a few more replies to the wonderful debate:  1) There will not be advertising on CryptoFlix 2) We will start the platform in under developed countries - and very likely in Asia first 3) The price will be determined by the streaming quality chosen by the users - and the content owners will have more control over the pricing. So we are expecting to be competitive - otherwise how can we expect to even have a market let alone to compete with piracy.

For example you want to watch a specific movie definitely now and not in some months which is still not on Netflix as it is too new. You can go to Cryptoflix and watch the movie there and just pay for the movie. Maybe this is just the case once per months or once every two months that you want just to see some specific movie or tv show which is still not on Netflix and then you can go over to Cryptoflix and pay just for this.

Here is some basic information about the paid Movie streaming platform - I am sorry if I am repeating some earlier stated facts, but since it is difficult to reach for previous replies I have chosen to write these again:  1. CryptoFlix will not be a subscription model like Netflix. We want to showcase new movies and TV as well, which is not possible on the subscription model.  2. There will not be advertising on CryptoFlix.  3. The pricing on the CryptoFlix platform will be much more flexible than that of for instance iTunes. We will allow the content owners to have bigger influences over the prices and the data size matters as well. There will likely be regional pricing differences.  4. Part of the development work we have to achieve before launch is the technology to analyze the device and internet speed before suggesting which definition to stream - we call this YourDef.  We have experimented with compressing the file size and quality while still ensuring a good quality viewing experience and we are convinced that we can deliver as promised even at low internet speeds.  5. The free content will be sourced from a number of partnerships which are being negotiated. These include state owned TV stations around the world and learning institutions. We will also establish a Charitable Trust where it is possible to donate content as well as money to support the educational cause of CryptoFlix.  6. Regarding the working demo of the platform prior to the ICO, please do not expect this. The design of the current platform sample on our webpage is a good representation of how it will look for users with the convenience and easy menus etc., but before we have finalized the development the YourDef technology we will not have a full working demo ready.  That is it for now. Take care everyone and don't forget to sig up for the Early Pre-sale alert on our webpage www.cryptoflix.io.  Best, Christian",False

So no need to speculate about the annual price of a subscription!  Quote from: CRYPTOFLIX on February 04, 2018, 10:05:49 AM Hi everyone - Christian form CRYPTOFLIX here.  Because our name is similar to ""Netflix"", then there is an assumption that we will have a subscription service. This is not the plan. Our business model is very different from Netflix in that Netflix license content, which is not new to the VOD window, but which is comparable to Pay TV albeit without a fixed schedule. They are focussing more and more on their own content now and has become somewhat of a studio themselves. Our model for paid content is more like that of iTunes but for people without apple devices and with a much more flexible pricing structure. A lot of content will be free and there is no need to have a subscription to watch the free content, however if you use the free content for commercial activities, there is a subscription option for this. The other elements of the business model - especially the Film Financing Market but also ebooks, film production and licensing of the anti piracy tech are all in addition to the main business model, however in themselves potentially big, so there are multiple ways of making CryptoFlix into a successful business.  Join us!",False

Repeat.,"   Our aim is to help top quality film producers, sales agents, distributors and other film industry players to achieve funding for their projects, while at the same time offer the FLIX token holders the opportunity to act as financiers to enable them to achieve a return on the transaction.  In the White Paper we have used the example below:  A renowned producer is seeking gap financing for an English language horror movie. The movie will star a cast of renowned, but not “A-List”, actors.  Token holders can invest in the offered film projects with the returns and conditions offered in a term sheet. This will provide FLIX token holders with a unique opportunity to finance film projects, while fully aware of the risks and returns involved. The CRYPTOFLIX risk score will take into consideration the cast, the genre, the director, producer and key crew attached as well as other factors such as projected market penetration and income, which will serve as a guide for the token holder into the profitable world of film financing.  Other examples of potential projects needing financing could be:  A high quality independent film project, which unexpectedly attracts an A-List Actor to star. This happens and the producers will need to quickly find the extra financing to be able to cover the increased cost, which they are naturally willing to bear because the involvement of a star actor could hugely affect the financial outcome of a film.  Or  A distributor wants to pre-buy the rights to distribute a quality film and is looking for financing to be able to enter into an agreement with the sales agent before a film festival. A distributor is first in line to receive his/her share of the profits and the risk is different than that of the producer.  Now finally regarding the investment process we will use Smart Contracts and internal 1:1 fiat pegged stable FilmCoins to avoid exposure to the potential fluctuations in the crypto currency prices. As a FLIX Token holder, you will have access to the CRYPTOFLIX Film Marketplace, where you will be able to see the projects you can invest in and their term sheets. When you invest in a project, CRYPTOFLIX will deposit your FLIX Tokens into a FilmCoin smart contract and you will receive 1:1 fiat pegged internal FilmCoins which represent your investment. If and when the film project is a success and recoups profits, the initial FLIX Tokens used as collateral is returned to your digital wallet, while the yield is given as internal FilmCoins. I personally think that this is a film financing platform which has a big potential. Please read the white paper on www.cryptoflix.io",False

We will NOT present projects from filmmakers who could not get their films financed in by ordinary methods so the Film Market Place will not be a place to go to when there is no other way. The last 15-20% of the financing for most films made today is very difficult to get and often expensive GAP financing is used. So there is a real place in the market for this type of financing.  So yes the filmmakers will be known - no there will be no scam projects - and yes Token holders can freely decide which project they like and want to invest in.

Fund Films. Get Cryptos. Repeat.,"   Here is the explanation about the differences, its already posted on a few pages before. Quote from: CRYPTOFLIX on February 08, 2018, 02:29:11 PM Hey everyone - thank you for your continued interest and questions.  Just wanted to clarify the difference between the Netflix Model and the CRYPTOFLIX Model.  Netflix is mainly comparable to a Pay TV channel, except they do not have a fixed schedule. They pay license fees for the period where the content is on their platform up front and users can watch the movies as many times as they want, when they want.  In the film industry windows, Netflix is among the last stops in the income waterfall before free TV, but after VOD and DVD/BluRay. So Netflix will not have brand new movies, other than their own, because the content owners want income from the other windows first.  Also Netflix are producing their own content, which I believe they have re-allocated as many funds to as for licensing in 2018 so likely expect more of their own content going forward and less third party content.  The CRYPTOFLIX Model is more comparable to that of iTunes, which is a revenue sharing model where the content owners put their content on the platform against a share of the revenue and at no cost other than storage and administration to the platform.  CRYPTOFLIX will be different than the existing platforms in that it will be possible to use the platform without an Apple device and without a credit card (by using FLIX Tokens) and we will have more flexibility for the content owners in that the minimum quality requirements for entry onto the platform will be lower than the minimum standards for iTunes etc. and also our pricing structure will be more flexible. Also we can use smart contracts to share the revenue instantly with the content owners - in the current platforms this can take months or even years.  I hope this helps.

Get Cryptos. Repeat.,"Hey Everyone, Christian here  Regarding the CRYPTOFLIX Film Market, where FLIX Token owners can invest in films and own a little piece of Hollywood, I want to make it absolutely clear, that the movies we want to present to the possible investors, should have a potential to be present in many more windows of exhibition than VOD and the CRYPTOFLIX Streaming Platform. This is one of the key differences between our model and that of most other Blockchain based funding platforms for film.  To optimize the potential and income waterfall for a film, all windows of exhibition need to be pursued - these windows are:  1) Festivals (if applicable for the genre/type) 2) Theatrical (Cinemas) - this is still the best option for profits 3) DVD/Blu Ray - Still works, but not as it used to - by far 4) VOD - like CRYPTOFLIX 5) Pay TV/NetFlix 6) Free TV 7) Others  If a filmmaker was to exhibit a movie ""only"" on a lesser known blockchain based streaming platform, then there will be little or no profits to share with investors and likely break even is far far away.  We want the FLIX Token holders to be able to invest in quality Movies made by experienced filmmakers with the intent of taking it all the way - to ensure a maximum earning potential.  When the time comes for the movies to be in the VOD window - then they will be on CRYPTOFLIX.  Thanks for the continued interest and discussions/questions.

Repeat.,"    Seems you are correct:  3 Primary improvements with ERC223:  (1) Eliminates the problem of lost tokens which happens during the transfer of ERC20 tokens to a contract (when people mistakenly use the instructions for sending tokens to a wallet). ERC223 allows users to send their tokens to either wallet or contract with the same function transfer, thereby eliminating the potential for confusion and lost tokens.  (2) Allows developers to handle incoming token transactions, and reject non-supported tokens (not possible with ERC20)  (3) Energy savings. The transfer of ERC223 tokens to a contract is a one step process rather than 2 step process (for ERC20), and this means 2 times less gas and no extra blockchain bloating.  Switching from ERC20 to ERC223  ""ERC23 tokens are backwards compatible with ERC20 tokens. It means that ERC23 supports every ERC20 functions and contracts or services working with ERC20 tokens will work with ERC23 tokens correctly.""

Fund Films. Get Cryptos. Repeat.,"   There is a difference between the Netflix Model and the CRYPTOFLIX Model.  Netflix is mainly comparable to a Pay TV channel, except they do not have a fixed schedule. They pay license fees for the period where the content is on their platform up front and users can watch the movies as many times as they want, when they want.  In the film industry windows, Netflix is among the last stops in the income waterfall before free TV, but after VOD and DVD/BluRay. So Netflix will not have brand new movies, other than their own, because the content owners want income from the other windows first.  Also Netflix are producing their own content, which I believe they have re-allocated as many funds to as for licensing in 2018 so likely expect more of their own content going forward and less third party content.  The CRYPTOFLIX Model is more comparable to that of iTunes, which is a revenue sharing model where the content owners put their content on the platform against a share of the revenue and at no cost other than storage and administration to the platform.  CRYPTOFLIX will be different than the existing platforms in that it will be possible to use the platform without an Apple device and without a credit card (by using FLIX Tokens) and we will have more flexibility for the content owners in that the minimum quality requirements for entry onto the platform will be lower than the minimum standards for iTunes etc. and also our pricing structure will be more flexible. Also we can use smart contracts to share the revenue instantly with the content owners - in the current platforms this can take months or even years.",False

Get Cryptos. Repeat.,"Hey everyone,  Again thanks for the interest, questions and discussions. We are happy that you are all so passionate about movies as well as CRYPTOFLIX.  Just a few things from me today as a reply to the recent discussions:  1) We do intend for CRYPTOFLIX to be a worldwide service, however the intention is to start in the underdeveloped, underbanked world, namely Asia, South America and Africa and expand from there. If you read the White Paper there is an analysis of both the competition and the markets and for paid content our first markets will be the unbanked population of the world who today have little or no other option than to watch pirated movies.  But because of the much more flexible pricing structure, we expect than many content owners would want to be on CRYPTOFLIX for Europe and US as well. Believe me, if we see that there is an opportunity to grow into new markets, we will act on it.  The free educational content will be out worldwide from day one.  2) Regarding languages and subtitles, this is really a choice for the content owner. Obviously local and regional films will already be versioned for the near markets, but for international films, usually there will be subtitled versions and if available also dubbed versions etc. From a content owner perspective it is important to always evaluate if the cost of dubbing a film will come back as income from said market. A good dub is costly and therefore many international films will only have subtitles. This is why our strategy is to start with markets, where there is a high level of English, French or Spanish language speakers to provide as wide a selection of films and TV from the beginning.  3) I have really enjoyed your ideas and suggestions for what movies you would like to see produced. Filmmaking is an art form that unfortunately is influenced heavily by contracts and rights etc. And it takes a long time and a lot of money to get from idea to seeing the film on the big screen. I know that you are wondering what kind of films you are going to be able to invest in with the FLIX Tokens. We will seek to provide a range of film and TV projects of different genres and budgets and from different parts of the world - all with one thing in common - they are good projects with quality people behind them.  Finally please don't forget to sign up for the Early Pre-Sale alert on our webpage: www.cryptoflix.io  Take care everybody and thank you again for your support.  Christian",False

Before we launch the platform we need to finalize the development of the ""YourDef"" interface between the user and the platform. Obviously we would like to roll out the platform as soon as possible, but for CRYPTOFLIX to be a successful venture we need to be able to present the right solution for the users, while also carefully considering the very different markets around the under developed world.  As for the Film Market Place - I do not see why we could not offer investment into big budget movies. Like I mentioned in an earlier post, most filmmakers work hard to get the last 15-20% of financing and in the Film Market Place we could round up many investors to go into the same project to attract these big projects as well as other quality projects.

Get Cryptos. Repeat.,"Hey everyone - thank you for your continued interest and questions.  Just wanted to clarify the difference between the Netflix Model and the CRYPTOFLIX Model.  Netflix is mainly comparable to a Pay TV channel, except they do not have a fixed schedule. They pay license fees for the period where the content is on their platform up front and users can watch the movies as many times as they want, when they want.  In the film industry windows, Netflix is among the last stops in the income waterfall before free TV, but after VOD and DVD/BluRay. So Netflix will not have brand new movies, other than their own, because the content owners want income from the other windows first.  Also Netflix are producing their own content, which I believe they have re-allocated as many funds to as for licensing in 2018 so likely expect more of their own content going forward and less third party content.  The CRYPTOFLIX Model is more comparable to that of iTunes, which is a revenue sharing model where the content owners put their content on the platform against a share of the revenue and at no cost other than storage and administration to the platform.  CRYPTOFLIX will be different than the existing platforms in that it will be possible to use the platform without an Apple device and without a credit card (by using FLIX Tokens) and we will have more flexibility for the content owners in that the minimum quality requirements for entry onto the platform will be lower than the minimum standards for iTunes etc. and also our pricing structure will be more flexible. Also we can use smart contracts to share the revenue instantly with the content owners - in the current platforms this can take months or even years.  I hope this helps.  Don't forget to sign up for the Early pre-sale Alert on our web page: www.cryptoflix.io  Take care, Christian",False

Fund Films. Get Cryptos. Repeat.,"    What do you mean? it was officialy from Christian CRYPTOFLIX  Quote from: CRYPTOFLIX on February 05, 2018, 11:04:32 PM Hey everyone, Christian here from CRYPTOFLIX.  There have been some questions about how the CRYPTOFLIX Film Marketplace will work and what types of projects we expect to see. Also, there seems to be a belief that major filmmakers and studios have enough money to finance films by themselves, so I just wanted to share some of the ideas and plans we have regarding this.   First of all, financing a film or a TV series is not easy for most filmmakers, even for good ones. There seems to often be a gap of 15-20% which is typically financed by wealthy individuals or investment companies. Sometimes the last part is financed by banks or other specialized film financing sources. Very often there are many layers of financing and as these layers are in different positions when the income from the film starts to flow, there are different layers of risks and rewards involved.  Our aim is to help top quality film producers, sales agents, distributors and other film industry players to achieve funding for their projects, while at the same time offer the FLIX token holders the opportunity to act as financiers to enable them to achieve a return on the transaction.  In the White Paper we have used the example below:  A renowned producer is seeking gap financing for an English language horror movie. The movie will star a cast of renowned, but not “A-List”, actors.  Token holders can invest in the offered film projects with the returns and conditions offered in a term sheet. This will provide FLIX token holders with a unique opportunity to finance film projects, while fully aware of the risks and returns involved. The CRYPTOFLIX risk score will take into consideration the cast, the genre, the director, producer and key crew attached as well as other factors such as projected market penetration and income, which will serve as a guide for the token holder into the profitable world of film financing.  Other examples of potential projects needing financing could be:  A high quality independent film project, which unexpectedly attracts an A-List Actor to star. This happens and the producers will need to quickly find the extra financing to be able to cover the increased cost, which they are naturally willing to bear because the involvement of a star actor could hugely affect the financial outcome of a film.  Or  A distributor wants to pre-buy the rights to distribute a quality film and is looking for financing to be able to enter into an agreement with the sales agent before a film festival. A distributor is first in line to receive his/her share of the profits and the risk is different than that of the producer.  Now finally regarding the investment process we will use Smart Contracts and internal 1:1 fiat pegged stable FilmCoins to avoid exposure to the potential fluctuations in the crypto currency prices. As a FLIX Token holder, you will have access to the CRYPTOFLIX Film Marketplace, where you will be able to see the projects you can invest in and their term sheets. When you invest in a project, CRYPTOFLIX will deposit your FLIX Tokens into a FilmCoin smart contract and you will receive 1:1 fiat pegged internal FilmCoins which represent your investment. If and when the film project is a success and recoups profits, the initial FLIX Tokens used as collateral is returned to your digital wallet, while the yield is given as internal FilmCoins. I personally think that this is a film financing platform which has a big potential. Please read the white paper on www.cryptoflix.io.  I hope that helps.

We are aiming at sourcing strong projects with experienced and trustworthy filmmakers at the helm - as well as good projects with potential from less experienced filmmakers. The key I suppose is that we want to showcase projects that have the best chances of a real life in both the traditional windows of the film industry - as well as on VOD on the CRYPTOFLIX platform - in an effort to maximize the return for the token holders.

Get Cryptos. Repeat.,"Hello everyone - Christian here again.  Just a few remarks to the general discussions:  1. CRYPTOFLIX is not going to be an adult movie streaming platform. 2. We are NOT going to be streaming illegal pirated movies and/or TV series. 3. We are indeed aiming at getting the latest movies and TV shows on the platform as soon as possible after their release - the content owners will be interested in accessing the developing countries through a secure streaming platform - also to combat piracy. 4. We are film makers so yes we do have plans to produce content for the platform, but first we want to get the streaming platform and the Film Market Place up and running. 5. There are several reasons why we are blockchain based. The White Paper explains this so please read, however in brief: the unbanked have little access to the global VOD providers hence the need to be able to pay in Crypto. 6. Yes there are competitors in the market - but many are focussed on increasing the quality for ""western"" users as well as producing more and more own content. Our platform is tailored to meet the demands of both the industry and the users in the developing world.  In my view CRYPTOFLIX can be broken down to: 1) A Paid content streaming platform where it is possible to pay in FLIX (Crypto) Tokens as an alternative to credit cards etc. which the unbanked have no access to 2) A Film Market Place which allows FLIX Token holders to contribute to PROFESSIONAL film projects in different stages and levels of the film industry - each of which will generate a risk dependent return and 3) A Free content educational film and TV streaming platform to educate freely across borders.  All of the above elements are solid projects and we have some ways to expand further with the inclusion of an ebook distribution platform (both paid and free), a film/tv production company and an anti-pirate tech software solution to be licensed.

Get Cryptos. Repeat.,"Hey everyone, Christian here from CRYPTOFLIX.  There have been some questions about how the CRYPTOFLIX Film Marketplace will work and what types of projects we expect to see. Also, there seems to be a belief that major filmmakers and studios have enough money to finance films by themselves, so I just wanted to share some of the ideas and plans we have regarding this.   First of all, financing a film or a TV series is not easy for most filmmakers, even for good ones. There seems to often be a gap of 15-20% which is typically financed by wealthy individuals or investment companies. Sometimes the last part is financed by banks or other specialized film financing sources. Very often there are many layers of financing and as these layers are in different positions when the income from the film starts to flow, there are different layers of risks and rewards involved.  Our aim is to help top quality film producers, sales agents, distributors and other film industry players to achieve funding for their projects, while at the same time offer the FLIX token holders the opportunity to act as financiers to enable them to achieve a return on the transaction.  In the White Paper we have used the example below:  A renowned producer is seeking gap financing for an English language horror movie. The movie will star a cast of renowned, but not “A-List”, actors.  Token holders can invest in the offered film projects with the returns and conditions offered in a term sheet. This will provide FLIX token holders with a unique opportunity to finance film projects, while fully aware of the risks and returns involved. The CRYPTOFLIX risk score will take into consideration the cast, the genre, the director, producer and key crew attached as well as other factors such as projected market penetration and income, which will serve as a guide for the token holder into the profitable world of film financing.  Other examples of potential projects needing financing could be:  A high quality independent film project, which unexpectedly attracts an A-List Actor to star. This happens and the producers will need to quickly find the extra financing to be able to cover the increased cost, which they are naturally willing to bear because the involvement of a star actor could hugely affect the financial outcome of a film.  Or  A distributor wants to pre-buy the rights to distribute a quality film and is looking for financing to be able to enter into an agreement with the sales agent before a film festival. A distributor is first in line to receive his/her share of the profits and the risk is different than that of the producer.  Now finally regarding the investment process we will use Smart Contracts and internal 1:1 fiat pegged stable FilmCoins to avoid exposure to the potential fluctuations in the crypto currency prices. As a FLIX Token holder, you will have access to the CRYPTOFLIX Film Marketplace, where you will be able to see the projects you can invest in and their term sheets. When you invest in a project, CRYPTOFLIX will deposit your FLIX Tokens into a FilmCoin smart contract and you will receive 1:1 fiat pegged internal FilmCoins which represent your investment. If and when the film project is a success and recoups profits, the initial FLIX Tokens used as collateral is returned to your digital wallet, while the yield is given as internal FilmCoins. I personally think that this is a film financing platform which has a big potential. Please read the white paper on www.cryptoflix.io.  I hope that helps.

Here : Quote from: CRYPTOFLIX on February 04, 2018, 10:05:49 AM Hi everyone - Christian form CRYPTOFLIX here.  Because our name is similar to ""Netflix"", then there is an assumption that we will have a subscription service. This is not the plan. Our business model is very different from Netflix in that Netflix license content, which is not new to the VOD window, but which is comparable to Pay TV albeit without a fixed schedule. They are focussing more and more on their own content now and has become somewhat of a studio themselves. Our model for paid content is more like that of iTunes but for people without apple devices and with a much more flexible pricing structure. A lot of content will be free and there is no need to have a subscription to watch the free content, however if you use the free content for commercial activities, there is a subscription option for this. The other elements of the business model - especially the Film Financing Market but also ebooks, film production and licensing of the anti piracy tech are all in addition to the main business model, however in themselves potentially big, so there are multiple ways of making CryptoFlix into a successful business.

This is not the plan. Our business model is very different from Netflix in that Netflix license content, which is not new to the VOD window, but which is comparable to Pay TV albeit without a fixed schedule. They are focussing more and more on their own content now and has become somewhat of a studio themselves. Our model for paid content is more like that of iTunes but for people without apple devices and with a much more flexible pricing structure. A lot of content will be free and there is no need to have a subscription to watch the free content, however if you use the free content for commercial activities, there is a subscription option for this. The other elements of the business model - especially the Film Financing Market but also ebooks, film production and licensing of the anti piracy tech are all in addition to the main business model, however in themselves potentially big, so there are multiple ways of making CryptoFlix into a successful business.

Welcome to CRYPTOFLIX – a Blockchain film streaming platform to give everyone, everywhere legal access to movies and to educate humanity across borders. Imagine a new platform, where movies of yesterday, today and tomorrow, local and international are available to stream legally on a phone or tablet at low cost – even on a slow internet speed and where it is possible to access educational films and TV for free.  This platform is called CRYPTOFLIX and the cryptocurrency revolution has made it possible for the CRYPTOFLIX team to carry out this project – now. Check out our progress on www.cryptoflix.io    OUR MISSION   Our mission is to launch the CRYPTOFLIX Ecosystem with CRYPTOFLIX - a closed network film and TV streaming platform as the central element. We will in part offer paid content in the form of feature films and TV and commercial free films and TV for educational purposes to private individuals across the planet, without borders. Paid content is available through payments in our own FLIX Tokens as well as common crypto currencies and which will be launched firstly in underdeveloped, high population, under banked countries. Furthermore, we will launch a Film Market, where FLIX Token holders can invest in film projects with the returns and conditions offered in a term sheet and which have a risk score as well as comments from our expert analysts.   WHAT INNOVATION DO WE OFFER   There are three main challenges in the delivery of content in underdeveloped countries:   ●   Internet speed ●   Hardware storage limits ●   Piracy   We intend to deliver a user driven quality of the content so that it will be possible to stream size-compressed films even at lower internet speeds. This deals with the first two challenges.  We call this, Your Definition or YourDef.  We are further developing groundbreaking new technology to individually watermark a streamed copy of a film and we will be able to link to the payment on the Blockchain. We fully expect to be able to patent and license this technology.  Our vision for the new watermarking of streamed films is for this to be a market standard for Video on Demand. Today it is not possible to individually watermark a streaming and link this to a payment and thereby identify the pirate. This will be possible with our solution.      THE CRYPTOFLIX PLATFORM   The CRYPTOFLIX Platform is the central element in the CRYPTOFLIX Ecosystem. It is where most users will have their interface with our product and all other elements of the ecosystem are connected to CRYPTOFLIX.   When users register on the CRYPTOFLIX platform they will have one account to access both paid content – movies and TV and free content - educational films, documentaries and TV. When the user is logged in there are 2 types of content:  Cinema content - paid movies and TV.  Educational Screening content - free films and TV for private individual use.  The platform account will also feature a user digital wallet where users can top up their balance for paid content and which will be integrated with local as well as Blockchain based payment forms as necessary for each market. Payment for the content on the CRYPTOFLIX Platform by way of FLIX tokes will feature a discounted price compared to payment in other accepted digital currencies.  Non-private individual – institutional users can access the educational content through a prepaid monthly subscription plan, which will be competitively and reasonably priced to ensure that the content owners are satisfied as well as to ensure that the content will be used correctly and not through illegal use. This solution is optimal for schools, libraries, organizations etc.  The Platform offers a number of unique benefits for both users and the film industry.  You can see a demo of the platform clicking on this link.     CRYPTOFLIX FILM MARKET    With the CRYPTOFLIX FILM MARKET we will enable top quality producers, sales agents and other industry elite players and suppliers to seek financing from the FLIX Token holders. We will generate a risk score based on   1.   Where in the film value chain does the financing apply 2.   The time it will take to get the project to market 3.   The genre, potential market and projected income for the project 4.   The team behind the project 5.   Any X Factors which apply to the project (A-List actors, subject matter    etc.)   Token holders can invest in the offered film projects with the returns and conditions offered in a term sheet.  This will provide FLIX Token holder with a unique opportunity to finance film projects, while fully aware of the risks and returns involved. The risk score and comments from our expert analysts will allow the token holders to make educated decisions and to only finance projects which are within an acceptable risk compared to the private finances of each token holder.  The CRYPTOFLIX risk score will take into consideration the cast, the genre, the director, producer and key crew attached as well as other factors such as projected market penetration and income and will serve as a guide for the token holder into the exciting world of film financing.
