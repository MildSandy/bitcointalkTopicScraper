Although such systems have been in use in various guises for many thousands of years, their recent popularity stems from the Bitcoin blockchain algorithm and its many successors which use network nodes and cryptographic techniques to verify transactions in a public ledger. Much work has been done in considering the general economic advantages and disadvantages of such systems, as well as addressing general technical problems which include but are not limited to simple consensus and authority. However, there remains a number of specific problems which relate to applications for ‘machine-to-machine’ (M2M) interactions. Chief amongst these are the challenges of reaching a machine-negotiated consensus, delivering higher ledger throughput, and achieving an appropriate level of utility.  The future of M2M Negotiation The human world sees complex negotiations occurring between multiple people as a routine part of everyday life. These might be as trivial as a shopper agreeing to purchase goods at the advertised price, or as complex as an agreement between multiple business counterparties to deliver a range of goods and services with multiple interdependencies. Negotiating the specific case of an agreement to buy at an advertised price is itself trivial, and can straightforwardly be synthesised by an algorithm that accepts or declines execution of the contract according to one or more simple parameters.   https://i.imgur.com/C8QOsZF.jpg   What does that mean for you? We are about to enter a world of billions of Internet capable devices with forecasts of over 20 billion IoT (‘Internet-of-Things’) devices globally by 2020 (source: Gartner on 7 Feb 2017 see https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3598917) and by 2035 ARM (the world’s largest computer chip company) forecasting over 1 trillion IoT devices in place by 2035 https://readwrite.com/2017/07/26/arm-iot-2035-dl1/ These devices will become even more capable with AI (Artificial Intelligence) making such devices even more powerful. However, if these devices are to be more than just pieces of metal and plastic connected to the Internet, they need a means by which they can reach sophisticated, commercial agreements between themselves completely autonomously without human intervention.  The Railz protocol has been designed to enable these billions of IoT devices to negotiate sophisticated commercial or other agreements between themselves without any human intervention. And that each agreement reached is the best possible agreement that could be reached between both parties, a so called mathematically proven ‘optimised consensus’.  The Future Imagine a world where a self-driving electric vehicle (EV) approaches a traffic light and stops above a ‘wireless’ charging point in the road. With Railz, the EV and charging point could carry out a negotiation to buy or sell spare electricity with each other (depending on pricing), either to top up the EV batteries or sell the EV’s spare capacity onto a local or National Grid.

We envisage a world where soon 50 billion IoT devices and eventually a trillion devices will want and need to trade, negotiate and form 'smart supply' chains without human intervention.  And so:    We will be building the software to do this securely. We will be evangelizing to the global IoT, Robotics & AI communities on how Railz can help facilitate a 'Fourth Industrial Revolution'. We will be aiming to get manufacturing, robotics, IoT and AI businesses from SMEs to global firms to adopt Railz as the protocol for them to communicate with billions of other devices.    Example use cases:   Self-driving vehicles at mass scale Renewable energy generation and trading Healthcare Transport & Logistics Secure food chains",False

That potential could be used to harness the power of the sun, to clean the atmosphere and seas, to spread the influence of earth to further reaches of the galaxy.  It could also turn against its maker, see us as a threat and a nuisance, feel it necessary to remove or control us in a way it saw fit.  The issue we have is, what part of our own image will we build them in?  Will the most powerful cutting-edge AIs be weaponry? will we build them to kill, hunt, fight, to find threats?  Or will they be designed from the ground up to care, nurture, grow, build, to feed those without, will we design them to care about life?  There are many sides to man, we are capable of great compassion and caring, art and beauty. we are also capable of terrible acts of violence and hatred, cruelness, and spite.   I do not think we can or will ignore the potential of AI, but will we design them as a gun or a paintbrush?  A gun is designed primarily to hurt and kill, and it will do so indiscriminately.  A paint brush is designed to improve and make beautiful, and it will do so given the right hand.   The possible reaches and repercussions of true AI are unimagined in scope and complexity, how far can that tech go?  If we build digital artificial intelligence and it achieves a will of its own or ""sentience"" what do we want to have taught it and how will it build on that?   I feel really the AI debate is a question of who are we and what do we want to build?

We envisage a world where soon 50 billion IoT devices and eventually a trillion devices will want and need to trade, negotiate and form 'smart supply' chains without human intervention.

Although such systems have been in use in various guises for many thousands of years, their recent popularity stems from the Bitcoin blockchain algorithm and its many successors which use network nodes and cryptographic techniques to verify transactions in a public ledger. Much work has been done in considering the general economic advantages and disadvantages of such systems, as well as addressing general technical problems which include but are not limited to simple consensus and authority. However, there remains a number of specific problems which relate to applications for ‘machine-to-machine’ (M2M) interactions. Chief amongst these are the challenges of reaching a machine-negotiated consensus, delivering higher ledger throughput, and achieving an appropriate level of utility.  The future of M2M Negotiation The human world sees complex negotiations occurring between multiple people as a routine part of everyday life. These might be as trivial as a shopper agreeing to purchase goods at the advertised price, or as complex as an agreement between multiple business counterparties to deliver a range of goods and services with multiple interdependencies. Negotiating the specific case of an agreement to buy at an advertised price is itself trivial, and can straightforwardly be synthesised by an algorithm that accepts or declines execution of the contract according to one or more simple parameters.     What does that mean for you? We are about to enter a world of billions of Internet capable devices with forecasts of over 20 billion IoT (‘Internet-of-Things’) devices globally by 2020 (source: Gartner on 7 Feb 2017 see https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3598917) and by 2035 ARM (the world’s largest computer chip company) forecasting over 1 trillion IoT devices in place by 2035 https://readwrite.com/2017/07/26/arm-iot-2035-dl1/ These devices will become even more capable with AI (Artificial Intelligence) making such devices even more powerful. However, if these devices are to be more than just pieces of metal and plastic connected to the Internet, they need a means by which they can reach sophisticated, commercial agreements between themselves completely autonomously without human intervention.  The Railz protocol has been designed to enable these billions of IoT devices to negotiate sophisticated commercial or other agreements between themselves without any human intervention. And that each agreement reached is the best possible agreement that could be reached between both parties, a so called mathematically proven ‘optimised consensus’.  The Future Imagine a world where a self-driving electric vehicle (EV) approaches a traffic light and stops above a ‘wireless’ charging point in the road. With Railz, the EV and charging point could carry out a negotiation to buy or sell spare electricity with each other (depending on pricing), either to top up the EV batteries or sell the EV’s spare capacity onto a local or National Grid.
