But if the rest of the stock exchange this action could collapse, then liqunet will purchase the necessary volume on several exchanges, which does not warp the skewed one big deal.  That requires a very fast trading engine for your setup to make that all work in real time if huge trades need to be executed!  At the moment, at the most simple equipment we have 18000-20000 transactions per second, if necessary, the core easily scales into several servers and the productivity can be increased by an order of magnitude.  I have no clue how many transactions these large exchanges right now process per second, but 18000-20000 sounds about ok I guess.  Nobody has any clue about this transaction because trasnaction are ananomous which we can identify but admin can easily identify through back ground process.

Hi You can always ask questions if you feel that you do not understand something about the project! We are here to help So, let me explain to you: LIQNET is a cryptoexchange, which allows to unite liquidity from different platforms and solve the problem of scattering of users, their trading requests, and orders, thus forming a unified order book with better market depth and better prices for private persons and legal entities from various jurisdictions. What makes the LIQNET exchange unique is the LEN (Liquidity Exchange Network) tool, which allows to collect and combine orders of our exchange's clients and orders from third-party platforms into a single order package and make them available for trading by all LIQNET's clients. LIQNET also provides a suite of order types to help our customer optimize their trading strategy. Btw, our exchange is already working in a test mode.

The clear benefits of owning tokens provide the demand.  Also you can sell your LEN tokens on exchange. The exchange value of the LEN token will be determined in accordance with the demand and supply. The more users of the LIQNET platform, the more participants need LEN tokens.  Additionally, based on the results of votings of the token holders, it is possible that a buy-out of tokens at current prices at LIQNET will be done to ensure the demand in order to avoid sales at low prices and access to ultra-low discounts in huge volumes.

Our team has done calculations of competitors' profits. Nine largest exchanges were taken for calculations. Average monthly trading volume was calculated, which was equal to $46 228 934 670. The forecasted value of the volume of trading positions from third-party platforms — 25%, and the percentage of revenues from arbitrage percent getting is 0,3%. Thus, the share of cross positions equals to $34 671 701 002. Also, a midline development scenario was calculated, for which the level of exchange's trading volume was set to $350 000 000, and the size of trading positions from third-party platforms was equal to 70%. For these numbers, the share of cross positions will equal to $105 000 000. Due to the platform aggregating sufficient amount of liquidity of different tools, it is planned to implement trading of deliverable futures and options for those that have the highest liquidity.

The clear benefits of owning tokens provide the demand.  You can sell your LEN on exchange. The exchange value of the LEN token will be determined in accordance with the demand and supply. The more users of the LIQNET platform, the more participants need LEN tokens.  Additionally, based on the results of votings of the token holders, it is possible that a buy-out of tokens at current prices at LIQNET will be done to ensure the demand in order to avoid sales at low prices and access to ultra-low discounts in huge volumes.

The LEN mechanism (Liquidity Exchange Network) collects and consolidates LIQNET exchange clients orders and orders from third-party platforms into a single order book and makes them available for trading to all LIQNET clients.  Quote from: MoNeY TrEE on July 25, 2018, 04:31:13 PM It is interesting to ask whether this project has any disadvantages if you compare it with other projects?  Several categories represent the competitive environment of LIQNET: 1. Classic cryptocurrency exchanges with which LIQNET works as a client by using the LEN mechanism. It connects to them through an API and executes a significant number of trading operations thus increasing the competitor's turnover and pays fees for every operation, therefore, making profits for the competitor. 2. Forex brokers who are offering to trade the BTC-USD and other cryptocurrencies pairs. They are not considered direct competitors because they work with non-deliverable CFD contracts on the price difference. Cryptocurrency can be bought from them, but it can't be withdrawn. 3. B2BX project. It is not an aggregator of real cryptocurrency liquidity. It would be more proper to consider it as an offer to brokers to implement trading of contracts on the difference between prices in BTC and ETH, an attempt to connect brokers and their clients, who trade to lower the brokers' risks of changing prices of cryptocurrencies. Because non-covered risks will have to be covered on the markets with an actual shipment of assets anyway, LIQNET will be the best solution for that. In other words, B2BX is not a competitor, but LIQNET's potential client. 4. Futures contracts from CME Group, CBOE.  A futures contract on Bitcoin index put on the market is not a competitor to LIQNET. If the possibility of an arbitrage appears, traders need a place to buy or sell the base asset. Because the index is calculated based on the data from four cryptoexchanges, each of which is a supplier of liquidity, LIQNET is the optimal platform for that, because it provides the maximum volume of liquidity for the best price. Therefore, the issue of futures leads to the increase of the number of traders, who want to trade physical assets at the LIQNET platform. As you can see, LIQNET has not any disadvantages, if you compare it with other projects.",False

So, I`ll explain it for you: The server side of the LIQNET platform is a private cloud, which is composed of physical servers in several locations and client terminals (currently, one terminal for web browsers). The security of the server side has been thoroughly tested. To ensure the security of user data and tools, we implemented the following protective measures: - two-step authentication; - system of replicated geo-distributed servers with the possibility of scaling; - geo-distributed array of hot, conditionally hot, cold wallets, as well as addresses with a multisignature for each cryptocurrency; - a background clearing system that checks the correctness of current balances and I/Os between full cross-sections, and when a discrepancy registers a dangerous state, it transfers funds to cold wallets and multisignature addresses.",False

I would like to know more about this The market of cryptocurrency exchange is tightly bound to the cryptocurrencies themselves. It is at the early stage of its development. In comparison to the stock, derivatives, and currencies markets, it is a small number. Nevertheless, the growth potential is vast. It can be linked to the growth of their applicability in real life, the improvement of the technology itself, the increase of their legal status, and to the allowance of them as a payment tool on international and national markets. Any positive information and any novelty positively affect the growth of popularity and acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Studying the cryptocurrencies market helps to understand that even with the immense potential, the level of uncertainty around the new payment and investment tool is still high. It can be seen already now that people tend to a freer money circulation and a more democratic monetary policy. Cryptocurrencies allow to cut costs, which every economic agent faces every day. The process of the development of the cryptocurrencies market that was started 7 - 8 years ago actively transforms existing socioeconomic foundations of society by considerably simplifying interactions between economic agents in P2P, C2B and B2B sectors. The growth of the industry's capitalization confirms that people vote with their money for its development. The exchange value of the LEN token will be determined in accordance with the demand and supply for it. The more users of the LIQNET platform, the more participants need the LEN tokens.

You have not to worry about LIQNET`s security. The server side of the LIQNET platform is a private cloud, which is composed of physical servers in several locations and client terminals (currently, one terminal for web browsers). The security of the server side has been thoroughly tested. To ensure the security of user data and tools, we implemented the following protective measures: - two-step authentication; - system of replicated geo-distributed servers with the possibility of scaling; - geo-distributed array of hot, conditionally hot, cold wallets, as well as addresses with a multisignature for each cryptocurrency; - a background clearing system that checks the correctness of current balances and I/Os between full cross-sections, and when a discrepancy registers a dangerous state, it transfers funds to cold wallets and multisignature addresses. Quote from: UnIvErS on July 25, 2018, 10:17:59 AM But what does this change in comparison with previous facts? In comparison with other exchanges, liquidity for the LIQNET exchange is collected both by classical methods and by a separate mechanism based on the LEN technology of our own design. The LEN mechanism (Liquidity Exchange Network) collects and consolidates LIQNET exchange clients orders and orders from third-party platforms into a single order book and makes them available for trading to all LIQNET clients.

Quote from: rahu0831 on July 20, 2018, 04:02:49 PM but we need multiple exchanges for good competition since it is healthy for customers Today, the number of exchanges has grown so much that the market needs unification to be able to continue to develop as a single organism. Users and their assets are split; therefore, liquidity is split, too. Cryptocurrencies should unite people, companies, and financial streams, but the fragmentation of trading over several platforms leads to increased volatility of many cryptographic currencies and assets. This scares traditional investors away from investing in cryptocurrencies. Low level of liquidity and considerable spreads don't help the development of the cryptocurrency industry. Naturally, exchanges should seek to get into a unified trading place to be able to use the combined liquidity to increase revenue. The abundance of exchange and trade tools on the market should also be critically reviewed. At first glance, the market is filled with stock and cryptocurrency exchanges. However, when filtered by such parameters as reliability, accessibility for end users (many exchanges are selective in allowing residents of different countries and jurisdictions to trade), ability to trade with required tools (fiduciary currencies included), the choice is narrowed drastically, and the illusion of abundance goes away. At the remaining optimal exchanges, liquidity will be limited. Therefore, during a market move or when buying or selling a significant amount of funds, a trader risks to fail to get the required amount or get it at an unacceptable price. We solved this problem by uniting liquidity streams from different platforms into one order book.",False

Would like to join your dialogue a bit and to place emphasis on discounts on the exchange's fees to token holders, LEN token holders will get a discount on the exchange's fees of up to 90% depending on the number of tokens spent on it. How to get a discount: one token gives a 0,5% discount on the sum of fees for one day. The discount is activated for 24 hours in the personal account right after the withdrawal of tokens or at the set time. Increment size is 0,5%, the highest possible discount is 90%. The timing of the discount can be chosen in the personal account. For example, 10% discount on the fees for a day costs 20 tokens, 50% discount for a week requires 700 tokens. So, the platform allows to use the purchased LEN tokens and offers the holders the ability to get discounts and the right to vote on the way the funds received by the system are allocated.",False

It means a lot to us! Quote from: Garag on July 17, 2018, 07:20:57 PM But all the same, what about the market situation. Does it cause you reasonable fear? Today, the number of exchanges has grown so much that the market needs unification to be able to continue to develop as a single organism. Users and their assets are split; therefore, liquidity is split, too. Cryptocurrencies should unite people, companies, and financial streams, but the fragmentation of trading over several platforms leads to increased volatility of many cryptographic currencies and assets. This scares traditional investors away from investing in cryptocurrencies. Low level of liquidity and considerable spreads don't help the development of the cryptocurrency industry. Naturally, exchanges should seek to get into a unified trading place to be able to use the combined liquidity to increase revenue. The abundance of exchange and trade tools on the market should also be critically reviewed. At first glance, the market is filled with stock and cryptocurrency exchanges. However, when filtered by such parameters as reliability, accessibility for end users (many exchanges are selective in allowing residents of different countries and jurisdictions to trade), ability to trade with required tools (fiduciary currencies included), the choice is narrowed drastically, and the illusion of abundance goes away. At the remaining optimal exchanges, liquidity will be limited. Therefore, during a market move or when buying or selling a significant amount of funds, a trader risks to fail to get the required amount or get it at an unacceptable price. We solved this problem by uniting liquidity streams from different platforms into one order book. Quote from: BlacK CrowN on July 17, 2018, 08:01:37 PM Explain me please I do not fully understand your idea. Sure! LIQNET is a cryptoexchange that aggregates liquidity from various platforms thus solving the problem of the splitting of users and their trading orders by forming a unified order book with the best market depth and prices. LEN (Liquidity Exchange Network) is what makes our exchange unique. This mechanism allows collecting and aggregating buy/sell orders through APIs of 1,2...n exchanges located anywhere in the world and forming a unified order book. Thus, orders are combined and users can now make deals with best prices and minimal spread. As a result, our users get access to the single order book, in which they see both the orders of our exchange and orders relayed from other platforms. Due to the platform aggregating sufficient amount of liquidity of various tools, it is planned to implement trading of deliverable futures and options for those that have the highest liquidity. LEN allows the LIQNET system to get an improved model from the standard model of market depth that offers added liquidity at the intersection of supply and demand.

The company LIQNET is registered in Singapore. In recent years, Singapore has done a great job of creating legislation that meets the most modern requirements of the cryptocurrency market. Strict laws of Singapore are primarily aimed at protecting traders, so LIQNET wants to meet the advanced requirements of local regulators, working ahead of time for most other jurisdictions. We are proud of this. The office in Singapore allows LIQNET to respond quickly to changes in both the legislative and business landscapes, because there is a very high concentration of blockchain projects and specialists there. This is the best place to conduct a global business in cryptocurrency trading. In the current active phase of preparation for entering the market, we decided to concentrate the entire team, including founders, developers, marketers and managers, in Russia. This allows us to minimize delays between decisions and their implementation. In the future, remote offices of LIQNET will be united by round-the-clock communication using advanced technologies of corporate interaction.

ANSWER  1. After the ICO, users can withdraw tokens from the wallets in the investor's personal accounts into other wallets. 2. Trading tokens will be possible at LIQNET after the ICO. 3. The exchange value of the LEN token will be determined in accordance with the demand and supply for it. The more users of the LIQNET platform, the more participants need the LEN tokens. The company does not give any forecasts and does not participate in the formation of the value of the tokens.

Hi, So, the basis of the LIQNET project is a secure cryptocurrency exchange. It collects liquidity using both classic methods and a standalone mechanism that uses the in-house LEN technology. LEN is a mechanism that through an API allows to collect and combine data on requests to sell/buy from many cryptocurrency exchanges located anywhere in the world and to form a unified order book.

Yes it is good but what comparative advantages does it have?  Quote from: UnIvErS on July 13, 2018, 06:51:04 PM It is very interesting to know about it too ?  LIQNET is a cryptoexchange, which allows to unite liquidity from different platforms and solve the problem of scattering of users, their trading requests, and orders, thus forming a unified order book with better market depth and better prices for private persons and legal entities from various jurisdictions.  What makes the LIQNET exchange unique is the LEN (Liquidity Exchange Network) tool, which allows to collect and combine orders of our exchange's clients and orders from third-party platforms into a single order package and make them available for trading by all LIQNET's clients. The holders of the LEN tokens get privileged terms. Other advantages of LIQNET: 1.   Desktop apps (own desktop app, MultiCharts, TradingView, and MT5). 2.   Fully functional mobile trading apps for Android and iOS. 3.   An online-wallet project that provides the ability to exchange cryptocurrencies and fiat money by the press of a button. Additionally, it has the easy cryptocurrency investment service with free and paid built-in strategies. 4.   Acquiring service for receiving payments in cryptocurrencies that provides sellers with many capabilities and protects from many risks.  Quote from: Monopoli$T on July 13, 2018, 05:49:29 PM Tell me also can this project be compared to other projects doing the same? I cant say they are better or not.  By the second quarter, LIQNET did not have a single efficient competitor on the global market. Exchanges-aggregators are being developed and sooner or later will open for traders, but by this time LIQNET will gain valuable experience and a large client base.

The discount is activated for 24 hours right after the  the withdrawal of tokens or at the set date. Greetings   Thank you for your questions and additions! So, as for the benefits for the Token Holders and the possibilities that the Token offers, we have the following : On the developing cryptocurrencies market, the LIQNET's ICO may be one of the few options for investors to enter the cryptocurrency services and exchanges market through a finished elaborated project. Our ICO stands out from the majority of the others because it is not just an idea. It is a real product ready for launch. It will be able to increase its competitive advantages and allow us to develop exponentially with the help of tokenization. LEN token holders will get a discount on the exchange's fees of up to 90% depending on the number of tokens spent on it. Purchase a discount on fees: one token gives a 0,5% discount on the sum of fees for one day. The discount if activated for 24 hours in the personal account immediately after the withdrawal of tokens or at a particular time. Increment size is 0,5%, the highest possible discount is 90%. The timing of the discount can be chosen in the personal account. The platform allows to use the purchased LEN tokens and offers the holders the ability to get discounts and the right to vote on the way the funds received by the system are allocated. LEN token holders get access to the voting service to decide on the following crucial matters: ●Choice of trading pairs that should be present on the exchange — initially, the system has only one or two pairs, and the token holders choose the first 20 pairs, which will be added to the system immediately after the ICO; ●Choice of the ways of spending 50% of collected fees: ○ selection of additional trading pairs to be added to the exchange during the later work, except for the pairs that will be added by the LIQNET developers; ○ an increase of the exchange's marketing budget; ○ expansion of deposits in other exchanges to provide better liquidity on the LIQNET platform; ○ choice of additional sources of liquidity for LIQNET, except for those added by the LIQNET developers; ○ a buy-out of tokens on our platform at current prices to support the demand for them. Doing this will help to avoid the sales of the tokens at low prices, and, therefore, prevent the users from having access to super cheap discounts in large amounts — this may lead to the substantial decrease in the volume of the exchange's fees.",False

It collects liquidity using both classic methods and a standalone mechanism that uses the in-house LEN technology. LEN is a mechanism that through an API allows to collect and combine data on requests to sell/buy from many cryptocurrency exchanges located anywhere in the world and to form a unified order book. LEN aggregates requests into a single stream, and because of that users can make deals at the most favorable price with a minimal spread. LEN allows the LIQNET system to get an improved model from the standard model of market depth. The new model offers added liquidity at the intersection of supply and demand. As a result, LIQNET users work with a unified order book, which contains both orders of clients of this exchange and orders relayed from other platforms.

Our ICO stands out from the majority of the others because it is not just an idea. It is a real product ready for launch. It will be able to increase its competitive advantages and allow us to develop exponentially with the help of tokenization. Quote from: Garag on July 09, 2018, 09:55:52 PM Why do they give better solution than any other crypto project? Hello) LIQNET allows to unite liquidity from different platforms and solve the problem of scattering of users, their trading requests, and orders, thus forming a unified order book with better market depth and better prices for private persons and legal entities from various jurisdictions. Liquidity for the LIQNET exchange is collected both by classical methods and by a separate mechanism based on the LEN technology of our own design. The LEN mechanism (Liquidity Exchange Network) collects and consolidates LIQNET exchange clients orders and orders from third-party platforms into a single order book and makes them available for trading to all LIQNET clients.

Hi) I can give you the answer if you don`t mind) What makes the LIQNET exchange unique is the LEN (Liquidity Exchange Network) tool, which allows to collect and combine orders of our exchange's clients and orders from third-party platforms into a single order package and make them available for trading by all LIQNET's clients. The holders of the LEN tokens get privileged terms. Other advantages of LIQNET: 1.Desktop apps (own desktop app, MultiCharts, TradingView, and MT5). 2.Fully functional mobile trading apps for Android and iOS. 3.An online-wallet project that provides the ability to exchange cryptocurrencies and fiat money by the press of a button.

One token gives a 0,5% discount on the sum of fees for one day. The discount is activated for 24 hours in the personal account right after the withdrawal of tokens or at the set time. Increment size is 0,5%, the highest possible discount is 90%. The timing of the discount can be chosen in the personal account. For example, 10% discount on the fees for a day costs 20 tokens, 50% discount for a week requires 700 tokens. LEN token holders get access to the voting service to decide on the following crucial matters: ●   Choice of trading pairs that should be present on the exchange — initially, the system has only one or two pairs, and the token holders choose the first 20 pairs, which will be added to the system immediately after the ICO; ●   Choice of the ways of spending 50% of collected fees.

By the end of the decade, global cryptocurrency trading is scattered among various platforms, which led to severe fragmentation of liquidity. The lower the liquidity, the lower the average volume of a trading position in comparison to stock   It isn't a bad thing per se to have hundreds of exchanges as they also compete with each other for offering the best prices and security.  Today, the number of exchanges has grown so much that the market needs unification to be able to continue to develop as a single organism. Users and their assets are split; therefore, liquidity is split, too. Cryptocurrencies should unite people, companies, and financial streams, but the fragmentation of trading over several platforms leads to increased volatility of many cryptographic currencies and assets. This scares traditional investors away from investing in cryptocurrencies. Low level of liquidity and considerable spreads don't help the development of the cryptocurrency industry. Naturally, exchanges should seek to get into a unified trading place to be able to use the combined liquidity to increase revenue. The abundance of exchange and trade tools on the market should also be critically reviewed. At first glance, the market is filled with stock and cryptocurrency exchanges. However, when filtered by such parameters as reliability, accessibility for end users (many exchanges are selective in allowing residents of different countries and jurisdictions to trade), ability to trade with required tools (fiduciary currencies included), the choice is narrowed drastically, and the illusion of abundance goes away. At the remaining optimal exchanges, liquidity will be limited. Therefore, during a market move or when buying or selling a significant amount of funds, a trader risks to fail to get the required amount or get it at an unacceptable price. We solved this problem by uniting liquidity streams from different platforms into one order book.   Quote from: caecoli on July 10, 2018, 01:41:36 PM The project looks quite promising.

By the second quarter, LIQNET did not have a single efficient competitor on the global market. LIQNET differs from other exchanges in that a liquidity for the LIQNET exchange is collected both by classical methods and by a separate mechanism based on the LEN technology of our own design. The LEN mechanism (Liquidity Exchange Network) collects and consolidates LIQNET exchange clients orders and orders from third-party platforms into a single order book and makes them available for trading to all LIQNET clients.

Users and their assets are split; therefore, liquidity is split, too. Cryptocurrencies should unite people, companies, and financial streams, but the fragmentation of trading over several platforms leads to increased volatility of many cryptographic currencies and assets. This scares traditional investors away from investing in cryptocurrencies. Low level of liquidity and considerable spreads don't help the development of the cryptocurrency industry. Naturally, exchanges should seek to get into a unified trading place to be able to use the combined liquidity to increase revenue. The abundance of exchange and trade tools on the market should also be critically reviewed. At first glance, the market is filled with stock and cryptocurrency exchanges. However, when filtered by such parameters as reliability, accessibility for end users (many exchanges are selective in allowing residents of different countries and jurisdictions to trade), ability to trade with required tools (fiduciary currencies included), the choice is narrowed drastically, and the illusion of abundance goes away. At the remaining optimal exchanges, liquidity will be limited. Therefore, during a market move or when buying or selling a significant amount of funds, a trader risks to fail to get the required amount or get it at an unacceptable price. We solved this problem by uniting liquidity streams from different platforms into one order book. Quote from: GOZIC on July 08, 2018, 05:20:18 PM   I think that is not quete clear.

The security of the server side has been thoroughly tested. To ensure the security of user data and tools, we implemented the following protective measures: - two-step authentication; - system of replicated geo-distributed servers with the possibility of scaling; - geo-distributed array of hot, conditionally hot, cold wallets, as well as addresses with a multisignature for each cryptocurrency; - a background clearing system that checks the correctness of current balances and I/Os between full cross-sections, and when a discrepancy registers a dangerous state, it transfers funds to cold wallets and multisignature addresses.

We will take into account your proposal) As for now LEN has one pressing issue: not all exchanges offer a trading pair with USD, some trade cryptocurrencies directly for national currencies. The solution is to make interactions in LEN more complex: national currencies can be transmitted by connecting a currency gateway and quoting these pairs with their exchange rate to the dollar in mind and then into the main blotter. In this case, unfortunately, fees for currency conversion are added. Economic calculations prove that it is better to pay an additional fee and get cheaper liquidity so that this feature will be implemented by Q3 2018.

We are thankful for your feedback! Quote from: DyxLEzz on June 21, 2018, 10:51:57 AM What is the LEN technology? Hi) Let me explain: LEN is a mechanism that allows you to collect and aggregate data on buy/sell requests through an API from a variety of cryptoexchanges located anywhere in the world and form a single order book. LEN aggregates orders into a single stream, so users can make deals at the best prices with a minimum spread. LEN allows the LIQNET system to obtain from the standard depth model an improved model with additional liquidity at the meeting point of supply and demand. As a result, LIQNET users work with a single order book, in which both the orders of the clients of this exchange are presented, as well as retranslated orders from other sites.

The server side of the LIQNET platform is a private cloud, which is composed of physical servers in several locations and client terminals (currently, one terminal for web browsers). The security of the server side has been thoroughly tested. To ensure the security of user data and tools, we implemented the following protective measures: - two-step authentication; - system of replicated geo-distributed servers with the possibility of scaling; - geo-distributed array of hot, conditionally hot, cold wallets, as well as addresses with a multisignature for each cryptocurrency; - a background clearing system that checks the correctness of current balances and I/Os between full cross-sections, and when a discrepancy registers a dangerous state, it transfers funds to cold wallets and multisignature addresses.

The holders of the LEN tokens get privileged terms. Other advantages of LIQNET: 1. Desktop apps (own desktop app, MultiCharts, TradingView, and MT5). 2. Fully functional mobile trading apps for Android and iOS. 3. An online-wallet project that provides the ability to exchange cryptocurrencies and fiat money by the press of a button. Additionally, it has the easy cryptocurrency investment service with free and paid built-in strategies. 4.

Quote from: GeRa_182 on June 13, 2018, 12:46:37 PM What categories competitive environment LIQNET?  Several categories represent the competitive environment of LIQNET:  1. Classic cryptocurrency exchanges with which LIQNET works as a client by using the LEN mechanism. It connects to them through an API and executes a significant number of trading operations thus increasing the competitor's turnover and pays fees for every operation, therefore, making profits for the competitor.  2. Forex brokers who are offering to trade the BTC-USD and other cryptocurrencies pairs. They are not considered direct competitors because they work with non-deliverable CFD contracts on the price difference. Cryptocurrency can be bought from them, but it can't be withdrawn.  3. B2BX project. It is not an aggregator of real cryptocurrency liquidity. It would be more proper to consider it as an offer to brokers to implement trading of contracts on the difference between prices in BTC and ETH, an attempt to connect brokers and their clients, who trade to lower the brokers' risks of changing prices of cryptocurrencies. Because non-covered risks will have to be covered on the markets with an actual shipment of assets anyway, LIQNET will be the best solution for that. In other words, B2BX is not a competitor, but LIQNET's potential client.  4. Futures contracts from CME Group, CBOE.  A futures contract on Bitcoin index put on the market is not a competitor to LIQNET. If the possibility of an arbitrage appears, traders need a place to buy or sell the base asset. Because the index is calculated based on the data from four cryptoexchanges, each of which is a supplier of liquidity, LIQNET is the optimal platform for that, because it provides the maximum volume of liquidity for the best price.

Greetings) The blockchain technology is based on the distributed computer network with cryptographic-based security and a particular protocol of network nodes interactions — accumulation of information in a block and its further verification by all nodes. The blockchain is the core of all cryptocurrencies, so the prospects of its development directly influence the future of the whole market. Conspicuously, the obstacles to the technology's development mostly pertain to the low level of understanding of the technology itself — for example, it is one of the reasons for the governmental rejection of the technology. This is common for every new technology that is aimed at changing existing foundations of society. At the dawn of its development, Internet has faced similar problems. On the other hand, the prospects that blockchain offers are capable of drastically improving the current situation in the world and first of all in the monetary field.",False

I know that holders of this token receive a discount on the exchange Commission up to 90%  Exactly. Thanks for support   Also LEN token holders get access to the voting service to decide on the following crucial matters: ●   Choice of trading pairs that should be present on the exchange — initially, the system has only one or two pairs, and the token holders choose the first 20 pairs, which will be added to the system immediately after the ICO; ●   Choice of the ways of spending 50% of collected fees: ○   selection of additional trading pairs to be added to the exchange during the later work, except for the pairs that will be added by the LIQNET developers; ○   an increase of the exchange's marketing budget; ○   expansion of deposits in other exchanges to provide better liquidity on the LIQNET platform; ○   choice of additional sources of liquidity for LIQNET, except for those added by the LIQNET developers; ○   a buy-out of tokens on our platform at current prices to support the demand for them. Doing this will help to avoid the sales of the tokens at low prices, and, therefore, prevent the users from having access to super cheap discounts in large amounts — this may lead to the substantial decrease in the volume of the exchange's fees.

The standard way to increase the liquidity and trading volumes is to connect an API of a platform to automated trading systems (trading robots). Almost all cryptoexchanges provide such trading APIs.

Quote from: GOZIC on June 09, 2018, 11:50:01 AM What is necessary to connect crypto-exchange to LEN?  To connect a cryptocurrency exchange to LEN, a user should register an account, deposit some money, and implement a particular LEN module that uses the exchange's open API.

It's ok You do the right thing, that you ask your question LEN has one pressing issue: not all exchanges offer a trading pair with USD, some trade cryptocurrencies directly for national currencies. But don't worry, the solution is to make interactions in LEN more complex: national currencies can be transmitted by connecting a currency gateway and quoting these pairs with their exchange rate to the dollar in mind and then into the main blotter. In this case, unfortunately, fees for currency conversion are added.

Our ICO stands out from the majority of the others because it is not just an idea. It is a real product ready for launch. It will be able to increase its competitive advantages and allow us to develop exponentially with the help of tokenization.  LEN token holders will get a discount on the exchange's fees of up to 90% depending on the number of tokens spent on it.  LEN token holders get access to the voting service to decide on the following crucial matters: ●   Choice of trading pairs that should be present on the exchange — initially, the system has only one or two pairs, and the token holders choose the first 20 pairs, which will be added to the system immediately after the ICO; ●   Choice of the ways of spending 50% of collected fees: ○   selection of additional trading pairs to be added to the exchange during the later work, except for the pairs that will be added by the LIQNET developers; ○   an increase of the exchange's marketing budget; ○   expansion of deposits in other exchanges to provide better liquidity on the LIQNET platform; ○   choice of additional sources of liquidity for LIQNET, except for those added by the LIQNET developers; ○   a buy-out of tokens on our platform at current prices to support the demand for them. Doing this will help to avoid the sales of the tokens at low prices, and, therefore, prevent the users from having access to super cheap discounts in large amounts — this may lead to the substantial decrease in the volume of the exchange's fees.",False

Therefore, during a market move or when buying or selling a significant amount of funds, a trader risks to fail to get the required amount or get it at an unacceptable price. We solved this problem by uniting liquidity streams from different platforms into one order book.  The basis of the LIQNET project is a secure cryptocurrency exchange. It collects liquidity using both classic methods and a standalone mechanism that uses the in-house LEN technology. LEN is a mechanism that through an API allows to collect and combine data on requests to sell/buy from many cryptocurrency exchanges located anywhere in the world and to form a unified order book. LEN aggregates requests into a single stream, and because of that users can make deals at the most favorable price with a minimal spread.

Users and their assets are split; therefore, liquidity is split, too. Cryptocurrencies should unite people, companies, and financial streams, but the fragmentation of trading over several platforms leads to increased volatility of many cryptographic currencies and assets. This scares traditional investors away from investing in cryptocurrencies. Low level of liquidity and considerable spreads don't help the development of the cryptocurrency industry. Naturally, exchanges should seek to get into a unified trading place to be able to use the combined liquidity to increase revenue. The abundance of exchange and trade tools on the market should also be critically reviewed. At first glance, the market is filled with stock and cryptocurrency exchanges. However, when filtered by such parameters as reliability, accessibility for end users (many exchanges are selective in allowing residents of different countries and jurisdictions to trade), ability to trade with required tools (fiduciary currencies included), the choice is narrowed drastically, and the illusion of abundance goes away. At the remaining optimal exchanges, liquidity will be limited. Therefore, during a market move or when buying or selling a significant amount of funds, a trader risks to fail to get the required amount or get it at an unacceptable price. We solved this problem by uniting liquidity streams from different platforms into one order book.  The basis of the LIQNET project is a secure cryptocurrency exchange. It collects liquidity using both classic methods and a standalone mechanism that uses the in-house LEN technology.

LIQNET is a cryptoexchange, which allows to unite liquidity from different platforms and solve the problem of scattering of users, their trading requests, and orders, thus forming a unified order book with better market depth and better prices for private persons and legal entities from various jurisdictions. What makes the LIQNET exchange unique is the LEN (Liquidity Exchange Network) tool, which allows to collect and combine orders of our exchange's clients and orders from third-party platforms into a single order package and make them available for trading by all LIQNET's clients. The holders of the LEN tokens get privileged terms.  Today, the number of exchanges has grown so much that the market needs unification to be able to continue to develop as a single organism. Users and their assets are split; therefore, liquidity is split, too. Cryptocurrencies should unite people, companies, and financial streams, but the fragmentation of trading over several platforms leads to increased volatility of many cryptographic currencies and assets. This scares traditional investors away from investing in cryptocurrencies. Low level of liquidity and considerable spreads don't help the development of the cryptocurrency industry. Naturally, exchanges should seek to get into a unified trading place to be able to use the combined liquidity to increase revenue. The abundance of exchange and trade tools on the market should also be critically reviewed. At first glance, the market is filled with stock and cryptocurrency exchanges. However, when filtered by such parameters as reliability, accessibility for end users (many exchanges are selective in allowing residents of different countries and jurisdictions to trade), ability to trade with required tools (fiduciary currencies included), the choice is narrowed drastically, and the illusion of abundance goes away. At the remaining optimal exchanges, liquidity will be limited. Therefore, during a market move or when buying or selling a significant amount of funds, a trader risks to fail to get the required amount or get it at an unacceptable price. We solved this problem by uniting liquidity streams from different platforms into one order book.",False
