The system encourages the exchange of experience and expertise in all areas. Neural networks and AI products will be launched on the platform after a period of learning.  Project Mission  The main mission of the project is optimizing the exchange of works and other scientific information between scientists around the world. We believe that only under conditions of symbiosis will the world science be able to move towards scientific breakthroughs. We wish to create a community in the framework of which scientists from all over the world can support each other. We are here to pass on our knowledge.  Project Idea  The idea of Globex Sci is to create an ecosystem for storing and using large sets of data with scholarly manuscripts, public data, experimental and clinical data and test results published in the blockchain. Through the use of deep learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, we strive to accurately predict results, for example, the response of an individual patient to specific drugs, thereby increasing their effectiveness and minimizing side effects.    Globex Sci is an ecosystem that stores and allows to use big data arrays, published in blockchain. By employing algorithms of deep learning and AI, we can predict the success of new developments, thus, increasing the efficiency of work. This will allow developing successful solutions in the shortest time.   Globes Sci operation scheme  Databases of academic papers are aggregated in a single array. Search engines provide user access to the system. Machine learning determines patterns, processes new data. Ecosystem routes and processes data, writes algorithms using artificial intelligence. Ecosystem mechanics allows to model and predict the success of a scientific development. As a result of modeling, successful solutions are being developed in a short time.  Advantages:  ► One-of-a-kind interactive platform ► Scientists exchange knowledge and experience and get rewards ► Copyright protection ► The target audience is specialized but is spread all around the world ► The system is synchronized with the trends and technologies of the future: it is constantly advancing and scaling ► User-friendly interface and information delivery. Easy to find all the necessary information ► In the framework of the system, new products are being developed in the spheres of biology and genetic engineering ► The system can scale and create new vectors of development  Benefits:  ►Quick access to the database saves time and resources ►Receiving profit and rewarding authors ►The products created as a result of testing and modeling allow making a breakthrough in a short time ► The possibility of creating a fund that allocates 10% of the network commission for the development of the ecosystem      The crowdsale of the GlobexSci research platform will have two stages: Pre-ICO and ICO.  Purchase currency: Pre-ICO – ETH; ICO - BTC, ETH. Token name: GSI Price: 1 GSI = 0,03 ETH The minimum amount required to start the project: 3 000 ETH Predicted amount: 60 000 ETH  Pre-ICO  The first stage of the crowdsale is Pre-ICO. It will start on December 6, 2017. The duration of the Pre-ICO is one month. The goal of this stage is to get an amount of 3 000 ETH. Maximum number of tokens to sale at the Pre-ICO: 140 000 GSI All raised funds will be used to launch the project.  pre-ICO funds allocation:    Goals and Objectives of the Pre-ICO: To test the system and make necessary corrections before the ICO starts All funds raised during the Pre-ICO will be used to launch the project, so that at the ICO stage the team would be able to present ready-made developments on the project to the community and investors. ICO The main stage of the crowdsale will take place one month after the end of the Pre-ICO. Date: February 13, 2018. Duration: 2 months.  The cost of implementing all the stages of the project aimed at modeling how human organs work will amount to 57 000 ETH.  Minimum sum to collect: 8 600 ETH Maximum sum to collect: 57 000 ETH   ICO funds allocation:   Bonuses system  The system of giving additional GSI tokens in the form of bonuses for investors will be employed during the ICO GlobexSci crowdsale. The bonuses will be calculated according to the time at which the purchase takes place:  pre-ICO: Week 1-4 → 40%  ICO: Week 1 → 35% Week 2 → 30% Week 3 → 25% Week 4 → 20% Week 5 → 15% Week 6 → 10% Week 7 → 5% Week 8 → 0%   The principles of GSI token usage  GSI token is the key to using the GlobexSci platform  The GlobexSci platform will provide services to all comers, from a student to a scientific community. The tokens will be used to access the research and development blockchain platform. The services that the platform provides will be paid with GSI tokens using the system of smart contracts. Potential users who did not participate in the ICO will be able to buy GSI tokens in the future at the public cryptocurrency exchanges.  Services provided for tokens:  Saving scientific materials in the blockchain to verify authorship. Saving massive data sets in the blockchain or in another form on the platform. Providing paid access to data arrays. Performing distributed statistical analysis and mathematical processing of data. Distributed machine learning, in particular, training of neural networks. Creating products in the form of external API based on mathematical models trained in the blockchain. Developing a platform for biological systems modeling.  Token type: utility, tradeable at the exchange  The main functional tool of the platform, until the platform will move to its own blockchain, and also the object of purchase at the ICO crowdsale is the GSI (GlobexSci) token.  The GSI token will be issued on the Ethereum platform. Its design will comply with widely accepted standards for the use of tokens. As the platform evolves and its own blockchain is developed, the GSI token will be exchanged for the new internal currency of the future blockchain system. A finite number of tokens (2,765,000 GSI) will be issued without the possibility of an additional emission.  Token distribution  Explanation:  97,83% of all tokens will be distributed among the investors. 2,2% will be used for a bounty program. All unsold tokens will be “burned”.  Legal Aspects  GSI tokens are issued on the Ethereum platform on the base of ERC20. The team intends to use tokens to provide P2P-interaction within the platform between its participants.  Globex SCI does not give token holders an ownership right or share in the business of the Team, does not give the right to advisory participation in the business processes and activities of the project, management, and does not provide any other direct or indirect rights, except for the opportunity to receive rewards, described and stipulated by conditions of this White Paper.  GSI tokens do not possess the features of a security, are not securities and cannot be considered as them.  Tokens were not registered and will not be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933 as amended (the ""Securities Act"") and may not be offered or sold in the US or in the interests of US residents (as defined in Regulation S in accordance with the Securities Act), unless they are properly registered or subject to registration requirements under the Securities Act.  Tokens are not offered to residents or citizens of the US. The cost of the tokens is not refundable. Potential holders of tokens should make an informed decision to acquire tokens, independently assess and independently bear all the risks associated with this decision.  The dates specified in this White Paper are exemplary, there is no guarantee that the project will be put into operation within a certain period of time.  The Globex SCI Team will carefully inspect the legal aspects of our activities in all markets (in all countries) in which our project will be implemented.  ___________________________  We are about to introduce our team and give out the follow links pretty shortly. Stay tuned!",False
