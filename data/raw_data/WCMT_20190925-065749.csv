It is a unique project, which has no analogs in the world today. At the first stage development and start of the main product - the interactive virtual cryptomuseum with full 3D visualization – is supposed. Here each visitor from any country of the world will have a remarkable opportunity to get acquainted with the main historical milestones of development of cryptocurrencies, from the moment of origin of unique technology to the present stages of development, to see the exclusive exhibits both relating to the time of emergence of virtual coins, and to which have become popular and known today. In the cryptomuseum users will be able to choose and to purchase pleasant souvenirs devoted to the subject of cryptocurrencies. At the next stage opening of the full-fledged real museums in the different cities worldwide is supposed. The choice of location of the museum will be not accidental, it will be carefully selected, proceeding from certain parameters. First of all, the preference will be received by the cities where events which possess historical and global value for development of cryptocurrencies took place. For example, London, San Francisco, Tokyo. It will become a profitable project for potential investors.   The project of the cryptomuseum (entrance) is and will be developed further by the following address: crypto-museum.com  TARGET AUDIENCE The target audience of the project WorldCryptoMuseum is huge. The museum will be able to attract interest as among adult population, beginners, experienced users, specialists, and also among youth, teenagers and even pupils of elementary grades. Today cryptocurrencies acquire increasing popularity, but the difficulty is that there is no universal information base relating to the subject. Our project will be able to resolve the matter, increasing the level of knowledge on cryptocurrency among a wide range of users. The planned attendance of the virtual museum, by our estimation, will make not less than 50 000 people a day.  PRINCIPLE OF WORK AND COST OF THE ENTRANCE WorldCryptoMuseum is a full online project, based on 3D - visualization. The access is open for each user in the presence of connection to the Internet, computer, notebook, tablet and smartphone. Thanks to modern technologies visitors will be able to see in all details not only the exhibits provided in the museum, but also others users who will attentively study virtual exposures at the same time. Besides, the audience will be given a unique opportunity to communicate with each other, to share the impressions or recommendations what hall should be visited, the last news to tell, the purchased souvenirs. In such mode visitors, directly familiar with technology a blockchain and cryptocurrencies, and those who have information on the provided exposures and exhibits, can act as guides.  It will help to increase the level of knowledge in this area among users who are not so prepared. The project possesses the convenient interface and intuitive and clear management. In order to freely move in virtual halls, to study exposures and even to touch to exhibits, a rather standard computer keyboard and a mouse are enough. Also, additional entertaining opportunities are provided for visitors which will help to make the process of visit of the museum fascinating and memorable. These are some kind of mini-games, in which the user will be able to collect own first farm for a mining. With the help of the application visitors will get acquainted with one of the key technologies that is connected with cryptocurrencies and will also be able to mine independently.  The cost of an entrance to the virtual museum is fixed for each visitor regardless of age and location, and it is $1. It is possible to pay with the help of any popular cryptocurrency (BTC, Ethereum, etc.). and fiat money. A principal currency for payment acceptance is Ethereum, and each payment will be converted in ETH. A visitor of the museum, after having paid an entrance fee, gets access to all opportunities and exposures of the interactive museum. The unique electronic certificate is provided (code) as the ticket. The certificate needs to be activated directly on the website of the virtual museum. Note: Initially we wanted to use project tokens for an entrance to the museum, but after long reflections we decided to refuse this idea, because it can lead to increase of a course of tokens and impossibility for most of people to visit the museum. BUT, if investors decide that such option is better - we surely will listen to them and we will make the decision taking into account the opinion of the majority.  All information on the carried-out transactions is brought in Ethereum blockchain, it allows to monitor each payment made in system. It would be rather easy to count real attendance of the museum this way. After activation of a code the visitor gets the access to the virtual platform within 24 hours. The code begins to work from the moment of his activation, prior to this procedure there is no restriction of validity period of the received certificate. It gives the excellent chance to use purchased certificate as a gift to another user, or it could be exchanged or sold.   TO POTENTIAL INVESTORS  By our calculations, investments into the project will already pay off completely in 12 months. Let us briefly explain the main stages of implementation of our project: ICO procedure will last 28 days. After the investment attraction in the planned amount is completed, the project will begin to actively implement the ideas described in Whitepaper. We already have a team of developers and also a contract with a manufacturer of souvenir production. After starting the virtual platform and creating the electronic knowledge base, the following stage begins – the construction of the real museums in the different large cities of the world. When the construction is completed, the owners of the tokens will be able to receive dividends in the form of profits from the sale of entrance tickets and souvenirs. The distribution of dividends will occur on the wallets of the owners of the tokens every quarter, from 20 to 25 of each reporting month.  WHAT ARE WCMT TOKENS FOR? WCMT (worldcryptomuseum tokens) are tokens of the WorldCryptoMuseum project, a specific stock analog. By purchasing tokens, you can receive income in the form of dividends. Profit is paid to all holders of tokens. Also, tokens will be added on every popular exchange where they can be sold/purchased depending on market situation.  Profit distribution:  50% of electronic ticket sales; 25% of the sale of souvenirs from an online store and built museums; 25% of all ticket sales in real museums;  TOKEN SALE WCM offers to participate in the sale of WCM tokens. At Pre ICO, we plan to raise up to 20% of the funds to finance the project.  Address of Pre ICO: wcmt.co  Smart contract address: 0x638dB321775E03cf4c29207E0Bb228BbAFb76460  Address of tokens: 0x742686bB1B136b396b59818F42e47a4fC3509394  The share of token distribution among investors is 85% of the total number of WCMT tokens. 15% of the released tokens will go to pre-ICO developers (the development team). Tokens for creators are issued when investors transfer funds to the address of the contract.  We also allocated a pool for the bounty program during the Pre ICO. Immediately after the start of sales, 150,000 WCMT will be issued for the Bounty program, which is equivalent to 150 ETH (~ $ 45,000).  WCMT tokens can be purchased for ETH only, by sending Ethereum to the address of the smart contract. Tokens are issued instantly and only when ETH is transferred to the address of the smart contract. The course during the Pre ICO is 1 ETH = 1000 WCMT (for 1 ETH you can get 1000 WCMT tokens).  The maximum collection level (HardCap) on Pre ICO is set at 3500 ETH. When this boundary is reached, the release and sale of new tokens will cease.   The sale of tokens begins at 10:00 on October 26, 2017 (GMT).  There is a bonus program for buying tokens during Pre ICO*:  1 week = 100% (quantity of tokens * 2) 2 week = 60% (quantity of tokens * 1,6) 3 week = 40% (quantity of tokens * 1,4) 4 week = 25% (quantity of tokens * 1,25)  * - The bonus scale for tokens does not extend to founders (i.e. founders do not get any bonuses).  The sale of tokens will end at 10:00 on November 23, 2017 on (GMT), or at achievement of the maximum level (HardCap).  After completion of the procedure of Pre ICO, we will start implementation of plans for development of the cryptomuseum, the bank of knowledge and the sale of souvenirs. The main ICO will take place in 2 months, namely on January 20 at 10:00 on GMT (this date is mortgaged in the smart contract). The thread on the forum with information about the main ICO will appear a few days before this date.  * - on all emerging questions you can contact us in Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, forum, and email: info@wcmt.co  BOUNTY   BOUNTY THREAD Rules and Rewards (pdf-file): click here Total Tokens for Bounty = 150000 WCMT  USE OF THE RAISED FUNDS  Distribution:  Beginning of development of the interactive 3D-museum with initial functionality — 1700 ETH Marketing and promotion of the 3D museum, placement of the presentation of the project in media  — 1400 ETH Start of sales of souvenirs through our partner (through Adwords and social networks (Facebook, Instagram) – 400 ETH  * - thus we are going to begin to get profit directly after carrying out Pre-ICO.

Owners of tokens will receive a profit of a certain percentage (50% from sales of electronic tickets, 25% from sales of souvenirs). I'll give an example: we earned $ 100,000, $ 50,000 - this will go to pay dividends. This amount is divided by the number of shares (tokens). Thus, the more tokens, the greater the dividends.  The price of tokens on the exchange will not affect the payment of dividends. The price of tokens can fall or grow depending on the market conditions. Tokens can be purchased to receive dividends in the Pre ICO and ICO, or on the exchange after the end of the ICO. Payments will be made every quarter from the 20th to the 25th of the reporting month. We will also find an independent audit firm that will conduct the audit, ensuring fair distribution.",False
