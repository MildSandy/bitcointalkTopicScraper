An increasing number of retailers struggle because these commissions together with the discounts offered represent too high a proportion of their margins.   As a result, to protect margins, retailers often end up giving lackluster promotions that are either unattractive or with unrealistic terms – alienating the very target user group they set out to attract.",False
