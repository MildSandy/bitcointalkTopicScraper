As electricity suppliers to their members/customers, energy cooperatives becomes our first link to the European energy market and the European electricity consumer.  However, Pylon Network is designed as an open-source tool for cooperation between all players of the energy market. This means that once our platform is demonstrated in partnership with energy cooperatives in Europe (our demonstration partners are GoiEner from the Basque country in Spain) any player who wishes, will be able to integrate their operation on Pylon Network, potentially with no cost.  By taking out the commercial exploitation from the core operation of the platform and adding all benefits of blockchain (trust, transparency, traceability) is how Pylon Network aims to expand to more players who want (or are committed/obliged) to make their operation more efficient and green.  Necessary condition for a future adoption by many players/markets is the demonstration of the benefits  of our blockchain algorithm (i.e. scalability potential & green mining consumption), which we will validate through the later stages of Pylon demonstration.  It won't happen within a day. It is a long process and has been longer than it should. Our only aim is to accelerate it and the more the better..

They already have projects running ion building microcommunities with various European Utilities as well as a large project with a Transmission System Operator.  The problems with peer to peer transactions energy transactions are of two main origins. 1. legal limitations for a non utility related energy producer to sell against value to another common citizen 2. transmission and distribution costs to be paid to the Grid Operator.  Prosume has solved both these points in order to build a very strong business case from day one.,False

The pilot project will be funded by the ICO which is currently live.  We have partnered up with GoiEner - an energy cooperative from the Basque country with 8,000 members - and we are in talks with numerous others around Europe. Energy cooperatives are well-defined players of the enegy market (especially in Europe - 650k members and growing) and through them we access the market and we bring consumers together with producers of solar energy of all scales (from prosumers in households to large scale solar PV).  At the same time, Pylon Network is open for everyone to implement a model for trading electricity built around Pylon Coin - including utilities. However, at the moment we are focusing on the demonstration of our platform within the real market, together with our partners. Among our partners are Faircoop: a team of experienced blockchain code developers that have developed their own ""Proof-of-Cooperation"" consesus. Together we are developing Pylon Coin code which is based on Proof of Cooperation and minimizes the energy footprint of the platform.  In few words, Pylon Network offers the most realistic implementation plan and a very strong team of developers, engineers, advisors and partners.",False

The project seems interesting however, Pylon Network offers much more than a P-2-P platform for electricity exchange. Pylon Network provides the framework for the creation of a self-governed energy-based economy, built around renewable energy.  At the same time, we have solved both of the problems you are mentioning and our model is applicable in the rest of EU, not only on one country. Our platform is not restricted to exclusive use and is open to all energy cooperatives who want to adopt it to their specific needs.  Again, thanks for your comment and good luck with your project!

There is a huge legislative/market risk associated with most ICOs of the ""energy exchange marketplaces"" genre!  The fact that you are addressing that shows that you have looked in some parameters which are critical - like we have!  So, I will wish best of luck to both of our projects, since they are both trying to solve a huge problem. The more innovative business models for the energy transformation, the merrier!

Pylon Network brings together green energy producers of all scales and consumers, creating a peer-to-peer basis for exchanging electricity - directly from producer to consumer. So, we actually remove the necessity for intermediaries. At the same time we introduce Pylon Coin as a payment method for all energy transactions; Pylon Coin is designed to utilize and reward the excess renewable electricity from any installation, reducing - in that way - the payback period of the investment.  This is what we refer to as ""Green Mining"" in our White Paper, which you can find here:https://pylon-network.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/170730_WP-PYLON_EN.pdf  Pylon Network is implemented within the operational scope of renewable energy cooperatives - we start with a demonstration project within the electricity grid of Spain, in partnership with the energy cooperative GoiEner. The pilot project will be funded by the ICO which is currently live.  All info can be found in our website: https://pylon-network.org/  If you want to dig in further in the project and get an overall idea of the project (besides the white paper), make sure you give a look at the FAQ and Blog sections.   Feel free to ask if you have more questions. I am here to help!  Thanks for your interest.  Cheers!",False

Of course, we had the chance to‚Ä¶mention Pylon Network and engage to a dialogue for exploring future collaborations and demonstration of the blockchain technology as a tool for energy democratization.  It also, ‚Äúhappened‚Äù that Greenpeace was organizing the same day a conference with all Spanish energy cooperatives invited. And it happened that we mentioned Pylon to them, too‚Ä¶  We are very fond of the cooperative model and we want Pylon to be an open environment and a scalable tool to accommodate all cooperatives who want to empower communities through democratization of green energy assets and decision-making about such a basic commodity as energy, at local level.

Klenergy and Pylon Network  Among the selected startups is Klenergy, which works on The Pylon Network. Its CEO and founder, Gerard Bel, explains: ""Pylon Network is a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy exchange platform based on blockchain technology. All transactions occur without intermediaries and with the use of Pylon-Coin, which is used to pay for the energy exchanged through Pylon Network. It was designed specifically, to reward the production of Renewable Energy (RE) in order to accelerate their implementation in a de-centralised framework by making RE investments more attractive. Pylon Network is an ambitious, yet feasible project, which we are here to demonstrate the value creation from decentralization of energy generation, within the Spanish energy market. This will be the first implementation of blockchain technology in the energy sector, at such a large scale ‚Äì 800 people are going to participate in the pilot demonstration stage. It is definitely the most innovative and large-scale project for Europe and maybe, even globally"".  South Summit Startup Competition  Among the criteria that have been taken into account for the selection of the hundred projects, five fundamental values stand out:  The innovation they bring to the market, Their economic viability, The scalability of their technology, The human team behind them Thether they are scalable or not.  Selected from a total of 3,500 projects - 53% international from more than 72 countries - the 100 startups selected come from countries like the United States, Israel, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Portugal, Italy, Mexico or Chile.

We might be dreamers (!) but, the reason you are mentioning, is why our approach and roadmap implementation does not deal with energy providers but energy cooperatives. This is our realistic plan to  enter the energy market structure and apply P2P trading and financial schemes at a large scale.  Taking into account the way the energy market is developing and the potential impact of blockchain, I find it hard to see the utilities not being interested in that - especially after the successful pilot demonstration through our energy cooperative partners.
