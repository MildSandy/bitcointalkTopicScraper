The aim of ACESO is to decrease the expenses of protecting a computer from malware to a minimum, where users will no longer have to pay for software, but for a service instead. Additionally, our solution decentralizes the earning center, and 90% of all earnings are put on a p2p model where a Researcher gets 30% and a Malware analyst – 60% of the computer protection fee.    [Youtube Video]    Tired of investing into ideas on whitepapers? We have working product!  As mentioned before, ACESO is based on our MVP, the commercially available WiperSoft Anti-malware (wipersoft.com), which is already operating in 100+ countries, with 1M+ users, and had a 950% sales growth in 2017.  WiperSoft is a powerful security tool that will help protect users from common computer threats, such as hijackers, adware, etc. It detects infections that may not be detected by other security tools of this kind. And if it is not able to delete a threat, users have the option of contacting the help desk, where they will be provided with a custom fix. While it is relatively new compared to other products in this industry, thousands of users choose WiperSoft to protect their computers every day.  ✓ In 2015, we created Anti-malware software. ✓ In 2016, we launched it for free and acquired more than 1 million users. ✓ In 2017, we've monetized it and got $300,000 in revenue.   Now we’re scaling Anti malware protection using Blockchain with a more advanced business model and a new brand name, ACESO NETWORK.  Solution  ACESO offers a totally different approach to keeping users  safe. We aim to create a platform where all could participate in cybersecurity and gain something, whether they are knowledgeable in the field or just someone browsing the Internet. The created platform would allow regular users to fix their malware issues in a much cheaper way, while malware specialists would earn income by providing malware samples/helping others solve their malware problems. It is a win-win situation for everyone.   This ACESO mechanism offers: ✓  End User – Clients pay for service, not software; ✓  Researchers – earn tokens by providing general blocks of information; ✓  Malware analysts –  earn more tokens by identifying malicious blocks. ✓  ACESO Network – ACESO will work as a security program, that acts much like an anti-virus. Users will be able to scan their computers with it in order to check whether their computer is infected with malware. Additional AVs will not be necessary as ACESO will have their functionality. Whether the computer is infected with adware or a data-stealing Trojan, the program will notify the user about it.    [Youtube Video]    So how will ACESO benefit you?  For regular users (those without knowledge or experience in the field):  You can keep your computer free of malware for much cheaper as you would only be paying when facing actual threats; You pay for a fix for malware, and not software; One computer fix costs $1. No more than $10 per year; Even if you lack the skills and experience in the field of malware, you have the option of becoming a malware researcher. A researcher is someone who simply browses the Internet and submits encountered malware samples, or makes system screenshots. Researchers get rewarded in tokens for their contribution; You get access to resources that may help you gain knowledge in this field.  Compared to traditional anti-virus solutions, ACESO is much more advantageous to regular users. Because you get the option of fixing your computer for $1, there will be no need to spend $40 on an anti-virus program. One fix for malware costs tokens equivalent to $1, and you get real-time protection and a couple of other features by just having tokens! So you’re essentially using anti-virus for free until you get an infection.  In addition, when buying a fix you’re actually rewarding those who directly contributed to creating it for you, as researchers get 30% and malware analysts get 60% of your reward.  For specialists or those who want to become one:  Instead of helping users for free on forums, you can earn money by doing the same thing; ACESO will provide material and guidelines on how to identify malware if you’re interested in becoming a malware analysts; The tokens you earn from helping users solve their malware problems can be exchanged to real money on cryptocurrency exchange services.    By giving 80% of control to users, we’re are able to provide the service for much cheaper. ACESO will ensure that all information going in and out of the market is encrypted and depersonalized to not contain any personal information. While malware fixes will go through our malware engine to ensure their effectiveness, the market will be fully decentralized.    What are ASO tokens?  ACESO Network, a leading developer in cybersecurity solutions, has received an Opinion Provision from the Bank of Lithuania, concluding that the ACESO token (ASO) is not a security.  Aceso tokens are strictly utilities that can be used in many different ways, such as:  Protecting a computer; Fixing a computer; Submitting any file for deeper analysis; Getting additional features; Earned ASO tokens can be exchanged for cryptocurrencies and cash;   DON'T MISS THIS EXCLUSIVE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN ACESO CYBERSECURITY NETWORK NOW!
