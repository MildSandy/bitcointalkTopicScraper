I installed it on my computer and checked that the app once opened has no need to insert any password. So any person who opens this app on my computer will be able to see my BTC amount of money, and maybe also send money without any password.  So... I checked the settings and no security, password or something like that. Could somebody help me out? Seems Copay has no support and don't know if this is too safe.",False

IMO it's the safer wallet a regular user can use without having to setup a cold storage or buy a hardware wallet.  They let you encrypt you wallet with a password, so you are safe from people opening your wallet without you knowing.  The maximum you can do on Copay is setup a PIN code of 4 digts in the Settings page.",False

Also Exodus recommended to use Copay for larger amounts so I thought... why not give it a try.  I also checked Electrum even so and I thought the interface is horrible...  Is Copay not secure enough?",False

I don't see how Electrum could be worst than Copay in the security aspect. It's also strange that in the same website, I see that they say this about Electrum:  ""Not friendly for newbies, and the reliance on external servers could present security threats.""  Even that Copay actually relies on a centralized service by default. This means a third party must be trusted to not hide or simulate payments.  In the end Electrum > Copay. But you shouldn't worry about using Copay as your wallet. I have used them for a while and it worked well without any problems.  Also, I think https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet is a better place to check most pros and cons from all the major wallets.   I also checked Electrum even so and I thought the interface is horrible... And yeah... Electrum's interface is awful.",False
