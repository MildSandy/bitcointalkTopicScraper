Voucher token called AIM (Alternative Investment Marketplace) initially rated as 0.001 ETH (ethereum). AIM token will allow its holders to pay for services and selected products at the HighCastle marketplace.  “The biggest digitalised investment marketplace in the world” due to its founders’ definition, HighCastle is using an open-architecture technology to digitalise alternative investments globally and enables online access to $1.7 trillion market of private securities worldwide. HighCastle’s token sale will help to leverage the real-time blockchain technology into the HighCastle ecosystem, which is designed for transparent and trusted trading.  The team that involves capital market, crypto, and programming experts, as well as the supervisory board of honored professionals with more than 30 years of bulk capital markets and investment banking experience each, has been developing the online platform for the last 18 months. HighCastle marketplace enables investors to diversify their portfolio, and resell their investments (private shares, bonds, loans) whenever they wish, trade any private or public security crossborder in fiat and cryptocurrencies. With HighCastle’s revolutionary Smartnote solution and Distributed Ledger Technology, it tends to achieve liquidity for private securities market, the same as liquidity was achieved earlier by predecessors in other market segments, i.e. p2p lending, now a multi-billion USD companies.  HighCastle Advisor Ugo Bechis, who is also an independent adviser of Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), and Co-Chair at Lafferty Brexit Council for Cards and Payments, comments on HighCastle AIM token sale: “One of the challenges of blockchain-based solutions is to fit their digital advanced features into established market practices and regulations tailored to the present. The HighCastle management addressed such a challenge with an open approach which combines its own internal digital and crypto expertise with contributions of professionals and advisers who have experienced the transformation of established practices into digital ones. The HighCastle solution aims at closing the gap between the existing alternative investment opportunities and the complexity of their trading and access by crypto and fiat investors in different markets - potentially trillions of dollars private placement deals worldwide to be closed finally online”.  According to Nitin Gaur, Advisor at HighCastle and Director At IBM Blockchain Labs: “The intent of digitalised investment marketplace is meant to bring efficiency and efficacy to alternative capital markets. Meaningful use of Blockchain will not only enable an efficient investment marketplace built on fundamental tenets of blockchain of trade, trust and transparency but also facilitate global reach creating a truly digital marketplace for investments worldwide.""  The majority of the proceeds received after the token sale closing on February 25, 2018, will be dedicated to the development of secondary market infrastructure, portfolio management tools, geographical expansion and legal compliance of the HighCastle investment platform with the regulation of UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). HighCastle’s long-term plan includes upgrading the HighCastle to Organized Trading Facility (MTF) under MIFID II and blockchain-powered Stock Exchange, opening listing and trading opportunity for digitalised public stocks along with alternative investments.  Ulyana Shtybel, Partner and Co-founder at HighCaste Capital, explains the token sale initiative: “We are engaging contributors into the token sale to help us build an investment marketplace that will ultimately open access to retail investors. For KYC/AML verification purpose, we will use the internal procedures and tools provided by our official partner Thomson Reuters, whilst blockchain solution Quorum from JP Morgan enables us to build the first investment marketplace driven by Distributed Ledger Technology. HighCastle will be also the first blockchain-based investment marketplace to be regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)”.
