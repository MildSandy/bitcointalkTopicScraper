The CRV Token represents a share of time-value of use of all properties in the portfolio. CRV Token holders will receive CROWD (Crowd Points) on an ongoing basis, proportional to number of CRV Tokens held and length of holding period. These CROWD can be used at all times to book for actual stays in all of the Crowdvilla properties. It is on the Ethereum Blockchain. Our smart contract has been audited by New Alchemy to ensure code quality and no loopholes are found.    Quote from: earthcoin on March 09, 2018, 08:03:36 PM Why do you guys decide to use the blockchain? I don't understand.  Blockchain allows Crowdvilla's tokens to be transparent. With the NPO (Non-profit organization) structure and the decentralized asset model, Crowdvilla can strive to achieve true sharing for its community. This cannot be achieved in a point based system where there is a centralized token system.    Quote from: momo on March 09, 2018, 11:18:53 PM Where can I see the details of the New Alchemy report? I would like to comment.  You can find the New Alchemy report covered on the blog post here.    Quote from: nextwalker on March 10, 2018, 01:14:24 AM As I understand, the project will also include hotels. What level of hotels will be included in the line of proposals?  Depending on the amount raised, the team will then be able to confirm the type and location of hotel. You may view the property selection criteria as well as the visual concepts drawn by the team in the whitepaper.

How will the real estate items selected and acquired? There’s a special algorithm for selection and estimation of the real estate items which starts from Crowdvilla manager. He will be responsible for all the decisions related to acquisition of objects and use of tokens. The presence of a particular  job position with clear requirements is a good advantage for the project, of course. I’m glad that it’s clear whom it’s possible to ask about results if necessary. First the short list of the items which can be interesting to be obtained is made, then the managers of the project together with advisors choose a particular real estate item. The choice is always made basing on  correspondence to the key parameters. I’d also like to learn about key parameters, but later. What happens after that? After that the team of the project effects a deal or enters the auction to obtain the item that’s chosen. In this case there’s a lot of related work – estimation of law, financial, technical and other aspects. Laborious and long process. Will investors (simple people who has invested in the project) somehow take part in votes?  The community will be consulted via polls. Crowdvilla will take the community input seriously to make its decision on property acquisitions.   Quote from: iddyraz on March 10, 2018, 11:07:37 AM How can this project can benefit us as investors? I cant see your point.  Crowdvilla CRV token holders can benefit from the buying CRV one and generating CROWD to stay at different properties globally perpetually.  Token holders can also trade CROWD when they are unable to stay. This provides huge freedom to token holders versus traditional means of room/hotel booking, renting, purchasing of properties.  And most importantly, token holders will be part of a true sharing movement for community properties.    Quote from: ilcaramba on March 10, 2018, 12:14:17 PM A question for developers… Isnt Singapore location of the project at risk?  From the point of view of legal rules of the country?  The Crowdvilla project is legal in Singapore. Crowdvilla has consulted with legal counsels to ensure regulatory fit. You can find our legal counsels on our website.    Quote from: shokhibul on March 10, 2018, 01:44:55 PM Would it be possible to implement such a project as Crowdvilla without blockchain? What do creators think?  The decentralization concept and blockchain technology provides a very good framework that aligns well with Crowdvilla's goal of community true sharing. Therefore, although possible, it is unlikely to implement Crowdvilla without blockchain.

There’re several points in the WP dedicated to this. There will be such activities carried out, so these aspects and investors’ requirements can be changed in the course of time.  No. The role and functions of the CRV and CROWD tokens will not changed after the ICO.    Quote from: Sam67 on March 10, 2018, 06:30:48 PM Total ownership of real estate ?! Houses where you can relax? I saw different projects on the blockchain, but I could not even imagine it. How is it planned to implement it? Who will administer all this and manage the actions of the community?  Page 9 of the  whitepaper explains the Crowdvilla model.  Crowdvilla is a non-profit entity which will ensure customer service, room services like cleaning, maintenance, booking platform, and other matters relating to the functioning of Crowdvilla properties.

Token holders who have submitted KYC and locked the tokens will be allowed to received CROWD. CROWD is not a dividend. CROWD is a unit which allows for booking of stays at Crowdvilla properties.    Quote from: dort on March 11, 2018, 07:05:01 PM Will it be possible to do anything on the platform for fiat currency? Or everything is done only with tokens of the project?  Fiat can be used to exchange for CROWD which can also be used to book for stays. Both processes can be easily done on the Crowdvilla booking platform in a single booking page.

I think that it won’t be necessary.  As Crowdvilla does not follow the traditional ICO methodology. There will be additional token issuance after ICO. This additional token sales are used to raise additional resources to expand Crowdvilla's portfolio of properties for the community usage. If Crowdvilla does not run future token sales, the number of properties will always be fixed.

Quote from: Neo501 on March 12, 2018, 11:42:16 AM In addition to tourism, can the project have synergies with other industries? I would like to understand the scope of possibilities.  Yes definitely. Feel free to discuss this in our telegram group.    Quote from: sinfazat22ron on March 12, 2018, 06:00:17 PM I work in the tourism field. The project is interesting, I think it can be very interesting to a large number of people who go on holiday to any place on the Earth. But I strongly doubt that through Crowdvilla it will be possible to organize convenient queuing and hotel-using systems, that will be similar to traditional schemes. How will it work?  Crowdvilla properties are mainly for the usage of its token holders. Special tourism groups can be arranged by working with our operational managers upon the completion of the booking platform. It should work the same way as booking in advance for large groups with hotels.    Quote from: sinfazat22ron on March 12, 2018, 09:44:27 PM How well will investors, who have invested in the project, be protected?  Crowdvilla CRV token holders are protected by the underlying asset of the property value. They are also protected as only CROWD can be used to book stays at Crowdvilla properties. Locking CRV tokens are the only means of generating CROWD. Fiat users will use the booking platform to exchange for CROWD to book stays. This ecosystem provides an economy which benefits CRV token holders.    Quote from: MadduckUK on March 12, 2018, 10:31:08 PM Will specialists of the company look only for ready objects? Or does the project also plan to participate in construction?  Crowdvilla's propety asset managers will not only look for ready properties but can also participate in construction. The team will consider the market profitability and community's requirements.   Quote from: app2endad on March 13, 2018, 12:30:32 AM Will this form of real estate ownership be legalized at the usual legal level?  Crowdvilla as a non-profit organization will be owner of the real estate.    Quote from: Mat24 on March 13, 2018, 06:41:27 AM How do I get CRP tokens?  You can acquire CROWD by participating in our public token sale. Bonus CROWD will be given out along with the CRV. CROWD will be generated via the smart contract by locking your CRV tokens for a period of time. CROWD can also be purchased from public exchanges or traded for bookings on our property booking site.    Quote from: holland35 on March 13, 2018, 10:36:17 AM What is the difference between the CRV and CRP tokens?  Each CRV Token represents a share of time-value of use of all properties in the portfolio. CRV Token holders will receive CROWD (Crowd Points) on an ongoing basis, proportional to number of CRV Tokens held and length of holding period. These CROWD can be used at any time to book for actual stays in any of Crowdvilla hotels and holiday properties.    Quote from: martbruce on March 13, 2018, 11:20:39 AM I have recently seen news, that project hire new consultants. What will they be responsible for?  Advisors of Crowdvilla will have the role stated on our website. Feel free to connect with us on telegram if you are still unsure.    Quote from: ptbs on March 13, 2018, 01:01:31 PM Did the developers have a chance to go on vacation, using a similar service? Maybe they have used competitor’s offers?  Yes. All members of the Crowdvilla team are avid travelers and enjoy staying at properties around the world.

It turns out that a fantastic project is developing! Tell me, what the parent project gives to Crowdvilla? ReiDao is a technology company, that initiated the Crowdvilla real estate project. ReiDao is interested in the success of Crowdvilla and provides all possible assistance. You can also see that projects can have joint activity and they are partners for each other. As in the case of ReiDao, is Crowdvilla managed by the same managers? Crowdvilla has its own strong team, which, together with involved advisers, that have many years of experience in the real estate field and special knowledge of the real estate markets of the world, will be engaged in the implementation of the project. Now the team is actively holding conferences for potential investors. OK! I'll look for their speeches. Another question: in addition to luxury objects, will middle class or low-cost options be presented? Developers do not see any sense in this. Investors of the project are primarily interested in luxury properties – private houses, apartments, villas, and comfortable hotels! How is the cost of each purchased object agreed?   taken from the white paper we have Eligible asset criteria: An industry-standard set of parameters within which Crowdvilla’s real estate asset acquisitions are conducted are key to ensure resources are used to maximise the end utility for token holders. Key areas of focus would be overall objectives, acquisition policies, asset selection & monitoring and reporting guidelines. Crowdvilla invites the community to provide inputs on this agenda too.  Quote from: g8stTDas on March 08, 2018, 10:16:08 PM As I understand it, the project will involve hotels. Only 5-star ones?  as long as the property passes the Eligible asset criteria it would be up for consideration.

Houses where you can relax? I saw different projects on the blockchain, but I could not even imagine it. How is it planned to implement it? Who will administer all this and manage the actions of the community? Crowdvilla is based on the concept of the common good, so that the community can pool resources and acquire real estate jointly for use. If, for example, two friends can buy a house somewhere for recreation and spend time there in turns, then why can not the same do 10 or 20 people? The only question is regulation. It's just on paper, it's easy! What kind of property is planned to be acquired? The plans are to work with the luxury segment, which has a great attraction from people as places of rest. The community will own the rights to homes that can be owned and enjoyed. Ok! And how is the right to real estate in the project realized on a global scale? By owning the tokens. Each owner and holder of the token gets the rights to the real estate. The funds received from the sale of tokens, will go to receive real estate for recreation around the world. In which region of the world are the project managers ""looking"" first?  We will firstly consider to acquire properties in: Japan, China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Australia, United States, France, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Thailand, Indonesia.

Quote from: MadduckUK on March 03, 2018, 09:10:39 PM Will the project create its customer support service? For sure there will be a lot of questions at an early stage.  Crowdvilla already has community support on its telegram group. When the properties are ready, customer service managers will be ready to serve the community members.
