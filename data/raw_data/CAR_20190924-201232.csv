Have you seen any blockchain project (except Bitcoin and Ethereum) that has wide spread real world user base? Nobody has. This is something that needs time to grow.  However, there are two major differences between CarVDB and the majority of the other blockchain projects:  First, we already have a working platform in place, which is available to everyone and can be used as we speak. Second, the technology that we are going to integrate into our platform does not rely solely on blockchain functionality, hence people can start to use it as soon as the development is complete.  In the long term, the main ""currency"" on our platform will be the CAR token. We however plan to also use FIAT money until the users get used to the token  and for convenience of those groups of people who prefer more traditional ways of payment.  As to payments with other coins like Bitcoin or Ethereum, we have not ruled out their integration and we might do it if it makes sense. In order for this to happen, people should start to use them as payment method first rather than holding as means of investment. If there is wide spread usage and there is a demand, we will surely integrate other coins.",False
