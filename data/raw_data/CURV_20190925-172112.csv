Cryptocurve is the all-in-one Cryptocurrency wallet for managing all of your cryptocurrency needs. The Cryptocurve ecosystem provides seamless integration between a user and their crypto wallet by providing the ability to buy, sell, send, or hold their digital cryptoassets easily. For example: When you want to purchase your first bitcoin, you have to have a wallet to store it in. When you want to spend Bitcoin, you have to use your wallet to transfer that Bitcoin. If you’re going to buy any other Crypto, again you need a wallet where you can store it.  The wallet is everybody’s exit and entry point into crypto  Crypto wallets are an essential tool for how cryptocurrencies are transacted, used, and accessed on a daily basis. The Curve Wallet stands out because of the interoperability and ease of use in the wallet. The Curve Wallet (and the whole CryptoCurve ecosystem) is built on top of cross-chain solutions, specifically through our official partnership with Wanchain.   This opens an Interoperable layer of access to other blockchains and an aggregate platform to manage your assets in real time.  Features of the Curve Wallet include: ICO Investing, ICO Pooling, Portfolio Tracking and... the NUKE button.  What is the purpose of CURV token?  A single investment into CURV, staked in our smart contract equals investments in every ICO hosted through the Curve platform.  The more CURV tokens you stake, the more airdrop tokens you receive (Passive Income).  Staking enough CURV tokens allows you to create your own ICO Pool smart contract.  Governance in deciding the future of the Curve Wallet.  Burning Mechanism AKA CryptoCurve Buyback Program.  Nuking your portfolio.  Trading Fee Discounts.   Token sale  CryptoCurve aims to raise a total of 37,000 ETH and 6 million USD in WAN.  A total of 415 million CURV will be minted initially, with 207.5 million CURV, or 50% being sold to investors.  Rate: 1 CURV = $0.20 + 25% bonus  Token Vesting Mechanism:  1st month: 25% of tokens released 2nd month: 20% of tokens released 3rd month: 20% of tokens released 4th month: 20% of tokens released 5th month: 20% of tokens released  Token sale starts on 30th of October 2018!
