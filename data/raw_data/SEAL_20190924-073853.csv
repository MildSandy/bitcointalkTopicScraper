Join our Telegram  We believe the designers, artists, scientists, programmers and creators are the unsung heroes behind brands that make magic happen in our lives. The brands are the seal of these creators’ souls: they symbolize their blood, sweat and tears. We believe that we should cherish brands and its creators, protect them, encourage them to keep going and strengthen the connection between people and brands.  Seal Network is a proud member of the EEA (Ethereum Enterprise Alliance) and IACC (The international Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition)  ❗IMPORTANT❗We always communicate through @seal.network. This is the only correct address, all other domains are fake!  Info Official Website Whitepaper ICOBench ★★★★★ Bounty Program Referrals What is Seal? Seal is a blockchain powered product authentication and services platform which will provide consumers and manufacturers with product trust. Seal enables anyone the ability to confidently, quickly and economically verify the authenticity of any product which is Seal enabled. The Seal proprietary technology utilizes NFC compatible Seal chips which can be effectively, securely and discretely incorporated with any physically manufactured product. Upon integration of the Seal chip, the product is paired with the digital counterpart on the blockchain. Verification of authenticity is instantaneous with a simple tap or scan with any smart device. How does it work? Watch our explainer video    The Seal platform consists of several components:  1) Products with an embedded Seal-chip that uniquely identify physical products 2) The Seal-app installed on an NFC-compatible smartphone 3) The Seal-token which allows communication between the different parts of the platform 4) The Seal-network, an immutable blockchain database where each transaction is recorded and validated by its nodes    Brands are the sole issuer of product-pairings on the blockchain. This way, brands can ensure exactly how many authentic copies are released. Disingenuous manufacturers are no longer able to produce imitations that can be passed off as authentic, because they cannot replicate the token. Token Utility Utility Seal Tokens are used to pay for services by consumers and brands. The number of supported services will increase as we improve the platform. The current version of the app already provides authenticity checks and ownership registration. The table at the bottom displays all the features we have currently developed or scheduled. In the future brands might be able to pay customers for certain activities (e.g. via a loyalty system).  Currency of Authenticity The ultimate goal for Seal is to become the currency of authenticity, a currency optimized for the exchange of consumer products. In this way, the Seal Token is a medium of exchange. This is not listed as a service since it does not require additional fees. If used in this manner, the Seal Tokens can be used as a currency to pay for products directly. Purchasing products with Seal Tokens directly claims ownership while payment to the seller occurs simultaneously via the blockchain. Using Seal to pay for products provides both buyer and seller a guaranteed exchange of goods. With regular fiat money transactions, there is no way to tell with certainty whether (a) the product is genuine and (b) physical money / banknotes are not counterfeited. The Seal Token acts as a currency that is optimized for transacting consumer goods, an especially powerful feature in the secondhand market trade. Sovereign currencies like USD or EUR are primitive in comparison to Seal and its powerful properties as a medium of exchange and utility token.  Decentralized Apps for Brands Seal will help brands set up their own decentralized apps for their products on the Seal Network. Seal Tokens can be used to interact with these decentralized brand apps (bApps), each with their own logic and services attached to them. We envision a future where all major brands communicate with the Seal Network where Seal Tokens serve as the communication medium between the Seal Network and the bApps.   Value Creation The value in the Seal ecosystem is linked to the brands that place their products on the Seal Network. Each service on the Seal Network costs a service fee. Brands decide on the price of ownership transfers so that it suits their product, strategy and brand image. The more value is captured and protected by Seal chips, the higher the value of the entire network becomes. This will depend on the total volume and value of these goods.  Network Effects The utility of Seal tokens increases as more and more brands adopt the platform. To explain how network effects improve utility, a classic example is a phone network where the utility of the first phone in the network is low, but becomes more useful as more people start using phones. Network effects will impact the value of Seal, for the same reasons the increasing adoption of Bitcoin and Ethereum has impacted their respective value. When more brands use Seal and when more services are available for use within the Seal Network, consumer adoption of the token will increase, together with its demand. With time, more and more products will reach the secondary market, where we expect Seal and its token to have the biggest impact.  Tokens Required Seal tokens are required to enter the ecosystem. The Seal tokens power the Seal Network. They enable low-cost micropayments between the Seal Network, consumers, and brands.  Future Use Depending on future developments and regulations, additional properties can be added to the token. These properties could include voting rights or other token holder incentives.  Token Diagram  History of Seal Bart and Joris worked together on a social mobile games startup in the past. Back in 2013 we put our gaming hardware to work mining Bitcoin and Litecoin after office hours. We quickly figured out that coupling NFC technology with the blockchain would be a disruption to the illicit practice of counterfeiting, and that this is a use case with the potential to put the blockchain into the hands of millions of people. Although our initial work was done back then, we knew the market was not ready yet. In 2017, we realized it was time to put our masterplan to work, and so we did.

The Seal token is used as a currency. Products may be purchased in full with Seal tokens. This guarantees an exchange of goods. Used to pay for services, such as registering ownership, flagging as lost or stolen, etcetera. For a full overview of the services offered, please refer to the whitepaper. Decentralized brand apps (bApps) Low-cost micropayments between the Seal Network, consumers, and brands.  What kinds of chips do u use? NFC chip made by NXP. The chip uses AES cryptographic authentication and allows to automatically and securely connect to a web service by just tapping the tag without the need of a dedicated app installed on the mobile NFC device. Seal chips use three AES 128-bit application keys. To put this into perspective, a single 128-bit key would take 1.44 billion years to crack.   How can I participate in the pre-sale?
