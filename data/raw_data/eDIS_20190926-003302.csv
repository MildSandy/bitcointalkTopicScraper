We are looking for your feedback before we start an Ethereum ICO ERC-20 Token for the business. Please review the draft whitepaper and email us your feedback.  Our goal is to better support and embrace software developers. There are a number of places developers can list their product for sale and there are companies that will help promote software. eTardis is different.  Our focus is the developer and their product. We will help support the developer to do what they like to do the most, develop great software. As such, we will purchase the distribution rights for their product to give them an up-front payment. We will then start to market and sell their product with our proprietary concept to maximize profits.  The profits don’t just return to eTardis. They are distributed in a unique way between the developer, eTardis operation costs, and reinvestment into marketing activities. The more a product earns, the more investment it will get into marketing and sales activities to benefit both the eTardis company and product developer.  If that isn’t enough, eTardis wants to recognize the relationship between the developer and the company. Although the developer is not part of eTardis, they can be eligible for profit sharing.  PROFIT SHARING FOR THE DEVELOPER!  That is correct and not a typo. We thought long and hard about how to better support the developer. We want developers to feel like we have their back and not their money. Given their products help to build the company, we feel that it is appropriate to return some of the corporate profits back to those who helped make the company grow.  Developers can get more information and submit a place in queue for consideration for the launch event at the eTardis website.  We look forward to reading your comments.   Also posted on Medium  ================================================================ Thanks for reading, we are working towards an ICO launch but would like to get feedback on the whitepaper to include best practices and potentially great ideas to add to the company.  We are working on the ERC-20 Token and contract so we are not ready to launch.  Once we release a final revision of the whitepaper we would like to give people 7 days to review prior to the pre-ICO.  Also, we want people to have time to review the Ethereum Contract code we will post to Github prior to launch.  Thanks for your time and consideration.  We would love feedback on the bonus schedule.  Also, if you know a developer whom might want to be included in the launch please send them to us.  We are also looking for top-notch Marketing & Sales as well as Business Development as the business grows.  -eTardis www.etardis.com",False
