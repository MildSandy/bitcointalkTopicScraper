BlockMesh is proud to be announced as a Bancor member.  Bancor will allow for instant conversion of Mesh Tokens (MESH) directly through a simple Web App. This conversion is possible between MESH, BNT, ETH and any other integrated token in the network, with over 50 planned activations already announced.  The Bancor Protocol utilizes an innovative “Connector” method which allows users to buy and sell any token for any other at formulaically calculated rates directly using popular Web3 wallets, without needing to match two parties in traditional exchanges. BlockMesh will create a Bancor-compliant Token Relay™ with 5% of the BlockMesh supply within the week following the MESH launch.  BlockMesh began as a mesh-network solutions provider in October 2015 and aims to revolutionise the current centralised communication ecosystem by allowing its users to call, text and share files with other BlockMesh users without requiring infrastructure such as satellites, cellphone towers, Wi-Fi hotspots or radio repeaters.  The blockchain has solved the challenge of compelling individuals to support the mesh-network by offering BlockMesh app users cryptocurrency rewards simply for network participation. The reward function will utilise blockchain technology to incentivize users with Mesh Tokens, which they can then easily convert through the Bancor Network for other tokens. The more data that passes through a user’s app, the more Mesh Tokens they will accumulate.
