Alguns rotulam a invenção do século e alguns como classificam como o maior consumo desta década. Está previsto que, nos próximos 5 anos, setores como varejo, bancos, empresas e logística sejam explicitamente dependentes do blockchain para o desenvolvimento do gerenciamento inteligente de e-mails de blockchain.  Por outro lado, a indústria de cannabis é um grande avanço no lazer e na indústria farmacêutica. As vantagens medicinais dos cânforos são os países em que se encontram os países da América do Norte, Europa, Norte e Leste da Ásia, não são muito importantes para o futuro e são importantes para o resto do mundo. Atualmente, uma indústria mundial de cannabis está em torno de US $ 25 bilhões. Como projeções são de que, até 2025, é uma indústria de US $ 125 bilhões, que incluem cannabis recreativa e medicinal. Isso significa que, em comparação, uma indústria de cannabis será maior do que uma indústria de bebidas alcoólicas e de bebidas alcoólicas.  How is a government is legalizando a maconha, is one major conscientization and compulsion also is being used to a transparent growth, buying and retail of cannabis, is such is being movido consumer, companies and companies must be enabled in order to sale.

O Biotrack não é suportado pelo blockchain, que é problemático porque não fornece uma tecnologia de rastreamento do governo, e o governo sendo responsável por garantir que a indústria seja informada sobre os dados tecnológicos em torno da tecnologia blockchain tornou-se um conflito de interesses. Como resultado, o governo cancelou o contrato.  Finalmente, o MJ Freeway foi, infelizmente, hackeado, enquanto o código fonte foi publicado. The MJ Freeway was invadted again and the process logo after certificate, the MJ Freeway was invadted again and the same they registration your sales. Isso não foi apenas embaraçoso, mas também fez com que seus clientes perdessem credibilidade na moeda da MJ Freeway. The problem the trophy content of the supply of business vulnerability.

The most clear vision of this future is the use of tokens for financial transactions. Blockchain tokens, or cryptocurrency as they are known to the masses, provide new value to individuals from banking the unbanked to the creation of new industries. This value though powerful will face an uphill challenge to be unlocked via technological development and gaining a critical mass.  The adoption of tokens today shares many parallels to credit card adoption in the 1950s. This article provides a historical account of credit card adoption and suggests that history offers valuable insights into what it will take to bring tokens mainstream. To gain mainstream adoption, credit cards faced numerous challenges including fierce competition, a lack of infrastructure, fraud and security vulnerability, an uneducated user base, and lack of regulations. Yet despite early doubt and scorn by users and merchants alike, today 3 in 4 American adults have a credit card.",False

We have identified a calculation mistake in our OST Circulating Supply spreadsheet (which is always work in progress). I am reposting our answer from telegram, as you have raised it there too.  ICO's have evolved a lot over the past couple of years as projects and (and their lawyers) have converged on some best practices, particularly around proving token utilty before tokens are distributed/unlocked and providing for long term vesting schedules for pre-sale, team, and advisors.  OST provided a very conservative distribution of tokens relative to other ICO's during the same period and one of the most conservative vesting release schedules, period.  Here is link to our answers to the same questions back in December of last year, just to show consistency throughout.  32.63% of supply was sold in the first token sale on 14 November, 2017.  Pre-sale was 20% of that and will be released over 12 month, 1/12th per month.   27.2% reserved for the Network Accelerator Program. This is a pool created for seeding promising projects based on Simple Token. The OpenST Foundation will review applications for the Network Accelerator Program and could make grants available to projects based on Simple Token and to the teams behind such projects. The Foundation may also use this pool to incent developers to develop and provide applications, designs, software, and services that enhance the value of Simple Token.  5.61% for early finacial backers of the project like Tencent and Greycroft and 500 Startups, on a 3 year vesting schedules.  10% for advisors, on a minimum 2 year vesting schedules. 10% for the founding team, on a minimum 3 year vesting schedules.  14.56% for future token sales. These tokens will be locked for a minimum of 6 months from the initial token sale. We don't currently have any plans for a future token sale, this is only a reserve.  Countering the above distribution, companies that build on OST will need to purchase OST from the public market and then ""stake"" it against minting their own branded tokens backed by OST. Staked tokens are removed from circulating supply, so the more companies signing up to build on OST, removes more and more tokens from circulation.  We feel that compared to other projects that held ICO's during the same time period as OST (e.g. Kyber, Airswap, Civic, Bluzelle), OST took a very conservative and fair approach to token distribution and releases, which we fully stand behind.",False

Here are our quick feedback points:  - Very general definitions of the scalability problem, blockchains, enterprise adoption, distributed applications, nothing going into the specifics of the implementation. - No Mention of using the Ethereum mainnet, again to independently develop a platform (an independent blockchain), on the scale of ethereum without having thought about using the developments made in the sector by them, without any details in the paper as to why they chose that option is quite alarming. One has to give details as the to the issues with existing tech and how to improve upon it before going ahead and declaring that something new would be built entirely from scratch. - Their timeline shows that they would be releasing “Through the use of a set of uniform and open-source RESTful APIs in a variety of languages (Python, Go, JS, Ruby, .NET, Java, Node.js) businesses large and small will rapidly deploy next-gen applications on the Neblio Blockchain Network like never before seen in the blockchain ecosystem”,  what are the details on this never before seen ecosystem? The details are hazy. - The details on how the APIs interface with the blockchain are not present. - Very general definitions of security, immutability, and reliability , talking about decentralised mesh networking without going into specifics, Red flag! - Very General applications of the blockchain use cases mentioned like Secure Records Mgmt, Regulatory compliance & Audit trains, IOT & Big data. - They go into saying they will be supporting many languages on their APIs. Which is quite a mouthful without the details on how to do it. Enterprise Driven requirements are asked for from people participating in the development but there are not tokens for the same. as 96% of the tokens are distributed. - Private blockchain development : Neblio talks about business services for private healthcare blockchains for cases where information on the blockchain must be encrypted for security, but no further details on this are provided.",False

Their token is utility-based, meaning that as companies use their OST protocol to create their own branded token (BT) economies, they have to stake OST in exchange. This removes OST from the circulating supply. Additionally, current holders of OST can lend their OST stake to partnering companies.  Today they launched OST-KYC, which is a KYC-as-a-service product for ICOs that want a streamlined onboarding process. For this service, companies also have to purchase OST on the open market. Very few projects have multiple streams of intrinsic utility like that.  On their Medium page, they have outlined projections for how their circulating supply will change over time, inclusive of current partners and forecasted partners to use the platform. By utilizing the staking mechanism, their circulating supply is deflationary, since it declines over time as more businesses use OST. Projections for circulating supply are (conservatively) estimated to be about 7 million OST by the end of 2019, which bodes well for price appreciation even if marketcap remains flat or steadily increasing.  As for their competitors (Lisk, etc), do bear in mind the nature of their target clientele (app/blockchaindevelopers). The purpose of OST however, is to enable ANY mainstream business to incorporate blockchain into their business model, and create token economies, WITHOUT having to write a single line of code/hire app or blockchain developers/deal with regulatory or legal issues with running a traditional ICO. Its essentially the Amazon Web Services of Blockchain-based tokenization.  I would suggest folks follow their official telegram chat for partnership and product updates, as well as their blogs on Medium, and peruse their Github repertoire if you are tech savvy.  Imo, this is a hidden gem that shoulddo very well in 2018. Clear cut example of what a real UTILITY token looks like.  Cheers  #notfinancialadvice #doyourownresearch",False

So they can use one ST to create 10, 100 or 1000 of their personalized token (the ST team may have limits to the ratio but so far I haven't heard any).  But of course since having a valuable token is very important, companies are naturally motivated to keep their ratio as low as possible.  So, it WILL create demand on the token, but the supply is probably going to be ok.  People will be trading the branded tokens in for ST and spending them throughout the network, so companies will always have to buy more in order to keep value in their social media platforms.   So, I misspoke a little before.  Companies won't necessarily be holding, but from time to time they'll have to be refilling their supply.  I suppose companies will do both!",False

I have talked to Jason (the CEO of Simple Token) about it. Theoretically there is no limit, but if you make 1000 Branded Tokens (BT) out of 1 Simple Token (OST), 1 BT would only have a value of $0.001 if 1 OST = $1,-   To further detail.. this is what Jason said on the matter:  ""A company before minting their first branded tokens can set the exchange rate of OST to BT at any rate you desire, but once you set it, it is fixed and cannot change. That ensures that companies don't change the rules on their customers.  So, let's say OST is trading at $1, and you set your exchange rate to 1 OST = 1000 BT. Then, each of your BT is initially worth $0.001.  The price of the BT does not fluctuate on its own, as it is not tradeable on secondary markets. So, each BT is always worth 1/1000th of and ST.  However, OST does fluctuate and could go to $2 or $10, or $.50.  A few factors come into play there.  First, price oracles could be used to set prices withing the company's branded token economy so that even if ST goes up and down, the relative price of the good or service in the Token Economy does not change. For instance, let's say in the example above that you allow your users to earn $.01 each time someone likes someone else's product review. By setting the value of the service at $0.01 using the price oracle, it would start off at 10BT per liked review, but would auto-adjust to say 20BT per liked if OST rose to $2.  The other concept that can be deployed is price stablization mechanisms. The company could sign up for a 3rd party to provide price stabilization to insulate its end users from price fluctuations. Imagine for instance if your user above earned 100,000 BT worth $100, and then the next day it was only worth $50 or suddenly was worth $250. The user would either lose faith in the system or could start hording or cashing out. With price stabilication mechanisms, the company could insulate its end users from wild swings in OST price, while the company uses upside for reserves/buffer against downward swings, a swell as the company could retain some profits from OST increases.  In general it would be nice to enable end users of BT to participate in at least some of the rewards of OST rising because of the community support for the various BT's, but at same time price stabilization mechanisms could be used to guard against unintended consequences from wild swings.""",False

So, companies can stake as much as needed to support their initial token outlays to start and then stake more and their customers demand more of their tokens. We're working on exact pricing model.  Also, a 3rd party could ""loan"" the stake for a company in exchange for a monthly fee at a premium. e.g. a 3rd party could stake $1M worth of OST for a company, and provide price stabliziation and other services to them, for say $50,000 per month over 24 months.

They will develop cryptocurrencies for other companies as a paid service. It’s so much easier and more efficient for companies to log in to the ST sweet and mint their token with ST services as opposed to creating everything from scratch. Think of the major companies that use CRM as an example from the business world. Companies using CRM wouldn’t create their own platforms but rather they might use salesforce or Zoho software.  Here’s the best thing about ST [make sure you’re seated for this]. Whenever a company decides to mint their tokens with ST, they must purchase a large stake of ST which will drive up the value significantly (keep in mind that companies can’t simply decide to dump these coins like the vulture day traders do, the supply they hold will be stacked to be used by their consumers). As these tokens get used by the consumers of these companies, demand for ST grows with the success of these companies. There’s already 9 companies that have shown interest with 50+ in the pipeline. In the long run, this will create a massive network across multiple companies, all using ST and pumping ST with their success. The tokens will also be tradable across the network (meaning from one company to another). The team is lead by an very successful internet entrepreneur Jason Goldberg.  This is a true utility token. What that means is that it is not going to rely on day traders and your common cryptocurrency investor who hangs around the exchanges to pump it. It will gain its value from the companies that will purchase ST. Just recently an announcement was made that ‘Kryptonite 1′ has taken part in the token presale of the Simple Token project (“OST”) with an initial investment amount of USD248,783. This is just the beginning.",False

Always check the ICO price before investing in a coin. In this case it was an avg of 0.08 and it hit the market at 40c. Those who invested in ICO dumped it as soon as it hit market to get profit and then they buy back in at a much cheaper price. If the team of this coin was ""so smart"" they wouldn't have allowed such a large discrepancy because then the coin will debut at -70% and that's just not attractive for new investors at all.

The upcoming first Simple Token sale event on November 14, 2017 (commonly known as an “ICO”) is required for two reasons:  1. Because the OpenST Protocol requires staking ST to create BT, we need to first create ST and have some value placed on it by purchasers of ST.  2. So that we can create an endowment for the community ecosystem. 27.2% of the ST token supply is intended to be reserved for what we call the Network Accelerator Program. This will be used by the OpenST Foundation Limited (“OpenST”) to seed projects, developers, and teams that are building interesting use cases based on ST. In this manner we can become a seed program/accelerator for a new generation of apps launching branded token economies..  More details:  Simple Token is a protocol and software suite for consumer app tokenization.  The business and technical challenge we set out to solve is to enable mainstream applications to benefit from deploying their own branded crypto-backed token economies, in a scalable and cryptographically auditable manner, without needing to mint and maintain their own publicly-tradable crypto tokens. This project began with our attempt in 2016 and into early 2017 to develop a token economy for one app, Pepo, and our realization that rather than building tokenization technology for one app, the much more important, interesting, and worthy challenge was to build the enabling technology for any app to tokenize and benefit from having parts of their business on a blockchain.  We want to enable any business to launch their own branded crypto-based economy without the legal, regulatory, and technology headaches involved with going alone. This could enable them to monetize user contributions and content, power peer-to-peer transaction, provide meaningful incentives and rewards, develop transparent loyalty programs, and unleash thousands of new monetization and supply / demand possibilities.  The OpenST protocol, powered by our ERC-20 token “ST,” enables any company to stake ST on Ethereum main-net to mint their own branded digital currency (aka “tokens”) on open scalable side blockchains, in a crypto-graphically auditable manner.  The Simple Token software, built on OpenST, helps companies launch and manage their ST-powered token economies. It’s a SaaS software package, a dashboard, a set of tools, for managing a token economy.  Here's more details. https://simpletoken.org/documents",False

What is the OST project all about?  OST blockchain infrastructure empowers new economies. OST is a public blockchain platform designed for the needs of businesses with millions of users. Launch your own Branded Tokens with OST technology and turn your business into a dynamic ecosystem. OST is built on the OpenST Protocol, a framework for building highly scalable blockchain token economies.    Our signature product, OST KIT, gives businesses all the tools they need to run a blockchain-powered economy.  OST KIT alpha, the first public test version of OST KIT, is now available for anyone to try!   OST stands for ""Open Simple Token"" and OST KIT is built on OpenST, our protocol for mainstream business adoption of Blockchain. The OpenST protocol allows for the staking of $OST on Ethereum mainnet against minting branded tokens on the OpenST network of side blockchains. This enables mainstream businesses to launch their own branded crypto-currencies on the OpenST network, backed by staked OST, affording for higher throughput and transaction volumes than currently possible to achieve on public Ethereum. The OpenST platform allows Ethereum smart contracts to run faster and cheaper while leveraging the security properties of Ethereum’s Proof-of-Work.    OST KIT is a Software as a Service platform that builds on OpenST, providing a rich set of dashboards and APIs to program and manage your token economy. Our ambition is nothing short of enabling any mainstream business to launch their own crypto backed by OST, without their teams having to have any blockchain developers.    Those videos provides some more details about the OpenST solution.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJswJcnLYpU  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz8LhpKCsw0&feature=youtu.be    Discover OST KIT: https://kit.ost.com/  Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6N3uKMzasI     Discover OST KYC: https://kyc.ost.com/  Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uCN1cqYfwo  -------------------------------------   The OST Technology Stack  Blockchain technology designed to scale with the needs and requirements of businesses     Social Media   👤 Twitter - https://twitter.com/OSTdotcom 📌 Medium - https://medium.com/ostdotcom ✅ Telegram - https://t.me/OSTdotcom 🔥  Official announcement channel: https://t.me/OSTdotcomnews 🖥  Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/OSTdotcom/ 👥 Facebook – https://www.facebook.com/OST 🗣️ Developer Chat - https://gitter.im/OpenSTFoundation/SimpleToken  Key Documents, Links, and Repositories  All Docs Github",False
