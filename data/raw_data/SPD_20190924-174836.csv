BLACK STAR CAPITAL LTD (London, United Kingdom) granted SPDs, to the top three teams as extra prizes, as well as to participants through SNSs like WE CHAT and WEIBO and visitors to the events during China's largest e-Sport event ""ChinaJoy.""  ""ChinaJoy"" is one of the largest Chinese e-Sports events organized by China Joy Organisation Committee under the guidance of the Chinese government in order to promote the healthy growth and management of e-Sports. The 16th ChinaJoy this year was held under the concept of ""Smart New Era, Embrace New Entertainment."" The event saw players compete in the MOBA PC Game, League of Legends and the MOBA Smartphone game boasting more than 200 million Chinese users, King's Glory: City Race series. After both online and offline elimination races in 10 different Chinese cities, and the semi-finals in July, the finals were held on 3–6 August, 2018 in the Shanghai New International Expo Centre (SNIEC). More than 400 thousand million visitors, significantly more than last year’s 342,700 as well as more than three million online spectators watched the finals, and the event was wrapped up in the midst of great excitement.  BLACK STAR CAPITAL LTD will continue to promote, invest and operate business in the Chinese market, where e-Sports are expected to further expand under the governmental development policies. More than half of the worldwide online e-Sports watchers are Chinese users, and the Chinese market is now regarded as the largest in the world.  Through the sponsorship to this year’s Chinajoy, we have renewed our awareness that we can make the most of our investment in the Chinese e-Sport market to help grow SPINDLE.  In 2018, the e-Sports market is expected to grow more than twice than last year’s market size to more than 1.5 billion dollars, and we have been convinced that the penetration of SPINDLE into e-Sports markets will have positive impact on future SPD growth. SPINDLE will continue to invest in Chinese markets and e-Sports markets.  The project SPINDLE joined BIAS (Blockchain Industry Alliance Shanghai) on June 4. Following the opening of its Shanghai office and participation to Blockchain conferences and sponsorship to Chinajoy, it will seek to further expand its business in China in order to further raise awareness of the project SPINDLE in China and expand its market.",False

Unless you actively work in a financial environment or can call yourself one of the “accredited investors” according to the definition, the term investment has a certain exclusiveness and unattainability attached to it. Not everyone is a trader. Your expertise may lie in the field of fine arts, gastronomy, or languages. Does that mean you are less eligible to pursue financial independence?  At BLACKSTAR, we believe true wealth is to not feel sorrow when you hear the word “wealth”. You can invest, you can trade, and you can do it with a lot of money, or you can do it with small amounts.

High volatility and technology imperfections portray a hurdle that stands between investors and cryptocurrency. Traditional investors tend to be taken aback by the heavy price fluctuations and refrain from investing in these new financial instruments. Such sense of vagueness and randomness in investment needs to be erased for traditional investors to actively join in. At the same time, cryptocurrency attracts a new group of investors that has not made it to the big stage of the conventional financial market - people that do not have access to large funds or can call themselves ""qualified investors"" in the traditional sense. The low entry barriers create opportunities; what is needed now is accessibility and the confidence of investors.  On May 8 at 12 PM CET join SPINDLE’s stream on Youtube to learn about:  What are crypto hedge funds, why are they relevant for you, and why are you not yet invested? How can you take the ""privilege"" out of investment and make it an actual option for everyone? How does SPINDLE support your entrance into confident, unlimited investment?  The webinar will be led by the core representatives of the SPINDLE team - Masamitsu Hirai, SPINDLE CEO and president of the investment company BLACKSTAR GROUP, and senior analyst of SPINDLE, Lina Seiche.  To learn more about a new era of investment, join SPINDLE’s webinar on the 8th of MAY at 12 PM CET via this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Y3lK2i0-c4.  Don’t forget to set a reminder!

We have an important announcement to make  Official notice to all SPINDLE holders and those who wish to participate in the conference “BLOCK ONE powered by SPINDLE” on 1 May  “BLOCK ONE powered by SPINDLE”, scheduled for 1 May 2018 at Makuhari Messe in Chiba, received more than 12,000 registrations for a venue with a capacity of 3,000. As we had prepared a procedure which would allow participants to freely enter the location, we evaluated that if we were to continue our preparations as we had originally intended to, it would lead to chaos and the danger of the occurrence of accidents; with all participants’ safety being our highest priority, we decided to postpone the conference. We sincerely apologise to everyone who has been looking forward to the event.  At “BLOCK ONE powered by SPINDLE”, we had planned to share with you the descriptions of our business, announcements on the official listing, and much more; but with the number of attendees exceeding our expectations by far, concerns were raised among our international relations that if we held the conference under these circumstances and, in the worst case, any incidents were to take place, it would negatively influence our listing position.  With that in mind, we are going to change the date and location for “BLOCK ONE” to a point in time after listing. Further, we were planning to also perform a conference airdrop program. With the latest changes, we are going to issue said airdrop to everyone who has signed up. As soon as “BLOCK ONE’s” updated schedule is finalised, we are going to get in touch with everyone who has registered. We are truly sorry for many of you have been anticipating the conference, but if there were any incidents or accidents to happen, we would be seen as mistaking means for ends. We believe that this kind of outcome is also not what our holders wish for, which is why we sincerely hope for your understanding and cooperation.  Thank you for always supporting SPINDLE.

With scams being so prevalent and often well-planned, it’s difficult to know which news sources and projects to trust when making investment decisions. Fake news has become so widespread and effective in the cryptocurrency space that it has even caused massive fluctuations in the price of many assets.  For example, in early January 2018, rumors began spreading that South Korea had plans to ban its citizens from using cryptocurrency exchanges. Many news sources began publishing articles detailing the South Korean government’s intention to ban all exchanges, with virtually no evidence provided. Investors began to panic, and rightfully so, considering the impact South Korean investors have on the cryptocurrency market.  About a week later, the South Korean government cleared the air and announced that they had no such plans. But the damage had already been done – due to panic selling, Bitcoin had lost almost 60% of its value.  It’s difficult to discern real news from rumors. It’s difficult to decide what projects to invest your money in. In a space dominated by projects that try to solve trust issues with blockchain technology, there is ironically a trust issue being created in and of itself – who to trust, in the first place?  The SPINDLE Project, by Blackstar Group, aims to solve this problem. It matches investors interested in cryptocurrencies with asset managers and cryptocurrency hedge funds that can do the investment work for them. Thanks to the power of the blockchain, investors can track which asset managers and hedge funds are performing the best because investment decisions will be transparent and viewable on the blockchain....",False

Mr. Hirai, one of the founders of SPINDLE project said,    Therefore, the SPINDLE task is to educate people, without much investment experience or none at all, that investment and asset management is an enjoyable way to enrich their own lives and minds. Although crypotocurrecy is highly volatile due to its possibility of significant rise or fall, nevertheless, many experts highly evaluate the perspectives of the cryptocurrency market because most coins are based on the technology-promoting interests of many large companies.  Projects such as SPINDLE serve as an instrument and platform to wipe away people’s anxieties towards investing and management, provide abundant resources and help solve these anxieties, as well as become a suitable environment where everyone can make decisions by and for themselves.

Quote Recently, we have seen a trend to burn unsold tokens. SPINDLE withholds its decision regarding token burning based on the reasons listed below. 1 Regardless of burning tokens or not, because of the limited amount distributed in the first place, the deflationary nature of the currency will not change. 2 Since the value of new tokens are mainly determined by its relative recognition through ICO by the society, if we are to consider the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies both in the present and in the future, the burning of new tokens in the stages of its ICO, in reality, will have no effect or influence. 3 A currency’s value is always relative, and while proved in many ways, SPINDLE believes in an era where currencies are democratized, and that the many owners of tokens and believers of the system will be the key to the valuation of the currency. Thus, utilizing surplus tokens will enable the expansion of SPINDLE and will lead to the benefits of SPINDLE token holders. Even from a historical perspective, when the amount of a currency issued is low and the additional issuance is slow, the social impact of such currency decreases.",False

WEBSITE | TELEGRAM | TWITTER | FACEBOOK | MEDIUM | REDDIT | GITHUB  BOUNTY CAMPAIGN  SPINDLE is the official utility token to be used on the blockchain-based investment / asset management platform SPINDLE, a comprehensive space which aims to act as a gateway creating access to various investment options at a high level of transparency.  SPINDLE believes that establishing a fair relationship between investors and asset managers is the best way to remove investors’ vague sense of unease about investment and encourage involvement in proactive asset management.  Recent years have seen global credit crises like the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 and the Greek financial crisis. These are but few of the examples of financial collapse from conventional centralized countries and their central banks. On the other hand, Bitcoin and other digital currencies have emerged, rapidly developing decentralized markets where individuals can judge and improve currency values. The SPINDLE project aims to enable more people to enjoy enriched lives through investment and asset management, and to become free from the conventional exploitative social structure that is based on centralized authority.    PRODUCT DETAILS    PROTOTYPE #1   SPINDLE TOKEN ECONOMY MODEL    After the ICO, SPINDLE will be made available on Windows, Mac, IOS and Android as an application called SPINDLE Service Application (SPA). SPD holders can use the SPA app to invest in virtual currency hedge funds around the world. SPINDLE PROTO #2 is the SPA beta version, and after the ICO, the SPINDLE committee will select 5 to 10 virtual currency hedge funds and ICO tokens will be made available.    SPINDLE ICO ICO DATES: 9 MAY 2018 - 15 MAY 2018  SOFT CAP: 60,000 ETH HARD CAP: 1,581,000 ETH  The difference between SPINDLE’s token sale and other ICOs is that, unlike ICOs which start to create their service applications after their ICOs, SPINDLE will start creating an application from early 2018, with the target of launching the service just after the ICO.
