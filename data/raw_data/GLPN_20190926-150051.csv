The company has been developing a unified service that allows each of its users to invest their money at interest, take out a loan, exchange funds and cryptocurrencies, keep their savings at a profit, and pay for goods or services using their own GLPN wallet.  The company allows to buy tokens on advantageous terms. The coins are sold only for 0.09 USD each during the current Pre-Sale ICO stage! It is a truly unique chance for potential participants and private investors to get a maximum discount on a very valuable asset, which will cost 0.9 USD at the ICO stage. The price will grow in the future depending on the market conditions and the limited coin emission.  The first stage of the GLPN token sale has already begun. 500,000 coins are available for purchase for investors and participants at the initial stage. This makes 10 % of the overall amount ready for emission. Five more million coins will be issued during the full-scale ICO stage, and one coin will cost 0.9 USD. This tenfold difference in price provides a one-of-a-kind opportunity to make a really profitable investment.  Special features of the Global Pay Net project:  the Blockchain-based financial platform is developed by analysts, traders and software developers from all over the world; it is based on all main features of the Blockchain technology (safe keeping, currency exchange, payment capabilities, and investment making); an informative, optimized and user-friendly wallet will be created; the project is supported by large international financial companies. Currently, Global Pay Net is developed by a dedicated team of professionals featuring Benedetta Milani, Jody Samuels, Gary Whitehouse, Jonha R., Oanna Hubbard and many other Blockchain experts.  Many people ask about the opportunities provided by the GLPN tokens during the investment stage. It is a full-value asset that represents one's share in the business. It is not a traditional cryptocurrency. When you purchase the tokens, you are entitled to the payment of future dividends. The value of these assets will grow due to their limited emission.  The participant's share in the business increases with the total number of coins he/she owns. This also means that this person will receive bigger dividends.  The 90 % bonus for purchasing the tokens during the Pre-SALE stage is an added benefit for the participants of this revolutionary financial project.    https://globalpaynet.com/sites/all/themes/new/image/gpn-image.jpg  https://globalpaynet.com/sites/all/themes/new/image/plan.jpg   Online banking Online banking, also known as internet banking, it is an electronic payment system that enables customers of a bank or other financial institution to conduct a range of financial transactions through the financial institution's website. The online banking system will typically connect to or be part of the core banking system operated by a bank and is in contrast to branch banking which was the traditional way customers accessed banking services.  https://globalpaynet.com/sites/all/themes/new/image/Solution1_IB4Retail.png    GLPN CARD Within the GLPN Wallet, user can choose to order a GLPN Card, a virtual and/or physical debit (and in time to come credit card). As a security measure, we allow a user to lock and unlock his card through the GLPN Wallet App. Furthermore, the user can also set limits for his family members and sync all the cards to the same Wallet. This makes our system more secure than traditional credit and debit card systems. Blockchain and GLPN Tokens become very central to this as users can sync multiple cards to the same GLPN Wallet, which can then be used as both Fiat and Crypto medium of exchange without incurring any high feesforsuch transfer at any time. Further, we will also be coming up with a loyalty mechanism tied to the GLPN Card, so that more you use the wallet, the more you are rewarded as a GLPN Token holder. Not only are the fees, much cheaper than traditional Wallets, but also payback rewards are massive, leading to almost nil fee when used globally. Customers will be allowed to top-up their GPN Card with ETH/BTC/GPN Tokens, bank transfer, credit card, debit card or via a pre-approved credit limit. Other third party partners like Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay will be integrated in time to come.  https://globalpaynet.com/sites/all/themes/new/image/v-card.png         ROAD MAP  Concept development March 2018 Development of the concept, preparation for ICO Start Conducting pre-ICO April 2018 Preparation of the bounty, preparation of marketing.
