EHF Advisor, prof. Arnold Mitnitsky answers questions about aging, frailty index, longevity, mathematical models that help to understand and fight against aging.  Take a look at the 3rd part of his comments.  7. What does eHealth First mean for me? Our work with eHealth First is in the very beginning. The way I am thinking about health and its measurement, its use in health care, is quite similar to what eHealth First is planning to do (see the White Paper for details). I am happy that my expertise in mathematical modeling and data analysis of complex biomedical systems gives me additional opportunities to push forward the agenda of understanding and thus improving health of individuals that ultimately will affect the quality of life of people in the world. I appreciate eHealth First for giving such opportunities.  8. What would we do, if many people live much longer than now? Of course, aging of the populations presents some serious challenges to the healthcare systems all over the World. Such challenges are well known –increasing load on the health care is one of them. There are several scenarios that might happen if people live longer under discussion. Briefly, I think, most likely people will mature later than now, and keep changing slower than now. I see that the stretching the time scale of life is rather likely. People will go to retirement later than now, will have more productive life. In other words, the pace of aging will slow down. This will lead to the life extension and to the health span extension. I also believe that the society will find the way of mitigating any possible negative consequences of the life extension. In this I way, my view is rather optimistic.",False

EHF Advisor, prof. Arnold Mitnitsky answers questions about aging, frailty index, longevity, mathematical models that help to understand and fight against aging.  Take a look at the 2nd part of his comments.  4. How aging could be measured? Aging could be measured in many ways at the different levels. Our approach is to sum up multiple health attributes of the various nature (for simplicity, they should be dichotomized). The fraction of health deficits from the total number of health attributes (known as a frailty index or FI) is associated with multiple adverse outcomes (mortality, length or stay in hospital, morbidities). Thus, the FI is a useful (and holistic) utility measure that represents the state of health of the entire organism. There are several other measures that are in some use although not as widespread as the FI. One such measure is the DNA Methylation age that is based on the characteristics of epigenetic system. The other measures of the rate of aging, i.e. the different indices of biological age based on the batteries of biomarkers (e.g., obtained from the blood tests). The comparison of these measures has yet to be done in order to understand the advantages and limitation of each of them.  5. What about Frailty Index? The frailty index (FI) is a measure of health of individuals (health utility) based on the accumulation of deficit approach. The FI is the ratio of health deficits present in an individual to the total number of deficits available in the database or in the study. The FI lies between 0 (no deficits present) to 1 (all deficits present) although empirical limit of the FI is close to 0.7 – the higher values of FI are incompatible with life. The frailty index is a robust predictor of adverse outcomes, such as mortality, and increasingly used in many epidemiological and clinical studies. The term includes “frailty” to reflect the vulnerability to stresses during the aging process, and “index” reflects the degree of such vulnerability. The FI should not be confused with the Frailty Phenotype which is a simple tool constructed from 5 characteristics of physical functioning although less comprehensive and less powerful than the FI. The FI is a measure of the global damage of the organism, it is not only empirically validated in multiple settings but also has a strong theoretical support in the new complex dynamical network model of aging and frailty developed by our group.  6. Why math models could help us fighting aging? Mathematical modeling become increasingly popular in many areas of science and technology. There is a strong needs for that. In general, mathematical modeling is a central part of the theoretical advances in science. As people say: “Nothing is more practical than a good theory” (Kurt Lewin). As for controlling /postponing/ slowing aging (that I would prefer to “fighting aging”, “combating aging”, and such) the mathematical model is the only thing that allows to understand the processes under investigation, especially the processes involved the complex interactions and nonlinearities, like aging. Without modeling, what we have instead would be a bunch of semantical statements without the possibility to be tested (or falsified). If we do understand the aging process we can do something to modify it. Otherwise, we will be drown in the deep and murky waters of complexity and to fight with each other, instead of fighting aging (as often goes and goes on).",False

EHF Advisor, prof. Arnold Mitnitsky answers questions about aging, frailty index, longevity, mathematical models that help to understand and fight against aging.  Take a look at the first part of his comments.  1. Briefly about myself and why I’m a Team member at eHealth First? My expertise and research interests lie in the area of mathematical modeling of complex biomedical systems. More specifically, I have a longstanding interests in modeling the process of aging. Being affiliated with the Dalhousie University (Department of Medicine) in Halifax, Canada, I was a recipient of several grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to find the answer to the following questions: “How can we quantify aging in individuals and population?” How can we understand the biological aging and what is Biological age as a measure of the aging process, and finally how can we assess it? The problem of data integration is the crucial one in this respect, as more data becomes available with the explosion of the new technologies, such as genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and advanced computational techniques, including the Artificial Intelligence (AI). The eHealth First team members have similar expirations and relevant expertise, so I was delighted to joint this team in the development of the approaches to assess health of individuals during aging with the hope that the new approaches will be implemented in practice.  2. What is aging? Aging is many things (aging is complex and has many aspects) and that is why people who study aging cannot agree all time (rather often). Aging can be defined at the different levels (cellular, subcellular, organ, entire organism). For me, it is a systemic nature of aging that is most important. We can say that aging is the process of changes in multiple aspects of health, declines in functional capacity, and functional reserve, increasing vulnerability to stresses, increasing the level of frailty. My focus is not about semantics but about developing the means that allow to quantify aging. Mathematical modeling lies in the heart of my approach. From that standpoint, we (with my colleagues, geriatrician, professor Kenneth Rockwood) suggested to assess aging as the process of accumulation of health deficits that can be found in multiple databases (clinical, epidemiological, etc.) and we have introduced a measure that can be readily applied to many data to make use of the information available currently and expected in the near future.  3. Why we age? The opinions about that greatly diverge. There are two major theories of aging: the damage accumulation, and genetic programming of aging. I am in favor of the accumulation of damage approach to the origin of aging, as a cause of aging and that is well supported by our mathematical models, especially the network model of aging that shows how the propagation of damage occurs in complex networks. The accumulation and propagation of damage in complex dynamical networks (that represent our organism) explains the major quantitative characteristics of the aging processes, including the exponential increase of mortality with age (the celebrated Gompertz law of mortality) and the accumulation of health deficits with age that ultimately results in increasing the risks of death.",False

That’s why the Team previously planned the timeline for 7 years. Many questions and comments about that were published in our Social Media resources and messengers. So let us comment.  1. Yes, the updated duration of the Project is about 5 years. Nevertheless, it absolutely doesn’t mean you can’t use EHF Apps for such a long period of time. It just means we would like to show you the perspectives for mid- and long-term periods. Also, we aim to create innovative, widely useful, cost-effective and sustainable solution for personalized health and longevity management. Thus, earlier we scheduled to complete MVP within the first 2 years after the Project launch. And to start sales within the first 3 years! And we are working hardly to make EHF Roadmap even better. What have we achieved?  2. We are starting the development of the EHF Platform now. Moreover, we will show the MVP (the Platform basis with the blockchain and centralized DB for data storing and management) BEFORE the launch of the ICO, Round 1! We believe such honest and pro-active approach enforces eHealth First image among potential users and investors.  3. What if you would like to know tech details and see improved Roadmap before the start of Pre-ICO? What if you haven’t enough time and / or don’t will to study the WP, version 1.1? Just wait and at the end of April check for the updates. We’ll provide you with many technical details in a relatively short format. ----  So pls check updated and new WP, Annex 1 and Presentations here: https://www.ehfirst.io/#wp  Thanks!    https://static.tildacdn.com/tild6632-3532-4231-b038-313130626535/eHF_for_WP__12__Titl.jpg  https://static.tildacdn.com/tild3062-6534-4362-b566-643532656562/eHF_for_Annex_1_to_W.jpg  https://static.tildacdn.com/tild6137-3462-4438-b437-646330316561/EHF__Presentation_in.jpg  https://s7.postimg.cc/87fyrcdaj/EHF_Presentation_in_English_April_2018_055.jpg  https://s7.postimg.cc/87fyrcdaj/EHF_Presentation_in_English_April_2018_055.jpg",False

EHF Director in AI and NLP Eray Ozkural: What about EHF's approach to AI and NLP? https://youtu.be/gVKMmyzDZ8M  ----- How about the eHealth First approach to AI? We’re looking at a few possible applications, so I’m going to try to explain what we intend to accomplish. First is medical meta-analysis, looking through a good number of medical articles, and solving some medical problems using this data. This will have a conversational interface for ordinary users, and one that is intended for medical professionals where they can specify more detailed queries. This will help people to make an automated diagnosis based on their medical history and lab work and other sensor data, so we try to learn these things from medical articles, and we find the relevant publications and recommended course of action, basically, doing a lot of what a medical doctor does, of course in a more automated manner. At first, we will make use of existing research, and integrate them into our architecture in a practical manner. And then, we will be adding a lot of things like deep learning, and we will automate the language analysis using deep learning approach, and this will make it a lot more adaptable, and a lot more powerful actually. Deep Learning has started to take over a lot of things in natural language processing, so we’re trying to follow this technology, and we think this will work really well here. We can actually make a conversational engine like Alexa or Siri but one that’s a medical expert that knows all of those articles at a sufficient level. And we’re going to use the medical standards and conventions for understanding the text, so we can ensure sufficient understanding to answer some challenging queries. You can ask about how to treat a general condition, or you can input your personalized data, lab work, sensor readings, medical images and it will infer what your condition is, it will diagnose you, and recommend a medical intervention much like what a doctor does. So, that’s the main goal. Medical image analysis using deep learning will also be achieved by the same system. And, in a later stage, we will also integrate genomics data through deep learning, so it will be able to look at your genome sequence, proteomics, and other *omics data, so these are more advanced stuff, and more expensive stuff, but this is where AI can be really powerful, because personalizing treatment based on your genome is a more complex but potentially much more powerful problem. And then, it will also be able to look at medical images, use deep learning on medical images, to detect conditions like tumors or lesions. So, these are the three basic capabilities of the EHF AI Platform. We think we can do a lot more, for instance, I’m considering a longevity application where we will recommend a longevity combination therapy, personalized, for a specific patient, because every patient will have different biomarkers to improve, and these personalized recommendations can thus be very useful. These are some of the things we are going to do, and we are very excited about them! -----  All the details are on the website http://www.ehfirst.io/ and in the White Paper http://www.ehfirst.io/#wp.

EHF Director in AI and NLP Eray Ozkural: Biomedical publications. https://youtu.be/vm38dmFSpAk  There are millions of biomedical publications, thankfully collated in some online databases, biomedical researchers are very generous in that regard, a lot of articles are open to the public, although some are still behind a paywall. We can access those archives, basically. Now, a human, or a bunch of humans, say you gathered one thousand people,  how much time does it take to go through and summarize the findings and translate to some machine readable format? For a single technical paper, maybe for an expert, it will take only a few hours, but there are millions of articles, so even with such an extensive work force, you would have to do this over and over again, because there are always new papers, and maybe the format you use isn’t enough, so you have to do it all over again. This is obviously something that’s apt for automation, it calls for it, and the best kind of automation we have is AI & machine learning. So we’re going to leverage the power of deep learning to do this task. We want the machine to extract every relevant bit of information from this treasure trove, and use this for preventive medicine, for recommending alternative therapies, helping medical professionals come up with better cures, there is a lot of value in this without doubt.

EHF Smart Contract code is available on GitHub https://github.com/isvirin/neurodao/blob/5fbff1e15b199e5623d37eec00995bdbef716b75/eHealth first/EhfirstCrowdsale.sol  ---  B.   EHF is unique international project with huge agenda. That’s why the Team planned the timeline for 7 years. Many questions and comments about that were published in our Social Media resources and messengers. So let us comment.  1.   Yes, the total duration of the Project is 7 years. Nevertheless, it absolutely doesn’t mean you can’t use EHF Apps for such a long period of time. It just means we would like to show you the perspectives for mid- and long-term periods. Also, we aim to create innovative, widely useful, cost-effective and sustainable solution for personalized health and longevity management. Thus, we scheduled to complete MVP within the first 2 years after the Project launch. And to start sales within the first 3 years! And we are working hardly to make EHF Roadmap even better. What have we achieved?  2.   We are starting the development of the EHF Platform now. Moreover, we will show the MVP (the Platform basis with the blockchain and centralized DB for storing data) BEFORE the launch of the ICO, Round 1! We believe such honest and pro-active approach enforces eHealth First image among potential users and investors.  3.   What if you would like to know tech details and see improved Roadmap before the start of Pre-ICO? What if you haven’t enough time and / or don’t will to study the WP, version 1.1? Just wait and at the end of April check for the updates. We’ll provide you with many technical details in a relatively short format.  ---  C.   Another FAQ from you is the question about funds raised during the Private Placement. So EHF received over $800 000, mostly as a funds that would be invested after successful Pre-ICO in MVP Development and ICO, Round 1, marketing. Negotiations with several more investors are continuing.  ---  D.   As EHF deserves it, considering our will to show the Project from the best-for-investor view and the current situation on the market, EHF Team decide to postpone EHF Pre-ICO launch. The start of the Pre-ICO will be a month later, on May 10, 2018. Up to 1 500 000 EHF tokens for sale. Price at launch 0.006 Ethers. Daily price increment +0.25%. Bonuses of up to 40% is available. AND (1)   First 100 participants will be able to buy tokens with the additional discount 10% to the current Pre-ICO Price (via Smart Contract) AND (2)   After submission the Whitelist form all investors participate in the lottery, in which 20 randomly selected winners will receive an additional 2 000 EHF tokens (the transaction must be completed by May 31, 2018).

EHF Director in AI and NLP Eray Ozkural: What is NLP? https://youtu.be/hplr-d9tp9Q  NLP stands for natural language processing, and it is a subfield of AI where we solve linguistic problems with an AI approach. It may be considered as a fusion of linguistics and computer science, and we can imagine it as a computer taking on the tasks of a linguist as he analyzes the order of words, meaning, and uses of linguistic expressions, speech, and discourse. For instance, there are algorithms in NLP that break down a sentence into its tree-like grammatical structure, find the classes and referents of the words, such as, is it a noun, is it a proper name, is it a verb, what do these words refer to, translate a sentence to another language with statistical methods using a large number of examples, construct a logical representation of a sentence’s meaning out of which questions may be answered or stored in a database, generate a sentence from a meaningful representation, carry out dialogues with humans, recognize and synthesize speech. So, you can see how NLP is related to tools we use everyday like Google Search, and Siri, but the possibilities in NLP are actually much larger. You’ve already seen Google Translate which uses a kind of machine learning to translate, but these tools can fail in some ways so there is a lot of room for improvement. Nowadays, we’re using a lot of deep learning, which is a field of machine learning that uses brain-like neural network architectures to deal with text and speech. Fantastic results have been achieved with speech recognition and synthesis, the results are mostly indistinguishable from human. These new methods can also perform a great textual analysis, they can translate among many languages, we can detect intentions, that’s how Alexa works, and chatbots are already commonplace. These are all NLP applications where we instruct computers to analyze and respond to text and speech with algorithms.  All the details are on the website http://www.ehfirst.io/ and in the White Paper http://www.ehfirst.io/#wp.  The WHITELIST is launched!

EHF Director in AI and ML Eray Ozkural: What is Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning?  AI is making computers perform tasks that require intelligence, such as solving a math problem, or understanding a piece of text. There are many definitions of intelligence in the AI literature. Thinking or acting like human, or thinking or acting rationally, like Mr. Spock. AI spans the whole gamut of our mental faculties such as learning, perception, reasoning, planning, reflecting, language and behavior. There are many approaches in AI, such as symbolic, logical, Bayesian, neural, and evolutionary. On the other hand, machine learning is making models that fit the data. It helps us solve pattern recognition, perception problems, like in vision and speech recognition; statistical problems like classifying or clustering the data, predicting a variable, such as predicting stock movements. Neural networks, and in particular an advanced form of it we call deep learning has shown tremendous success, matching human level in image recognition, and provided new capabilities like style transfer. I think that most AI problems can be solved with machine learning. Deep learning has vastly improved speech recognition, synthesis, language understanding. We can use deep learning to reason, analogize, map questions to answers, and imagine. We have thus already started applying machine learning to solve many kinds of cognitive problems. Either deep learning or AGI methods will likely soon help us achieve human-level across all tasks. Machine learning can also be used to design autonomous or semi-autonomous robots that can adapt to the environment. A popular kind of machine learning application is automating labor such as trading, and legal search.  https://youtu.be/V5uJnwEBB4s  All the details are on the website https://www.ehfirst.io/ and in the White Paper https://www.ehfirst.io/#wp.",False

Its like a computerdrive. It can only be written so much to and then the sectors are destroyed. Also with a lot of memory, this inflicts your behaviour. You are the result of your past and react that way. Thats why elderly people are so unwilling to change their mind about something, because their memorys tell them better but times already have changed and younger people are better at adapting to the new environments and threads.

EHF Director in AI and ML Eray Ozkural: Why I’m a Team member at eHealth First?  https://youtu.be/s1fHiRDdRe0  Hello there. My name is Eray Ozkural. I am the AI director of EHealth First platform. I’ve obtained my PhD in computer science from Bilkent University, Ankara, on the subject of parallel data mining, or big data. Since then, I've primarily worked on Artificial General İntelligence (AGI), or AGI. My specialty is transfer learning, that is, I've designed a long-term memory system for AGI, I've designed scalable, parallel general purpose-machine learning algorithms for human-level AI. I've also been working on deep learning and AI theory. For my theoretical contributions to universal induction, I've received the Kurzweil Best AGI Idea award in 2015. Well, why am I a member of EHFirst? First of all, it is a great team with prominent professionals from the longevity and bioinformatics research community, therefore they know which are the forthcoming problems and how to attack them. Second, it is the first application oriented AI platform on the blockchain, machine learning has the potential to revolutionize healthcare and AI in general can make a huge impact in healthcare as all sorts of predictions and analyses in medicine can be automated. Combined with the AI analyses of millions of research papers, we can make medicine more effective, personalized and preventive. Third, owing to the multitude of data types in medicine, and the data’s higher than usual complexity, the next-generation machine learning algorithms may be particularly helpful, which is a formidable challenge for AGI research. And fourth, and finally, I believe, well, I know that we can defeat biological mortality one day, careful but sure steps are being taken in longevity research, which may eventually help us naturally revitalize by reprogramming our cells to a more youthful state. Along the way, we will need ever more careful monitoring and treatment of our more vital bodies, and AI based automation of routine but important healthcare tasks will help greatly.  All the details are on the website http://www.ehfirst.io/ and in the White Paper http://www.ehfirst.io/#wp.",False

And this has been the best-executed and fastest-adopted implementation of the blockchain so far. Well, that could be forgiven. However, the fact that she has found the vast majority of her success in one area does not exclude that she would be even better suited to another.  Blockchain provides logical, seamless tracking of changes and access to a piece of data. Essentially, the ledger is the perfect way to keep track of and keep track of who changed or accessed those records.  And at eHealth First, we believe Blockchain is the ideal system for managing health records - Blockchain could even lead beyond health data to a veritable revolution in the healthcare industry. Just as it is revolutionizing the financial industry.  Personalized Mobile Health Management  There's a huge market for health management apps - go ahead and search the App Store or Play Market and you'll see it. Hundreds, if not thousands, of applications will claim they can be your new health coach for 2018. Some of these apps are based on good medical principles, but few are truly comprehensive and actually personalized.  Most of these health management applications help you to track your actions. They ask you to step into things that you do - what you eat and when, your practice routines, etc. - so that you achieve certain ""goals"". Some notable apps adopt a semantic approach and ask you to complete a questionnaire to provide you with some sort of diagnosis or assessment of your current physical condition.  The thing is, medicine does not work that way. Medicine is an art - not science - and is subjective. Health management techniques that work for one person may not work for another person. There is a wealth of medical literature that confirms this fact, and it shows different ways in which different people should be treated.  eHealth First, a new healthcare management platform, aims to improve health outcomes and longevity by leveraging this medical literature and personalized diagnostic techniques. They plan to do so in a mobile format using the latest AI, data processing and blockchain technologies to achieve this goal.  How eHealth makes the health of your home possible  Whether your goal is to track a chronic condition or just to improve your overall health, eHealth First may just be the app for you.  The user experience in the app includes three key phases - analysis, diagnosis and recommendation or further analysis. Data on the app is securely stored - mostly using blockchain technology (distributed books) to decode and distribute personal information remotely - meaning that no one else but yourself can access it.  During the analysis phase, the user goes through a first screening. This preliminary analysis appears to the user as a simple questionnaire. Behind the scenes, however, the questions are based on the principles of evidence-based medicine.  Based on this questionnaire, a rough assessment of the user's health is made taking into account the biological age, the placement on the frailty index, and the status of various body systems. At this point, a rough ""diagnosis"" is created. AI algorithms then use this estimate to determine what further testing the user may need.  These tests are offered to the user for a fee as referrals. In certain cases, laboratory tests and medical consultations are recommended and users are referred to a doctor or doctor.  As more and more data of the user is collected, the app gives a more personal health advice. After all, it will seem to the user as if they have a personal doctor they have been visiting for years, right in their pocket!",False

And yes, maximal features of the EHF platform will be developed, if the ICO reaches the hard cap. Nevertheless, we will be able to create the applications with a fully functioning screening module in case of reaching the soft cap. Moreover, to enhance the project attractiveness for investors, users and partners, EHF uses multiple ICO stages. So if EHF can collect, say, $70M investments during the Round I + the Project progress will be OK, there would an opportunity to attract more investments during the Rounds II and III. So even in the case mentioned above, finally all the milestones will be achieved on schedule.

And yes, they will pay 10-50% less than other customers. As you could see, the financial model (even the conservative scenario) is based on this assumption, and still NPV (10-y, 12%) is close to $600M, and EV (Y2023)= $1.4 bln. How could the token holder check, if he / she really receives appropriate discount? Just considering the cost in USD and the token price by the day of payment. Yes, 50% discount isn't an average one  But if token holders pay, for instance, 15% less for appropriate medical examination, will EHF and other investors lose money? It is not necessarily, i.e. a business partner could be interested in flow of customers, agreeing to a reduction in profits per customer. There are many opportunities. In worst-case scenario, when EHF loses all the profits per client due to a discount (that's far from an average case), the missed profits per client aren't expenses, and they doesn't obligatory mean missed profit on a company scale. In our view, the business aspects are quite well represented in the WP. However, I'm agree indeed, some points could be improved and more details could be added. Thank you!",False

To make a real change and inplement complex valuable eco-system, we need to include in EHF many different features: - AI and ML; - NLP; - blockchain and mixed model of health data storage; - telemedicine and expert teams.  That's a point.  Secondly, we believe, health care system users / consumers, healthy people and patients must hold the rights to deal with their confidential health data. It includes the right to share these data with appropriate insurance companies / HMOs / hospitals and clinics / doctors / relatives / health and dietary consultants etc.  We completely understand the investors want to make a profit ASAP.  And as you could see, the project has multiple milestones. So the first alpha version (MVP) will be available less than 2 years after the project launch. And sells will start much earlier than 2025  It means, EHF has a complex vision and plans its activity for many years ahead. And it means also, there will be achievements after 2-3-4-5-6 years of project development + marketing activities / promotions + sells within the next 7 years.

Let me tell you about our progress and plans.  You can find out about the news in EHF Newsletter: www.news.ehfirst.io Subscribe and you will get all the latest information about EHF ICO and Project first via email. Next week there will be an update.  As I mentioned earlier, we will post one new video on ehfirst Youtube channel every day, from Monday to Friday: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDOXlcfFnSTVRlkqy8kojWA Subscribe!  There will be several new articles in crypto media soon. We will inform you about it.  We are negotiating with big crypto funds. Hope to inform you about good news soon!  Some of you asked us:  1. What about brief version of the WP, that should be smaller than the Brochure? The WP is the main source of info about eHealth First Project and ICO. For sure, there are a few people, who read it completely (like, for example, big imvestors do). Anyway, we ask you to see the WP and read Sections interesting for you before buying tokens. It's absolutely OK, that some crypto investors emphasize a team, others look at financial plan, token economy, vision, project technologies, legal aspects. We hope, all of you will see the high quality of the Project, attention to details, importance for society and profitability for investors. And translations into multiple languages will be ready early in March (before the Pre-ICO launch).  2. What about WP translations? The WP translations into multiple languages will be ready early in March (before the Pre-ICO launch). Yes, most of them are developing within EHF Baunty Campaign. Yes, we use proof-reading and we will do our best to control for quality of the translated WPs. Yes, the conditions (costs and terms) for tranlsating are the same, regardless of a language. We know about market variability in the cost of tranlsation. Nevertheless, as we pay in EHF tokens, we consider to set one price for the WP translation.  3. It's clear how to make a profit in long-term period. It's also have a good chance to have it in mid-term one. However, what if I would like to have a profit within half a year? Indeed, we can't garantee that, nevertheless there is a chance also. Please wait for the video answer, that will be published soon.  4. When will EHF tokens be traded on the exchange? We are planning to launch the trades by the end of 2018 (by November), 4-5 months after the end of the ICO, Round I. And there will be no vesting period for purchased tokens.  5. Why are the bonuses on Private Placement so big: 50 to 70%? The bonus size depends on the investment size and the month of buying tokens (the later the smaller). See here http://www.ehfirst.io/#privateplacement For most part of investors the discount is 50% vs. 40% on Pre-ICO. And the maximal amount of tokens sold on the PP is 1 mln.  6. Is Aubrey going to appear in one of those videos the team is preparing as well, since  the platform is particularly inclined toward both health & longevity? Yes, we are scheduling it and hope the videos will be ready in March. There are other outstanding EHF team members who also are making video answers for you.  7. Could you diminish the minimal investment threshold on the Private Placement? 10 ETH / 0.5 BTC it too much. Such a level was set as all the transactions during the PP are checked and processed manualy and we must guarantee the maximal bomuses for mid-sized and large investors. There will be no limits on Pre-ICO and ICO and anyone will be able to participate, regardless of the investment size. Nevertheless, we received more than 300 messages via telegram @nkryuchkov1, https://t.me/ehfirstgroup, emails investor@ehfirst.io, nkryuchkov@ehfirst.io and Facebbok with the requests to decrease the minimal limit to 5,3 and even 1 ETH.  So to solve this issue, we need to see how many of you are ready to invest say 2 ETH or more in February, having the same bonuses as for the 10 ETH investment (50%).  Please: - reply to this post saying how much would you like to invest minimally in February; - OR write to me directly ar nkryuchkov@ehfirst.io, mentioning how much would you like to invest minimally in February.  Next week basing on your answers we'll set new minimal investment threshold for February to get you opportunity to enter the Project with the maximal possible discount.    Thank you very much for your interest and support!  Yours, Nickolay Kryuchkov and EHF Team.  https://static.tildacdn.com/tild6161-3539-4533-a439-343630636434/_205x.png",False

You can also imagine this situation: During the second round of ICO, the price of tokens on exchanges will drop below the price of the ICO. We all know that volatility is huge and in short periods of time there can be grandiose falls and price rises. Then the second round will become unsold and according to the document developers will have to burn all unsold tokens. But as a result, they will not receive money for further work on the project. The situation will become somewhat uncertain. I have not yet fully read the white paper, but already I noticed something about the second generation of new tokens. But so far I have not understood why this is so: Generation I. EHF will enable trusted payments for EHF storage, bandwidth and processing worldwide top-level expertise in healthcare. Generation II. EHF aims to become the token governing exchange of decentralized peer-topeer health-related services and products. A EHF token holder has the inherent right to replace (by choice) each existing coin of previous generation into a new one at no cost. Gen-II EHF tokens will be announced and offered to existing holders, which can choose to send their old tokens to the company in exchange for the new ones. All legacy generation tokens will be destroyed and annulled once replaced. All generation tokens will retain their attributes of independence from the Company itself and will bear no rights in relation to the Company itself or its activities.",False
