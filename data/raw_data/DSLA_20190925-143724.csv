Well, they are bound to the scalability of the architecture they are running on top. Right now Stacktical deploys its SLA guarantees on Ethereum. So for an enforcement they might have delays of minutes for compensation transfers... But they are still incredibly faster that the traditional model that involve human processes and coordination + customer claims to receive a compensation on their next billing cycle.

Our belief is that the blockchain is a technology to incentivize human behaviour in a system. In our case, that would be incentivizing online service stakeholders: providers, employees, users, insurance companies and so on.  If we talk about ""mass"" adoption, we're talking about getting the product in the hands of users. For now, we are focusing on helping online service providers manage the expectations of their users using SLAs, but at some point, we will also empower users themselves with more capabilities by launching products that are more or less dedicated to them.",False

The platform relies on a circular economy, powered by the Decentralized Service Level Agreement (DSLA) ERC-20 utility token, as per the diagram below :    The provider defines service level objectives (A) and stake DSLA tokens (B) to form a compensation pool (C).  The compensation pool is depleted according to good service levels (D) and bad service levels (D’).  Token owners can either withdraw the DSLA they received as a compensation to their ERC-20 compatible wallet (E) or exchange them for promotional offers, loots and other service collectibles in the Stacktical marketplace (F).  All tokens exchanged on the Stacktical marketplace return to the compensation pool (C), ready to handle the next performance failure.  BENEFITS  For service providers:  Streamline their service level management process Streamline their (total) compensation management process Increase their attractivity as a service provider with demonstrable proofs of care Increase the reliability of their online services Increase the performance of their support teams Better retain consumers, customers and partners Better retain talent and support heroes Reduce the cost of disputes  For users:  Get automatically compensated upon performance failures and downtimes Access an exclusive catalog of service collectibles and loots Fair, Inclusive, Accountable, Transparent & Trustable service providers  For employees:  Get automatically compensation for proactively anticipating performance failures, meeting service level objectives and support objectives Increased employee satisfaction Increased service level management efficiency  TOKEN SALE  The DSLA private sale is in progress. The DSLA pre sale will start on November 1st 2018. The DSLA public sale date will be announced right after the end of the pre sale.
