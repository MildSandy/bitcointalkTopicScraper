BEDOUR ALSHAIGY OLEG MINENKO AARON BROWN STEPHEN EVERETT CHANDRA PRAKASH TIM BUKHER THOMPSON BUKHER LLP JACOB KOSTECKI     What Do We Do?     Why Artificial Intelligence?  Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly emerging as a transformative technology. Recent advances in the availability of computing power and large training data sets have allowed machine learning algorithms to tackle problems of impressive complexity. From mastering the game of “Go” to powering voice-controlled assistants, AI is already making an impact. Yet we only stand at the threshold of a revolution. The global benefits of AI are estimated to exceed $15 trillion by 2030. An AI industry is scaling up to deliver these benefits, with a predicted annual growth rate of 52% over the next eight years. The AI industry alone is expected to generate annual revenue of $58 billion by 2025. However, there are some constraints that are currently holding back the development and wide distribution of the benefits of AI.   Why a Token?  1. AIGC as a Reward Users are paid to earn certificates, increasing incentives to learn, subsequently increasing our pool of AI developers.  2. AIGC as Game Currency Users then use AIGC as their entry fee for games and challenges, and receive their rewards in the token if their bot wins a game or tournament.  3. AIGC for Crowdsourcing Crowdsourcing customers pay micropayments in AIGC to the users  that collectively participate to solve the problem.  4. AIGC for Recruitment Recruiters will pay AIGC to access our recruitment system and proceeds will be shared with users that have opted in to the recruitment platform.  5. AIGC in the Marketplace Micropayments will be made in AIGC to bots in the Bot Service Marketplace,  by users who choose to utilize a bot’s AI services.  6. An Immutable Record The blockchain records users’ course progress, game results and crowdsourcing history, giving a proof of AI development ability to businesses.    Token Economics  50 million Hard Cap (Token Sale) Hard cap for the token sale is 50m (excluding bonuses), to be sold over 3 phases.  25 million Community Reserve Reserved for future incentives to build the community, for example competition prizes, subsidised challenges, marketing etc.  25 million Company Pool (Retained) Retained by us to aid with the sale, e.g. bonuses, token sale costs, bounties, partner compensation, and future fundraising.

Is there any lock-up period for this bonus? Because when you release the coin for trading everyone who got 50% bonus will definitely dump causing a panic sell to the regular folks who bought without bonus. If you don't have lock-up for the early bonus, consider my advice to implement it. It will benefit the whole ICO and what is more important your supporters.",False

AI Gaming is an existing platform to educate, assess and source AI development expertise.  We have 6 major areas of functionality, all driven by the token: Education - We pay developers to take courses and earn certificates in AI development techniques. Competition - We offer various challenges ranging from one-on-one games to multiplayer hackathon tournaments.  AIGC is the stake and the reward for these challenges (but note this is not a gambling site - all games are skill based). Crowdsourcing - We allow customers to offer micropayments of token to have our user and bot network solve their real world problems.  We re working with a large grocery chain and an e-commerce retailer to solve commercial problems, and we are looking at gamifying challenges for a police force, an online ticket seller (identifying touts) and a recruitment agency. Branding - Customers can create custom challenges to encourage our user base to use their systems or get their brand across to this particular demographic (for example we currently have the ""Microsoft Cognitive Challenge"" and a forthcoming event is sponsored by Microsoft) Recruitment - Users can opt in to a recruitment system and earn token by simply being browsed by potential employers or agencies. Bot Service Marketplace - Users can create specialised bots which can be called by other bots (for example those solving a crowdsourcing problem) and earn token by offering services.  Blockchain - we currently use a centralised database to store user's educational, competition, crowdsourcing etc. results, but we will migrate this to a blockchain solution, so that this information is available in an immutable fashion to future crowdsourcing customers, recruiters and bot service customers - like a form of academic transcript, but one which is trustworthy and objective.  We are not specifically targeting the gaming industry, although there will be plenty of problems that they have which could be usefully solved by AI.  The ""gaming"" in our name refers to the fact we offer games on our system to encourage sign ups and make competition fun, then we gamify real world challenges to encourage our users to consider more real world problems using the same platform and interfaces, ultimately being able to offer services that have a real world impact.  Hope that helps, please fire away with any further questions!  Paul (founder)",False

AI Gaming offers both online and real world courses which result in the user being awarded a certificate.  We have one certificate online at the moment as a proof of concept and we have an Oxford University DPhil creating two additional courses.  These will be offered online and at UK universities next term.  The two courses in development are an introduction to python (the programming language we use on the site), and an introduction to AI.  We will continue developing more advanced courses, including those in partnership with companies who offer AI services like Microsoft.  Last week we cohosted an event with Microsoft at Oxford University to promote use of their Cognitive Services API and we have been invited to run the same challenge at their Imagine Cup world finals in Seattle in July.",False
