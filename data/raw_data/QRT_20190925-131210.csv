Question: How many ICO has this team made ?  I see that same team also made Hodler Mining ICO https://foundico.com/ico/hodler-mining.html https://hodlermining.com/    Hi dkbit98,  We have made 2 ICO's.  Qredit (started in February 2018) and Hodler Mining.  We were hired for the project Hodler Mining until the former CEO decided to go on a different path. We have then decided to take over the project and continue Hodler Mining at the location in Geleen (Netherlands). 225k was raised with Hodler Mining and it's going to start within 2 weeks.  With the Qredit ICO, we've made 643k USD. Qredit was meant to be a rewards token on the Neblio platform. After the decision to swap to our own native blockchain, we offered the early investors a refund at ICO price. 70% has already been refunded and we are now doing a rebranding of Qredit with many more use-cases.",False

In what countries are you going to operate this platform? Of course, there should be a guinea pig in every project? And do you have the list of merchants already in the pipeline?    Several projects are simultaneously venturing in this kind of business. But it's a matter of how many consumers you can attract to utilize your platform as well as merchants that want to integrate their services to your system.",False

In every project there is a guinea pig.  The guinea pigs in chronological order are: - 3 Companies in the Netherlands (pilot shops) (a few more already said that they are willing to use Qredit, 24 to be precise, but this will be announced once the pilot phase is over) - MIF (Money Fair Event in Maastricht). http://mifevents.com/en/ - Ghana - Caribbean - Locals   The first shop that is already using Qredit as a pilot is Simotion Computers in Beek. (the Netherlands). The second shop is a tyre company in Hoensbroek (the Netherlands) named Grip Bandenservice (Grip Tyre Service). The third company is a huge car lease company in the Netherlands. (I'm not allowed to share these details until half of October).  The MIF is a huge event in the south of the Netherlands. http://mifevents.com/en/ It's an event where coin collectors meet with each to discuss about coins or to trade coins. (physical coins), but they've recently allowed blockchain startups to join the event. The point here is that this is our entrance to other events in the MECC building. People will be able to use Qredit to pay for food and drinks at the event. If it's a success, Qredit is going to be used on all other events in this building for the catering service.  Everything explained above is a start and more like a pilot phase for our project. If everything succeeds, we are going to dive deeper and announce further information. As we don't want to create to much expectation unless we have something really solid.  Another project that is going on is the country Ghana. We have a good partnership with a person from the royal family in Ghana. He's looking for a cryptocurrency to use in their region and they are willing to implement Qredit as a currency. As long as we can provide a gateway for crypto-fiat conversion.  Then we have the Caribbean. We are going to announce a partnership soon with Potion Owl from Jamaica. Potion Owl is a healthcare service in Jamaica, we've talked about Qredit integration in their region along with their own services. The goal here is to bank the unbanked. As some people know, creditcards or bank accounts are only for the wealthy people in the Caribbean. We will be there to disrupt that idea and implement our own ""Qredit Cards"" for the less wealthy people.  And our main goal is to start in the south of the Netherlands. During the MIF event, we are going to invite local communities and the municipality to view our product during demonstration. We already know that they are looking for crypto integration in the region. Why not use something that is already done? instead of waiting for government funds to create something new?  If you join us on Telegram. You will be able to follow all of our updates. The following weeks will be very exciting!  ",False
