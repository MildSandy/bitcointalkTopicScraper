The project is now open to public participation through a Token Generation Event.   WHAT IS PROSUME  The future is prosumer – individual consumers, energy communities and businesses will exchange energy more efficiently and sustainably, maximizing the use of locally produced renewable sources. Decentralized, decarbonized and digitalized prosumer policies is the only possible future for energy!  PROSUME Energy is a platform that will revolutionize the exchange of electricity from both renewable and fossil fuel sources. The project, based in Switzerland, is backed by a team of professionals with in-depth knowledge of the energy sector and blockchain technology. The PROSUME platform connects independent power producers, consumers, utility companies and energy communities in a locally shared market where each peer is free to interact in a multi-tenant ecosystem.  The main goal of the project is to promote the decentralization of power models and empower energy communities. In order for this to happen, Prosume will focus on the implementation of P2P energy exchange policies, targeting possible solutions for existing energy framework barriers (both from a physical and legal standpoint) and investing in continuous Research & Development in order to offer state-of-the-art hardware and IoT-devices related to smart metering/billing, smart grids, energy routers and devices.  PROSUME is based on 3 main pillars: ● Decentralization: any consumer can see from his utility bill that the bulk of what he pays comes from distribution services and taxes instead of his actual consumption. In a decentralised energy community, prosumers would become the main players, cutting out these intermediary costs. ● Digitalization: with the platform, consumers can provide the entire energy market with accurate consumption prediction in order to better balance energy peaks. This would bring about the optimization of resources and promote the development of more sustainable energy policies, including the diversification of sources, etc. ● Decarbonization: starting a fossil or nuclear company today is not economically convenient anymore; companies would need several years to amortize initial costs due to the high investments needed; furthermore, a great part of primary sources wouldn’t be local, increasing costs even further. It is for this reason that small energy companies have to seek alternatives through local sources, giving priority to the most sustainable and renewable ones.  When it comes to energy exchange, the links between prosumers must be safe and transparent, just like the ones in the blockchain virtual structure. This disruptive technology has been held as ideal for the execution of this project since it combines IT with cryptography and governance principles to create a safer, more resilient and transparent place, where individuals can be independent in choosing their energy sources.  In order to support the project, Prosume is launching a Token Generation Event based on an upgradeable ERC20 derivate token named PEF on the Ethereum platform, the industry standard for issuing custom digital assets and smart contracts.  Early adopters and strategic partners can currently exchange ETH, BTC or LTC for PEF tokens with a significant bonus*. *(1st 10,000 tokens: 47% | 2nd 10,000: 37%)  The ERC20 token interface allows for the deployment of a standard token that is compatible with the existing infrastructure of the Ethereum ecosystem, such as development tools, wallets, and exchanges.  The PEF Token will be upgradeable using an opt-in mechanism for future upgrades and it will be non-transferable until the end of the event.

We are a team of senior applied cryptographers enthusiasts and energy experts .  We have been working on this topic for almost two years.We have several pilot projects with different energy communities and utilities in different stages. We strongly believe that applied cryptography could be disruptive to the energy models, creating smarter and most efficient energy policy and rules.  We would like to have a serious and sincere feed back from the community, we are promoting an ico for a serious and reliable project. We need your help and support, we strongly believe that communities must be part of the process.  Please I am here for any constructive discussions and precious  advice.  Thank you in advance,  Alph",False
