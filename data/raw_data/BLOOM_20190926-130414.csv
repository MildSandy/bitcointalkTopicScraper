Hey yall, just wanted to throw out some info on our upcoming ICO with the hopes of getting some feedback from the community here. We've built a social platform with a community of over 280k moms active monthly (yes, moms), on arguably the worlds most engaged mobile app - mom.life.   The short version of the story is that we're not just jumping on the bandwagon here, but we've been working for several years on tools to give moms the greatest possible agency and ownership of the content they create. Blockchain and the ability to build a decentralized deflationary economy around a digital currency are providing us a way to take this to the next level. The things our users are already doing to add value to the app such as content creation, providing support to other users, and network growth, are our equivalent of mining. We are creating a system of direct incentives that will allow our users to monetize their time on social media through the kinds of social and commercial interactions they are already involved in.

I know that's super broad strokes, but did it answer your question? I'd be more than happy to get into the weeds if you'd like. ",False

But what happens if you already have an economy?  Today, Mom.life — a global social network and messaging app for moms that has over 1 million users — has launched a digital economy that converts the app’s existing rewards into tokens with real-world value.  Founded in 2015, and with $2.5 million in funding, Mom.life is a free mobile app that helps moms around the world support each other by sharing parenting knowledge. Before today’s announcement, moms could reward each other with “Blooms,” which they have been doing since July 2017. During the app’s first two weeks of circulation, 150,000 Blooms were given out, and 500,000 Blooms are now given monthly. In fact, one-third of the active audience is now being compensated for content creation and assistance through this token system.
