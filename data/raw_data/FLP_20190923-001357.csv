At the infrastructure level, we’ve been stress testing our Ethereum cluster dedicated for FLP transactions and we’re pleased with the results thus far. The next step is to perform final integration and then conduct live testing. Once the testing results meet our expectations, we’ll open up the FLP wallet and payment to our community members in a phased rollout.  Separately, we also have begun development of the FLP wallet within our iOS Gameflip app. A preview of the app UI is shown below.  As mentioned in our previous update we’ve been working to localize our marketplace to 10 different languages.

Got no problems with companies competing in the same market. It's the way capitalism work after all.  Also, I've analysed the monthly visits of opskins.com vs gameflip.com with the SimilarWeb chrome extension. Opskins has 12.3 millions monthly visitors vs 5.3 million monthly visitors for gameflip. I'd say gameflip is doing very good and that makes for an excellent investment with FLP tokens, even though it is not at the absolute top.  The other point to take in consideration is growth. Opskins went from 10.9 million monthly visits six months ago vs 12.3 million monthly visits today for an excellent 12% increase. Contrast it with gameflip that had 2.6 millions monthly visits 6 months ago vs 5.3 million monthly visits today for a whopping 103% increase. That's a meteoric rise that makes me confident in the future of GameFlip as a company.  As for GameCredits and Dmarket, just by looking at the surface level ( I don't want to spend too much time researching them ), they seem like great projects, but they are not building on an existing successful platform with loyal customers like Opskins and GameFlip do. I think that makes DMarket and GameCredits riskier investments, built on speculation rather than solid fundamentals.  In the end, the whole gaming digital goods industry is projected to grow, so whether you invest in FLP tokens with GameFlip or WAX with opskins, you'll make a good investment. GameFlip, however, has had amazing growth these past 6 months and will probably continue to expand. I think there's enough space for everybody in this sector and I'm not concerned at all for the future of FLP tokens.",False

Now that the token sale has ended with a smashing success, our team is focused on one key goal: building strong demand for FLP amongst gamers from all around the world. To deliver upon this goal, we are hard at work on several parallel initiatives including Publisher Partnerships, eSports Branding and Product Development. Here are the main developments in each of these categories:  Publisher Partnerships We are excited to announce the official launch of the FLP Early Access Program to a select group of innovative publishers who seek to expand their business onto the blockchain. Among the benefits, the early access program provides publishers with (1) substantial incentive FLP tokens to be distributed by the publisher to their community of gamers allowing them to transact digital goods in the Gameflip marketplace and (2) exclusive early access to the FLP SDK, allowing publishers to place their digital gaming goods onto the blockchain and leveraging smart contracts to execute fraud-free transactions. Publishers who integrate the FLP SDK will receive a commission for every transaction of their digital good that is enabled by the FLP crypto-token.  If you are a game publisher or developer and would like to contact us about the FLIP Early Access Program, please send your inquiry to bd@gameflip.com.  eSports Branding We are partnering with top global eSports organizations to bring FLP to the competitive gaming masses. eSports oriented games are the biggest drivers of demand for digital gaming goods and it’s one of the fastest growing segments within the gaming market. We are very excited to contribute to this growth and can’t wait to see the possibilities for FLP within the realm of competitive gaming.  Product Development As previously announced, FLP will soon be available as payment method in the Gameflip marketplace. Our SDK for collaboration with publishers will take development priority after FLP payments and payouts are available on Gameflip.  More news and announcements are coming soon! Stay tuned!

More FLP is coming your way. Here’s the moment you’ve all been waiting for (since our last message): the breakdown for how we’ll achieve a 43.2% token ownership for our supporters. Over the entire token sale (pre-sale and main sale), we received 10,753.00 ETH and issued 2,633,123 FLPs. We also received 356.48 BTC for which we’ll issue 3,065,545 more FLPs. Altogether, we’ll issue a grand total of 5,698,668 FLPs. But there’s still a lot more to be had before we reach our full token distribution goal. So we’re multiplying the total number of FLPs sold (5,698,668) by 7.58 to obtain 43,200,000—the amount of FLP we promised for our supporters. What does that mean to you? We’re going to scale the number of FLP you’ve already purchased by multiplying your tokens by 7.58! The FLPs will be sent to your wallets and will be made tradeable by 1/16 or sooner. Please note: the multiplier has been rounded to 2 decimal places, so there may be minor rounding differences.",False

I am glad I was part of their bounty campaign during the ICO pre-sale stage of this project.  Quote from: Gameflip ICO on December 08, 2017, 08:36:51 PM Dear FLIP community members, we have great news regarding our product progress and partnership discussions.  From our discussions with both game publishers and game tournament organizers, the effort required to extend our marketplace to leverage blockchain and to deliver a viable solution for these partners is lower than we initially anticipated. Because of this, we’ve determined that we only need an additional budget of between $3 million to $5 million USD to make FLIP successful, given the $10 million we’ve already raised from our existing venture investors.  Thus, we will lower our goal to 6,000 ETH and our hard cap to 12,000 ETH (token sale ends 72 hours after reaching this hard cap). Also, we’ll add FLIP as a payment option on Gameflip.com in Q1 of 2018, creating instant demand from our 2 million gamers.  I think they will reach the new goal in no time and the ICO will close early, as they have already reached more than half of the new goal.  Looking forward to upcoming updates from the team.",False

Gameflip is part of the emerging breed of Silicon Valley startups turning towards the ICO market, despite being backed by top investors and having years of traction. For these established and experienced companies, an ICO is a chance to connect with arguably just as powerful of a community in crypto and help build an extension of contributor ownership, transparency, and security on the blockchain.  Gameflip entered the crypto scene in 2017 as a Silicon Valley-based, 2 million member-strong global digital goods marketplace for gamers. With more than 500,000 active monthly users, Gameflip transactions total millions of dollars in digital goods each month. Being backed by VCs such as Lightbank, Bullpen Capital, and GoAhead Ventures has allowed Gameflip to build out a team of highly experienced entrepreneurs, advisors, and investors. The core team previously built Aeria Games into a $100M game publishing business, an experience that has grounded the team and led them to carve out their current path in the crypto community.  https://coinidol.com/gameflip-ico-help-gamers-and-publishers-around-world/",False

Given the early pre-sale success, the ICO has a targeted goal of 15,000 ETH for the duration of the sale, with a trigger to end the sale 72 hours after reaching 30,000 ETH.  Minimum contributions for the campaign will be 0.1 ETH with no maximum purchase amount. The Gameflip team is currently working on accepting BTC payments and will have it ready this week. Bonuses will start at 25% and stagger down to 15% and 10% for later contributions, incentivizing early FLIP supporters to invest earlier in the ICO.  One way Gameflip stand out from other ICOs is with its focus on game publishers. Gameflip has reserved 40% of the total supply of FLIPs to incentivize publishers by allowing them to sell these FLIPs to their community and keep up to 100% of the proceeds. Gamers will also be incentivized by having access to a liquid marketplace that is safe, transparent and reliable.  “Publishers are the key to success in this market. Our competitors are trying to build marketplaces on the blockchain without an established platform behind them, an experienced team among them, or an outward focus on publishers guiding them — and that’s simply impossible,” said JT Nguyen, CEO of Gameflip.  Gameflip’s publisher-centric model is the product of decades of combined experience in the gaming industry. Prior to founding Gameflip, the company’s core team built the global games publishing business Aeria Games from the ground up, cultivating a community of 40 million gamers.  “The Gameflip team is excited to hit the ground running in this ICO. We have built out an amazing community of FLIP supporters, beyond our existing user base, that are passionate about gaming and creating a better gaming experience for everyone transacting digitally,” added JT Nguyen.",False

We believe that having a handful of competitors in a new evolving space is good as it signals the market potential can be very large. We also believe it's wise to never underestimate any competitor!  The key advantages of FLIP are as follows:  1. Gameflip Marketplace Platform - The Gameflip marketplace platform has been transacting gaming digital goods since the beginning of 2016 with millions of dollars processed across 2 million gamers. We fully understand the risks associated with managing digital goods transactions and the strategy to scale the marketplace rapidly. Our plan is to enhance our platform to provide the highest levels of transparency and security by implementing blockchain and smart contracts.  2. Experience - Collectively, our Gameflip team has over a century of starting, operating and scaling start-up companies. This is our passion! On top of that, we have a world class team of advisors, including the co-founder of Electronic Arts, the co-founder of GREE and the founder of Bigpoint, all of which are the top global gaming companies across the globe.  3. Incentives for Publishers and Game Developers - This is a key point we believe our competitors have missed. Clearly, there is demand from gamers to sell their digital goods but the publishers are the gatekeepers. Without providing strong and aligned incentives, something we've done by allocating 40% of our FLIP tokens for network growth, we don't believe the publishers will join the decentralized network. If you step into their shoes, we are asking them to try out a new """"""""unproven"""""""" technology to develop a new revenue stream. This is risky for them so we need strong incentives as well as a clear onboarding plan, something which we know well since our team previously ran a $100M publishing business called Aeria Games before starting this business.",False

We also believe it's wise to never underestimate any competitor.  The key advantages of FLIP are as follows: 1. Gameflip Marketplace Platform - The Gameflip marketplace platform has been transacting gaming digital goods since the beginning of 2016 with millions of dollars processed across 2 million gamers. We fully understand the risks associated with managing digital goods transactions and the strategy to scale the marketplace rapidly. Our plan is to enhance our platform to provide the highest levels of transparency and security by implementing blockchain and smart contracts.  2. Experience - Collectively, our Gameflip team has over a century of starting, operating and scaling start-up companies. This is our passion! On top of that, we have a world class team of advisors, including the co-founder of Electronic Arts, the co-founder of GREE and the founder of Bigpoint, all of which are the top global gaming companies across the globe.  3. Incentives for Publishers and Game Developers - This is a key point we believe our competitors have missed. Clearly, there is demand from gamers to sell their digital goods but the publishers are the gatekeepers. Without providing strong and aligned incentives, something we've done by allocating 40% of our FLIP tokens for network growth, we don't believe the publishers will join the decentralized network. If you step into their shoes, we are asking them to try out a new ""unproven"" technology to develop a new revenue stream. This is risky for them so we need strong incentives as well as a clear on-boarding plan, something which we know well since our team previously ran a $100M publishing business called Aeria Games before starting this business.

Ethereum’s recent Byzantium hard fork, upcoming Bitcoin hard forks, and potential changes to international regulations.  In light of all these conditions, we have decided to extend our pre-sale by one week and push back the start date of our main sale. This will provide time for the Ethereum and Bitcoin network changes to stabilize as well as give everyone an opportunity to get some additional clarity on factors impacting this space.  And since many of you have expressed interest in purchasing FLIP tokens with BTC, we’re going to use the extra time to expand payment methods so you can do just that. We’ll also use this extended time to keep driving awareness in the crypto community.  The pre-sale will be extended until Oct. 27, and the main sale will now begin on Nov. 28.  We also started accepting KickCoins on KickICO platform.  For buyers using BTC, we will have a manual process to convert your BTC to ETH. If you’d like to sign up, please add yourself to this list: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRt9MLN_raaN-hpHkBH3nzSncrjle4V-imgtO7lubKtcbE1g/viewform  If you want to buy FLIP’s with KickCoins, you can do it on KickICO platform: https://www.kickico.com/campaigns/35481/join-gameflip-crowdsale",False

The key advantages of FLIP are:  - Gameflip Marketplace Platform - The Gameflip marketplace platform has been transacting gaming digital goods since the beginning of 2016 with millions of dollars processed across 2 million gamers. We fully understand the risks associated with managing digital goods transactions and the strategy to scale the marketplace rapidly. Our plan is to enhance our platform to provide the highest levels of transparency and security by implementing blockchain and smart contracts.  - Experience - Collectively, our Gameflip team has over a century of starting, operating and scaling start-up companies. This is our passion! On top of that, we have a world class team of advisors, including the co-founder of Electronic Arts, the co-founder of GREE and the founder of Bigpoint, all of which are the top global gaming companies across the globe.  - Incentives for Publishers and Game Developers - This is a key point we believe our competitors have missed. Clearly, there is demand from gamers to sell their digital goods but the publishers are the gatekeepers. Without providing strong and aligned incentives, something we've done by allocating 40% of our FLIP tokens for network growth, we don't believe the publishers will join the decentralized network.

If the buyer claims the digital good is invalid and the seller has no way to prove the digital good was indeed valid, as is the case with Steam keys, how are you going to handle that dispute? And since this was paid for with crypto it's impossible to charge back in case fraud did take place. Escrow doesn't help, because neither party knows the truth, except Valve.

We fully understand the risks associated with managing digital goods transactions and the strategy to scale the marketplace rapidly. Our plan is to enhance our platform to provide the highest levels of transparency and security by implementing blockchain and smart contracts.  - Experience - Collectively, our Gameflip team has over a century of starting, operating and scaling start-up companies. This is our passion! On top of that, we have a world class team of advisors, including the co-founder of Electronic Arts, the co-founder of GREE and the founder of Bigpoint, all of which are the top global gaming companies across the globe.  - Incentives for Publishers and Game Developers - This is a key point we believe our competitors have missed. Clearly, there is demand from gamers to sell their digital goods but the publishers are the gatekeepers. Without providing strong and aligned incentives, something we've done by allocating 40% of our FLIP tokens for network growth, we don't believe the publishers will join the decentralized network. If you step into their shoes, we are asking them to try out a new """"unproven"""" technology to develop a new revenue stream. This is risky for them so we need strong incentives as well as a clear onboarding plan, something which we know well since our team previously ran a $100M publishing business called Aeria Games before starting this business.""",False

The key advantages of FLIP are as follows: 1. Gameflip Marketplace Platform - The Gameflip marketplace platform has been transacting gaming digital goods since the beginning of 2016 with millions of dollars processed across 2 million gamers. We fully understand the risks associated with managing digital goods transactions and the strategy to scale the marketplace rapidly. Our plan is to enhance our platform to provide the highest levels of transparency and security by implementing blockchain and smart contracts.  2. Experience - Collectively, our Gameflip team has over a century of starting, operating and scaling start-up companies. This is our passion! On top of that, we have a world class team of advisors, including the co-founder of Electronic Arts, the co-founder of GREE and the founder of Bigpoint, all of which are the top global gaming companies across the globe.  3. Incentives for Publishers and Game Developers - This is a key point we believe our competitors have missed. Clearly, there is demand from gamers to sell their digital goods but the publishers are the gatekeepers. Without providing strong and aligned incentives, something we've done by allocating 40% of our FLIP tokens for network growth, we don't believe the publishers will join the decentralized network. If you step into their shoes, we are asking them to try out a new ""unproven"" technology to develop a new revenue stream. This is risky for them so we need strong incentives as well as a clear onboarding plan, something which we know well since our team previously ran a $100M publishing business called Aeria Games before starting this business.",False

Please remember that the pre-sale starts in just few hours, Friday, October 13th, 19:00 UTC.  We’d also like to share some exciting news below.  Advisors We’ve added a few key advisors who will quickly help us recruit and onboard the top global game publishers. The new advisors are Malte Barth, head of eSports at MTG (owners of ESL), Chris Akhavan, Chief Revenue Officer of Glu Mobile and Yoon Im, Senior VP of Publishing at Perfect World.  Token Pre-sale After discussing with our advisers we came to the conclusion that it will be beneficial for all our backers if we lower goal for the pre-sale to 3,000 ETH and set hard cap of 7,000 ETH. This way we’ll guarantee higher demand after the sale and token value growth. [we'll update first 2 messages of the thread soon with this information.]  Publishers We have a strong pipeline of publishers who are interested in adopting the FLIP ecosystem and are in the process of signing a Letter of Intent (LOI).
