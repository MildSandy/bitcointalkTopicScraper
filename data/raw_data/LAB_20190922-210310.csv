They are called Trade Instruments, meaning,  instruments that facilitate trade. Stocks are an example of trade  instruments that aren't money, they have no actual value but they  represent a share of a company and the company itself does the work that  turns the profits that gives a share its theoretical value. All trade  Instruments work along the same lines: Fiat is traded by banks and  Foreign Exchange companies, Stock is traded on Stock Exchanges such as  the New York Stock Exchange and Cryptocurrencies are traded on various  Cryptocurrency Exchanges. All of their values are representations of  real things, for example Stocks Represent created and distributed goods  and services by a particular company, while fiat currency represents  created and distributed goods and services of a nation. Both change  based on industrial/technological/scientific/developmental/etc.  advancements within those companies or nations, as well as various  factors such as trade volume and inflation. It is best to trade your  trade instruments at the highest value possible and use them to buy real  items, such as: Precious metals, Livestock, Software, Machines,  Produce/Seeds, Land, Realestate, etc and then use those to get more  trade instruments.  Politics can effect a nations Currency or Stock Market. For example, when Mosul was taken over by ISIS and all of the Gold in the Bank of Mosul was taken, and the Investment Opportunities went bleak, their Money became much less Valuable, even though after the fall of Sudam Hussein the British Government just printed the Country of Iraq new Notes. The opposite of that can be seen in 2 ways, and that situation can also be compared to the effect of a Cu-De-Ta on the Currency or Stocks. But the opposite would be Vietnam, who had a Civil War that America got way too involved in, and then at the end opened up their Markets and their Currency did well and Investment in Vietnam continues to be good. A Similar effect is Trump. The people with a lot of Money and Stocks and Companies on the Stock Market in America, all just got Tax Breaks, so they are willing to spend more, and take bigger risks, and they all trust Trump not to do them wrong because he came from the same Environment as them.  Then, an example of something similar but not exactly the same, is Brexit. When Brexit happened, everyone panicked. Stock Markets dropped in America, as well as Britain and Asia, and then the British Pound went down in value. That was not good for Britain, because anyone with savings, or anything, had money that was worth less than it was the day before on the Global Market. But that was good for everyone else, because you could buy British Pounds, and you would get more of them than usual for USD. So you could go on vacation in Britain and get things for Cheaper if you were starting with USD. Or, you could buy British Pounds and wait for them to go up in value.  Trade volume is how many people are buying and selling a particular currency or stock. The more people who are buying it, the higher the value will rise.  An example of Inflation is when the United States starts printing too much money. When this happens a dollar starts being worth less, which in turn means it will take more money to buy the same materials. For instance, if you go to the store and one day Milk is $3/Gallon but then you go a few months later and notice it is $5/Gallon, this is because of inflation. Inflation also drives things like the minimum wage and social security checks, which are usually based on the cost of living. Cryptocurrencies with no cap will eventually inflate into eternity and lose value, unless they have a high trade volume.  Supply and Demand is the comparison of how many people want something against how many their are of that thing. For example, when Apple creates a new IPhone the value is higher than it really should be and as the technology slightly or drastically ages, the value goes down.  A Whale is a person who has a large quantity of a certain trade instrument and uses that to effect the markets. For example, if someone has 51% of a particular stock they could either sell them all quickly which would bring the value of that stock down, or they could hold on to all of them which makes them more rare and makes them more valuable.  Bubbles are when something is artificially high in value, 2 examples of this are: IPhones as mentioned before, and Gasoline. Gasoline raises in value based simply on the speculation that “one day we might run out”, this creates bubbles which raises prices.  Bulls and Bears  This is a lot more simple than people think before getting into it. Bulls strike upwards, with their Horns, so that represents someone who makes money buying Stock when they see that a Market is doing well and is likely to do better. That way they can make an investment, and it is likely to go up and they can sell soon after and make a profit.  Bears strike Downwards, with their Paws and Claws, that represents someone who makes money as the Market goes down. So when you are scared, because you spent $5 per Stock or per Coin, and now it is $4, and you want to get out before you lose any more money. The Bear will buy your Stock, or Coin, and will wait for it to go back up later. So he profits on the Fear of others, or on temporary situations like Brexit, etc. A Bear doesn’t look for a Stock that is doing good and will do better, a Bear looks for a Stock that has done good long term, and is not doing well at the moment, but is likely to bounce back.  Then that brings us to the Bear Whales, Buy Wall and Sell Walls of the Cryptocurrency World. A Bear Whale is someone who has maybe 50,000 or 100,000 Bitcoins, maybe more, and they decide they are going to drop 50% to 90% of that on the market, to kill the “Buy Wall”. A Buy Wall is all the people who have said “I will pay X price” but that price was below the last price that it was sold for on the Market.  So say I am selling my Coins, and I want $1 each, but you put a Buy Order up for $0.90 cents each, I might sell my Coins to you. But if there are 5,000 people trying to buy it, they may have Buy Orders at $0.99 cents, and $0.98 cents, so your $0.90 one may take a long time to get filled, or may never get filled if the coin goes to $5 each, and $10 each. But if someone comes on the Market, and drops enough Coins on everyone to get to $0.90 cents, and even $0.80 cents, and $0.50 cents. That scares the shit out of everyone, and they sell their Coins, which makes it worse, because now they are selling into the Buy Wall, and dropping the price even lower.  And the Bear Whale buys all your Coins at the bottom, so instead of 50,000 or 100,000. Now he has 200,000 or 1,000,000 Coins  Just as an example. If the Bear Whale starts sales at $1, and you have a buy order for $0.95 cents, and he sells to everyone that wants Coins for $1, and he sells down to you at $0.95 cents, then sells down to $0.80 cents. You might sell your Coins to him at $0.80 cents out of Fear, and he may have sold that exact Coin to you for $0.95.  And if you were buying $500 worth at $0.95 cents, you might sell all of those to him at $0.80.  The first post explains Trade Instruments and compares Crypto to Fiat to Stocks, but something else needs to be pointed out. You have probably heard of the phrase ""Liquid"", cash is ""Liquid"", Bitcoins are ""Liquid"". Gold is not Liquid, you can not go online and buy things using your Gold Bars. You can not use Cows to buy things at the Store, you can not use Oil to buy things. These things are not liquid, they are not Trade Instruments, they are Commodities. You use your Liquid, Trade Instruments, to buy Commodities, Land, Machines, Services, Software, etc.",False

You can read the whitepaper here: https://www.dropd.co/  Dropd will be a music platform unlike any other in existence today—a place where people of all ages and countries go to listen to their favorite artists, discover new artists and connect with each other.  The platform is the place where good music, whether from a famous artist or a complete unknown, can rise to the top and be monetized instantly. All users will be able to participate in the success of artists with the market determining who is popular, not huge corporations. By the time this project is complete, the music industry will be changed forever.  Vin Foresta, founder and CEO of IJI, Inc. and Dropd architect/developer, describes that his vision “will include all these things and much more. Dropd will be orders of magnitude greater than an ordinary music app; it will be revolutionary. By the time this project is complete, the music industry will be changed forever,” he said.  Dropd’s patent-pending technology uses the blockchain to decentralize an antiquated business model. The music industry is perhaps one of the best examples of an industry that stands to be drastically altered by blockchain technology. The decentralization and socialization of the music industry have the potential to create the opportunity of a lifetime for many, as well as massive disruption to the status quo. Dropd is positioning itself as the driving force that will lead music into the blockchain age.  Given the evolving regulatory environment in the U.S., Dropd’s ICO will exclude U.S. citizens’ participation. The technology for the Dropd ICO site will have IP blocking in place for US residents and a secondary check that forces users to declare they are not a resident of the U.S. The ICO countdown will begin soon. Watch for a definitive timeline to be published later this week.  Dropd is a platform that is well into the development cycle. It is not just a concept; it is a viable technology with public launch projected in the third quarter of 2018. Watch for the promotional buildup and ICO site listings to begin over the next few weeks. The Expanse and Tokenlab teams could not be more excited about the Dropd project!",False

This is huge news for those of us who have been waiting. The agreement also specifies that they will list Expanse (EXP), as well as future tokens launched on the Tokenlab ICO platform. In return, we will help them gain more attention and popularity with our large community of traders and investors that follow Expanse.  As soon as we have the exact date in February from CryptoBridge, we will share it with you all, but it is officially on the way. We will also continue reaching out to centralized exchanges to add Tokenlab, but currently, most are just overwhelmed with demand. That is another reason a scalable decentralized exchange like CryptoBridge has real potential. There is growing demand for a solution like this. Fact is, scalable decentralized exchanges are the future, and this new partnership is a big step in that direction for Expanse and Tokenlab.",False

WHAT IS TOKENLAB? Tokenlab is an integrated system to create Tokens and assets on the Expanse.tech Blockchain. It includes the ability to start ICOs with smart contracts designed with time-locked distributions built in to protect investors from funds being dumped on the market. Tokenlab is also the first ICO of Tokenlab utilizing the LAB token that will be tradable and pay out a percentage of all new Tokens created by Tokenlab. For example, when Expanse creates the VotelockTM ICO on Tokenlab in the future, any holders of LAB would receive a percent- age of Votelock tokens later. When anyone else creates an ICO using Tokenlab, a percentage also goes out to all holders of LAB.  So i have read on other sites that 5% on tokens from each ICO will go to LAB holders.This will be amazing if it actually happens and definitely worth holding long term.",False

LAB is being priced in USD with the changing prices of crypto, $0.08 cents per token for the Exclusive Sale, then $0.09 cents and $0.10 for the final sale. So it is a balance, you can buy early for a nice discount but you will have to wait a bit, or you can buy later on for slightly more.",False

Tokenlab is an integrated system to create Tokens and assets on the Expanse.tech Blockchain. It includes the ability to start ICOs with smart contracts designed with time-locked distributions built in to protect investors from funds being dumped on the market. Tokenlab is also the first ICO of Tokenlab utilizing the LAB token that will be tradable and pay out a percentage of all new Tokens created by Tokenlab. For example, when Expanse creates the Votelock™ ICO on Tokenlab in the future, any holders of LAB would receive a percentage of Votelock tokens later. When anyone else creates an ICO using Tokenlab, token creators will have the option to airdrop their new token all LAB owners.  Links: Website: https://www.tokenlab.io Website: https://www.expanse.tech Discord: https://discord.gg/xqMwbpg Slack: http://slack.expanse.tech Twitter: https://twitter.com/tokenlabio Twitter: https://twitter.com/ExpanseOfficial  Tech: ERC644 Token Standard Expanse Blockchain  Crowdsale Information The Tokenlab™ (LAB) token sale has not yet begun. When the token sale begins, we will notify you via an email to the Tokenlab mailing list and posts on Slack, Facebook and Twitter. Since the Exclusive Sale will only accept EXP as payment for purchasing LAB tokens, make sure you have EXP available in your wallet before the sale begins.  Raise Funds for Your Ideas We believe that anyone with a great idea should be able to start a fundraising campaign. With Tokenlab, you can start your campaign with just a few clicks. Once the campaign starts, it's easy to track performance and gauge your interest. At the end of the campaign, you as the owner, issue tradable tokens to investors who have invested in your project.  Invest in Your Favorite Ideas With Tokenlab, you get an easy-to-use interface for contributing to your favorite blockchain projects. You can track the progress of your investments, create watch lists, view documentation and provide valuable feedback to the owners of the project.  Watch Your Investments Grow The main goal of any token on the Blockchain is to provide value to the token-holders. Tokenlab creates value for ICO investors through the viability and enhanced value of the individual projects over time. Expanse-holders benefit through the rise in value of EXP that occurs as its utility is enhanced—increased utility translates to increased value.  FAQ:  What entity is selling Tokenlab as a product?  Tokenlab (LAB) is by Borderless Corporation. Founded in 2016, Borderless Corp., Inc. is incorporated in Wyoming, USA. Its address is P.O. Box 2702, Washington, NC 27889. The phone number is (252) 495-0363. The CEO is Christopher J. Franko.  Are there expectations of profits?  The Token for Tokenlab (LAB), is being sold solely as a Token to use on Tokenlab for using Tokenlab as utility, as a virtual token, and not a currency. There are no expectations of profits whatsoever and the value of LAB Tokens will be determined by whatever prices the market deems it to be worth. LAB is not to be considered an investment and merely as a means to use Tokenlab and create ICOs in a safe and secure way.  Are there restrictions on buying LAB Tokens based on location?  There are no restriction on locations for buying LAB Tokens. Tokenlab is by Borderless Corporation in the USA and US sales will not be blocked by IP address. Borderless Corp will follow all rules and regulations and pay all applicable taxes. If you live in the USA or elsewhere you should be able to participate, however, please check your local laws and regulations of your state or country before purchasing.  What is the purpose of the LAB token?  The LAB Token will be the Token sold at the launch of Tokenlab and as the first crowdsale on Tokenlab. Tokenlab will be operational at this time, and after LAB Tokens are issued, new ICOs can start on Tokenlab. A fee of LAB is required to start any new ICO to prevent spam. This fee will be dynamic and based on levels of customization and change with market cap. LAB tokens will also function as a reward mechanism and a decentralized ownership stake in the Tokenlab project. Rewarding holders of LAB and LAB tokens will also be tradable on exchanges, to be announced, and as negotiated in the future.",False
