We put a lot of thought into the platform that we used prior to deciding on the one to use.  We chose Waves because of transaction speed and scalabilty.  We looked really hard at Ethereum but the Crypto Kitties issue was a great example of why we couldn't use it.  We understood that there have not been a lot of huge projects on Waves prior to starting but their tech is spot on.  We needed a platform that could handle 10s of millions of players all performing transactions on the platform at any given time.  I think this will be the project that really puts Waves on the map in terms of a solution for projects like ours.  Waves has recently put in place a verified token policy so that only tokens that have completed the verification process will show up by name.   Thanks for your comments as well! ,False
