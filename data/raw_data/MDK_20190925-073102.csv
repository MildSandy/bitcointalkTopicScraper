MDK creates a communication platform â€“ MDK App, that unites creators, users, moderators, and businesses, and coordinates their actions to develop the community. The core principe is that all purchases in the MDK App, including advertising, will be made with MDK Tokens. The reward system will distribute tokens among all members based on their input.  Social media improve everyday lives of more than 3 billion people. However, together with their huge advantages we have also discovered new issues that gradually become more critical in the modern society:  1. Unfair Profit Distribution. Large companies earn billions of dollars through advertising, aggregating usersâ€™ content. The users themselves get nothing. 2. Weak Opportunities. In ad oriented economics chances are low for unique content to get noticed without a large follower base or advertising budget. 3. Centralized Editorial Policies. Top content on large social services is curated by services themselves to suit their editorial policies. This takes all influential power away from the users.  We present MDK â€” the new type of global entertainment community based on principles of decentralization, equal opportunities and a shared economy.   - The MDK Token. The MDK Token will be the basement for the communityâ€™s ecosystem and will be used for all rewards and purchases within the system.  - The MDK App. The MDK App will provide powerful tools for content creation and communication, uniting all members and businesses in one place.  - The Unique Ecosystem. They both create a unique ecosystem, which distributes rewards to motivate members to improve the community and work on business offers.  How it works?  1. Members create and moderate content. All members of MDK have equal opportunities to create and moderate content. Great posts fly to the top, while inappropriate ones never see the light. In that way the content quality always stays consistent, attracting new members to the community.  2. In-app features and advertising are purchased. Businesses purchase MDK tokens to partner with community members. The members can purchase in-app features for content creation, which attracts more businesses. Everything is then gathered in the Reward System for further distribution.  3. Members earn MDK Tokens. Content creators, moderators, commentators â€” everyone, who pushes MDK forward, gets rewarded based on their impact for the community. The rewards can be used to, again, purchase in-app features for content creation, goods or be withdrawn.  Token Distribution.  Token will be issued based on the ERC20 standard. The total supply is fixed and amounts to 1,000,000,000 MDK tokens. MDK tokens will be allocated as follow: Usersâ€™ remuneration fund: 250,000,000 MDK; 25%. Team: 200,000,000 MDK; 20%. Public distribution: 500,000,000; 50%. Reserved for development: 50,000,000 MDK; 5%.  Token Sale Phase 1.  MDK tokens will be sent to the Userâ€™s personal respective cryptocurrency wallet at the end of the Token Sale Phase 2. MDK tokens that will not be sold during the Token Sale Phases 1 and 2 will be returned to Development Reserve.  Starts: November 29, 16:00 PM UTC; Ends: December 20, 16:00 PM UTC; Exchange rate: 22,500 MDK for 1 ETH; Hard Cap: 4,000 ETH; Currencies accepted: ETH, BTC.  Token Sale Phase 2 will start in 1Q 2018 and last one month or until all the MDK tokens available for public distribution will not be sold, whichever occurs first. The exchange rate for the phase 2 is 1 ETH = 15,000 MDK tokens.  Team.  The project is launched by the MDK executive team â€” the owners of the largest entertainment community in Europe with 20+ millions participants and 7+ years of experience in content management and digital marketing.

Token sale gives value to the token, which is important for first users of the platform. Thus, we get both benefits using token sale compare with fundrising: 1) will use early users remuneration fund of our tokens to motivate early users and 2) get funds for development and launch platform.

This is a typo in the text in the White Paper. The platform is currently under development. The beta release is scheduled for the 2Q 2018.  - Some projects do not have experience at all. Therefore, we consider the existence of experience as a big plus. We have 7+ relevant experience in community building. Yes, it's in Russia basically. But it's our global project, that will be launched around the world.  - Shortly, Reddit do not pay rewards to their common users. Moreover, users have not economic incentives to develop their community.  - We are looking for long-term growth. Increase of the number of users of our platform in the future (due to the attraction of common internet users in our new ecosystem) will ensure the growth of the demand for the token and its value.",False

Without the issue of MDK token and its free circulation, the whole idea of the project is impossible.  We are focused on a long-term strategy. 1 billion tokens is the amount that will be convenient for future users. In addition, we carefully calculated the price of the token at the initial stage. The first buyers will also be additionally protected by the fact that tokens in the Development reserve will be locked for 12 months. In addition, it is in the interests of all tokens buyers that the company has enough budgets to develop and promote the platform.",False
