Haven't been in btctalk in some time. This looks like one of the most viable blockchain projects I've seen in some time. ICOs got too expensive. This hard cap is low. Did a little digging, this one looks off the radar but team looks like they work. Going to find out more.",False

They had some bumps that's probably stopping them from being really recognized. Apparently, ICObench's bots did their snapshot on the placeholder site, before the new one went live. A couple of well known twitter people invested heavily in a very small presale. I can't confirm all parties but one did who is a former software developer. Hard cap is very low, team self-funded project and they are near a working product already. Model is simpler than I thought even and makes sense- Use smart contracts and blockchain to create trustless group buys. I get it. If you know anything about small business, putting together an order big enough to receive a scale discount is a nightmare. Putting these groups together makes sense. Website is nice enough and little video they put up tells the story of how insane amount of costs get baked into pricing. Knowing something about dtm's increasing popularity, this is one of those things that's going to happen.   Given that many ICOs are 10x as expensive (valuation or actual market cap), are a year away from launching, want to raise 20mm plus, had huge presales and big advisory boards bloating the supply, I'm tired of making a few select people rich. Cartel looks good to me. If I sound like I'm shilling, I guess I am. Haven't seen a well priced ICO that with an actual business model in awhile, save for Legolas and that's a long hold and way more expensive.",False
