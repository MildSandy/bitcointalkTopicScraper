An interesting point was when the price was moving down to 0.0150. If you were following my reviews, you had a chance to make money on it. Will support 0.03 be broken? Based on that very interesting candle, no. In the best case, it will move around a little and go to the area of the first target 0.04. These levels are known to all traders, not so long ago they worked perfectly, most likely, they will continue to work.  As for the previous review and the reversal model at 0.04, this is one of those cases when a double bottom is drawn beneath the level, but something happens and the price gets back to the previous trend, in this case ‚Äî the bearish one. There's been no entry signal intraday: i.e. the very signal that I am referring to in my recommendations, namely the flag. Actually, the flag was on the hourly chart, but it did not begin to work out. As a result, the rate drew a double bottom, stood, mused a little, and decided to go down. However, these are the things of the past days, now we should focus on the current situation. As I stated above, it makes sense to expect a reversal pattern at the support area 0.03. If such a model appears, the growth potential becomes very interesting and is at peak 0.07. If you did not have time to buy token at 0.0150, you still have a chance to take 250 percent of the profit by buying coins now and waiting for working out to 0.07. In addition to the profit from the growth of token, you can get a nice bonus from participating in the Aunit-Rally.  Aunit vs BTC analysis  Token is being traded against Bitcoin in the support area 0.00000200. As with the previous tool, this support represents a strong level. However, I do not exclude that the price would prick support 0.00000200, the same happened on the previous pair. In this case, I can recommend putting a little volume beneath support 0.00000200. However, unlike the situation with the previous pair, here the pair is still working close to the support and can go up without drawing a reversal pattern ‚Äî this is the worst option, as it will not give a good entry point. But in general, if you work more as an investor than as a trader, now is a good price to buy Aunit token.  Aunit vs. ETH analysis   As usual, for the most part of the time, the calmest situations take place for the cryptocurrency pair Aunit token against Ethereum. Here the rate is being traded in the support area 0.000100. If you have free Ethereum, it‚Äôs time to buy some Aunit tokens. It is worthwhile to place a profit order in the resistance area of 0.000400, thus, the profit potential is about 400%.  P.S. All three pairs are based on strong support lines: it‚Äôs time to think about new purchases. In the end, let me wish everyone to be successful both in trading and investing.",False

First, this is an already finishing seminar of the company in Moscow, which was held on August 25 ‚Äì 26. The seminar gave everyone participating a chance to talk with the leaders of the Aunite Group Corporation and other like-minded people, as well as the opportunity to learn first-hand about the nearest plans and outlook of the company.   I‚Äôd also like to mention a small competition for users of the Wulet application. Participants can receive iPhone X and other valuable prizes as awards. The competition is on until September 21.   As always, the past week the company had presented new discounts, promotions, and brought new partners. This has already become a good tradition that we are all used to.   Do not forget that AUNIT-RALLY is still on and as long as it is running it will support the token rate due to the activity of participants.  Aunit vs USD analysis   Next, I‚Äôll consider the technical situation on the Aunit token against the US dollar. I congratulate everyone who followed my tips: there are hopes that the rally will continue and the optimistic first goal is around 0.07.  https://miro.medium.com/max/1366/0*9dldDvJpItn4ATxQ  Events around the token are developing on the three levels. Of course, they include intermediate ones, but they are not important for the current trend. It is primarily about the levels 0.0270, 0.04 ‚Äî 0.0430, and 0.07. The last event occurred right when I was writing my previous review, recommending to buy a token. At the moment, such a good chance has already gone. Further, in the near future, the price will test resistance 0.04 ‚Äî 0.0430. After the breakthrough of resistance, it will move even higher up and most likely there will be a rapid increase by 0.07.  The alternative option is rather similar to the previous one and implies an uptrend followed by a small pullback. Both options do not contradict with each other. The current situation implies a need to share our resources into several transactions. The first transaction is carried out around 0.04 ‚Äî 0.0430. We leave one more part for a corrective rollback and the other part for the case of the flag around the resistance 0.0400 ‚Äî 0.0430 is built and broken. If you work as an investor, then it‚Äôs time to buy the token at any price, because now it is heavily oversold.   More cautious speculators are to wait for a downward pullback with the double bottom pattern being built beneath 0.04 level in order to enter the market. This option is possible, but it may not take place. In this situation, there is a risk of being left out of work again. An alternative option could be just monitoring the possibility of the flag, which is the fastest option to continue further upward movement.  Aunit vs BTC analysis  https://miro.medium.com/max/1366/0*OocpHKA-2zOIFh2b  A rather similar situation is developing for this cryptocurrency pair. It also involves three lines, the difference is only in a slight lag in the rate. At the moment, the market is approaching the center of the range: 0.00000450 ‚Äî 0.00000400. The picture will become completely similar if resistance is broken: the rally will continue and the first goal for it will be around the High 0.00000750. You can go there through the flag around the average level 0.00000450 or after a rebound from this level. As the rate is testing the resistance 0.00000450, you are to elaborate a plan for further development of the situation.  Since the current rate shows the same dynamics as the previous pair (AUNIT/USD) does, the recommendations on your tactics are in general similar here.  Aunit vs. ETH analysis  https://miro.medium.com/max/1366/0*nsram5pqVWvGqlcN  The Aunit token against Ethereum is being traded at the rollback stage. The rate has not reached the center and rolled back almost completely. There may be a chance to buy the pair 0.000110, so I‚Äôd recommend you reserving a small amount to buy there. Since the price has bounced or not reached the resistance 0.000230, we are to work from the support of 0.000110 in any case.  P.S. I am wishing all of you successful trading and investing.",False

The previous rally was very small and stopped at 0.0550, whereas the expected target was based at 0.07. However, everyone had the opportunity to make that trading position and thus double the available amount.   At the moment, the price has rolled back to about the starting point, and you can repeat the previous deal with the same result, and perhaps it would be the best possible result. Everything will depend on the situation we have in the resistance area of 0.0550. However, let‚Äôs get to a little more detailed picture. The first point is a a potential Buy point. Now the pair is being traded in the support area of 0.03. The reversal may take place from the current position, or there may be a slight dip down followed by a reversal correction and an uptrend. The most cautious traders are recommended to wait for a reversal model, but it may not happen, or its starting point will be much higher than the current rate. Being heavily oversold, as well as close to the support 0.03, the token can offer a simple entrance strategy: the part can be spent for the purchase from the market, whereas the other part can be placed below 0.03. As for the next rally, it has two goals: the first goal lies in the resistance area 0.0550, whereas the second goal pertains to the High 0.07.  Aunit vs BTC analysis  https://miro.medium.com/max/1366/0*90juoD2nE2YUn5iw  As for the Aunit token against the Bitcoin, it also unfolds a very interesting situation. The Aunit against Bitcoin is being traded in the support area 0.00000200. There are many other support lines ahead, around which a reversal model will be created. However, the situation is similar to the situation developing around the previous trading instrument. There is a strong support ahead with the token being oversold, so I would recommend buying from the market and putting several pending orders below the support 0.00000200. It also makes sense to exit in parts, because the potential target for the initial strong growth lies around 0.00001400 (if you are confused with zeros, I‚Äôll put the potential profit as 700% to that). Therefore, I repeat, we exit partially at the levels of 0.00000500, 0.00000750 and 0.00001400.  Aunit vs. ETH analysis  https://miro.medium.com/max/1366/0*0sT8c7dgO88X5ihW  The Aunit token against Ethereum is being traded in the support area0.000100. The situation is similar to the situation with both previous pairs. Given the low volatility, which sometimes gives unimaginably profitable entry points, only pending orders would be best solution. At the moment, you can buy the instrument by placing additional several orders for ‚Äúluck‚Äù beneath support 0.000100. It makes sense to put Take Profit orders at such marks as 0.000270, 0.000400 and 0.000640.  P.S. I wish everyone successful trading and investing.",False

If for some other reason you are not in yet, then perhaps it‚Äôs the best time to join. Firstly, it will be over soon and thus you are closer to learning about its results, and secondly, the token‚Äôs price is at the best possible level for entry (of course, as long as you need an iPad Air for $25).  Let me get to the competition rules briefly if you are not aware of them yet. In fact, 3 iPads Air will be drawn among all those who bought more than 1000 Aunit tokens. One iPad Air goes to the one who bought the most number of Aunit tokens, the other two will be randomly drawn between the other participants who satisfied the contest rules. In addition to the iPad, there are other prizes, (as well as we can consider the profit that we could earn on the next rollback as our prize).   The next noteworthy news: more partners have joined the Aunite Group company. These are the Russian stores, as well as the stores across the CIS, Turkey, and Europe. Expanding the list of partners is always for the company‚Äôs value. And, of course, good news specially for residents of the CIS countries: the launch of the Wulet application, previously available only to Russian citizens. Just to remind: Wulet is a safe and modern app for cardholders. If you did not use it, I‚Äôd recommend to try it out. Moreover, there is a reason ‚Äî until September 15, the Aunite Group will be running the contest with 3 iPhoneX and 27 other prizes being drawn among those who downloaded this app and satisfied all the contest rules.  Aunit vs USD analysis  https://miro.medium.com/max/1366/0*LhvCHULYrHun3llq  From a technical point of view, the Aunit token is in a very interesting situation. As you can see on the chart, the rate is based on a very reliable support 0.0270. Since the level has been pricked, we can expect a reversal model being formed before the rebound somewhere to 0.07. In this case, even lower rates for the heavily oversold token are possible. However, given the history of the breakthrough of this support, the puncture can be rapid with the reversal pattern being formed within the day. Given the lack of activity, this reversal model is not necessarily to be formed. With current prices, buying from the market now is profitable . In any case, the current prices are very good and will remain quite acceptable even if a reversal pattern gets formed, (even if being slightly higher than the current ones). The main thing is not to miss the price that can occur for a very short moment.  Aunit vs BTC analysis  https://miro.medium.com/max/1366/0*v1V95RuE4APPwV7V  As usually, the situation on this pair is similar situation with the previous one. Here is a very strong support area and you should buy from here now, plus make sure to put several orders ‚Äúfor luck‚Äù below. If we move down, we should do that quickly and briefly, in order to catch the moment; just make sure to put pending Buy orders. Exit points can also be set with pending orders around 0.00000500, 0.00000700 and 0.00000900.  Aunit vs. ETH analysis  https://miro.medium.com/max/1366/0*6RZK7isUxX04NPhg  Unlike previous pairs, Aunit against Ethereum is being trading far from the support 0.000100, where we could have an opportunity to make a profitable purchase. If you work there, you can only put a few purchase orders, starting from 0.000100 and below. The correction‚Äôs form is still uncertain, so we can test 0.000100 quite well. If you entered earlier and did not exit at a recent leap, the goals 0.000200, 0.000270 and 0.000380 are relevant for you. Given the token being oversold, it makes sense not to leave it completely, and just wait for the next pump, reserving the part of your deposit for this time.  P.S. I wish everyone of you successful trading and investing.",False

This figure may seem impressive but not when we look at the location map of these stores in various countries, especially in Russia.  The most influential interactive map, coinmap.org, says that in Moscow you can only pay with BTC in 60 organizations. You‚Äôll hardly find 5‚Äì10 points in other mega cities where you can buy goods or services with crypto. Most of them include software stores, games or components for computers. Some online stores that accept crypto are selling highly specialized products, which we buy not every day.  Making it possible to pay for Aunite Telecom mobile communications and products of the Academy of Beauty and Health with AUNIT is indeed a ground-breaking step. Our crypto will be one of the few ones that can be used to pay for services and consumer goods!  As of today, we already accept AUNIT as a tuition fee at our Corporate University. In the near future, we are planning to enable payments for the travel direction and our other projects by Aunit. This way, our service will be fully transferred to settlement via AUNIT in the foreseeable future.  We believe that the expansion of our operation area makes sure our token gains high popularity and great future. If you don‚Äôt have AUNIT yet, join now as long as our tokens are available for free!",False

When moving up from the current position, the price would a rather clear and simple double bottom. At this point, still, it does not look like that. On the other hand, the price can go down to one more Low and make a double bottom through this operation. This would be followed by an upward movement. Therefore, the situation with a double bottom is still not certain. As for the support 0.04, a false breakthrough has been formed which you can buy.

The first news is very important: this is the expansion of the company. According to the company‚Äôs website, Aunite Group is to set the campaign for the dozen new countries in the coming 2019. New markets always imply new investors, which will support the coin. In my opinion, this news will provide long-term support along with the growing company‚Äôs volume and new investments. The second news is also able to provide support for the reviewed coin in the medium term: the company has launched a contest which engages new customers, partners, and investors.

Results of the passing year for Aunit and other coins:  The current year is coming to the end with this review being the last one in 2018. First of all, let me wish you all the best in the upcoming 2019 year and sum up some results on the Aunit coin as well as other coins, which received their well-deserved popularity. I will begin, of course, with the first coin, BTC/USD. Its High was recorded at the beginning of the year and exceeded $17000 for one coin, at the end of the year it hits $ 4000 per coin. The year was hard for bulls in the cryptocurrency market. Most likely, many could not stop in time, because in 2017 everyone could trade in the cryptocurrency market, the main strategy was simply to buy and hold. There have been many Gurus performing, I think, in 2018 most of them showed their potential, but the point is not even about them. The year was hard for most traders and investors, as profit trading was made in a too simple way. Returning to Bitcoin and numbers, the year was closed by BTC with a drawdown in 4.25 times. That is, whoever bought it at the highest price of the current year, became poorer in 4.25 times. Those who are less fortunate, and bought Bitcoin at #20000, has even 5 times less money to date. As a result, this year was not for rather sensitive Bitcoin traders and investors.  I wish you Happy New Year and prosperity!",False

An author of these articles is Alexander Ischuk - an exchange trader with a great record, a developer of automated systems and a trading tutor.  We'll start from a brief intro of the Aunit token. What and who is behind the Aunit token?  The token has emerged recently. The ICO dates back to January 2018 and has finished in July 2018. After the end of the ICO, the coin had received a legal approving conclusion from the US lawyers and was launched on the crypto exchange. Though the coin is young, the company with a solid business record is standing behind it. Its record can be tracked on the web as well. The history of this company began with the AutoClub brand and after the rebranding it came to the name of Aunite Group. The main direction of the company is rendering of the cashback service. It took only 4 years to get 12 000 partner companies and more than 850 000 users. In addition to the cashback direction, the company is running regular tutorials for all who wish to plunge into cryptocurrencies and make money by investing in new technologies. Unfortunately, a brief introduction cannot describe all aspects of its business, but what we've already mentioned can prove that the company has been among the leaders of during more than 4 years.  BTC-Alpha Exchange A simple and convenient exchange, which was the first to list the AUNIT token. The tools represented on it have everything you need to conduct a technical analysis. There is an in-depth view tool of prices and indicators. More info about the exchange: https://btc-alpha.com  Withdrawal of the coin and review of the pair AUNIT/USD  The first quote and the first trading day on this chart are dated by Sep 18; so, the chart gives about a one-month record of prices. Of course, it may be not as sufficient for a proper technical analysis of data, but given the reliability of the coin;s emitter, you can begin to work. The coin is not only released to the market and sent to float freely, but also takes part in the work of the company. Nevertheless, let's return to the technical analysis, but remember that the coin is demanded by the people who build their business together with the Aunite Group company.  The technical picture of the AUNIT/USD is quite simple and resembles the behavior of other coins: as it was released to the exchange, a depreciation of the value took place, then there was an attempt to recover, though not successful with the value dropped to 20 cents, then 10.  At the moment, we can indicate the Low at 0.0200. If you are looking for buy opportunities, here they are but given the fact the coin is close to zero as compared to the US dollar, you can buy a coin at any time. You can also split a position into two parts, the first will be a purchase from the market, or close to the current positions whereas the second one will be a purchase around 0.0200. You can also buy using a breakthrough of the resistance  0.0480 if such a breakthrough takes place. Upon a rollback, if before that the coin is rolled back to 0.0200, upon a return to test the resistance 0.0480, you can cover the third part of the position in case of a false breakthrough of 0.0480 or a rollback from this resistance.  AUNIT/BTC  This pair is less interesting than the previous one, however, one resistance on the chart has been already formed: 0.00001128. The situation is similar to the above-described situation since at the moment the coin is not expensive, it is interesting for investing. The first goal for growth will be 0.00001128. If we break through this value, we'll move to  0.00001200 - which is no resistance so far, but it may form around 1200 in the future in case of a rollback from this point. The difference between these pairs is a sharp rise in Aunit versus Bitcoin on October 8, 2018. Someone exchanged the most expensive coin for Aunit. Another option to buy a coin against Bitcoin is to work with rollbacks with one of the Buy goals set for 0.00000200-0.00000220. At the moment there is no bottom, but there is a chance it would be formed at 0.00000700, therefore, working with rollbacks, you can make part of the purchase partly around 700, party around 220 and place an order between them around 450 (0.00000450).",False

First, the coin is going to be listed on the two more exchanges. How will this fact impact on its rate? Most likely, since the coin is new, there will not be as much influence. However, you might earn money on arbitration within the first few days or weeks after the listing on the exchanges buy buying it on the exchange where it is cheaper and selling to the other one where it is more expensive.  Second, as far as it refers to the trading on the BTC Alpha exchange, the Aunit coin is in the top ten in terms of trading volumes.   AUNIT/USD  A positive event for the bulls was recorded on October 25, 2018: the coin broke through the resistance 0.0675. The chart shows that testing range exceeded width of the broken channel or double bottom with growth over 300%. Considering that the currency pair does not have a long history, it worked perfectly from a technical point, it made a pump, we can say that the coin is gradually earning trust and becoming popular for investors. The occurred breakthrough also indicates that the coin allows short-term players to make money. The spread has narrowed, which is an indirect confirmation of popularity of the coin.  Trading ideas for this pair imply the three levels, two supports and one resistance.  The levels of support are 0.0665 and 0.0222. The entry strategy is simple: if the pair rolls back to support 0.0665, then you should wait for a rollback in the form of reversal pattern within the day, or rather a false breakout of support 0.0665 and buy the coin at the beginning of the figure. You can enter from 0.0222 without reversal patterns if the pair returns there. The return to support 0.0222 will be fast and you can enter the market via a simple pending order.  As for the resistance 0.1100, it has not been formed yet and may be found in another place. Therefore, before using this resistance, you need to wait for it to confirm, or to get it confirmed around 0.1100 and work with the new buy resistance on a breakthrough if you fail to enter on rollbacks to 0.0222 or 0.0665. If there are entrances on the current support, then, it is possible to partially close long positions around 0.1100.   AUNIT/BTC  On this currency pair, the situation is less interesting in technical terms, but there are good levels to work with. A good buying option is a false breakthrough of support 0.00000600, followed by 600. If the pair returns to this support, then inside the day you can catch a false breakthrough in the form of a reversal pattern, followed by double bottom or an inverted head with shoulders. You can buy the coin by a pending order around 600, but you need to be ready to roll back to 0.00000135, followed by 135. Thus, one of the two options emerges. The first option is a simple pending order at 600 and 135, dividing one deal into two parts. The second option is waiting for a reversal pattern with a false breakthrough to the support area 600‚Äì500.  There is another interesting level on the chart: resistance 0.00001340 followed by 1340. Recently, this resistance has been broken twice, but during the day it came back under it. The last candle is not closed yet. This resistance can be used intraday, at least until a few candles would emerge on the daily chart below it. It makes sense to use a level together with a flag that may appear at resistance 1340 within a day in the near future. The goal of this flag is likely to be resistance 0.00002000 or 2000. This goal is also proven by the version with the already formed two channels: the coin can go from the lower corridor 600‚Äì1340 to the upper corridor 1340‚Äì2000.   AUNIT/ETH  As usual, this chart is the easiest and the least liquid, but at the same time it is the most promising. As the pair has gone down the bottom channel by 90%, it is moving upwards. It can consolidate above support 0.000600, then 600, then we can expect a move to 0.000900. Technically, it is still possible to enter this ‚Äúdriver‚Äù if the current exit outside the channel with resistance 600 draws a flag. However, the latter is unlikely, given the low liquidity of the pair. Other entrance options are purchases on rollbacks to 325 and 20 if there are such. Given the ‚Äúpins‚Äù at all intervals, we can conclude that someone was buying a coin today, possibly for a long-term investment. Summary  Given the high reliability of the issuing company, it is good time for long-term investment now. We‚Äôve also presented the options for short-term speculations above.

Therefore, a better buying potential emerges, which will have a positive impact on the rate against the US dollar and other coins.  At the time I am writing this review, the Aunit coin rate on the ExRates exchange is $2, the rate of the coin on the BTC-Alpha exchange is $0.045. Of course, it will be difficult to use this arbitration in practice due to the small number of coins on the ExRates exchange, but the arbitration itself is real. The question is only in volume. When ExRates‚Äôs depth will be filled, there will not be such a high difference. This is what makes the market attractive. Later, supply and demand will equal on both exchanges to the same level. Arbitrage will be possible only on the short-term fluctuations in supply or demand. Speculators will make money on both exchanges and trade will be boosted accordingly. This activity will support the coin.  Aunit/USD  After a strong growth, the currency pair has been gradually dropping over the past 7 days. However, an attempt to squeeze a coin to a previous support or a previous Low 0.0312 has failed, at least for now. There is a probability that the pair is drawing a new Low, however, there is no reversal pattern on the daily frame, which means that the rate can go lower. The Buy options at the moment are the following: you can buy, because we are not far from the support, the entry points can be at 0.0293 and 0.0217. Given the fact the support is close and on condition the rate does not fall, it makes sense to buy some coins. If we talk about the goal for growth, the most modest goal is at 0.0612. In addition to this rate, there is resistance around 0.0800 and 0.1200. The outlook for a rebound from these levels or a breakthrough followed by growth will depend on the nature of the correction around these levels. But we cannot exclude a strong growth, the so-called PUMP: in this case, resistance levels will work intra day. We should also pay attention to the positive dynamics regarding the volumes. Now the depth on this pair is well filled, and the spread is very tight. The closest Buy price is 0.0429, and the closest Sell price is 0.0416.  Aunit/BTC  Aunit is being traded against Bitcoin less actively. At the time I am writing this review, the coin can be bought for 0.00000791 Bitcoin, and sold for 0.00000623 Bitcoin. Low activity also has a negative impact on the chart; however, it enables to carry out technical analysis. The first level, which makes sense to state, is support 0.00000622. Now we are not far from this support and it makes sense to buy. If this level is broken, the pair can be around 0.00000170, so it makes sense to place a buy order and at 170. As for the TP level, in the event of a successful trade, its goal will be resthe istance of the current channel, provided that there is a rebound or a false breakthrough of support 622‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis is a quote 0.00001000‚Äì0.00000950. If the false break is deep and buy options at 0.00000400 open, then it makes sense to take profit by 200 points earlier: at 0.00000800. If the price rolls back down and your orders are at 0.00000170, profit should be fixed at 0.00000600. Upon that, buying around 170 should be done with a larger lot than buying around 600‚Äì650. If you‚Äôd like to earn more, you can exit partly at 0.00001500, and partially stay in the market and wait for when the rate hits 0.00002000 and 0.00002300.

The good news from the BTC-alpha.com exchange: Aunit coin is still gaining a better popularity. Aunit/USD pair was ranked the third in terms of volume, having exceeded BTC/USD trading popularity! Yes, yes, exactly, that Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency in the world. The trading volume of the Aunit/USD currency pair has been over $100.000. This achievement has been recorded on November 6, 2018. Mind that the Aunit coin was listed on this exchange about a month ago. The technical picture is that drawn when coins are bought by a major player, but this will be considered in the second part of the article. We believe the coin is gaining popularity at a rather rapid pace.  SEE charts: https://medium.com/@autounit2018/the-review-of-aunit-coin-d8bff44c24b1  Aunit/USD currency pair is also actively traded on the second cryptocurrency exchange, where the listing was received a little more than a week ago. Perhaps arbitration is starting to work, perhaps investors are buying coins on different exchanges to get a better portfolio, in fact, this is not as important. The growing popularity is supporting the coin, but there is no steady bull trend, which suggests that not all major players have collected their portfolio.   Technical analysis of the Aunit/USD cryptocurrency pair  Today the pair remains the most popular one of three pairs traded on the exchange. Despite a small history record of the coin, it is possible to clearly mark the support level 0.0375. Recently, this level performed as resistance, but this has not been for not long and as a result received a false breakthrough. Based on these two moments, you can build your trading tactics for several days: as long as the pair is being traded in the support area or the level of 0.0375.  At the beginning of my review, I mentioned that someone was buying the coin in big scales, which is proved by good support that had worked smoothly. Quite chaotic leaps upwards also prove that. On the peaks of jumps, we can see small players trading. If the opinion about a major player is correct, then this is an additional support for Aunit coin. However, it is difficult to use it for earnings, in contrast to the dry technical analysis. A dry technical analysis suggests that since the currency pair is being traded in the support area and if there is a downward movement, it can only repeat the previous false breakthrough, then it is time to think about purchases. Since there are two options for a rebound from the support 0.0375, then you can enter in two steps: the first step is to buy from the market, the second one buys after a false breakthrough. The second option should be purchased at the beginning of the formation of a reversal figure, which will be below the level of 0.0375.   Technical analysis of the Aunit/BTC cryptocurrency pair  This currency pair is a little underestimated.Templates of the technical analysis can be easily applied here.  The first thing you should pay attention to is horizontal support 0.0000600, then 600. The currency pair has pierced this level and if it does not consolidate there (judging by the green candles, it will), then you can wait for an upward rebound based only on these simple assumptions. The option is a bit more complicated as it also suggests a beautiful rise, which worth considering in more detail. The arrows on the chart draw a double bottom to the last trend down. There are also two parallel channels that use the two bottoms of a reversal pattern and cannot be marked in a different way. There is a false breakthrough, as we mentioned above.  Using this markup, we can outline a scenario that may occur. The first step is to draw a local intraday double bottom figure at the horizontal support area 600 and make the price work out to the middle line of the two channels, which is the resistance of the lower channel. In this movement, the first goal worked. The second step is to break the resistance of the lower channel and wait when the price works out the resistance of the upper channel, which will be the second goal. Now the first step is starting to be worked out, a rebound with a false breakthrough from the support 600. It means you can enter into two parts: the first part is the purchase from the market, the second part is an alternative step in case the figure reverses and breaks resistance. You will need to partially exit out of channel resistance. Next, we wait for correction around the middle line so that a breakthrough will give a signal to boost purchases. Profit shall be taken partially at the upper red line. Since all lines have the trend character, I can‚Äôt refer to exact quotes, you need to monitor the market and move the Closes of transactions.  So, the coin is quite promising as showed a great boost of activity.  Wishing you lucky trading!",False

The volume of the AUNIT/USD currency pair made over $105.000. Based on this indicator, the Aunite Group coin has outrun the pairs: Bitcoin (BTC/USD), Litecoin (LTC/USD) and many other well-known currency pairs.

A telling proof of this is a constantly growing trading volume. BTC-Alpha is currently not the only exchange where AUNIT can be traded.

Recently, Bitcoin finished the correction, which was not in favor of bulls. This correction had been lasting for quite a long time and ended up by fall. Here we can highlight an advantage of Aunit. Unlike Bitcoin, it is not an expensive coin, which almost has no point to fall. Perhaps this BTC downtrend is temporary, and we will soon see a strong upward trend, but this is beyond our review.  Aunit rate CHARTS: https://medium.com/@autounit2018/review-of-the-aunite-coin-71ef9035d9be  The topic of our review is the Aunit, which has everything ahead and given the constant development of the emitter company, it will be more interesting to trade with this coin on the every day basis. Aunite Group continues its dynamic growth, for instance, it has recently reached an agreement with Wullet, the spot where one can exchange with bonuses and points. As we know, the Aunite Group is about paying cashback, and also deals with bonuses and points. This is an important agreement because it demonstrates that the company is developing, and perhaps some of these news will boost the market. The only question is the age and popularity of the coin.   Aunit/USD review The last week had been quite interesting for this pair. A week ago, I had some doubts in the buying potential of the coin‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänow there my doubts are minor. We cannot say that everyone is trying to buy and hold the coin, but there are such traders and they do things for successful records of this coin. It also worths noting that growing sales indicates presence of pipsing traders, which is generally a good sign. Pipsers are good because they don‚Äôt care which direction the market is going to, they make volumes, but they do not put pressure on the coin. The technical picture is quite interesting. There is support around 0.0400, and there are high volumes around this support. There is practically no place for the price to go down. Our option is therefore to buy and wait when the price starts moving around 0.0800‚Äì0.0850. Not so long ago, a quote of 0.0400 was a good target to close positions opened around 0.0300 or below. The second goal, where the currency pair can go‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääis the resistance 0.1200, there is a High, at which the price could not hold position for long, however, there is a goal.  Aunit/BTC review  As usual for this pair, volumes are smaller and the process is more calm. However, the situation is quite similar to the previous cryptocurrency pair. Currently, there is support around 0.00000560, where the pair is being traded at the moment and support is around 0.00000400. If you choose to trade with this pair, then it makes sense to buy coins from these levels. The closest targets are 0.00001000 and 0.00001300. If there is a rollback and purchase around 0.00000400, you can partially exit at 0.00000560. The chart is showing one of the probable scenarios for the coin. The lower Bitcoin gets against the US dollar, the faster this option will work out. Ttraders will start looking for a coin to choose in order to leave Bitcoin and other cryptos that have fallen or are about to go down.  Conclusion You can buy Aunit from the market or at the support levels indicated in the review. The price targets are also shown on the chart and can be used to partially exit the market. There is no point to exit in full, as the question of growth is a matter of time. The coin is interesting to traders due to the fact that there a reliable company is behind it. It can be an option if the bear trend for Bitcoin and other well-known coins continues. In this case, we‚Äôll see a very notable growth of the coin due to its low price.",False

Now the Aunit coin can perform as one of the options for saving assets if leading coins continue to decline. If earlier you‚Äôve already switched from Bitcoin to Aunit, this current day you could stay without loss and even earn. Of course, this is our comment after the event. However, the Aunit can serve as a safe way, because there is a reliable company behind it.  SEE TRADING CHARTS: https://medium.com/@autounit2018/review-of-the-aunit-coin-397ba17e0631   Next, we‚Äôll share some news. First, the coin has been listed on one more cryptocurrency exchange: Simex. That is a goos news as the number of potential traders is growing. At the same time, we are in a better position now when it comes to arbitration strategies. The latter will have a full impact after this exchange‚Äôs depth is filled and active trading actually starts. The second news is the coming presentation of new developments of the Aunite Group company. As a rule, such events provide support for the Aunit coin.   Technical analysis of Aunit/USD Last trading week has been a flat time. As in cases with new coins, volumes for this pair are quite high,. Considering the flat trend and high volumes, we can conclude about a good number speculators on the pair who play both long and short positions. There is also a little slant in favor of buyers, which suggests that some of these players are investors and pick up some Aunit coins to their portfolio. If we look at the flat trend on the daily time frame, we can see that the pair is drafting double bottom based on the last bearish trend. If the second Low of the double bottom is above the previous mark 0.0335, then double bottom falls to the resistance 0.0535. If the second Low bounces off the support 0.0300, then the target will be slightly higher, around 0.0560. If the second Low renews support at 0.0300, then we can forget about the double bottom for a while, but not completely discard the reversal pattern. The double bottom can represent the trend. Either way, instead of a double bottom, it can turn out to be an inverted head with shoulders . Actually one option does not exclude the other one. The latter option will give investors the opportunity to buy coins at more favorable prices. However, based on how the depth is being filled there are no reasons to think about a decline below 0.0350 on this exchange.  Technical analysis of Aunit/BTC The situation with volumes on this cryptocurrency pair is approximately the same as with the Aunit/USD pair. We don‚Äôt speak about absolute numbers, but about dynamics. Large purchases had been recorded on November 6‚Äì7. After that, volumes were recorded on the level of 50‚Äì60 thousand coins. The volumes on the previous pair amount to several million coins per day. However, the volumes on this certain pair indicate the presence of speculators, too. Candlestick picture on this pair is worse than the one on the previous currency pair. However, this does not mean we cannot make money using this tool. The chart is showing support around 0.00000590. It is pricked rather frequently, but then the pair is moving smooth around it. The resistance is at 0.00001000, where the pair is moving following to a rebound from the support of the current range. It makes sense to take profit there a little earlier, which explains why the pair does not touch resistance. Thus, the situation on this currency pair is simpler than on the previous pair, where you need to wait for a double bottom. Everything is quite simple here: we buy around 0.00000590 and sell in the region of 0.00000900. You can buy at a lower level, but the number of transactions may be less or you can just stay out of the market.",False

Automated platform IAC brings together the best features of payment systems, cashback services and affiliate programs with steady turnover growth 280% per year.   AUTOTOKEN & AUTOUNIT  Plans to emit: 85 982 639 AutoToken tokens and 3 000 000 000 units of AutoUnit (AU). Token will be created gradually, as the sales proceed. Price: 1 AutoToken = $1. The rate for token holders: 1 AutoToken = 10 AutoUnit.   The AutoToken distribution diagram indicates that 15% of the tokens are planned to be distributed among the campaign participants. The IAC project with a multi-level partner network,  involves the use of two approaches in AutoTokens distribution over bounty campaign: traditional bounty is the distribution of a certain percentage of the total number of sold tokens for performing certain actions; referral bounty is a program only IAC‚Äôs partners and VIP partners can participate (see WP Glossary).To become an IAC‚Äôs partner you need to register on the company's website and pay the appropriate status.  Within the traditional bounty program, 3% of the total number released tokens will be allocated. In case of reaching the hard cap it will be 2.1% of the total number sold tokens and will be distributed among the campaign participants in accordance with the rules that will be published later.   Within the referral bounty program, 12% of the total number emitted tokens will be distributed among IAC‚Äôs participants with statuses Partner and VIP partner. A large percentage is due to the fact that tokens will be distributed throughout the IAC‚Äôs referral network where more than 70.000 people are currently engaged. Referral bounty program terms are detailed in the White Paper.
