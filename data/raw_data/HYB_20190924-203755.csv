We provide traders with real-time feeds from all the major exchanges.  HybridCentral: Application based education to onboard through simple education modules. Community channels and HybridAcademy’s gamified education system help mass adoption through quickly learning blockchain skills and participation.   Why is HybridBlock important?  HybridBlock solves three major inhibiting factors for mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency by introducing:  1.   A simple, professional and rewarding community-based education platform. 2.   Making users first cryptocurrency purchase as easy as online retail shopping. 3.   A reliable trading platform that performs at Wall Street trading standards.  Our mission is to onboard the masses, and facilitate mass adoption of blockchain solutions to the world.        AMA with the Founders HYB Token  HybridBlock has created the Hybrid Token, which plays a pivotal role in powering the HybridNetwork. Token owners will receive discounted rates, exclusive access to new products and services, and opportunities to invest in future Token Sales. Hybrid tokens serve three primary functions:  1.   Payment of transaction fees and for all services within our network. 2.   To power the market-efficiency mechanism. 3.   As a tradable cryptocurrency available on the open market.  The HybridBlock Token: HYB  HYB tokens are the lifeblood of the HybridBlock ecosystem. HYBs are smart contract tokens built to the ERC20 token standard. They are necessary for discounted trading fees, utilizing the HybridFX network, and advanced HybridCentral content.  HybridFX: HFX  Fiat backed digital token that is maintained at a one-to-one ratio to fiat currency. An alternative to traditional bank.    To be able to create crypto/fiat pairs there will need to be approval of central banking authorities. Thus, the legal part at the start will be crucial to accomplishing this. Does this seem possible in a short notice, or does this have a long term trajectory?  Technically you don’t need any approval from the central bank to do so. Right now there is no regulatory framework (sandbox) in which the rules are clear and open. There is no central government in the world who will allow another currency that will compete with their own FIAT, that would be direct competition. The legal opinion from the team will be critical in terms of HOW HybridBlock operates but in no way does it limit the ability to operate in the Fiat/HFX pair. There will be MANY “stable” coins in the future but the ones who have support or a passthrough via the governments are the ones who will have the best chance at mass adoption. This approach has a medium term trajectory.  What is the main reason to open up the crypto space to an abundance of new participants? What would your advantage be over, for example, Binance?   By utilizing HybridBlock, you also have access to the subset alt-coin market without having to be on Binance with an account open, funded, and AML/KYC approved. i.e. You come to our platform and you have access to other pairs that are on their platform without having the multiple screen/eth/btc transferring etc.  Will your exchange platform consider USD trading pairs rather than TETHER?   For our country specific trading pairs - HybridBlock intends to use HFX token. This will be paired with, for example, HKD/HFX, PESO/HFX, EUR/HFX, etc. The goal is to have the ministry/central banking authorities allow us to operate cleanly and radically transparently. Third party audits on a continual basis that are open and accessible to the public who is in the HFX pairing will give further confidence that there is no fractionalized printing/reserves.  A large portion of your hard cap will be used for your liquidity pools: This increases the market cap and creates a riskier investment than if the funds were just needed for development and operational costs.  Liquidity is king, and it always will be. Regardless of how incredible the tech/team/biz/dev is, without liquidity you are holding a 100 carat diamond with zero buyers which is equal to a great paper weight. What HybridBlock is focused on is mass adoption. By concentrating on 3 specific types of users (Retail, Crypto-Trader, Institution/Professional Trader) imagine the potential of the entire market cap if we achieve our 100m NEW crypto-asset participants. Everyone wins. Other exchanges, multiple alt-assets, etc.   Website - Whitepaper - Token Sale FAQ - Telegram Community - Telegram News Channel - Reddit - Facebook - Twitter",False
