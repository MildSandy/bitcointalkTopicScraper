Token Launch Phase I,"This reminds me of 2013 when you could see 'IPOs' for all kind of shit, cannabis growing operations, t-shirts sale, real world mining operations, real estate and so on, of course they all failed.  But at least, back then, they promised dividends, now they just wanna sell you a worthless token.",False

Token Launch Phase I,"Yesterday we launched McFly Token Airdrop by distributing our invitation tokens among Waves community members. By the moment Waves holders received more than 30 000 McFlys, it's about a half of the planned amount. However, our airdrop accidentally caused delays in Waves blockchain.  Naturally, we didn't expect such outcome.  We are very thankful to the Waves team for their platform that allowed us to start our Token Launch! We met with Sasha Ivanov in June to tell about our project. Alas, we were not granted a chance to meet with him again to discuss our plan for the Airdrop and other Token Launch details, which may explain why Waves blockchain performance caught us unawares.  We heard that the Waves team is busy implementing Bitcoin-NG protocol to handle 100 transactions per second instead of per minute. This will definitely protect the Waves network from massive airdrops like ours. Meanwhile, we're updating our distribution script to adjust it to the current Waves blockchain capacity.  We will continue to send our tokens to Waves holders, but at a slower pace (1 transaction per 1 second). Each holder with at least a ""cent"" of WAVES will get 1 McFly token which roughly equals to 1 minute of flight.  If, for some reason, you did not receive a McFly token on your Waves wallet, then send us the address of your wallet at info@blockchain.aero and we will bring it to you.",False
