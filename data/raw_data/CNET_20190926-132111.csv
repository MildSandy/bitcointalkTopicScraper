Many of you may have noticed intermittent delays on the network over the past few weeks. These have been caused by powerful mining operators pointing their hardware at the ContractNet network and as a result pushing up the difficulty. This is normally expected, however, these miners would then stop, leaving the difficulty extremely high, and there was not enough remaining hash rate to process blocks timeously.  We decided to add a pool to the roadmap in order to empower the community (and incentivise them) in assisting in stabilising the network.  Like Ethereum, ContractNet uses the Dagger-Hashimoto mining algorithm. The pool can be reached at https://pool.cnetscan.io and we offer both HTTP (8888) and Stratum (8008) bindings. Over the next few days we will release tutorials on how to connect your GPU mining rigs (CPU mining is not recommended due to the current difficulty) to the network. What we can say is that we have found far more stability using Claymore mining software on the Stratum (port 8008) binding.",False

There are already a number of companies seeking to introduce blockchain technology to the world of IoT. What makes ContractNet unique? What types of problems does the network seek to solve? Here are some of the problems mentioned in the ContractNet whitepaper:  IoT technology is diverse and segmented by use case. There’s an intimidating number of devices, and the number of smart devices is growing every year. By 2020, it’s estimated that there will be between 26 and 100 billion connected devices. The vendor ecosystem is complex and fragmented. Security is important, but technologies and strategies are still emerging to deal with it. We don’t have a full-fledged security protocol to manage the complex IoT ecosystem. IoT standards and interoperability will take a long time to solidify, and no unified standard has emerged. IoT widens the potential attack surfaces, making platforms vulnerable to hacking, spying, and invasion of privacy. As the number of IoT devices continues to grow, the number of potential targets inevitably increases. Tech vendors often offer complicated integrated solutions, while customers are more interested in specific answers to specific problems. ContractNet believes its technical solution solves all of these problems.",False
