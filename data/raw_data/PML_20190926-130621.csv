PrimeLend is a decentralized, secure and transparent investment platform that uses the Ethereum blockchain. It provides diverse investment opportunities in form of term-lending, stake holding and crypto exchange. PML, the PrimeLend currency, is the fuel for all services. PML is built on the Ethereum Blockchain and followed the ERC-20 standard to ensure security, privacy and compatibility. At PrimeLend have invented a remunerative investment platform where anyone can invest in three distinct profitable schemes- Lend, Stake and Trade. The investment currency is PML, an ERC-20 standard token developed on the mighty Ethereum blockchain. A very limited supply of PML (8,000,000) only would be issued and circulated to ensure an optimum supply-demand ratio. Through the Lending scheme, investors would be paid interest on their investment on a daily basis in our lending schemes. The interest rate on lending would vary, depending on our return on re-investment through PrimeLend Volatility Algorithm. This rate may go up as high as 672% per year! But the best bit is it would be paid on a daily basis. The Staking scheme is as easy as holding PML in your account to create value and earn PML in exchange for that. Through the Trading program, anyone can trade in our internal or external exchanges where PML would be tradeable with other cryptocurrencies.   Why PrimeLend?  TRANSPARENCY- A transparent token policy and blockchain based transactions will ensure transparency of services INSTANT WITHDRAWALS- We will NEVER hold your withdrawals. You will always be able to withdraw your available funds instantly either in PML or in BTC/ETH. DECENTRALIZATION- One token is issued, there is no central control. The demand will set the price autonomously. BUILT ON ERC-20- PML, the PrimeLend currency, is developed using the ERC-20 standard to ensure compatibility with wallets and exchanges. SECURE & PRIVATE- Transactions made in internal or external exchanges and transactions between users are completely secure and private. WALLET SERVICE- PrimeLend will offer a state-of-the-art wallet service for PML. The wallet will be available for web, PC, Mac, iPhone and android devices.   How PrimeLend Works?  At this point, a legitimate question is how PrimeLend offers such high return on investment. The simple answer is we do it with intelligent re-investment. We are a group of people who have been in financial investment arena for decades, trading wide range of instruments. From blue chips and forex to commodity investment, we have accrued vast amount of experience on diverse trading instrument. Our trading experts have teamed up with a group of talented AI developers and together we have come up with groundbreaking algorithms that can predict the direction of volatility of different trading instruments. We have been using these algorithms for several months with outstanding effect on return of our investment. Now we are confident and want to take it to the next level with our investors as well.   What is PrimeLend Volatility Algorithm?  PrimeLend Volatility Algorithm is a hybrid system developed by a group of financial asset managers and trading software developers with specialization in AI. The motive behind the development was to come up with a set of algorithms that can predict the peeks and valleys of different financial markets and generate successful trades with large scale of profits. But there are two decisive features that make this system stand out among the rest. Firstly, there are multiple algorithms for different financial markets, such as forex, crypto-currency and commodity. This covers a large number of financial instruments and a wider reach that provides more opportunities. Secondly, unlike other trading robots, it does not depend solely on the predefined analytical capacity of the software. The system and the respective markets are constantly being monitored round the clock by human trading experts. So, if a scenario comes where our trading advisors interpret the situation differently, they have the authority and the ability to override the algorithm and take control. This worked remarkably well for us for a great number of trades when the market movement was driven more by fundamental factors than technical factors. AI may have gone a long way but in trading arena, robots still depend on the technical analysis. But this hybrid nature of our platform not only gives us a different dimension, it also gives us an edge over the other systems. A lot of effort were put behind the development of this system but we are more than content with what have come up. So far the algorithms have generated a staggering 94% success rate in our investment on different financial assets and we predict the rate will only go higher with further improvement.   What are the Investment Opportunities?  PrimeLend offers 3 distinctive investment opportunities for the investors. Earn profit by lending, exchanging or staking.  LEND Invest any amount from $100 onwards in form of PML and earn interest at an incredible rate of up to 56% per months. There are 5 lending schemes with different interest rate and capital release term.  STAKE Just keep PML in our exchange wallet for a certain period and earn rewards in our web-based staking schemes. The interest rate for staking starts as high as 8% month.  TRADE Trade PML in our internal our exchanges to earn profit from the difference of price volatility. Exchange can be made against BTC and ETH.   Why PrimeLend is Different from Other Lending Platforms?  1. We are based on ERC-20 and Ethereum Blockchain. Every transaction in our lending platform and exchange will be a smart contract. So, you can actually trace where you are putting your money.  2. We have a very transparent token issuance policy. 85% tokens are to be sold in the private sale and main sale. Most other lending platform does not have a block explorer neither you can find how many tokens/coins the platform itself possess. So, the coin grows in your dashboard but when the coin is enlisted in exchange, everything is dumped and the token holders are left with a wallet full of money that's worth nothing. Such pump and dump is not going to happen with our token policy.  3. The ICO contract is written in a way that tokens will be delivered to the buyer instantly. The lending platform is also completely based on smart contract, where interest and the capital will be transferred directly to users wallet. The website will just be an interface to perform the transactions. For the exchange, the Ethereum conversions will be automatic and instant. For BTC, it's difficult to create a bridge with Ethereum blockchain that will be instant. Still, even in the worst cases, the withdrawal will not be delayed for more than an hour or two. But whatever the scenario is, we are NEVER going to hold the withdrawals.
