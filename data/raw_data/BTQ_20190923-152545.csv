It is a great pleasure for us to introduce all of you to our pioneering e-commerce project BeautiQ. A Bulgarian start up, our objective is to build a viable e-commerce solution that will bridge the gap that has remained over the years between the producers from the CEE/SEE countries and the high-potential Chinese market.  As many of you are already aware of, China is one of the most promising destinations across the globe for cross-border e-commerce. Over the years, however, this highly prosperous marketplace has been out of bounds for many of the Central, Southern, and Eastern European producers because of technical issues as well as rather complex entrance requirements.  We, at BeautiQ, have created a business model that covers all aspects of marketing, fulfilment, delivery, and customer service for Central and Eastern European FMCG products by utilizing the sales channels, operational resources, and marketing services that already exist in the Chinese market. During the initial phase of B2C operation, we will focus on the Chinese web stores and service providers. Our first product category will be high-quality and ethically manufactured cosmetic products from the CEE/SEE manufacturers. In the long run, we also plan to offer business networking and consulting services for the manufacturers looking to make their way into the Chinese market.  We have recently introduced our utility token named BTQ based on WAVES. Leveraging the benefits of the groundbreaking blockchain technology, BeautiQ will combine the flexibility of a cryptocurrency and the stability of a real business.  We are about to start our ICO campaign on February 20, 2018 with the objective of raising funds for our start-up operations. Don’t miss out on this one-time opportunity to be part of the Chinese e-commerce revolution.
