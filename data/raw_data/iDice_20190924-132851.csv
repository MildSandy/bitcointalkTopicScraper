Normally, you would have to make an account such in the case of bitcoin dice games. With Ethereum, you can play from the safety of your wallet by simply sending ETH to the game/smart contract address. The smart contract will be able to compute the results of the game with random numbers generated from random.org. You will be able to generate a wallet to play from on the iDice app. After you send funds to the wallet, you will be able to start playing on the go!  Hope this helps!

You say that it will, but can you please explain WHY you are able to make that representation?  Don't they (Google Play and iOS) both ban gambling apps?  Thanks for the question! I understand your concern. You are correct in that gambling apps are banned by Google Play and Itunes. You will be able to download our app directly through our site on your smartphone. We will not be releasing our app through Google Play/Itunes nor did we say that we would be. Our app will be able to run on IOS and Android platforms just like any other 3rd party app that you can download online. There will be a guide detailing how to install our app on your phone once it is released.  I hope this helps!  Can this be done without jailbreaking the iphone?  Thanks for the question! You do not need to jailbreak or root your phone to install our app. For android phones it is relatively simple, but for IOS devices, you will be able to install our app through a process called sideloading. We will provide a guide in how to do so once the app is released.

According to your white paper, you are distributing the tokens in three different ratios depending on what time the participant sent its Ether. Above the question was asked: ""What will happen with unsold tokens?"" and your answer was ""Unsold tokens will be burned"". But - it's impossible to have unsold tokens the way you framed your ICO. Every token will be distributed according to the ratio. Can you please explain?  2. For clarification. What is the exact amount of tokens that will be distributed to the ICO participants? Is it 4'500'000 due to the allocation of the development team or is it 5'000'000 with a total amount of 5'500'000 in circulation?  3. If I read the white paper correctly, you are raising an indefinite amount of money. You could end up with very few Ether up to millions of dollars worth of Ether (e.g. competitor vDice raised 1.8$ Million worth of Ether). Could you elaborate on how much money your planning to spend on the different phases?  Thanks and best wishes   Thanks for expressing interest! These are some great questions and I'd love to clear things up for you!  1. If there is no ETH contribution to convert to iDice tokens, those tokens will remain unsold. Everything will be handled automatically by the smart contract; there is a specific burn function on the smart contract that automatically burns tokens that have not received an ETH contribution. The smart contract also automatically handles the conversion rates of the tokens to ETH. There is no human involvement in the token conversion process, it is all done by code.    2. There is a limited supply of 5 million tokens. 500,000 of them will be allocated to development team, thus 4,500,000 will be distributed to the ICO participants.  3. We really wish we could raise an indefinite amount of money!   Unfortunately, we have a limited supply of 5 million tokens, so raising an indefinite amount of money is impossible. Even at the lowest conversion ratio, the maximum amount of money we can raise is 5million/130=38,461.5 ETH. You can find our how we plan to spend our money on our Use of Funds section on our whitepaper (https://crowdsale.idice.io/idice-whitepaper.pdf) This projection is based on our estimate of raising 1,000,000 USD.  ...

You went on to answer the my third question talking about 5,000,000 tokens again, rather than the above stated 4,500,000. You contradicted yourself within 3 sentences. Please clarify!  Thanks  Hi there!  Let me clarify:  That calculation is to show that we cannot raise an indefinite amount of funds even if we sold the tokens allocated to the development team. I apologize for the confusion.  500,000 tokens will be allocated to the development team, thus 4,500,000 will be available to the crowdsale. I used the 5,000,000 tokens as an example of if we sold everything and did not allocate any tokens to the development team. If we account for the 500,000 tokens allocated to the dev team, we have 4,500,000 tokens that are available during the crowdsale. Using this number we calculate that the maximum amount of ETH we can raise with the lowest conversion ratio is ~34615.4 ETH (4,500,000/130)  The whitepaper lists the conversion ratio from ETH to tokens, hence, 200:1ETH, 170:1ETH etc. We did not say that the tokens will be distributed equally. The number of tokens you can convert with 1 ETH depends on when you contribute during the crowdsale. Once the 4.5m tokens are sold, the crowdsale will end.  I hope this clears things up for you!",True

Mr.Joshua juggled with some numbers up here and made some fairly accurate assumptions. Now, he pointed out that, if he's assumptions are more or less correct, it will take 19 months for you to get your money back, if you invested at best price (first hour). This is obviously true, regardless of the amount. 19 months. IF they ever become as successful as Primedice.com - the biggest players in the market.  It's was pointed out (on page 5 of this thread) that Mr.Joshua does not take into consideration, that the coin itself has value and can be traded on exchanges. Now, what makes a coin valuable? - Bitcoin: Has value because it's being used as digital currency for payments in real life - Ether: Has value because it's the oil of the Ethereum network. You pay with Ether to use the network. - iDice: Has value because it pays out dividends  One ""iDice"" will pay you ~0.067$ dividends per month. This one ""iDice initially cost ~1.31$ during the ICO (taken the example from above). The time to break even, who would've thought, is obviously exactly the same - more than 19 months.  There is absolutely no reason, why the market value of this coin would ever significantly increase, because it takes ages to get your money back. There is no other value to this coin, than the dividends. Don't just assume the coin will gain value because ""that's what cryptos do""!  (Yes, an increase of revenue would be a reason, but we're talking in this example about numbers from Primedice who has been in the market for years and is the biggest player by far. We surely can assume that not all 5 million tokens will be sold, so the dividends will be higher per token, but we also have to assume that iDice will never wager $34 millions).  Fun fact: 1 Ether is currently gaining about 10$ a day. Do you really think that is a great trade here?",True

We are aware of the accusations that have been made against us. We referenced Etheroll's open source code and have added several additional functions on top of it: it is clear to see that although some parts may be similar, it is not an exact replica. The smart contract you are seeing right now is purely for our beta release. Our intentions in using Etheroll's old code was to protect our final product from malicious copycat attempts from potential competitors. If we really wanted to copy Etheroll's source code, we would have used their current code with all the improvements they have made. A lot of you are raising an issue of our outrageously high house edge. We set the house edge to 6.5% only to test our game beta, it was not meant to be an official launch. We are aware that a competitive house edge is around 1% and we did not falsely advertise the house edge of our beta in any way.  I personally guarantee that the official mobile and desktop versions of iDice will have a source code that is completely unique to our platform. The team is working around the clock to expedite the official release of iDice for desktop and mobile platforms (which will have a house edge of 1%).  We made a mistake, and I apologize for the inappropriate manner that we handled this situation.  We truly did not intend to lie to potential investors. We are not a scam project; our goal is to revolutionize blockchain gambling through mobile devices.  Thank you for understanding, -Jordan Wong",True

We are the first mobile gambling platform powered by Ethereum! Our goal is to become the next SatoshiDICE equivalent of gambling on mobile devices! Currently there is no competition in that segment and we believe that our mobile app release will grant us a monopoly in that segment for months before the competition can even respond. By the time they do, we will be a year ahead of the competition and hold the majority of the market share. We also plan on releasing other game types such as blackjack, roulettes, and poker on our mobile phones as well, all running ethereum smart contracts to give our users a smooth reliable experience without risk of being hacked and compromises in security!

Overall, iDice is a Project with good prospects. However I do have questions which needs to be answered so I can be clarified.  1. iDice has a maximum supply of 5m iDice tokens, No iDice tokens reserved to the founding team?  2. What will happen in case not all iDice tokens are sold. Unsold tokens will be burned?  3. It's mentioned in the Whitepaper that Token holders gets 100% of the profits from iDice Gambling platform. If this is the case, How will iDice make revenue If they distribute all profits to investors. I'd like to know!  4. The way the funds raised during the crowdsale will be used raised some personal concerns from me.  If $5m is raised during the ICO, $1m  will be used to build the iDice Gambling app. Isn't that too much? Even $50,000 can fund the development of the app.  5. How does iDice compare to ETHRoll, Edgeless & Vdice? They're all powered by the same Ethereum Network. So I'd like to know what makes iDice standout from the rest.  I await a prompt response on these questions.  Thanks for expressing interest! You have great questions and we'd be happy to address them!  1. 10% of all tokens or 500,000 tokens will be allocated to the iDice development team.  2. Unsold tokens will be burned.  ...  Hi there  I do have a couple of questions:  1. According to your white paper, you are distributing the tokens in three different ratios depending on what time the participant sent its Ether.

Could you elaborate on how much money your planning to spend on the different phases?  Thanks and best wishes   Thanks for expressing interest! These are some great questions and I'd love to clear things up for you!  1. If there is no ETH contribution to convert to iDice tokens, those tokens will remain unsold. Everything will be handled automatically by the smart contract; there is a specific burn function on the smart contract that automatically burns tokens that have not received an ETH contribution. The smart contract also automatically handles the conversion rates of the tokens to ETH. There is no human involvement in the token conversion process, it is all done by code.    2. There is a limited supply of 5 million tokens. 500,000 of them will be allocated to development team, thus 4,500,000 will be distributed to the ICO participants.  3. We really wish we could raise an indefinite amount of money!   Unfortunately, we have a limited supply of 5 million tokens, so raising an indefinite amount of money is impossible. Even at the lowest conversion ratio, the maximum amount of money we can raise is 5million/130=38,461.5 ETH. You can find our how we plan to spend our money on our Use of Funds section on our whitepaper (https://crowdsale.idice.io/idice-whitepaper.pdf) This projection is based on our estimate of raising 1,000,000 USD.  35% of all Ether raised during the crowdfund will become the house bankroll to pay winning bets. Token Holders as a collective receive 100% of iDice game profits.   30% of all Ether raised will be used by iDice development team to fund further development of the iDice Platform, as well as to fund the development and implementation of other game types on the iDice platform.   20% of all Ether raised will be used in the development and launch of the world’s first mobile blockchain gambling app, which will be available for both Android and IOS Devices.   15% of all Ether raised will be used for promotion and marketing purposes.  Unfortunately, since we cannot predict how much money we will be able to raise in this ICO, we are unable to provide specifics in our whitepaper. If more significantly more money was raised than our estimate, then we will allocate a higher % of funds towards our bankroll so that players will be able to make bigger bets, and increase the budget our promotion and advertising campaign.  I hope I've cleared everything up for you! If you have more questions, I'd be more than happy to answer them! Thanks!  ",True

This is currently our beta release and we acknowledge that we have used etheroll's contracts as a reference. Our contract source code can be found on: https://idice.io. Dice contracts are all similar due to use of open source blockchain-based oraclize.it to retrieve random integers supplied by Random.org via TLSNotary. The iDice smart contract then performs encryption on the integer provided by random.org and  the IPFS address of the TLSN proof to compute the game result. We've also contracted random.org for our own API keys, so we are not associated with any others. This way, we ensure that iDice will generate random numbers without 3rd party interference of the games final result. We'd love to add that our platform beta release is extremely popular as we've received nearly 1000 with positive feedback from our players.

Overall, iDice is a Project with good prospects. However I do have questions which needs to be answered so I can be clarified.  1. iDice has a maximum supply of 5m iDice tokens, No iDice tokens reserved to the founding team?  2. What will happen in case not all iDice tokens are sold. Unsold tokens will be burned?  3. It's mentioned in the Whitepaper that Token holders gets 100% of the profits from iDice Gambling platform. If this is the case, How will iDice make revenue If they distribute all profits to investors. I'd like to know!  4. The way the funds raised during the crowdsale will be used raised some personal concerns from me.  If $5m is raised during the ICO, $1m  will be used to build the iDice Gambling app. Isn't that too much? Even $50,000 can fund the development of the app.  5. How does iDice compare to ETHRoll, Edgeless & Vdice? They're all powered by the same Ethereum Network. So I'd like to know what makes iDice standout from the rest.  I await a prompt response on these questions.",True

For example, Primedice (according to dicesites.com) has 2,772 BTC wagered through it's site since the end of May.  Extrapolated for a months time would be about ~12,000 BTC or approximately $34 million a month.   With a house edge of 1% you would have an expected profit value of $340,000 a month, which is a significant amount of money, if you own all of the tokens and get 100%.   However, $5000 investment of ETH (~19 ETH as of today) would only yield 3800 tokens assuming you got it at the best price.  (200 tokens / 1 ETH first hour).   Lets assume all 5 million tokens are sold. 3800 tokens is only 0.076% of the total 5 million available tokens (about $6.5 million at first hour price).  So if it was as popular as Primedice, 0.076% [of $340,000] would only net you ~$258 a month.   That is a full 19 months before you even make back your original investment of $5000!
