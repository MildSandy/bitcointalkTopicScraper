The world of cryptocurrencies has exploded like never before in 2017. The price of Bitcoin was shot up to over $17000 for the first time in its history. There has also been an increase in the number of initial coin offerings (ICOs). According to reports on CoinDesk, ICOs went from roughly $300 million raised in total since they began in 2014, to $2.7 billion raised as of October 2017.  ICOs are becoming extremely popular and trendy way of raising funds to support startup and realization of their business plan. I have seen some ICOs where developers create a fancy website and articulate their vision in the whitepaper and still they have been successful. I learned a word called ‚ÄúFOMO‚Äù i.e. fear of miss out that is doing the trick even to illegitimate projects and investors are getting scammed.  Are we so lazy to evaluate a project thoroughly or do we not care for our investment or could be so that we do not know how to really spot the right project from this overly crowed world of cryptocurrency?  I recommend investors to follow at-least three simple steps to validate an ICO:  1. What Unique problem the project claims to solve?  Although everyone say that they are solving a unique but you as an investor must check whether they are really doing so. It‚Äôs not difficult to determine the fact as you can easily identify whether their idea is unique or not by doing through their whitepaper and other information available on their website. After all its your money and you got to ensure you are doing the right thing by considering a particular ICO for investment.  2. Who are part of the team and must validate their credentials  I personally have come across to some projects where they say due to security and safety of our team members, we are not revealing their identify. This is a big alarm. Stay away from such projects. How could you invest your hard earned money into some project where you do not know who the team is and what is their background.    Another scenario is where project has declared their team and probably put their linked in profile details. My suggestion is to contact at least 50% of the team members via whatever legitimate possible ways and validate their credentials.  3. Is the project having an existing business backing the idea  This is very important aspect to consider. Traditionally we all are tuned to check this information when we invest in equities or debt funds. We validate what does the company do and how are they projected to grow. Essentially we should apply the thought process when it comes to investment irrespective of equities, debt or even crypto currency project.  These validation criteria are not exhaustive and do not guarantee the selection of right project in cryptocurrency market however, it will certainly help you to a certain degree.

Investors can vary which part of the value chain where they want exposure with any number of funds. For example, the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (XOP) gives investors exposure to the upstream oil and gas exploration companies while the VanEck Vectors Coal ETF (KOL) gives investors access to the coal industry. Investors wanting access to alternative energy can invest in the Guggenheim Solar ETF (TAN).  There are many different ways for investors to gain exposure to the energy sector, depending on their preferences and specific views about the growth and earnings prospects across the value chain. The energy sector is bigger and more diversified than just the oil and gas industry. Many investors feel renewable and alternative energy sources will be important in the future as the popularity of electric cars grows. Traditional hydrocarbon producers seem to be falling out of favor for the time being.  However since future lies in blockchain, i would recommend to consider a project which has already established a market as a traditional player in energy sector and at the same time, had put their feet very strongly into cryptocurrency world. I see Bittwatt as an excellent investment opportunity.",False

First of all, thank you for your interest in the Bittwatt project. What we are doing is transferring the bits of information truly important and valuable in energy transactions into an independent blockchain, so that all parties in the energy ecosystem can benefit from a simpler, error-proof and lightning-fast platform. Bittwatt platform is one where: -   All operators involved are validated by eligibility and solvency, removing the risk of doing business with a party that can‚Äôt meet their obligations. -   Producers can sell to buyers without requiring physical contracts to concede that the deal took place. -   Suppliers can see production requirements in real-time (and can adjust production within a maximum of 24 hours). -   Traders can make full use of cross-border lanes by sharing them with other operators in exchange for a fee. -   Traders can quickly harness market opportunities, regardless source and quantity. -   Consumers can choose the best supply options and change suppliers within 24 hours. -   Distribution operators can make their information freely accessible in a safe network where eligible partners can extract their required data, doing away with a large part of useless bureaucracy and with human error.
