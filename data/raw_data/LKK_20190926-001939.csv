This is not a decision from Lykke's team but rather as explained before a consequence of LKK being considered a security. No crypto exchange that I know of is licensed to list securities (a lot of them can't even deal with fiat). Recently Kraken has delisted Iconomi as they are undergoing a token swap apparently (the new tokens represent true equity in the company from what I understand) which is a similar situation. This could be interesting to follow and see how it develops.  As you said it will be very beneficial from a marketing point of view to be listed in other exchanges because of the exposure alone. Regulations are becoming clearer globally and while many predicted 2019 would be the year of security tokens but things moved quite slowly as we are close to the end of the year. There were some interesting acquisitions and move towards this from big actors so I'm hopeful this will be a reality soon, not only because how it could affect LKK as an asset since I'm not here to speculate on that but because tokenized equity is definitely a huge addition to the industry and certainly take it to another level.",False

Lykke will become an equity shareholder in Nxchange in return for contributing investment capital, blockchain technology, crypto asset trading infrastructure and financial engineering expertise to the partnership. Nxchange will bring the regulatory expertise in compliance and governance around the listing requirements to facilitate safe and regulated trading. This will make it instantly easier for any company to offer their securities to a much wider investor market while simultaneously granting investors access to a far greater and more diverse variety of financial assets. The proprietary Lykke Nxchange wallet will provide the storage vehicle through which users will be enabled to access and trade their digital assets on the exchange from anywhere in the world, whenever they wish.  New blockchain technology and smart contracts used in the crypto markets becomes vastly cheaper, quicker, more accessible and more secure compared to traditional methods of exchange such as the incumbent stock exchanges and trading platforms provide. By the use of a new infrastructure to handle transactions between two parties, investors will become fully empowered to take control of their financial strategy. This partnership will see the potential for any asset or security – equities, bonds, loans, investment products, etc. – to be tokenised and traded on the blockchain infrastructure all within an MTF regulated and compliant environment. This will provide all on-boarded users with the peace of mind and trust required to invest in previously inaccessible assets, complete with embedded smart contracts to guarantee the rights of all users (e.g. dividends, asset ownership, voting rights, etc.) all within a securely regulated environment.  Nxchange has recently announced their collaboration with large institutional partner ABN Amro clearing bank in developing the first blockchain bank account where transactions can be settled real- time against fiat currencies while these are held in the safe custody of ABN Amro clearing bank.  Richard Olsen, founder of Lykke and of globally renowned futures commission merchant OANDA, says “This is a historic day - not only for Lykke and Nxchange as companies – but for our broader shared vision that is targeted at a more equitable and democratic financial world. The increasing acceptance of digital assets and blockchain infrastructure as the technology of the future correctly comes with a greater emphasis on regulation and compliance. This partnership envisages to satisfy all these things while still bringing all the benefits of transformative technology to any individual who wishes to access or exchange anything of value.”  Marleen Evertsz, CEO and founder of Nxchange says: “We believe that the time has come for a more modern form of capital market transactions: efficient, real-time, 24/7, transparent, and supported by compliance procedures that assure maximum security. We are delighted to partner with Lykke and to join forces in building the Next Generation Stock Exchange.  More information at: https://www.lykke.com/company/news/2018-11-nxchange",False

Regarding colored coins here is a good sum up on Lykke colored coins and fiat deposits: https://www.reddit.com/r/lykke/comments/6bzehz/what_does_it_really_mean_the_1usd_in_my_lykke/dhs0ub6/  Also a related question was recently answered here: https://www.lykke.com/city/blog/2018-04-qna-exchange  Q: Are fiat assets stored in Lykke wallet protected by European Deposit Guarantee Scheme? If not, what do you have in place? Richard Olsen: They are not protected by the European Protection Guarantee Scheme, which applies to banks. In the new world of crypto, customers of Lykke can convert any fiat assets into BTC, ETH or cryptos as moment's notice. Users do not have to wait for 2 business days to transfer their funds to another broker or bank as is typical for the traditional banking system. This reduces risk. Medium-term, we want to explore how we can provide insurance coverage.  I will try to put it into simple terms, many (if not most) crypto exchanges work like this, as exchanges, and keeping a tight balance sheet and segregated funds are the tools in place to avoid any mismanagement. Lykke also presents annual audit reports. I won't personally get into speculation about how Tether operates since there are many articles but I can say it's still not quite clear on how exactly are backed (Lykke colored coins are only redeemable on Lykke Exchange so that's a less complex operation).  As regulation moves forward, demands are higher but also a clear landscape appears too on what is required by law or needed to protect consumers. Sadly some regions move faster than others and many alternatives would need to co-exist.",False

Users will be able to set the transaction fee when withdrawing BTC from their private wallet allowing them to control how fast the transaction is executed.  Previously, the transaction fee for BTC private wallet was set and supported by Lykke. Many of our users wished to have more control over the transaction fee - and resulting speed - when using their BTC private wallet. With the new release, the users will be entirely responsible for the transaction fees for their private wallet: they will choose the fee that suits their needs, and pay the fee from their own funds. It will work in the same way as it works in the ETH private wallet now. All transactions in the bitcoin blockchain are handled by the distributed network of miners. The miners collect, verify and bundle transactions into a block and add it into the blockchain. The miners are incentivized by the money the users pay for each transaction as the transaction fee. As a result, transactions with higher fees are prioritized. Choosing the right transaction fee can be a complicated question impacted by multiple factors.  Time: How quickly do you need the transaction to be confirmed? Do you want to spend your BTC as soon as possible or do you have time to wait?  Network load: The bitcoin network overall load can vary greatly. When many users want to send transactions simultaneously, the demand for the limited supply of blocks increases. As a result, fees that would normally be competitive for miners can suddenly become insufficient to have the transaction confirmed within a reasonable timeframe.  Transaction Size: Transaction data size impacts the fee - and not the amount of BTC transferred as many think. In short, when users frequently receive many small transactions, the size of their transaction tends to become larger.  To choose the right fee, there is a variety of online tools you can use. If you are interested in the current bitcoin blockchain statistics, such as network load, average and suggested transaction fees, and transaction execution speed, you can check bitcoin statistics page.  https://www.lykke.com/company/news/2018-07-btc-private-wallet-update-choose-your-transaction-fee",False

The company also unveiled its goals for 2018–2019.  Key among the successes of the previous year was the posting of profits for both Lykke Corp and Lykke Group. Lykke Corp, consisting of Lykke’s Swiss entity on a standalone basis, showed a profit of CHF 2.2 million in 2017; while Lykke Group, which includes all international interests, posted consolidated earnings of CHF 4.6 million in the same period. As discussed in the coinholder meeting, Lykke is emerging from the transition period that began in 2018 as a newly retooled Lykke 2.0, which emphasizes global branding, lean development practices, a centralized leadership team, and institutional procedures for maximizing outputs. These four pillars will provide the foundation and organizational structure for continued growth into 2019.  “One aspect of Lykke that hasn’t changed is our pursuit of and commitment to aggressive goals,” said Richard Olsen, Lykke founder and CEO. “We’re rolling out redesigned versions of our free Lykke Wallet mobile app and our web trading platform. We aim to truly democratize finance through an ecosystem of apps that are accessible, reliable, easy to use - more information about the new products which are now in a concept phase will be shared before the end of the year. As for our new projects in 2018, one of the most exciting and innovative is the AlgoStore, which will help to democratize algo-based trading.”  The AlgoStore, which is expected in Q3 2018, enables any Lykke member, regardless of technical expertise or formal financial background, to find and experiment with trading algorithms using imaginary funds. After achieving a comfort level with the algorithm, the investor can begin trading with it using actual funds. It is hoped that the AlgoStore will pave the way for an entire ecosystem of reliable, easy-to-use, highly accessible financial apps, all bearing the global Lykke brand.  One of the challenges for online exchanges in general is liquidity. Lykke plans to implement liquidity improvements over the coming year, including a smart fee structure for trading professionals, increased marketing, and integration with other online exchanges, along with a continued focus on Lykke’s automated trading algorithm and market-making engine. Another continuing challenge is the global trend toward regulation of crypto assets. Lykke views this development as a net positive, despite the current state of flux of regulatory requirements in certain markets, including the United States. In the meantime, Lykke has made demonstrable gains with regulators in other key markets.

It occurred on August 1, 2017. Bitcoin Cash features an adjustable block size, which significantly improves the ability of the network to scale. By default, Bitcoin Cash sets the block size at 8 MB—eight times the size of the bitcoin block. This larger block size increases the speed of transactions, while the adaptability of the design contributes to the long-term health of the network.  “We’re excited to bring Bitcoin Cash to the Lykke Exchange,” said Richard Olsen, Lykke founder and CEO. “We’re equally excited about the way that we’re able to do it. The constantly emerging innovations around the bitcoin project and the rapidly changing protocols can lead to considerable confusion among investors and create a significant impediment to adoption. Moreover, hard forks often lead to hard choices about which branch to follow, which encourages division. But this isn’t a concern on the Lykke Exchange. Our traders can easily and transparently choose among all the existing protocols and blockchains and invest on either side of the fork, all from a single point of entry.”  Those members who held BTC with Lykke at the time of the fork are retroactively entitled to the equivalent amount in BCH. This occurrence is an effect of the fork. Previously, members of the Lykke community could withdraw Bitcoin Cash to external wallets only. Now they can withdraw BCH to their Lykke trading wallet and trade BCH on Lykke Exchange. See BCH withdrawal manual for iOS and Android for complete details.  https://www.lykke.com/company/news/bch-listing",False

The problem with LKK (and derivatives like LKK1Y and LKK2Y) is that they are considered securities (as they represent true equity in a company, something very few other tokens or crypto assets do). This of course make other exchanges hesitant to list it due to regulations concerns. In the recent YouTube AMA, a new designed utility token named LKT has been mentioned although the details are not yet defined. The idea is for LKT to add visibility as you mentioned and add value to Lykke.  If we take Binance for example, BNB is certainly an utility token and that's fine but I would personally love to own equity in the actual company. So in the space there is room for different dynamics. The migration to ERC20 tokens (from colored coins) will also help in order to be listed in many ETH based decentralized exchanges, although I'm just speculating here.",False

The topic about exchanges listing has been discussed many times. LKK is considered to be a security (it's an actual share of the company with all that implies) so most crypto exchanges are understandably not rushing to add it. Plus they will be basically adding a token from the competition which is not very enticing for them unless the volume is huge. I would say Lykke shares would be trading in a regular stock exchange first than in a crypto focused one considering the current landscape.  With the migration from colored coins to ERC20 token that could open the field to be traded at truly decentralized exchanges.",False

Lykke started to actively expand the list of assets from the beginning of February, 2018, and has added more than 30 new tokens since then. Litecoin is one of the top five cryptocurrencies in the world by value, with a market capitalization in excess of $2 billion. It is renowned for its faster transaction speeds relative to bitcoin and its ability to handle higher transaction volumes.  “The maturation of the Lykke Exchange continues apace with Litecoin,” said Richard Olsen, Lykke founder and CEO. “This important expansion to our offerings brings an investment opportunity to our community on a par with Ethereum and bitcoin. We’re especially proud of the Litecoin integration. Thanks to the modular software architecture of our platform, which provides an abstract integration layer, bringing Litecoin onto our exchange was a smooth and painless process.”  This ingenious integration scheme enables Lykke to adapt new cryptocurrencies to the Lykke Exchange through partial automation. The integration layer handles common tasks across blockchains, including cash flow operations and client wallets, so that Lykke can incorporate new assets on the exchange simply by deploying the appropriate software connectors. Following in the success of Litecoin, five additional blockchain integrations are currently in the testing phase with the support and participation of Lykke’s crowdsourcing community.  Litecoin is just one of more than 30 new additions to the Lykke Exchange. For the most up-to-date listing of tradeable tokens and coins, visit https://www.lykke.com/cp/tokens-and-coins-traded.

Colored coins still exists of course, the difference is the trading wallets (before they were decentralized (with a multisignature implementation where both the user and the exchange held one key and a refund address in case of a hack). Now they are managed by Lykke just like other centralized exchange. However private wallets provided by Lykke are still available and in fact you can still use CoinPrism if you prefer an external solution. However colored coins will be abandoned soon AFAIK, I can't confirm anything since I actually don't have more information about the subject but I can speculate that LKK would become an ERC20 token in the Ethereum network (actually LKK2Y recent forward contract is in fact an ERC20 token). Two years ago, Bitcoin was (still is for many) the most secured platform so colored coins made more sense but it's not the case anymore.  You can certainly sell your LKK for CHF and USD at any time inside the app/exchange, tap on the asset and select ""Trade"" or just tap on the bottom right button to access all available pairs. Just the same you can deposit or withdraw, in the case of CHF/USD, available option would be SWIFT transfer more likely to your local bank.

Recently, we were forced to change this policy. To continue supporting zero fees in our trading wallets, we have decided to introduce fees for deposits and withdrawals. The main argument for this decision is to use our resources to add more assets to the exchange and to offer better experience to our users, rather than to cover the fees for transactions that pass through the Lykke Wallet simply because of the zero-fee policy.  We will also use the saved resources to fund a referral program which our community has been requesting.  We have received a lot of feedback from the community after publishing our new fee policy.

More fees then any other exchange. Your probably more expensive then any other exchange. It is very easy to fix stop being greedy and mark down your spot price. If your not going to do that I have to put the money back on my credit card which i don't want to do. But I will because I am not going to get ripped off. You guys should figure out a solution with these prices they are way way to high. I don't mind paying a few percent over but not these prices. I will be losing around 80 dollars to do this and I can't even buy your lykke coins cause I am in america. You guys don't even put a warning sign that americans cant invest in your company before we do credit voucher. The reason people are investing into your exchange and wanting to use it is cause it supposed to be cheap. I thought its centralized we should have no problem buying lykke coin but nope can't so ok all get bitcoin and buy some ripple on poloniex. Nope can't do that cause your way over spot price on the exchanges. I am trying to figure out a way to use your exchange I can't its frustrating. I can't do anything except take my money back. That sucks. I am sure richard can fix this and he seems like a good guy that wants to make customers happy. If you guys don't fix this it looks bad on your business.  So i figured out a way to get money off lykke you got to put it on live coin where bitcoin price is the same as lykke. It is higher because your trading with usd for it. On poloniex and other exchanges its bitcoin price but not traded directly with usd. When its traded with usd I am noticing the price is much higher for it. So that might be why bitcoin is expensive along with ethereum. but if you move it to live coin you can trade it at higher price cause its compared to usd. So I am doing that now.,False

Shaping the communication culture inside the community is always a challenge for a company that follows the crowdsourcing ideal. On the one hand, we want to give everyone the opportunity to express their minds, share their experiences, and add missing parts to the information puzzle. On the other hand, crypto is changing so fast and embracing so much new energy that no project can incorporate all the new ideas. Sometimes, the information torrent has to be actively moderated and shaped. Sticking to the initial values and principles of the company is a big challenge in itself, but it’s a challenge that helps us to grow.  A Zen proverb says, “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” We want to start our journey by updating our Slack and Telegram channels. We have been analyzing the activity on these channels, and we have discovered a sad thing: Slack is dying.  On February, 1 we want to delete the Lykke public Slack channel. That will give us the resources to focus on the channel that’s living and growing: Telegram. We plan to create a number of new Lykke channels on Telegram to help you navigate in the modern sea of information and help us to be more responsive and connected with the community. The details will follow in the coming announcement.  Another change will take place on Twitter: from now on the official Lykke twitter is @lykke. To avoid confusion, the @LykkeCity account will be deleted. It was a nice name, referring to the tradition of building countries and cities in the wild and unexplored crypto cyberspace.

More importantly, it’s just plain fun.

This development has affected many companies, including Bitwala, BitPay, Cryptopay, and London Block Exchange, as well as Lykke. It’s sad to say, but we must temporarily delay issuing the Lykke Card while we work around this short-term challenge.  There are no plans to cancel the Lykke Card.

These considerations led us to decide to switch our exchange to a centralized model.  Full read at https://www.lykke.com/company/news/Lykke-Changes-Operational-Mode",False

Either way Lykke as it's mentioned in the blogpost is working hard on its own solution which seems very promising. That will take a while but it's always the goal, Lykke didn't stay semi-decentralized for so long if it didn't believe in the power of it.

Quote from: mtnsaa on November 11, 2017, 12:03:57 PM Hey Banned seller, this is a goal that's still on the plans but many different aspects need to align to happen. For starters I would say it would be prudent for both Lykke and these exchanges to get a resolution on licenses and regulations in the US which are advancing and entering the last phase. Lykke will most likely be considered a security in my opinion from what I understand (but a fully regulated one which is what the licenses are for). For many others projects this would be bad news because they tried to circumvent the laws, not Lykke, Lykke always worked close  to regulators, this takes a lot of resources and time  but I'm sure it will be very worthy at the end. After that answer the path will be clearer. Perhaps Poloniex won't be able to list it but another type of exchange could (not even a crypto one).  I'm just trying to speculate on the near term future and explain why some things appear to be ""delayed"" or postponed when in fact they are just going through their natural and proper course.",False

One of the things we've been up to recently is exploring hashgraph technology. We invite you to join us in this research, explore multiple applications of hashgraph, add your comments and participate in our Lykke Streams competition.  Hashgraph is a recently emerged technology that is often said to be able to dethrone blockchain. In a very simplified way, its principle can be explained as a network of computers communicating with each other randomly, in a decentralized way, and incredibly fast. For all operations, such as, let’s say, a money transfer, they create ‘events’ and exchange the information they possess about these and all the previous events within the network. This process is called ‘gossip about gossip’: you not only tell others your news, but you also gossip about what you’ve ‘heard’ from others. This is a very simplistic explanation, obviously, this information is encrypted, and not subject to biased ‘gossiping’, to stick to the same metaphor.  Hashgraph technology stands out for having found a practical application for the Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) protocol, that guarantees absolute security of operations. Consensus about what events have truly taken place is reached almost instantly through cryptographic verification of all the ‘gossip about gossip’ and virtual voting. Mathematics excludes the ‘events’ that don’t correspond to the records of the majority of users, this is how the Asynchronous BFT protocol works. The high speed of transaction verification within a hashgraph allows for a much wider variety of applications than that of blockchain.

This means that Lykke doesn't take possession of your assets (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Colored Coins). Most decentralized exchanges do this too but the user experience is quite subpar, that's why Lykke still need to be trusted with match the trades correctly (and that's why it's not a fully decentralized exchange).  Bittrex on the other hand is a fully centralized exchange, exposed to hacks and other vulnerabilities but also not offering direct ownership of your digital assets. That doesn't mean that it's bad per se, it just serves a different purpose (although currently it does not offer proper fiat gateway, either for deposit or withdrawal).  I suggest to do your own research as here's plenty of information available about Lykke at the official site alone or join our communities at Reddit, Telegram and/or Slack. Its aim is much more ambitious than being just ""only"" a crypto exchange.",False

For starters I would say it would be prudent for both Lykke and these exchanges to get a resolution on licenses and regulations in the US which are advancing and entering the last phase. Lykke will most likely be considered a security in my opinion and from what I understand (but a fully regulated one which is what the licenses are for). For many others projects this would be bad news because they tried to circumvent the laws, not Lykke, Lykke always worked close to regulators, this takes a lot of resources and time but I'm sure it will be very worthy at the end. After that answer the path will be clearer. Perhaps Poloniex won't be able to list it but another type of exchange could (not even a crypto one).

Lykke competes (or will compete) more with centralised exchanges, rather than decentralised exchanges.

It's massively scalable and can become a world player against some of the biggest exchanges in the world if things go right.

But: LKK represents ownership and burning supply would mean to shift ownership from founders and company to 'everybody else'. And why would the founders do that? They all are hard working to make Lykke a success and Richard Olsen, for example, is not only the one who started this project and works hard for it, but also the biggest Investor.  And out of the perspective of those who invested in LKK: Doesn't it feel better if those who work everyday on this have some skin in the game? Lykke is really not about a short-term-market-move-project. Technically LKK has all ""features"" of a cryptocurrency.

The discrepancy between App and Blockchain-Explorer is because Lykke implemented Offchain-Settlement. In very short words:  The trading-wallet is a multi-signature wallet (customer holds one Private Key, Lykke holds the other one) and you can imagine Offchain-settlement this way: Lykke deposits Coins in the multi-sig-wallets of customers. And let's say you want to buy, the balance is just updated. That speed things up and is cheaper than settling all trades on-chain. Your App shows your balance but the Block Explorer shows balances of both parties until now. In future the Explorer will be improved to differ between both parties.  You can find more infos about it here: https://www.lykke.com/city/blog/lykke_offchain_settlement (especially questions 7,8,9)   If you should lose your App, let's say because you lose your phone or it's damaged, you should have stored the 12 words seed safe.   Ether is not displayed on the Block-Explorer because the Lykke-Explorer only shows Bitcoin and colored Coins (Colored Coins are technically fractions of a Bitcoin, so they also run on the Bitcoin-Blockchain). Colored Coins are LKK for example but also all Fiat-Currencies on Lykke are represented as colored Coins.",False

The stock market is not the cryptomarket. You don't have regularly released shares every X minutes, you don't have shares ""lock up in smart contracts"".

There's tonnes of other coins out there where the ""founder coins"" are counted, but LKK coins aren't.  To me, it makes no difference, but I really dislike how misleading it is for other people who rely on coinmarketcap.  It makes valuations crazy. Look at something like BITOK. I have no idea what it is, pretty sure it's just a scamcoin, but it's value is utterly stupid because coinmarketcap hasn't given it a circulating supply value and thus it's ignored in their calcs.

In Lykke (but also several other projects) there is already existing supply that is theoretically on the market, because technically it is not locked up, but because it is in the hands of founders, team-members, board-members, seed-Investors, practically it is not on the market. That makes things more complex for a site like CMC of course, especially if they try to find the one rule that fits for all (to differ between circulating and total supply).  And like in some other projects that have different economical designs than Cryptocurrencies, that can lead to some controversy. Some are critical because the total valuation of Lykke is higher than how it is calculated on CMC with circulating supply, some are critical because the majority of supply is not in public hands, but I'm very sure that some also would be critical if that would be the case, because that would seem as if company and founders simply want to sell LKK fast to make money.

But while I believe Lykke's US rep went so far as to anticipate imminent US regulation in the months ahead during the online AGM (from his laptop at the airport), I view this as unsubstantiated, unprofessional and misleading. He doesn't know IF AND WHEN US regulators will give him approval. What if they do not? What is Lykke's business case then?  This is how a lot of regulators I know work: You apply for a license. They examine your application, and if they're favourable or unfavourable they'll give preliminary written feedback, which of course is market sensitive information and will be immediately released by the company in question. Then later the regulator usually - not always - follows up with a final determination granting or not granting, as the case may be.  Lykke has ""got people on it"". How we get from that to publically stating likely timeframes within periods of months I don't know - or rather I do: that's what the person promising speedy regulatory approval hopes for. What you hope for isn't likely, and shouldn't be presented to investors as such. I think Lykke's hopes of licensing is an example of this. But let's look at another example, the Winklevoss brothers ETF application. It was rejected. Then a whole lot of ""news"" outlets in the crypto space started reporting the ""news"" that the SEC will ""review"" its decision. This isn't ""news"", it's a statutory obligation the SEC must offer to ALL applicants whose applications are not frivolous.  I do not like Coindesk, Cointelegraph or whatever manipulating the true nature the situation (eg. the SEC rejection of Winklevoss' ETF) to paint a picture not really aligned to reality.

Quote from: playingpoodles on July 11, 2017, 03:32:25 AM I've been warning people for two weeks LKK was overvalued and will correct down.  Now it's down to 27 cents. Now given the altcoin sell off which I warned of has been faster and harder than I anticipated, I can see LKK shooting down below fair value, theoretically even below 10 cents, but certainly 10-15 range.  Thing is that everything is down. If you look here, it's deeply red: http://coinmarketcap.com (only 3 exceptions in the top 100).  Kind of funny is that USDT is up above $1. That shows how much money flees into Fiat.  My personal opinion is: After the hype of the last months in the whole market, that totally ignored the trouble Bitcoin is still in, this is an overreaction into the opposite direction. Unfortunately it's very rare that Crypto moves ""normal"" ;-) But whatever scenario will realize in Bitcoin, finally things move and there is potential again. Bitcoin is still the biggest ""money-mover"" that gets Fiat into the markets or pushes it out.

Now, yes, the whole market has joined in the fun. I mean, there's probably other things more overvalued than Lykke, my point is Lykke is one of the obviously overvalued coins (based on present lack of any regulatory approval and tiny userbase less than 12000).  Personally, I feel that Lykke management has a very, very high degree of control over the Lykke price because there are no limit orders, and so Lykke is the only entity taht can determine its own price - I believe that has  has been used to (manipulate OR stabilise, choose your preferred word) the LKK price and counteract the natural sell/downward pressure that exists. For example, often the system rewards purchase of LKK but penalises sale of LKK for USD - for example the more LKK you sell for USD the less USD per LKK you get, and the more LKK you buy for USD the more LKK you get per USD.  I think the manipulation to keep Lykke's price up against natural market sentiment is not going to work, there's more blood in store for LKK (and yes, like you say every other altcoin, everything except Bitcoin and USD).

You can see it in the high volume and sharp drop off, that has been temporarily leveled.  Interesting theories... But Lykke went down like others did and is simply following the market as a whole. You don't see that pattern in Bitcoin and others? Bitcoin goes down below $2200 and is above $2300 now, others also seem to find at least a temporarily base but in Lykke it's an intervention from ""Brother number one""?

Userbase growth I'd expect to continue its upward creep (though not fast enough). However regulatory approval, in particular in US states, isn't a quick or easy thing to achieve.  I think there's a degree of realism in the market now that has replaced the early exuberance when it comes to Lykke. Lykke was a great buy at 6 cents. At 41 cents, it was substantially overvalued at some $600 million plus in marketcap. To give you perspective Coinbase was talking about raising a funding round that valued itself at $1 billion http://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/bitcoin-start-up-coinbase-aims-for-1-billion-valuation.html  Coinbase in conjunction with its exchange GDAX has regulatory approval all over the place, including UK, Canada, most of EU Europe, and most or all US states (probably most not all). It has insurance for both crypto, and for US folks FDIC insurance of USD deposits.  Lykke on the other hand according to its annual report has ""a Vanuatu brokerage license"".  https://www.lykke.com/Annual_Report_2016.pdf (see page 3 and from page 19)  It is ""applying"" for lots of licenses, with keys being the US and UK. Applying for a license and having one is a very different thing. Lykke really has no licenses at this point, although they'll likely get some as time goes on, and anyway they appear to be allowing transactions without a license certainly with cryptocurrency, which they can probably get away with since everyone else is doing that. Not having any US license is a massive thing, and I'm not sure with a Swiss firm in competition with US incumbent Coinbase how enthusiastically and quickly US authorities will be in granting them licenses.  Lykke's userbase according to its recently released annual report is 11,442 users as of 1 June 2017. https://www.lykke.com/Annual_Report_2016.pdf  (Page 5).  I couldn't get exact stats out there on Coinbase, but it seems like it's got anywhere from 6 to 10 million users. https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-user-base-surges-coinbase-adds-1-mln-users-in-1-month http://www.newsbtc.com/2017/03/01/bitcoin-exchange-coinbase-surpasses-6-million-total-users/  Lykke is sitting currently at just under $480 million in total market cap (that is marketcap including coins held by founders and not in free float, which is something like 80 to 90 per cent of them).  My point is, how could Lykke possibly be worth half of Coinbase, that has 6 to 10 million users, worldwide regulatory approval, including the key US market through approval in US states when Lykke has less than 12,000 users and no real regulatory approval? (I'm not suggesting Vanuatu is not a ""real"" jurisdiction, I'm saying it's not an important one for the purposes of cryptocurrency markets).  My conclusion is it can't. That's why the price is off over 10% at 36.5 cents, but I think the price correction has only just begun. Segwit 2x will activate, and, when it does, Bitcoin will go up like crazy. No one will want to miss out on the action, they'll dump lots of things to free up liquidity to ride the ""Bitcoin has finally scaled"" wave up, they'll dump Ether, and they will certainly dump Lykke - especially early investors who are already sitting on lovely, acceptable 7x profits. I easily see a correction down to [edit, I see a larger LKK correction in light of today's altcoin route, 10 to 15 cents] in the next couple of months, which is probably closer to fair value anyway.  The big upside risks are (1) US regulatory approval and (2) substantial userbase growth. The big downside risks are (1) rejection or delay of US regulatory approval (2) Bitcoin scales and everyone dumps everything including Lykke to buy it.",False

I especially agree with your last conclusions about potentials and risks, because a lot will be about regulations. At the same time: Lykke is pretty much ahead when it's about that topic and may have some advantage over competing projects with similar goals.   In general, value and how people evaluate ""something"" (not only Investments) is one of the most interesting topics in my opinion - and what I believe: There is nothing objective to find. Out of individual perspective it's very personal, in last consequence it's about personal and subjective interpretations of informations that have a context nobody is able to fully overlook, plus the context of an individual situation. It's about beliefs. In short: Nobody is able to have all informations and nobody is able to interpret any information he has other than subjective. Individual decisions are significantly based on 1) personal beliefs and 2) the absence of informations.    And then there is the sum of individual views and decisions, the collective, the market(s). And that is a feedback-system: Individuals react on collective expressions (buying, selling, communicating) but the collective (part of) also reacts on individual decisions (whenever a ""whale"" shows his financial power the rumors start, and whenever a ""VIP"" communicates own opinions it has influence).  In the end it's very much about time. Moments form facts, everything else is subjective. That leads into the paradox that it would be possible to say that a price at a certain point in time is objective, because it is a fact. It's also possible to say that there is absolutely nothing objective because what has lead to it, in time, are 100% individual and subjective decisions while no participant is able to see the full picture. But many, maybe even a majority, tend to objectify collective agreements, especially if the time-frame is long enough.    When it's about Lykke and Blockchain-projects: Of course one can analyze a project, also compare it with others and it's possible to find facts about the status quo. Those facts are basically the results of the decisions of those who build a project. In my opinion, when it's about value and potential, it's very much about the teams behind. The same idea wouldn't be worth $10 if I would start it with some friends. But if the team behind Lykke should be able to develop the platform how it is meant to be, and of course that will always be an ongoing process, it might become a multi-billion-dollar project.  And nobody has ever bought anything else than future potential.   Btw, the question about Bitcoin and 1) what the result of the current controversy might be in time and 2) how it will effect other markets, is also very interesting and very complex. I consider 1 as nearly totally unclear. I only believe that there will be a lot of volatility because I don't believe that there will be something like a safe status quo anytime soon. But if something like a best-case-scenario should realize, new and more potential for the whole ecosystem and the price goes up etc.: Sure, it's possible that many would sell other Crypto-assets for Bitcoin. But what also should be taken into consideration: More people would be attracted and more money would flow into the whole ecosystem. A strong Bitcoin and a rising price of Bitcoin would be helpful for Lykke, also because even if Lykke is far from being fully developed, there is one fact: It's already pretty good to buy Bitcoin.

If you compare:  1) Ripple and Lykke - of course Ripple is worth more, already very successful and indeed banks are obviously interested. 2) XRP and LKK - what exactly is the connection between Ripple and the currency?  I know that for LKK: It represents ownership - 100% of the supply is 100% Lykke. But I have no idea why XRP should be at a billion-dollar valuation, I don't even know for what it's needed and the Ripple-team didn't care much about it. I also don't believe that Ripple as company is already worth $25 billions.  And no, I also don't want to say that Lykke, the status quo, is already worth $425 millions. But if Lykke should become successful it could be 1) much more interesting and valuable than Ripple and 2) like already said: LKK is directly connected to the value of the company.   Value of blockchain-projects in general: There is no project that is not overvalued if we focus on the status quo. There is no project that already could be seen as kind of established. At the same time it's also true that this space has huge potential in general.   Quote Why not compare it to Bitcoin that's worth over 40 billion, or ether's 25 billion? Why not compare it to Amazon with 300 billion or whatever it's worth? Because the only reason to do this is your reason and that is that you are an LKK holder and you want to instill irrational exuberance to make Lykke's price inflate beyond fair value.  I know that's not a reply on my post, but it's an interesting point: Of course it's part of the game that those who are invested write more positive and those who are not more into the other direction. But the question about valuation and what is rational or not is not that easy to reply on. I'll give you my favorite example: Factom. In Factom it's possible to calculate what the price of 1 FCT should be, because whenever Entry Credits (necessary to use the system) are bought, Factoids are burned. Once Factom will be fully developed one could say: The price of 1 FCT should be at least at a level that not more Factoids are burned than new created over the protocol. The price is at $25 right now and that is totally overvalued if we focus on the status quo. It already was overvalued when it was $2.5. Was it irrational to buy it at $2.5? Obviously not. Is it irrational to buy it at $25? That question can't be answered because it will depend on the future and if I wouldn't be invested in Factom I would buy, because the possibility that Factom will be used for billions of entries per month or maybe even per day at some point is absolutely there.  Same is true for pretty much all projects. If they should fail they are very overvalued. Those projects that will succeed are most likely not. And measured on the status quo - I know of no project that would not be overvalued.   Quote Sorry to tell you, that's already happened, which was my point. Could it rise on further irrational exuberance? Of course that's always possible. That's not happening now, LKK continues a slow decline. (It can't decline fast, because Lykke is its only market for itself and doesn't allow limit orders).  Limit orders would mean that there are more orders on both sides, more buy-support included. To say that Lykke couldn't be dumped because users can't set limit orders yet is not correct. Of course the price could fall hard if a big Investor would sell 100% in one moment.  Regarding price-decline: We have seen a hype over the last months that had impact on pretty much all projects. I've seen pumps of projects that are not even in development anymore, ""walking deads"". LKK moves a little bit slower, is not that ""over-sensitive"" like others, but of course: also LKK was bought up and corrects now.  I believe one important aspect is the Bitcoin-situation that brings some uncertainty into the whole market - Bitcoin might have more up-potential if things go right but also the opposite if a bad-case-scenario should realize. And most of the newcomers, who came into this space because the ongoing hype attracted them, bought high. It's natural that they are highly uncertain now because 1) they bought high and 2) they can't overlook the situation.   Quote   My point is when an asset's price is grossly in excess of its proven value the downside risks magnify. An idea, a Vanuatu brokerage license, 11,442 users and a nice iPhone and Android app don't make something worth $460 million (last time I looked, LKK has probably gone down since then).  To imply that there would be something like a ""proven value"" anywhere in this space is not right. If I should be wrong, it should be possible to point on a blockchain-project and say ""yes, that is already worth it's valuation"".  Regarding 11k users: That's the status of early june and has doubled since. The vanatu-license is only the beginning. In my opinion it's never about the status quo at all but about the question if the tendency is positive, basically about the questions:  1) what is planned for the project? 2) can those plans be seen as high potential? 3) do I believe the team behind is able to deliver?  And everybody has to come to own conclusions, but in my opinion it's yes yes yes. If the team delivers and builds a platform how Lykke is meant to be in future, we are talking about a billion-dollar-company  - all risks included of course, like in all projects. Nothing is safe and I'm still the opinion that there is nothing objective to find.",False

There is the perspective on the status quo, what I said in my last two posts, and then yes: it's valued too high. But also important: I don't know of any blockchain-project that is not overvalued if only focused on the status quo.  More realistic and also more rational in my opinion is to focus on the question of future-potential. And of course that is about the question if the concept of Lykke has potential as profitable usecase, and if the team has all what's needed to realize it. I believe yes, but of course we are not speaking about facts. Investing is about anticipating the future.  If we focus on the market-situation right now: I don't think that it's possible to predict short-term moves and that is also very connected to the whole situation in this space, especially Bitcoin is likely to be a rollercoaster until the situation becomes more predictable again (in whatever way, split-scenario included) and of course that will/would have impact on all markets. It already has impact - high volatility and uncertainty on all markets that have some volume.

Yes, absolutely right. Not everything is totally under control of the team and even if: Since everything is new, all teams have to learn a lot. But if a team is good, the unknowns are mainly about time-frames.  I'm not that uncertain about the question if it will be possible to get the necessary licenses because that doesn't seem to be that much about conflicting interests in general. Countries want to regulate, even if there is no clear path yet.  What is not the case is your impression that Lykke would act as if there already would be regulatory approval. US-citizen can't even download the App for example. Or Margin Trading: It's in demo-mode for most countries.  Again the most interesting question is how to look at limitations like that. One could say: Lykke is still very limited. Technically it's far from being finished (no limit orders yet, no web-based-terminal etc.) and regarding the regulatory status it's the same. Especially users could say ""Lykke is not that attractive until now if compared with other exchanges"" and I'm sure that many see it that way. At the same time it's already pretty nice to buy Bitcoin or ETH for example.  What would be a rational perspective of somebody who thinks about the question if LKK is a buy? My approach always was and still is not to overrate current limitations, but to find an answer on the question if I believe that current limitations will be overcome in future, because if yes: It's pure potential. That becomes obvious if we see it the other way around: If Lykke already would be fully developed, already would have all necessary licenses, but still only 20k users - something would be wrong then.  And sure, the question about future potential is about anticipation. That is why I always focus on teams, on the question if the people behind have everything what's needed. In case of Lykke:  - If Lykke gets all needed licenses, especially that is huge potential - If Lykke releases limit orders - it already will make the whole platform much more attractive. - If Lykke releases the web-based-terminal - same - If Lykke adds more wanted assets - same - If Lykke releases the debit card - same - If Lykke is able to connect into the existing financial system - same  ...and so on.

And I've done this here and on reddit. And if you read my previous explanations here and on reddit and this post of you: You can only continue this way by ignoring pretty much everything what I've explained and that is what you do. You want to place your message with a megaphone and you don't want to get answers on questions. You want to state your personal assumptions as facts and it's not that much of a secret that you want to convince others to share your very personal view.  In the beginning I didn't agree with you but I understand that you, and maybe also others, might have questions, maybe even be concerned. But you are the only one who makes such a drama out of the website coinmarketcap.com, that you call ""industry standard"" (what is kind of funny, isn't it?) and you are the only one who tries to attack that hard with a focus on integrity and credibility and the paradox is: You make moves here that are very dishonest, manipulative attempts and you can keep on with that, but pretty much everything also tells a story about yourself.   Quote   Olsen has made a bold move and its a high risk move. He is doing it to correct a mistake because he even says so...      1) That can be your personal conclusions, but it wouldn't be bad to word it that way 2) Arguments are missing 3) If you claim that Richard Olsen ""says so"" you should be able to quote where he exactly says that. Is that possible?    Quote   Here is the statement from Olsen:  Quote Thank you for all the comments about the valuation of Lykke.  Coinmarketcap computes the market capitalization of Lykke based on the coins that are held in the trading wallets and does not include the coins held in other wallets. When Lykke was founded and started the first rounds of fund raising, the coins were issued to other wallets, because the trading wallet was not yet developed. In June we will move all the Lykke coins to the trading wallet. If the price of LKK does not change and remains at 0.374716 USD the total market capitalisation will jump to 481,772,471 USD.  Every buyer of LKK needs to be aware that the Lykke project is high risk – we are reinventing finance and build an emergent organization that is inspired by the principles employed by nature and where all the software and knowledge is open source. We will make mistakes and these mistakes can be costly, so there is risk and any investor should only buy LKK, if he can afford to lose his money.  Last question again: Does he say that he is doing that to correct a mistake?   Interesting is that you ask questions and then you give the answers yourself - what does that tell me about you? ;-)    I'll quote them together - your questions, your answers:  Quote 1. Why is he talking about a jump if the market cap is already $481mn?  1. Its because the market cap isnt $481mn..its $50-60mn, according to the calculations agreed between Olsen and coinmarketcap.   He refers only to coinmarketcap.com and that also was the context of the discussion. And I've explained over and over again that also coinmarketcap.com changed over time. Maybe you don't know that, since your account is pretty ""fresh"". But what always was displayed as well is the total supply. That was never hidden, Lykke has never made a secret out of anything but it was explained before how it is calculated and one consequence is: If LKK are moved out of the trading-section, the number goes down and the other way around. Actually that's not that bad, it can be an interesting indicator. But if people don't know that they wonder why both charts (price and circulating supply) may not correlate in certain situations. Or to be more precise: It needs the information how it is done to recognize that it's not that bad. But because not everybody is good enough informed (not meant critical) it can lead to questions of course.  But most important to know are some infos and explanations, I've already given you here and on reddit - but you didn't pay any attention!      Quote 2. Why is he saying lykke is a high risk investment?  2. Its because he's making a high risk move  He said several times that Lykke is a high risk investment, independently of this super important coinmarketcap-site. What you try here is to turn his openness and honesty against him.    Quote 3. Why is he saying they will make mistakes along the way?  3. Its because he's correcting a mistake  Same here - again you try to use something against him that is in fact a quality: Honesty! He does not try to hype Lykke. He does not try to paint a perfect picture of Lykke. He simply reminds about a fact: Nothing and nobody is perfect.    Quote This is from his own words....he has said the valuation would be jumping, that there is high risk, and they will make mistakes.  Please don't forget that the first part is only about coinmarketcap.com. Please don't forget that he said that an investment in Lykke is high risk before. It's a startup in a high risk sector. Please don't forget that Lykke is built by humans and if you know any human without making mistakes, let me know. If you know any company that didn't do mistakes let me know. But you also said that he said it was a mistake how it was done on coinmarketcap before - and that is not true.     Quote It is circulating supply which matters and this is what was agreed between Olsen and coinmarketcap to agree the valuation..  But what is the circulating supply? Lykke is transparent about last crowdfundings and about the distribution and about all important numbers. Pretty soon they will publish an actualized financial report. But also this one from February gives a lot of infos:  INFORMATION BROCHURE FOR COINHOLDERS FEBRUARY 2017 https://forward.lykke.com/files/Memorandum.pdf  What is important to understand: Lykke has sold LKK to Investors. Instead of doing one hyped up monster-crowdfunding like some other projects, Lykke has done smaller sales without much advertising and PR. And those LKK's are obviously circulating supply. But there are also founders and team-members and the company itself. Nothing of that is locked up. Lykke is meant to be flexible and maybe you and maybe also some others would prefer some kind of ""lock-up"" of supply - but those who would need something like that to have enough trust will stay away anyway.    Quote The way to resolve the issue with the market cap would be one of 2 ways:  a) Declare that pre-investors would have their coins in a separate wallet from the circulating supply system, to avoid confusing the figures. This is taking the XRP and Ripple route by keeping pre-investor coins separately to avoid flooding the system, and would protect the current price and market cap (the $50-60mn one). Flooding the system doesnt mean there would be big sell orders. Flooding the system means changing the circulating supply unnecessarily to inflate the agreed market cap valuation.  This was the initial route which Olsen took. The circulating supply of coins bought on the exchange is what counted towards the market cap - which is why the agreement was made between Olsen and coinmarketcap. Otherwise why not just make all the coins - the full 100% count to the market cap from the start?  Why did Olsen not add all the coins into the market cap at the start then? Why was the agreement not made for this? Its a mute point to say just because the coins weren't on the trading wallet, that they shouldn't contribute if that's the argument someone wants to make.    Somebody like you could attack both whenever he wants. You can be critical about how it was done in the past. You can be critical about how it will be done in the future. And in fact you are.  I tell you what you could have done: Due diligence and getting your informations directly from Lykke. It's all there. And it's possible to ask questions. It's possible right here, on reddit, on two chats and even directly per mail. But you don't ask and if you ask you give the answers yourself.  And really, it's kind of interesting that you come up with that again and again but you ignore all explanations I've given before.   Quote The answer is it was an intentional decision to not add all the coins into the market cap. The private pre-investor coins weren't supposed to be part of the circulating supply to influence the public market cap.  b) The 2nd route is putting all the coins into the trading wallet so that all the coins are counted in the valuation figure. This is the route that Olsen has taken, which means its a U-turn. He made a mistake to say only the coins bought on the exchange should count to the market cap. To correct this mistake and to end any debate about the valuation, this move is being taken. It creates transparency and stability for the long term.  And again: It is up to anybody personally what one prefers. And also again: Coinmarketcap also changed how they display such things. For them it's not easy to find the best way that fits for all projects. But the total supply was always displayed there. And Lykke has shown transparency about numbers all the time.   Quote He is saying lykke is high risk because he's making a high risk move. Nobody knows what will happen when the valuation jumps to $481mn in his own words and because of this u-turn...It could fall, it could rise etc.  What you try is called spreading FUD. ""Oh no! Nobody knows what will happen! It's a high risk move!""  But no, he is not saying that Lykke is high risk because of that. Lykke is high risk anyway. Find a project that is not high risk. Find any investment that is not high risk. Oil maybe.   Quote A change in valuation also means my ROI will be less. There is less growth % when the market cap is 500mn than if its 50-69mn , making it unattractive to many investors.  You criticise that it would have been misleading in the past but now you are critical that it might not be misleading enough in future and your ROI would be less because of that. That's the whole point, isn't it? You haven't done due diligence but believed that only a fraction of LKK is free and the rest can't be moved and is locked up. And thing is: Technically that is not the case. Practically you can think about how likely it is that founders and company will act less carefully with the market than they've done it in the past.  Thing is: I know how you really think - you only think about what other Investors might think and if an obvious high valuation might deter Investors who also don't do due diligence. Right or right?      Quote -----  The breach of trust thing is because the initial idea was for the coins bought on the exchange to be the circulating supply, and this was the basis for the market cap figure in coinmarketcap. The pre-investor coins weren't supposed to be on the circulating supply at all. I honestly dont think Olsen is stupid enough to make a schoolboy error in not including the pre-investor coins in the circulating supply. It was INTENTIONAL to not include the pre-investor coins in the circulating supply initially because those are private coins linked to an internal valuation of the company.  Olsen is smart...the pre-investor coins weren't supposed to be in the circulating supply, which is why he didnt include them at the start. The reason they're doing it now is because Olsen believes the market cap figure is misleading (hence the debate on reddit and previously in this thread). He has done a U-turn to create transparency for the market cap figures and to end the market cap debate once and for all.  Please decide what you want to be critical about. I've already explained that it's not that simple to find the best solution that makes everybody happy, is precise and fits to how coinmarketcap.com handles such things.  But actually it is simple: If somebody believes in the potential of this project he might consider it as a buy. And the question if this has potential is the question if the people behind are able to build this and also will act carefully on the market. Those who believe that founders and team are dishonest and only want to make a quick buck: Don't buy.  You've made your decision and I respect that. What I don't respect are your megaphon-attempts to spread your manipulative attempts.    Quote My investment in Lykke was based on the understanding of circulating supply and visible market cap being just the LKK bought on the exchange, and that the pre-investor coins bought wouldn't contribute to the public market cap (not the internal valuation which is different). We saw that Olsen made the agreement with coinmarketcap to include just the exchange bought LKK...so my understanding was correct. Now though hes adding the pre-investor coins into the circulating supply, which is doing a U-turn. That to me makes this investment a lot less attractive.  It doesnt matter if the market hasn't reacted...it just means to me Ive sold my LKK and there's much better investments out there. The higher valuation (if it holds) is very off putting. I can make a higher ROI on smaller techs with a lower valuation.   My suggestion would be always to do due diligence. If you feel misleaded about how it was done in the past I can tell you: Read this thread and you'll find out that it was explained and I've replied on all questions about it and others as well. Same on reddit. Sergey and others did that on telegram and slack. There is also a blog-post in which it is explained that also gives a lot of additional informations and tips how to get interesting informations. Nothing was ever hidden.",False

Of course Olsen isnt going to directly say he's correcting a mistake - that would be stupid of him to do. If you're expecting that from him then I would be asking serious questions about you and what you actually know about the basics of positioning  He is alluding to the mistake by talking about it...its called positioning to put a positioned spin on the situation whilst maintaining a professional attitude.   Last question again: Does he say that he is doing that to correct a mistake?  Interesting is that you ask questions and then you give the answers yourself - what does that tell me about you? ;-)  Yes, he is alluding to saying he's correcting a mistake...its called positioning - something that you aren't understanding because sorry, I can see you lack the ability to ""read between the lines"". No offence intended. Nobody is going to go out and say he made a mistake..that would be suicide for him to do.   He refers only to coinmarketcap.com and that also was the context of the discussion.

But most important to know are some infos and explanations, I've already given you here and on reddit - but you didn't pay any attention!  This is confusing the issue. Lykke coins being or not being in the trading wallet shouldn't affect the market cap. This is called playing games with the system and making a mockery out of it, thinking Lykke can just make up the rules for itself as it goes along  Yes, the market cap counting all the coins wasnt hidden...so why is Olsen only wanting the circulating supply to display a lower market cap on coinmarketcap?? You have literally no answer to that whatsoever.  I am just putting that in red to emphasis it. The full total supply market cap is well known, so why does Olsen put only the circulating supply and agree with the industry-leading coinmarketcap to show a lower valuation?  You are digging a bigger hole for yourself with this...those are the FACTS of the situation..total facts.   He said several times that Lykke is a high risk investment, independently of this super important coinmarketcap-site. What you try here is to turn his openness and honesty against him.  You're missing the point completely. He is talking about a chain of thought of related themes...all which are relevant to each other within the context of the post.  He's saying its high risk because he's just made a high risk move. If you aren't intelligent enough to notice this then that's something you'll need to deal with yourself, its nothing to do with me.   Same here - again you try to use something against him that is in fact a quality: Honesty! He does not try to hype Lykke. He does not try to paint a perfect picture of Lykke. He simply reminds about a fact: Nothing and nobody is perfect.  You are getting massively confused here. Nobody is saying Olsen is dishonest or that honesty is in question here.  He is saying those things to maintain a professional attitude to the mistake that has been made. Otherwise why is there such a big question about the valuation of lykke?? Why do other coins not have this issue? (and please dont point out specific cases of coins where there are issues..im talking about the overall general market. Most coins and techs dont have these glaring massive issues with their valuations due to technicalities)  Olsen is making the mistake that XRP and ripple have managed to avoid. By ripple and XRP declaring that their held-XRP won't be added to the free market, they have given investors assurance. On the flip side, Olsen is flooding his coins onto the market in an attempt to resolve valuation issues, whilst the technology is still at an early stage. Though better for the lykke project long term, this isnt an investor assuring move.   Please don't forget that the first part is only about coinmarketcap.com. Please don't forget that he said that an investment in Lykke is high risk before. It's a startup in a high risk sector. Please don't forget that Lykke is built by humans and if you know any human without making mistakes, let me know. If you know any company that didn't do mistakes let me know. But you also said that he said it was a mistake how it was done on coinmarketcap before - and that is not true.  Sorry, but it appears you dont understand why he's talking about mistakes in that context. You are lacking perspicacity and an ability to read what is really meant by statements. You are lacking the ability to understand positioning.   But what is the circulating supply? Lykke is transparent about last crowdfundings and about the distribution and about all important numbers. Pretty soon they will publish an actualized financial report. But also this one from February gives a lot of infos:  INFORMATION BROCHURE FOR COINHOLDERS FEBRUARY 2017 https://forward.lykke.com/files/Memorandum.pdf  What is important to understand: Lykke has sold LKK to Investors.

Lykke is meant to be flexible and maybe you and maybe also some others would prefer some kind of ""lock-up"" of supply - but those who would need something like that to have enough trust will stay away anyway.  Well...you tell me what the circulating supply is...its what Lykke is playing about with to show a lower valuation in coinmarketcap!!  By playing games with the circulating supply and saying one coin counts and another doesn't...its causing clear issues with understanding and calculating the valuation.   Somebody like you could attack both whenever he wants. You can be critical about how it was done in the past. You can be critical about how it will be done in the future. And in fact you are.  I tell you what you could have done: Due diligence and getting your informations directly from Lykke. It's all there. And it's possible to ask questions.

Im not here to attack - im here to make money and maximise my ROI - Olsen has made a move that will reduce my ROI and so I've sold my LKK...simple as that.   What you try is called spreading FUD. ""Oh no! Nobody knows what will happen! It's a high risk move!""  But no, he is not saying that Lykke is high risk because of that. Lykke is high risk anyway. Find a project that is not high risk. Find any investment that is not high risk. Oil maybe.  As I've said you aren't able to read what's really written there and why things are being said in that particular context. Its clearer than daylight, which tells me you aren't in the same league as me, sorry to say.   You criticise that it would have been misleading in the past but now you are critical that it might not be misleading enough in future and your ROI would be less because of that. That's the whole point, isn't it? You haven't done due diligence but believed that only a fraction of LKK is free and the rest can't be moved and is locked up. And thing is: Technically that is not the case. Practically you can think about how likely it is that founders and company will act less carefully with the market than they've done it in the past.  You're getting confused here. In simple terms, the transparency could be better and Olsen realises this. By putting all the coins into the circulating supply, he is making an attempt to end the debate on the valuation   Thing is: I know how you really think - you only think about what other Investors might think and if an obvious high valuation might deter Investors who also don't do due diligence. Right or right?  I take into account a lot of things when investing, and how the market perceives a technology is obviously something I consider as well. That's not the only thing I consider though...   Please decide what you want to be critical about. I've already explained that it's not that simple to find the best solution that makes everybody happy, is precise and fits to how coinmarketcap.com handles such things.  Its simple. A) Put all your coins into the circulating supply at the very start and declare that as the contributor to your market cap or B) Say the 90% coins won't be put into the circulating supply and will be managed separately. All issues are solved there and then.  There is literally no complex issue or ""we can't make everyone happy"" problem here at all.  All of these issues are lykke's own making because its playing technical games with its valuation. Its simply made up its own rules as its gone along and now has changed it again.   But actually it is simple: If somebody believes in the potential of this project he might consider it as a buy. And the question if this has potential is the question if the people behind are able to build this and also will act carefully on the market. Those who believe that founders and team are dishonest and only want to make a quick buck: Don't buy.  You've made your decision and I respect that. What I don't respect are your megaphon-attempts to spread your manipulative attempts.  I believe lykke ultimately will be very successful. However what Im interested in is my ROI. My ROI has been decreased because of this move and so it's been time for me to sell. Simple as that. If you didnt understand it, you need more investing experience, end of story.   My suggestion would be always to do due diligence. If you feel misleaded about how it was done in the past I can tell you: Read this thread and you'll find out that it was explained and I've replied on all questions about it and others as well.

My suggestion to you is you need more investing experience with higher ROIs and an ability to understand positioning.    I've done a lot of due diligence on lykke and have been following this whole thread for a very long time. Olsen has made a move which reduces my ROI and so I've sold. End of story.  As for nothing being hidden, answer to me again why a smaller and wrong market cap is showing in coinmarketcap? That is hiding the true valuation right there. Why show a lower market cap there if its not the rightful market cap?",False

Your passive aggressive nature (""I'll be brief because I'm too busy"") and comment on my lack of deeper analysis isn't really healthy for discussion either.  Anyway, it seems to me you actually don't hang out on Reddit or Slack enough. Olsen does take the time to reply to our questions, and he also shares general finance stuff from time to time. Of course, to you all of this is calculated and not random.  Lykke has been mentioned a few times now that it's a high-risk investment. This is a common sentiment shared by most of the investors (at least on Slack anyway). Why will Richard Olsen mention it again? To me it's just a reminder.

That they honestly and intentionally did what they did?  Either way, you have also admitted that you're reading between the lines. So what makes you right and everyone else wrong? For one, we can all agree to disagree but you have to result to insults and telling people who take their time t respond to you that they're taking up space. Or that they are not in the same league as you.  Actually what are you trying to achieve here? What is it that you're trying to tell us? Your solution is not feasible because that would mean Lykke's own coins will either always be in private or always be in trading. Any change that Lykke makes will piss you off it seems, cause it doesn't align with your deep calculations.  A little humility will do you good. Also it's somewhat troll behaviour for you to raise your concerns but simply disregard everyone else's when they share their point of view.",False

Something like an overview about the Coinmarketcap-controversy to put things into perspective:   When Lykke was started and LKK was distributed to founders and Seed-Investors and Lykke as a company, the App was yet to release. And when it was released it didn't include the trading-section. This was about one year ago in June 2016:  ""Lykke, a Swiss fintech startup building a blockchain marketplace, has released a beta version of its cryptocurrency wallet app for iOS mobile devices. Some features included in the wallet are: tracking asset prices in real time for FX, BTC and colored coins; checking balances, transaction history and blockchain details at a glance; depositing and withdrawing bitcoins via QR code with no fees; and remotely disabling access if the phone is lost or stolen."" http://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/exchange/oandas-richard-olsen-launches-lykke-wallet-for-ios-devices/   During September/October 2016 there was the ICO which ended with these numbers:  ""Lykke, a Swiss Fintech company building a global blockchain-powered marketplace, concluded its initial coin offering (ICO) at midnight, October 11th, with the sale of 23,226,753 coins, raising 1,161,338 CHF."" https://www.lykke.com/company/news/blockchain_powered_exchange   When Lykke was added to Coinmarketcap some time after the ICO, the number of 30 million LKK was displayed as ""marketcap"". If Lykke would have said: Total supply = marketcap it would have been incorrect and misleading, because while the supply in hands of seed-Investors, founders and Lykke as a company is technically not locked up, it's also not on the market like the supply of public Investors.   Coinmarketcap later changed it's procedure and displays ""circulating supply"" since. And that is connected to the trading-section. The advantage is that it's very flexible and can be an interesting indicator. If LKK is moved from private or coinprism-wallets into the trading-section the number goes up and the other way around.  But one disadvantage is of course that it doesn't necessarily correlate with the price. It is possible that a lot of LKK's are bought and the price goes up, and if the supply then is moved into private the number of ""circulating supply"" goes down. Since many read ""circulating supply"" as ""marketcap"" it also can lead to a distorted impression about the total value of Lykke.  What is important to understand: Coinmarketcap lists hundreds of different projects that are very different by design. The site once was designed to display Cryptocurrencies with a fixed ""payout"" per day (mining or staking) like Bitcoin. But others have sold a fix number in an ICO that raises over time because of the protocol. Others have put a percentage of Coins on the market while a majority of supply is held by the teams and they use it to pay for development and so on. Under the line it differs a lot what is displayed on that site and there is no way for them to find the one perfect procedure to be totally correct for all of those projects. Factom for example sold 50% of the total supply to the public while 100% is displayed as circulating supply. That is also not really correct because the supply held by Factom-Foundation is not on the market. Sometimes that is used to attack Factom as well. And in Factom's case that number even goes down because the more it is used the more Factoids are burned while there is no inflation yet (also not fully developed) - very confusing for those who don't know the project but look at the numbers.   And Lykke moves supply into the trading wallets so it will be displayed as ""circulating supply"". At the same time that will also not be totally correct because founders and company and also those who invested very early won't simply sell. But it will give a more precise picture of the total value of Lykke.  And just btw, one advantage will also be that Lykke will go up in that list and become more visible.   My favorite site is https://bravenewcoin.com/lykke#Trading-Pairs, because it's much more precise regarding the chart. One can move over it and it shows different pairs and the volume per Currency etc. Regarding supply they keep it simple and display Total supply * price = marketcap.   Important is also: Moving supply does not mean that it will simply be sold. Founders and company, team-members and seed-Investors have zero interest to damage the price and the valuation of Lykke. And they've always been transparent!  This document of February gives a lot of details about the company, supply and distribution:  INFORMATION BROCHURE FOR COINHOLDERS FEBRUARY 2017 https://forward.lykke.com/files/Memorandum.pdf   This blog-post of april gives a lot of informations and useful tips how to get informations and how to read the Blockchain-Explorer:  Why does Lykke Coin price go up? https://www.lykke.com/city/blog/why_does_lykke_coin_price_go_up   This is the Asset ID: https://blockchainexplorer.lykke.com/asset/AXkedGbAH1XGDpAypVzA5eyjegX4FaCnvM  It shows a list of Shareholders, distribution and even makes it possible to get informations about the past. One can click on the date and type in a past date and it will show how it was at that time. The number of Coinholders is 3992 right now. 30 days back it was 1834.  That's an increase of 117% in just 30 days and it's accelerating what is also an aspect why the price went up like it did.   That said: Lykke will keep on being transparent. A new financial report will be published soon. I haven't seen it yet but I have no doubt that it also will include all necessary details.",False

Coins that are locked, reserved, or not able to be sold on the public market are coins that can't affect the price and thus should not be allowed to affect the market capitalization as well. The method of using the Circulating Supply is analogous to the method of using public float for determining the market capitalization of companies in traditional investing.""  Lykke is making up its own rules about market capitalisation and trying to apply them to the market. That's because Lykke isn't operating under the free market and so its valuation is bogus.  A true valuation and free market is where buyers meet sellers. Buyers set a price, and sellers set their price, and where the meeting happens between them is what sets the actual price of the token. This isn't happening with Lykke at all. People can't even set limit orders!  You can see very clearly on reddit and even on here that many people are saying the valuation is bogus - you should take that on board. Olsen has taken that on board and what's why he's moving the 90% pre-investor coins into the trading wallet.  Lykke attempting to dictate its valuation to the market has had the market pushing back. Therefore Olsen is moving towards greater transparency to try and solve the valuation issues.  Last point is..Olsen made an AGREEMENT with coinmarketcap that this is how the valuation would be done for Lykke. There is a meeting of the minds there so Olsen is complicit in this. If Olsen thought the valuation was completely wrong, he doesn't have to agree with coinmarketcap at all. He has agreed, but now he's attempting to change the valuation by moving the pre-investor coins into the trading wallet lol  Anyone who has been in crypto long enough knows this is called flooding the market. Its an attempt to game the market capitalisation by increasing the circulating supply of coins.

I personally don't even get why it has so much meaning for you.  2) That site makes ""agreements"" with all projects. Most likely they simply ask what might be best. And in no way it can be precise for all projects and all times.  3) It's not possible yet to set limit orders on Lykke, because Lykke is a project that is not finished yet but under development, like other projects in this space. No project is totally ready, not even the father of all: Bitcoin.  4) But Lykke also doesn't make it's own rules, it wouldn't even be possible to do that. Potential Investors make decisions to buy at a certain price or to stay away. Those who already are invested make decisions if to sell or to hold. If Lykke wouldn't care about that but set the price too high nobody would buy anymore. If Lykke would set the price too low it would be bought out and they have zero interest to sell ownership at discount.  5) Of course one can say that the valuation is too high. But that question is not that much about the status quo but about future potential. Those who believe that Lykke has the chance to become a billion-company, and I believe that, won't say that it's expensive now. Another part of the story is the context: Please show me one project that is at a valuation that couldn't be seen as overvalued at this point of time.  - Ripple is at $10 billion, only what is on the market. And XRP is not like LKK, not a share of the company. At the same time the company holds billions of it, in Dollar. It's just a bridge-currency and nobody seems to know why it needs to exist. The decision to lock up supply was made 1 month ago and years after Ripple was started in 2014.  Ripple Pledges to Lock Up $14 Billion in XRP Cryptocurrency - May 16, 2017 http://www.coindesk.com/ripple-pledges-lock-14-billion-xrp-cryptocurrency/   - Bitshares is at $796,550,979  - Monero ist at > $600 million  -  Augur is at $319,358,600 and is a smart contract  - Waves is at $502,451,000 (a decentralized exchange running on an own blockchain - that has pro's but also some con's)   ...to give only a few examples. If you believe that all those projects are valued in any way objective but Lykke is not - maybe think about it.    And to say this:  ""Anyone who has been in crypto long enough knows this is called flooding the market. Its an attempt to game the market capitalisation by increasing the circulating supply of coins.""  ...is interesting in a lot of ways:  1. How long are you in Crypto? Your account is pretty fresh (April 14, 2017). I'm long enough in this to know these kind of games. Of course you are not new. So, please let us know more about your intentions to use a newbie-account and to use a megaphone here and on reddit. There is nothing wrong to express concerns and critique, to ask questions and so on. But to attack how you do it, to confuse things intentionally, to misquote and to act so dishonest - that tells a story.   2. Moving supply that was distributed before the App even existed is not ""flooding the market"". If they would want that they could have done that in the past. If they would have intention to act dishonest they wouldn't speak about it openly and be that transparent as they are.  See, that is what makes me personally really angry. You try to use Richard Olsen's honesty against him and the team. They've always shown transparency, replied on all questions, they are working all the time as if they don't need any sleep. They give their best to be in touch with Investors and Users - and you are very engaged in your attempt to turn that all against them.

If Lykke would have started on other exchanges I believe that it would have pumped and dumped over and over again. People call it a free market and that is not wrong, but manipulation is part of the game, especially on Poloniex. That's one reason why LKK started on Lykke. Another reason is that it leads to a better base - those who invest in LKK-shares on Lykke are likely to be real Investors who care about the project instead of being short-term-gamblers with the trollbox as only source for ""informations"".  That said: It is planned to get LKK on other exchanges as well. Advantage would be a more of attention and it also would avoid theories about Lykke being too dominant.

The remainder 90% were already purchased / owned by the founders, angel investors, etc. who originally funded the project. Their shares were never on the market to begin with, so private wallet / trading wallet for them is irrelevant, as their stakes were locked as per shareholder agreement.

And there is no real difference for the market. It won't be simply dumped what also wouldn't make any sense because it would be dumped into Lykke-Buy-Orders since User-limit-orders are not possible until now. There also won't be a super-huge-sell-wall.   Quote Which tells me that the project will be overvalued in many people's eyes (the free market), leading to a substantial drop in price  But if that should be the case, that people right now believe the valuation is below of what it really is, you should see it as a push for transparency and not the opposite. And while this move is not a secret but openly told the public and discussed by the community here and on reddit and also on Slack the price did not drop until now. I believe the reason is that the high valuation never has been a secret. I've communicated it here several times, and also on all other places (I'm Ph03n1xII on reddit btw). And the total supply is also one ""focus-info"" on all places and official documents.   Quote I am selling all my LKK immediately and will wait until the dust settles before re-buying again. There is no need to flood the market with so many coins whatsoever  That is everybodies own free choice. And sure, it is possible that some or even many Investors might be kind of scared or expecting others to be. Until now that is not the case. The price did not go down but even more up.  And I personally don't believe that this will have much impact on the price while I believe that if the price should go down it will be profit-taking, a usual price correction. But I often believed that to happen in the past and all corrections until now were pretty much short-term and the price recovered very quickly.  Quote This move isnt respecting the investors who bought LKK on the Lykke trading wallet..its making a mockery of them  See, there are early Investors who bought LKK before there the APP existed. And there never was a sell-restriction while the supply that was displayed on coinmarketcap as ""on the market"" was not precise but only displayed the ICO of Sept/Oct 2016 if I recall it correctly. Then Coinmarketcap changed it to ""circulating supply"". And in Bitcoin for example that counts all BTC that are in existence. In Ripple it counts all XRP that are not locked (Ripple as company made the decision to hold back a certain amount they control). In Lykke it's about the difference of trading wallets and the other options (private or coinprism).  If compared to Bitcoin: All LKK's are already in existence so all could counted as circulating supply If compared to Ripple: There is no such sell-restriction in Lykke. But at the same time LKK's represent ownership and founders and company will not just be carefully with that because they don't have any interest in damaging the price and the value of the company, they also have no interest to sell their ownership cheap - they founded this, they are the ones who work hard to make Lykke successful.  Out of Investor-perspective LKK has much more advantages than XRP that is just a bridge currency without much base or connection to the success of the company behind. And it's everybodies free decision, based on own conclusions, to decide if one wants to buy and to participate that way in the potential but of course, it's also putting money at risk - and that is true for all Investments. And Richard Olsen is very open about it and says:  ""Every buyer of LKK needs to be aware that the Lykke project is high risk – we are reinventing finance and build an emergent organization that is inspired by the principles employed by nature and where all the software and knowledge is open source. We will make mistakes and these mistakes can be costly, so there is risk and any investor should only buy LKK, if he can afford to lose his money.""  And that is not the first time he states that.   Quote     I believe Richard Olsen realises he made a mistake and is trying to correct it before the situation gets much worse  I believe it would be a big mistakes not to communicate it but to do it. And it would even be worth if they would do that in a hidden fashion, slowly over months and thinking Investors would be too stupid to recognize it.",False

You are forced to buy at the price that Lykke sets, which is at a premium than if limit orders were allowed.  To simply say ""limit orders aren't ready yet"" is you not understanding the actual reality of the situation.  Quote No. This is false. The market is setting the price of LKK based on the constraints of the algo bot. If nobody is buying, and people are selling, the bot will drop the spot price for buys. That's how it works.  See above..the algo bot is setting the price to help the LKK price movement. If limit orders were allowed, the LKK price wouldn't appreciate in the same way.  Quote If you don't like the way the Lykke market is currently set up with the algo trading bot. Don't buy. It's pretty clear and simple. Nobody is forcing you to.  I have sold all my LKK when olsen announced he's moving all the coins to the trading wallet and updating the market cap figures for coinmarketcap. If the valuation was $450mn+ already, he wouldn't say that the valuation of the company would move to $450mn would he?  He would say the valuation was ALREADY $450mn...he wouldn't say it would move to that!! You are busted - read what he said on reddit  Here it is:  If the price of LKK does not change and remains at 0.374716 USD the total market capitalisation will jump to 481,772,471 USD.  ^He says it will JUMP to $450mn - why doesn't he say it ALREADY IS $450mn??? Because he wasnt being transparent from the beginning and gave the wrong figures to coinmarketcap to mislead investors...that's all he's done.  Now he is attempting to correct his mistake before it's too late.  This nonsense that ""oh its not in the trading wallet! It doesnt count!"" is chronic bullshit. The coins were bought and so they have value. Coins not counting to market cap happens when you have a mineable coin..not when the coins have already been bought  Quote Uh, this isn't Lykke doing that. It's coinmarketcap. Look here at a different website that calculates correctly: https://bravenewcoin.com/market-cap/  If you have a problem with coinmarketcap, don't use it. It's coinmarketcaps problem. Again, do 5 mins research on Lykke and you'd see the error in coinmarketcaps calculation. Perhaps you can email them and get them to fix how they calculate market cap?  Wrong again. It was Richard Olsen who told coinmarketcap to only make the trading wallet coins as contributors to the total market cap.  It was a lykke decision to do this and coinmarketcap obliged.  Quote But that's not how this works. Again, your entire premise is based on the false representation given by coinmarketcap. If you have a problem, it's with them.  You haven't done your research - it was Olsen who said that only trading wallet coins should contribute to the total market cap. Otherwise why is he saying the valuation will move to $450mn+ if the price holds when the coins are moved?  Quote  Think about it this way. The other 90% of Lykke shareholders are just that, shareholders. They were not originally LKK holders but shareholders. Lykke is transitioning to an LKK holder based model. 10% of the shares of Lykke were available for sale on the Lykke exchange representated by LKK coins. The remainder 90% were already purchased / owned by the founders, angel investors, etc. who originally funded the project. Their shares were never on the market to begin with, so private wallet / trading wallet for them is irrelevant, as their stakes were locked as per shareholder agreement. You can read all about this on their website.  What matters is that the 90% coins were bought - doesn't matter if they're hidden on Mars or anywhere else..they were bought and they contribute to the market cap.  All it seems is Olsen has realised his mistake and is attempting to correct it. He should NEVER have told coinmarketcap to only include the trading wallet coins in their figures - it was misleading from the start and doesn't create investor confidence at all. Now he is attempting to correct his mistake before it's too late  He has intentionally played a clever trick not realising that everyone can see it  I have sold all my LKK yesterday - he is thinking investors are fools and he has been called out on reddit big time.",False

He has decided one thing, and then backtracking to change his mind.  The issue with that is its a breach of trust. Its like ripple and XRP making an announcement that they wont flood the market with their XRP, and then going ahead and doing it.

Now all the coins in the trading wallets on Lykke Exchange are counted dynamically as a circulating supply.""  I think Tempus posted about that in a shorter form above  Its complete and total nonsense to only use trading wallet coins in the valuation - makes no sense whatsoever.  There is something you don't get right here and I don't yet understand what it is. Please think about it out of Lykke-perspective. We can put it this way:  - They've sold LKK to the public. They know how much and they are transparent about it. And what is safe to say: That is free floating and therefore it is part of the marketcap of course.  - They own the majority of shares themselves and that was never a secret. It's also logical because Richard Olsen put the most money into Lykke, is it's biggest Investor but before all: They do all the work. LKK represents ownership and I would be concerned if they would make an attempt to sell that out at discount prices. That would also be bad for future funding and Lykke is not cheap to build, especially regulations but also all the salaries are some money.   So let's say they would have said: 100% of the supply is free floating. Would that be true? No, of course not. It's not locked up but it's also not really on the market. If they would have said that 100% is marketcap people would also be critical and assume that Lykke only gives a percentage on the market while holding the rest back to get a higher cap. And as long as coinmarketcap displayed the supply as marketcap (while the total supply always was displayed as well) the number was what was sold to the public in the ICO.  The decision to display ""circulating supply"" and to connect that with the trading wallets is more precise but it goes up and down, dependent on individual Investors. Let's say some whales move their money out of the trading and into private section - the cap would go down, or the other way around. The information given on coinmarketcap would never be really precise.  And now there is the decision to simplify that and founders and company move their LKK into the trading-section that also will prevent an up and down of the marketcap-line that might be not necessarily connected to the price.   Under the line it's simply about finding the best way under given circumstances.    Quote Olsen again lied in reddit saying they didnt have the necessary infrastructure to make the 90% coins available so thats why it previously didnt count. The issue though is that if any transaction takes place, a trade has taken place. Doesnt matter if infrastructure is there or not.    Let's take a look at what he says:  ""When Lykke was founded and started the first rounds of fund raising, the coins were issued to other wallets, because the trading wallet was not yet developed.""  I didn't know Lykke when it was started. I found it in august 2016 or so. But there was a time that Lykke already was there but without any App. I believe LKK's were managed about coinprism. That is not a lie.  And no, not all transactions are trades. A lot of transactions doesn't change the ownership-status - if I transact Bitcoin from Polo to Lykke it's also not a trade.    Quote Coins have been bought and the coins have been traded no matter what ""status"" they're in. But not all coins have been sold and they will never sell out and simply give up their ownership. It's really important to understand that LKK represents that: Shares of the company.   Quote Just because the coins are in or not in a ""trading wallet"" doesn't mean trades for all the coins haven't taken place Again - only a percentage was sold.    Quote The bottom line is: Olsen has been misleading people and it's clear here...he's trying to fix this issue and that's a good thing. I dont believe its intentional, but it is predatory for sure and has led to an unnecessary breach of trust to correct the problem.  Again: I would suggest that you state as opinion what is in fact opinion and not as fact what is only opinion. You come up here with pretty hard accusations and it's some work to reply on your rants and put things into perspective. You are free to believe whatever you believe. If you've lost trust in Lykke now I won't even try to convince you otherwise. But don't state things as fact that are no facts.     Quote No other coins have this issue with their market cap (except the dodgy coins like XRP lol), so go figure  That's not true. Two projects I'm also invested are Factom and Antshares. In Factom the total supply is counted as circulating while also a huge amount is held by the foundation and team and is in fact not really circulating. There has been critique in the past that the lower supply that is practically on the market is misleading while about 50% or something like that is not on the market. I don't know the actual numbers but their ICO was a decision about the total supply and if I recall it correctly only 50% was put on the market.  Antshares: Total supply is 100,000,000 ANS while circulating supply is stated as 50,000,000 ANS. That is precise because the team has given itself a sell-restriction until later this year. But what it needs: trust. If they would be scammers (I'm sure they are legit) there wouldn't be a way to prevent them breaking the rules.   And there are other projects as well that are not displayed precisely. There is no way to find a way that is perfect for all.        Quote ----------  Here's what Ive just posted on the reddit:  The real question is: Why would Olsen agree with coinmarketcap to only show trading wallet coins in the market cap then? There is no reason for this decision, unless the initial plan was for the 90% not to be added to the trading wallet at all. Read that again as its very significant. The initial plan was to not make the 90% get added to the trading wallet, which is why the agreement was made by coinmarketcap not to add them However because so many people are questioning the valuation and the figures showing, Olsen is more or less changing his track and his mind.  I've tried to explain the procedure above - not only Lykke has changed over time but also coinmarketcap. And yes, it is about finding the best way. But not to mislead Investors. The question is what is best to give precise informations. And again: People also would be critical if Lykke would state that the total supply = marketcap as if it would be on the market (and coinmarketcap displayed it that way in the past) it would be said: Lykke acts misleading because the marketcap gives the impression as if the whole supply would be in Investor-hands.  Since some time Coinmarketcap displays circulating supply instead of marketcap and the decision was made to connect that to the trading wallets. And that is more precise but since that can change in a short time, people are totally free to send Coins from trading to private and forth and back the circulating supply chart wouldn't be necessarily connected to the price. And now the majority of the total supply will be transferred into the trading-section and both charts will correlate in future.    Quote Whereas before the 90% coins weren't to be in the trading wallet, due to investor disgruntles he is now putting them in the trading wallet for transparency.  And that would be bad? I know that they've thought about how to do it some time ago. It's not a decision that comes up without thinking about it. Richard Olsen even talked to me on phone about it and that was in april. But let's say it only would be a reaction on feedback: Why would that be bad?  Quote He has decided one thing, and then backtracking to change his mind. Oh boy... First of all: Richard Olsen is not the ""dictator-decision-maker"" you obviously seem to see in him. Actually he is more a man who asks a lot of questions, who involves the team and even small guys like me to find the best way. And sure, it's not possible to do things perfect and make decisions that everybody will like for all times. But why are you so critical if you can see that a team tries to find the best option under changing circumstances that are not under own control and that are communicated openly and honest?    Quote The issue with that is its a breach of trust. Its like ripple and XRP making an announcement that they wont flood the market with their XRP, and then going ahead and doing it. If you believe that Lykke has the plan to sell out - sure, in that case it's understandable that you move your money out. But there is no plan to do so and it's also not announced that way and Richard Olsen didn't say that.  And just btw: There might be others who are not happy about this move while there also might be others who were not happy how it was handled before. Maybe there are more who are concerned. But until now I don't see that it's a big drama. If that would be the case the price would have been crashed because a majority of Investors would have reacted with selling. The info is out since days and you make some noise on two platforms: here and on reddit. It's not meant critical btw, I just want to say: The topic got some attention now but the price doesn't reflect the trust-issue you imply.   Quote It seems to be Olsen thinks he can do whatever he likes and people wont notice it. If he would think that he would do it without saying it, right? He does the opposite. He is totally open about it and again: He is not the only decision-maker at Lykke. That you constantly pointing fingers on him, in combination with some hard accusations, makes things already kind of wrong.   Quote Last thing: If your arguing that the 90% coins dont need to be sold, then that again means they dont need to be on the trading wallet.  But that is not what I said. Lykke sells LKK whenever people buy because until now there are only Lykke-Orders on Lykke. Limit orders are likely to come soon but are not there yet. But how much Lykke sells is not only a question of demand but also a question of funding. They have to find a most possible best way to be well funded, not sell out ownership at an early stage of the company, to meet demand that is there and increased significant over the last two months, also to serve Investors and to give informations what includes other sites of course, like coinmarketcap.     ---------  Quote Again, Ive sold all my LKK as there's been a breach of trust...everyone else make up their own minds.  If you say that you've lost trust you can say that is a fact because nobody else could know that better than you. But you say that ""there has been a breach of trust"" and that implies that it's true for others as well. And while that might be true for some others, maybe even many - we both can know that until others say it. What we both can see as fact: The price doesn't reflect a collective breach of trust.

He is doing it to correct a mistake because he even says so...  Here is the statement from Olsen:     Few things you need to be aware of:  1. Why is he talking about a jump if the market cap is already $481mn?  2. Why is he saying lykke is a high risk investment?  3. Why is he saying they will make mistakes along the way?  The answers are:  1. Its because the market cap isnt $481mn..its $50-60mn, according to the calculations agreed between Olsen and coinmarketcap.  2. Its because he's making a high risk move  3. Its because he's correcting a mistake  This is from his own words....he has said the valuation would be jumping, that there is high risk, and they will make mistakes.  It is circulating supply which matters and this is what was agreed between Olsen and coinmarketcap to agree the valuation..  The way to resolve the issue with the market cap would be one of 2 ways:  a) Declare that pre-investors would have their coins in a separate wallet from the circulating supply system, to avoid confusing the figures. This is taking the XRP and Ripple route by keeping pre-investor coins separately to avoid flooding the system, and would protect the current price and market cap (the $50-60mn one). Flooding the system doesnt mean there would be big sell orders. Flooding the system means changing the circulating supply unnecessarily to inflate the agreed market cap valuation.  This was the initial route which Olsen took. The circulating supply of coins bought on the exchange is what counted towards the market cap - which is why the agreement was made between Olsen and coinmarketcap. Otherwise why not just make all the coins - the full 100% count to the market cap from the start?  Why did Olsen not add all the coins into the market cap at the start then? Why was the agreement not made for this? Its a mute point to say just because the coins weren't on the trading wallet, that they shouldn't contribute if that's the argument someone wants to make.  The answer is it was an intentional decision to not add all the coins into the market cap. The private pre-investor coins weren't supposed to be part of the circulating supply to influence the public market cap.  b) The 2nd route is putting all the coins into the trading wallet so that all the coins are counted in the valuation figure. This is the route that Olsen has taken, which means its a U-turn. He made a mistake to say only the coins bought on the exchange should count to the market cap. To correct this mistake and to end any debate about the valuation, this move is being taken. It creates transparency and stability for the long term.  He is saying lykke is high risk because he's making a high risk move. Nobody knows what will happen when the valuation jumps to $481mn in his own words and because of this u-turn...It could fall, it could rise etc.  A change in valuation also means my ROI will be less. There is less growth % when the market cap is 500mn than if its 50-69mn , making it unattractive to many investors.  -----  The breach of trust thing is because the initial idea was for the coins bought on the exchange to be the circulating supply, and this was the basis for the market cap figure in coinmarketcap. The pre-investor coins weren't supposed to be on the circulating supply at all. I honestly dont think Olsen is stupid enough to make a schoolboy error in not including the pre-investor coins in the circulating supply. It was INTENTIONAL to not include the pre-investor coins in the circulating supply initially because those are private coins linked to an internal valuation of the company.  Olsen is smart...the pre-investor coins weren't supposed to be in the circulating supply, which is why he didnt include them at the start. The reason they're doing it now is because Olsen believes the market cap figure is misleading (hence the debate on reddit and previously in this thread). He has done a U-turn to create transparency for the market cap figures and to end the market cap debate once and for all.  My investment in Lykke was based on the understanding of circulating supply and visible market cap being just the LKK bought on the exchange, and that the pre-investor coins bought wouldn't contribute to the public market cap (not the internal valuation which is different). We saw that Olsen made the agreement with coinmarketcap to include just the exchange bought LKK...so my understanding was correct. Now though hes adding the pre-investor coins into the circulating supply, which is doing a U-turn. That to me makes this investment a lot less attractive.  It doesnt matter if the market hasn't reacted...it just means to me Ive sold my LKK and there's much better investments out there. The higher valuation (if it holds) is very off putting. I can make a higher ROI on smaller techs with a lower valuation.",False

Here's my take on your questions:  1. Why is he talking about a jump if the market cap is already $481mn? I think there's insufficient info given in Olsen's reply in that reddit thread, and will personally wait for more details (an official announcement on their blog, hopefully). It seems like what wasn't tradable in the past is now tradable, so logically speaking it should contribute to the market cap. Why now though, that's a valid question but I'd rather wait for the answers than to jump to conclusions.  2. Why is he saying lykke is a high risk investment? Because it is? Would you have preferred him to not say it, or to say that Lykke is a low-risk investment? In either case, given your underlying belief that Olsen and the Lykke team are dishonest, there would have been an argument from you anyway, right?  3. Why is he saying they will make mistakes along the way? I think it's actually very respectable for Olsen to say something like that. It shows transparency. Of course, you can also view it as him given himself an escape route.  It's all about perspective, and we all make decisions based on part facts and part beliefs.

Let me clarify:  The chief guy who is extremely busy doesnt go on reddit to write about stuff that isn't relevant to the discussion.  He is mentioning certain things because they are relevant to the points discussed.  The points discussed are market valuation and its calculation, high risk and mistakes, which is exactly what he's mentioned and is talking about in that post. Add those all together because they are relevant to each other, and you'll understand better what he's saying...they are related within that context and are relevant to each other.  What you're doing instead is taking each of these in isolation and seeing them as separate, resulting in you ending up missing the actual meaning.  In simple terms you're showing inexperience and lack of insight to interpret things correctly. Olsen is an entrepreneur and entrepreneurs will understand him better than the average layman.  Re: Why is he talking about a jump if the market cap is already $481mn?  What this question means is: you wouldnt be talking about any ""jump"" if your valuation was already $481mn. He is talking about a jump because the valuation is NOT $481mn at the moment.  This infers that the actual market cap he is talking about is not the total coin supply market cap (ie 90% coins + exchange traded coins) which would give the $481 mn, but the circulating supply market cap.  The market cap reference he is referring to is the public market cap. You don't talk about a jump unless your talking about the public market cap in this context...not the private valuation (the $481mn one).  The calculations given by Olsen to coinmarketcap are the valuations of the public market cap and is how it was supposed to go. Now he's changed this...can't get any simpler than that.  Re: Why is he saying lykke is a high risk investment?  Look at the context of his post. He isn't talking about high risk for the sake of it...there's a time and place to talk about certain things and a busy CEO doesnt just come out with random statements for the sake of it. He is talking about high risk because he just made a high risk announcement.  Re: Why is he saying they will make mistakes along the way?  Again, look at the context of his post and the thread he posted it on. He is talking about mistakes because it was a mistake to only include the exchange traded coins in the total market cap calculation. This is really simple for anyone who has been following LKK closely to understand...  Olsen doesnt just add this in randomly you know. There is a time and a place to talk about mistakes, and he is talking about mistakes specifically in this context because he realises he made one. He is positioning it well and moving on.  ------  I dont think Olsen is dishonest at all..he's made a legitimate mistake and he'll learn from it and move on. He's creating transparency through this move and that's totally fine for the long term viability of the project, which ultimately I believe will be very successful. However, as I've said its going to cause some investors to sell....because now the ROI is much less than it would have been, had Olsen stuck to his initial strategy.  Quote 1) I've replied on all of your points to be precise. If I am I would appreciate that you do that as well instead of simply writing down another long text.  2) What I really don't like is how you combine your concerns and opinions with given informations to come to conclusions that are often also only opinions, even hard accusations, that you state as facts.

There is enough I should reply on, because I wouldn't like to see all the accusations without putting things into perspective (again).  Sorry, i'd love to reply in detail but im far too busy, so i'll be brief:  Everything I've said is based on what Olsen himself has said.....I havent just come up with something random out of the blue.  Olsen himself posted on the reddit post and you can see clearly what he wrote. There is no mistaking that whatsoever. That is the basis for this whole discussion and everything else is just assumption.  Within the context of that thread and discussion, he is very clearly talking about the valuation of lykke, the high risk nature of lykke and mistakes that will be made. The CEO doesnt just say that out of the blue and in a random way. All of these points are related - he made a mistake with the way the valuation was calculated (the public valuation) and now he has done a u-turn (a high risk move) to give a more transparent valuation. In the long term it will be better for lykke of course that the mistake is corrected now. And yes, I do believe the lykke project will make a lot of money and will ultimately become highly successful.  That is total common sense to me....if you can't see that, then that show's you lack a deeper insight...no offense  I've sold my LKK and am moving on...if your just looking for an average profit then LKK might be a good investment for you...but that's not for me. (and Im talking long term investment for the average profit, who knows what will happen when the market cap updates...also it depends on the timescale that existing investors are looking at for their ROI).",False

Richard Olsen made a post about the supply and how it's handled, also about the value on reddit:   ""Thank you for all the comments about the valuation of Lykke.  Coinmarketcap computes the market capitalization of Lykke based on the coins that are held in the trading wallets and does not include the coins held in other wallets. When Lykke was founded and started the first rounds of fund raising, the coins were issued to other wallets, because the trading wallet was not yet developed. In June we will move all the Lykke coins to the trading wallet. If the price of LKK does not change and remains at 0.374716 USD the total market capitalisation will jump to 481,772,471 USD.  Every buyer of LKK needs to be aware that the Lykke project is high risk – we are reinventing finance and build an emergent organization that is inspired by the principles employed by nature and where all the software and knowledge is open source. We will make mistakes and these mistakes can be costly, so there is risk and any investor should only buy LKK, if he can afford to lose his money.  What is the appropriate valuation of LKK? LKK is not just a normal crypto currency that can be used to make payments. LKK is also a share participation in Lykke Corp and entitles to dividend payments, when Lykke earns a profit. 1 LKK represents a share participation of 0.0000000778% of Lykke Corp to be exact. Lykke is more than a regular stock exchange, because we will be one of the liquidity providers on the exchange and will ourselves offer investment products for our users to invest. In addition, we have our accelerator business, where we help incumbents to retool their business and move to blockchain. We are acquiring the regulatory approvals to turn the Lykke marketplace into an industry strength organisation that institutions can use. There is a lot of upside for the Lykke business model. An increase of the LKK price is positive for us, because it makes it easier to fund our expansion plan and attract top talent.  Lykke does not have any shareholder agreements, etc. preventing investors to sell their LKK. This strategy is in line with my approach to build a fragile company – my reasoning is as follows: If investors can at any time sell their coins, then selloffs will be spread out over time and are helpful warning signals for the company. We have seen a few early investors selling, which has slowed the upmove of LKK but was easily absorbed by other investors.

Lykkes trading is currently managed by a trading bot. You can check out how it works on their website.  There's a big difference between putting coins in circulation, and putting sell orders out for tonnes of coins.  What they're doing is simply giving the existing shareholders the ability to sell IF they wish. This means the angel investors, founders, institutional guys, and people who believed in Lykke can sell their original distribution if they wish.  The only thing that's happening is levelling the field between current LKK holders, and original shareholders.  It is absolutely necessary that this occurs, as it further distributes ownership over time. This is a good thing.  You can of course, exercise your right to sell at any time.",False

Of course Bitcoin price was not as high but we've seen huge increases for many other projects going 4-5x in terms of BTC (let alone in fiat).

Of course Lykke being the only one offering LKK is also the only market maker but if there were no buyers the price wouldn't move. There has been a big increase in users coming on board lately and the communities at Slack, Reddit and Telegram are very active.  Having a fully regulated global platform where you could trade any type of assets is very exciting in my opinion, I can't name a lot of projects similar to Lykke especially ones offering actual equity in the company and not just tokens or software/platform licenses as I like to call them . Equity is very different since a lot of other stuff come into play and I would say makes the projects more easy to estimate a value, that's why I think it has been a more stable investment so far, there's less speculation.  I would say Bitshares or Waves are similar somewhat, even ShapeShift, the problem always boils down to fiat ramps and usability which are to me huge questions marks in these projects.

Especially during the Bitcoin-hype the number of users is increasing.  - The community has a lot of trust into the team behind  - Lykke has a lot of potential and that becomes more and more obvious  - LKK1Y: the decreasing supply on the market, because more and more LKK1Y-Investors settle their LKK1Y's while an increasing number of ppl is interested in investing, leads to a higher price.

Well, a couple things to my eye. Lykke is not really a currency like so many of the other coins. It's actually a token system representing shares in the company. Lykke is a company, and one with pretty high goals.  The founder is the previous founder of OANDA, a FOREX company that's doing very well today: http://fairreporters.net/economy/largest-forex-brokers-by-volume-in-2015/ being one of the largest FOREX companies in the world pushing over $10 billion in trade volume every single day.  Lykke is looking to move in on initially the FOREX / crypto marketplace as an exchange house, and then on the longer term roadmap move onto securities.  This is where things get very interesting, as these kinds of businesses are very very valuable.  This is unique in my mind as it's one of the few ""coins"" discussed here that has some serious substance to it.  Quote And what do you expect the price to be by the end of 2017?  No idea, and honestly it doesn't matter. If this company does what they are planning on, it's 2020 / 2025 when it'll matter. And if they get where they're aiming the valuation might be one of the biggest (I'm talking more than bitcoins current market cap).  Everyone should at the least have their eye on Lykke.",False

But, independently of Lykke, I would suggest to think about all this more realistic and practical and less ideological, also to be able to come close to your high ideals. What I mean is: Total freedom is not for free. There would be a price to pay because humans are not necessarily saints and especially honest people would become victims of those who would mis-use ""total freedom"", especially when it's about money. That already happens each single day, in small and big (also institutional).  And if you want to be totally free and protect your data, you need to know how to do it, because while Lykke needs to do a KYC-process, there are many other providers that collect your data and know more about you than your closest friends while you are maybe not even aware. If you use Google without VPN - they do psychological profiles. Amazon and all big retailers do the same. Social networks are very interested in all what you express. And if you use a smartphone and maybe even a messenger like WhatsApp (which is Facebook btw) - think about how much and what you give them, maybe even without thinking about it. Fact is: Without hiding your IP you are tracked all over the internet and with each single click you give data away about you.  And if you say: ""NO ID! How about that, I'll stick to Satoshy's bitcoin!"" - you should know that the blockchain is not anonymous. It can be tracked and I personally have not much doubt that it's already done. If you want to be consequent you shouldn't even use Bitcoin, or you need to do a lot and follow some rules to be anonymous. If you want to use exchanges it becomes complicated then, because there won't be many options, especially if you want to stay totally anon but also to use Fiat. And even Crypto-only-exchanges start with basic KYC-requirements once a User wants to move more money - take a look at Poloniex or Bittrex.  That said: I understand idealism and I'm all for privacy and data protection. But it's also about being realistic and in most of all cases it's also about a look into the mirror.

The KYC-process also reflects that approach. It's meant to be easy to do and also to be fast, while avoiding the risk that ppl mess with it. The guys behind this project are not naive but smart, and they have to be, because Lykke needs to be safe on the legal side to reach it's high ambitions.

Those who try it would increase the risk not to be able to access and use Lykke in future - fully legal with all what it will offer. And that will still be early.

Currency trades were the first implemented include cryptocurrency trades. Next up is supposedly music rights and carbon emissions. Multisig wallets require two keys before a transaction occurs. Transactions are thus approved by partipcants and the exchange. The transactions utilize the bitcoin blockchain which is secured by all the hashing power of bitcoin.

Factom is another in this group. However a decentralized exchange is a fantastic idea. I wish it was developed on its own chain.""    It's a fair post in my opinion. While it's not totally correct that Lykke develops a decentralized exchange because it's semi-decentralized (or semi-centralized), his explanation of Lykke is not a bad one. Fair is also that he doesn't hide that his conclusions are in fact subjective opinions - he states that ""he really doesn't like (...)"".  But: It would be interesting to know why he doesn't like the colored-coin-protocol and why he doesn't like projects that utilize other blockchains (Factom runs its own blockchain btw - but additionally anchors in Bitcoin).

It can also be applied to equity indexes where the storage costs are essentially zero however there is an associated time value of money (risk free interest rate) and possible dividends.  When the interest rate is higher than the dividend the market is in contango. We have been more or less in backwardation since the GFC in 2008 since the interest rates went to zero (or even negative in some countries) while the dividend yields actually rose in some cases.  https://www.quora.com/Are-S-P500-futures-in-contango-or-backwardation-through-most-of-their-history-Why-if-possible  However, you are correct in saying that contango does not apply straight off the bat to Lykke 1-year forward, its a bit more involved. You see the Lykke 1-Y is a future which has an upfront payment whereas futures are usually settled at the expiration. So the cash flow timing is different. On top of that there is an option built into the Lykke 1Y forward, which is the trigger. The option should in theory have a premium the value of which will depend on the volatility of the underlying asset (which is the LKK), as this is used to measure the probability of the asset increasing or decreasing in price over a period of time.  In financial theory, to get the volatility of an asset you can calculate that from the option price and other variables. However, in practice (in the markets) it works the other way round. What you have is the option price which is derived from the natural market forces of supply and demand and what you do is you back calculate the volatility (in which case it gets called as the implied volatility).  You see by having the Lkk1Y traded on the Lykke exchange, the Lykke team is essentially able to backcalculate the implied volatility. This is a much more accurate number than any volatility derived from theory using the black scholes or binary or any other option pricing model. So the Lykke team has been able to raise funds and at the same time cleverly able to derive the implied volatility - you need that to come up with pricing of other derivatives on Lykke they may need to list on the exchange in the future.  In short, I would expect the price of the LKK1Y to be higher than the Lkk merely due to the time value of money (measure by the risk free interest rate but complicated by the upfront payment) and the premium on the trigger option. Assuming dividend in the next 1 year will be zero which is a reasonable assumption to make for Lykke.  I guess that's how it is supposed to work anyways, however the guys at Lykke will be able to shed more light on the technical details.  Sorry for the long post, couldn't help it.

The other way to make profit is the possibility of an increasing LKK-price over time of course.   Quote What do you think is the advantage of this project over other similar ones?  I don't know all other projects deep enough to say much about them. But I've looked into some of them and decided not to invest because I'm always very concerned about teams (abilities, experience, honesty) in general and a project like that is very ambitious. And while there are many teams that start with big promises, often also believe in their own abilities (if not it's even intended scam), after some time it often comes out that there is a lack of expertise and experience. That is often a point in which even projects that were started legitimate (with good intentions) become shady because of different reasons (running out of money is one). It needs a lot of different kinds of abilities to not only get a project started and to do a successful ICO but to really develop it.  That said: One advantage of Lykke over those projects that try to do similar things is that there is a really skilled and experienced (and honest!) team behind this one. And it's a big team and as far as I can say: They are never bored. With other words: Since I know Lykke and have some insight I'm even more critical/concerned about some other projects with small teams of ""youngsters"", because Lykke somehow makes obvious how much it needs to get such a project to success.  What I also like: They focus on being effective. Instead of developing a ""Lykke-Blockchain"" they use Bitcoin and in future also other blockchains (Ethereum), and instead of doing it totally centralized, what would bring also some disadvantages, they combine the best of both worlds: the high security of a decentralized system plus the performance of a centralized system. In my opinion that is the best approach with the highest potential.  Plus: In comparison to others they are very good in developing user-friendly stuff. Without that the chance to be successful is near to zero in my opinion.  Quote   The only reason I'm interested is that the Oanda co-founder is behind this. I used to trade Forex on Oanda...

Yes, the Bitcoin-blockchain is not very fast but very secure. And what needs to be considered when it's about: The matching-engine is centralized and very fast while settlement is decentralized to ensure a high level of security - quote out of the Whitepaper:  ""Exchanges for cryptocurrencies can be organized with a different degree of centralization. Typically, centralized exchanges are much more efficient, whereas decentralized exchanges are more secure as they require less trust in the exchange. Due to their higher efficiency and simplicity, most volume is currently traded on centralized exchanges such as BTC China, Bitstamp or Bitfinex.8 A trader on such an exchange must entrust all assets in his trading account to the exchange. History shows that this is not without risk, with the most famous examples being the collapse of MtGox (more than 600’000 Bitcoins disappeared) and the most recent hacking of Bitfinex (120’000 stolen Bitcoins). Exchanges such as Bitcoin.de and LocalBitcoins are more decentralized and restrict themselves to organize trades and offer escrow services, but let the traders execute the actual trade bilaterally, whereas traders on LocalBitcoins often even meet physically. This naturally limits the achievable speed of trading to the speed of the underlying payment system (e.g. SEPA or moving bank notes). These exchanges can achieve a much higher trading frequency without having to resort to client deposits by restricting themselves to cryptocurrencies that can be exchanged instantly. Examples of such exchanges or whole cryptocurrency systems that include built-in decentralized exchanges are Omni, Counterparty, and BitsharesX - none of which achieved the same commercial success yet as the aforementioned centralized exchanges. These exchanges frequently try to even decentralize the matching of trades, which is problematic as it is fundamentally hard to enforce rules in a decentralized system, especially when timing is crucial. For the design of our exchange, we opt for a system with centralized matching of trades, but with direct bilateral exchange of assets, trying to combine the best of both worlds. One should also note that, when trading particular colored coins or any other issuer-backed asset, there is exposure to a centralized point of failure anyway, namely the issuer.""  (...)  Generally, all received coins can immediately be reused in a new trade. Thus, trading can be as fast as the connection between a trader and the exchange permits (normally in the range of 10ms - 100ms). Temporarily, the number of trades can exceed the limits given by the Bitcoin blockchain, as this just leads to a delayed settlement.   Plus:  ""To mitigate capacity limit, Lightning Network13 and Micropayment channels14 are the perspective approaches. Instead of broadcasting each single transaction on the blockchain, parties deliver coins by sending signed transaction messages offchain with subsequent net settlement on the blockchain.""  https://www.lykke.com/Whitepaper_LykkeExchange.pdf   Here you can find a graphic of how the exchange works: https://www.lykke.com/technology",False

Now I'm a little familiar with similar services like Xapo, never used their debit card but the process seems very straightforward, you use it like any other credit/debit card and when you pay or withdraw fiat at an ATM it makes the conversion/exchange from your Bitcoin balance.  However in Lykke as you hold multiple fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies and in the future even CFDs stocks (and many other kinds of digital assets) this can get a quite complicated.

First: Lykke is currently in the process to get regulated in the USA and during that time no new customers will be verified. If you are from the USA it's possible that it won't be possible to deposit Fiat. I don't know right now if new US-citizen are totally blocked or if it's only about the verification-process (Selfie, Photo of ID, photo of address).  If you are not from the USA you would need to the verification-process first to be able to deposit and withdraw fiat. But it's simple: If you click on the + next to Euro (or CHF or other FIAT) the verification-process should start. It will take some time (maybe 48h) and you should get a confirmation-mail.   To buy and sell etc. you need funds in your trading-wallet (you have bitcoin now if I understand it correctly). You can type on ""exchange"" and you see all pairs that are available until now (more will follow, like Chronobanks Time-token, Ethereum and others). You can type on one and the rest should be pretty much self-explaining. With the next release of the App it will be even more intuitive/easy.  A very good overview about the current version as videos is this:  Tour of Lykke wallet https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFsI6QgZunI&list=PLk9DrzhaS5AjlYColQnvU6R17MNNNhihK  And here a demo-video of the next release - focus on margin trading: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwhxfc3fi0    Colored Coins are technically Bitcoins (but very small units of BTC) and can represent different assets. Lykke-Coins for example are colored coins = small units of Bitcoin as representation of Lykke-shares. Same can be done with pretty much every value one can think of. Like Lykke also other companies could give out colored coins as company shares, colored coins can also represent fiat (that's also done on Lykke) or gold or even houses etc.  A good explanation is this: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Colored_Coins   Yes, a web-based-terminal is in development and a desktop-client is also planned. Lykke will change and grow dramatically over time. The App is just the beginning.     LKK1Y are forward contracts of LKK. Recently Lykke did a crowdfunding and sold LKK1Y-tokens for about 20% discount to LKK-shares. There are basically two possible scenarios:  1) To lock the LKK1Y-tokens up for 365 days. After 1 year LKK1Y will be swapped to usual Lykke-shares. 2) To trade the tokens as contracts (and a buyer could lock them up for example).

If you choose not to you can sell them back to the market. But if you do hold them you get 20% discount after the year is over the shares are released into your account. As for colored coins I believe they are bitcoin that turn different colors based on the contract you go into. If you want to sell a house the color of the coin might be one color. If you want to start a business it might be another colored coin. I am not sure exactly how it works but I do know a lot more can be done with a colored coin they a regular bitcoin.,False

In the most recent crowdsale 50,000,000 LKK1Y were sold - forward contracts for LKK. Investors have the choice to trade those tokens as contracts or to lock them up for 365 days and after that they will be swapped to LKK-shares. Since it's unlikely that all Investors pull the 365-day-trigger at once they will slowly reach the market.  The majority of LKK is in the hands of founders, team, angel-Investors and company and of course it's in their own interest not to hurt the market price (that would lower the value of the company). If Lykke should start to make profit soon it's likely that they won't sell that much more. If funds should be needed there may be another crowdfunding like the recent one. But in all possible scenarios it would be done carefully.  I don't believe that the majority of supply will ever reach the market.

Once they have a little bit more time I'll suggest that somebody will write an article to explain it all in layman-terms ;-)  But, Lykke will be about many aspects: financial products, payment system (plus debit card), p2p-lending, maybe also prediction market, information-system, crowdfunding-platform and they also build software for other companies but I don't know any details about that.  Key will be volume. Lykke will be much more attractive once it's fully developed and once they'll add pretty much everything what's significant in Crypto and beyond, forex-trading and shares and so on. Important are regulations. That's the reason why they push that topic so much and they do it all over the world.

BTC went from about $600 in Sept/Oct to an ATH and now there is the correction because of the ETF-disapproval and all the drama because of an anticipated hard fork and split. Reason Nr 2 may be that Lykke is in an early stage. Only those who recognize it's potential to grow are already attracted.

What matters is how true his statement is and I believe that he told the truth there.  That's the reason why I prefer a project like Factom. It's simply safer, even if the price can be very frustrating and of course: The last months were frustrating. And Lykke is kind of similar when it's about the situation (not that much attention yet) but much faster when it's about showing progress and much more user- and community-friendly.   For today: ETF-decision will most likely come. I really hope it! This is a good slack btw: https://reddit-bitcoinmarkets.slack.com/ There is an ETF-Channel and nearly everything what is ""known"" is posted there, plus an announcement channel in which everybody will be notified once the decision is out.",False

Speaking of risk, completely agree on Ethereum, but that's how innovative technology and good investments are made, taking risks. And if you think about it, Bitcoin seems so stable and risk free but I'm fudding when I say that there's a high chance of a fork coming its way especially if ETF doesn't get approved and sentiment changes. This will create huge instability in the market and the whole industry will suffer for months like it happened with Ethereum. Ethereum survived because it has too much momentum, developers and ideas on its side. Bitcoin? a fork could absolutely annihilate it because it will hit when it hurts the most.

I do have some experience, I think they are great even for long term investing that is if you trust the exchange or authority managing it. Sites like eToro or plus500 are safe and regulated and with insurance but of course it's not the same as owning the actual stock. However for medium term investment or diversifying I think CFDs are perfectly fine. That is if you also get the dividends you are entitled to. A while ago these exchanges kept the dividends for themselves but lately they started distributing them so right now there's virtually no difference on holding a stock to a CFD except for the risks I mentioned above. It's very similar to a IOU if you will. This could very well translate to crypto soon with dividend paying tokens like ICN, SNGL, LKK, etc. We'll see if exchanges will distribute them or not.  I know because we already discussed that CFDs will be a major player for Lykke along with FX so I'm curious to see what they are planning in this case",False

Yes like we discussed, I think there's minimal chance of the ETF being approved but each day that passes by without any confirmation the price will be stable or continue to rise since if we get to March 11 without any notice it's approved by default. I'm sure we'll hear something by the end of the week, if not then the chance of getting approved will get bigger. Right now I feel it's already priced in, it's the perfect spot to take a risk in case a trader thinks ETF will get approved. I even feel it's a little overvalued, $1080-1100 would be a more cautious price.  I agree an ETF will bring much more money into crypto and Lykke being an exchange will definitely benefit from it (exchanges and gambling sites are the most profitable companies in this industry).",False

That would mean that prices reflect real value objectively what's not the case in my opinion - best seen in some projects that are worth pretty much nothing (some or many are even scams) but get pumped up on irrational price-levels. And there are also projects that are undervalued on the market and I believe that Lykke has a lot of price-potential.  But yes, the price went a little bit down because 1) Bitcoin went up the last months and currently we see a new sharp rise. 2) Some have sold LKK to buy into 1YLKK, which is not a bad sign because it indicates confidence in the long-term-potential of Lykke.

Companies, organizations that do this can actually profit from the support of regulators""  ""Lykke addresses issues that regulators wanted to solve for decades – we are highlighting these features: new type of matching engine based on price, time and spread priority, which addresses the risk of flash crashes, intraday interest payments, which ensures intraday liquidity during periods of stress, ability of immediate settlement, which is a continuous clearing system for all types of asset classes and can address the issue of too big to fail.

I have nothing against critique and I'm always open to discuss the hell out of each and any aspect and we can use this thread for some nice fights ;-) , but that word implies hidden and dishonest intention to make money on the back of misleaded Investors while not deliver on promise. And Lykke acts the other way around. They are totally transparent about the financial part, not only the past but also about how and for what they'll use the money in future. And when it's about the development:  https://github.com/LykkeCity --> won't be easy to find another project with such activity and quality on the development front. (Just by the way: They've pushed out an update for the App)  Goal will always be to ensure a win-win-Situation while building a great project and increasing it's value. And of course: Funding is needed until Lykke will make profit - that is in line with shareholders interest. That is true for all startups and in my opinion it's much smarter to do things carefully and step by step and over time in combination with showing real progress, instead of triggering a big hype only with a whitepaper and some nice screenshots to sell as much as possible at once but running out of money after 12 months.  Out of Investor-perspective a decision if to buy or not to buy or to sell if invested, should be based on the own conclusion if this project has potential - if the team will be able to deliver. And what I always suggest is to dig deep. Because the interesting part is: There are a lot of projects that may seem great on first sight while a lot of fascination gets lost once one takes a deeper look into it. With Lykke it's the other way around. My prediction is: For those who do deep research and begin to understand it, the more fascinating and promising it will become - and based on facts.  One also could do it this way: Take a look at the current quality and what they've already achieved. Then take a look at what they want to achieve in future and ask yourself what Lykke could become in months and years if they ""just"" continue to develop this on all fronts how it was done until now.

Since I started buying the fiat price hardly moved compared to other altcoins. I understand we could see $4 per LKK share but that for me only means it will be very undervalued.

I guess it can go lower but the company already have offices, trademark, apps already working perfectly, that is what a company marketcap is worth. In most projects you are buying a token/coin not a share in the company, there's no dividends, no offices, no trademarks so price is much more speculative.  The current Bitcoin rally to me it's nothing more than ETF hype/pump and it will correct to below 1k soon enough. In my opinion there's zero chance the ETF gets approved and it would be a huge surprise if the contrary happens. The price will blow past $1500 and could even touch $2k if that was the case.

I'm one of the lucky early birds myself and back in 2015 it wasn't too known and compared to today much cheaper to become a whale. And some are so much in profit and have so much that they are able to sell and to keep it down with that. But I also believe that there are some strategic manipulations at least sometimes. The latest decrease might be more a combi of rising BTC and M2-problems. But the community is growing. Much more active (but more on slack now) then 8-12 months back.  LKK-price: Since LKK is traded on Lykke and attracted more long-term-focused people instead of those who try to make a quick buck through waiting for a Polo-pump it's of course more stable. Plus: Lykke uses algotrading that also has some stabilizing effect. And yes, I believe it's unlikely to drop much.

Bitcoin can be included but also company shares of software licenses - pretty much everything.  The interesting part is: That's not only about a technical change. It will have huge impact on society, at least over some time, since self-responsibility will be a much more important requirement than it seems to be now. A guy with a portfolio with 10 or more different assets needs to handle more informations and to think more to adjust his values smart than somebody with a bank-account for Dollar or Euro or whatever. And while the focus of the Crypto-space is still very much about the technical side, about the question how to make it possible for average people to use Cryptocurrencies easy and safe, the question how to get and handle informations to become really self-responsible will be much more interesting.

The most detailed informations are here to find:  1) Information Brochure for Coinholders February 2017 https://forward.lykke.com/files/Lykke_Corp_Offering_Memorandum.pdf  2) About the 1yLKK-forward https://forward.lykke.com/files/Fact_sheet_2017.pdf   Short overview in my words:  The total supply of Lykke Coins is: 1,285,690,000 LKK  100 Lykke Coins represent 1 share of the company: 12,856,900 shares  The majority of shares is held by the company, it's founders, angel Investors and the team.  Detailed Overview of Coinholders: https://www.coinprism.info/asset/AXkedGbAH1XGDpAypVzA5eyjegX4FaCnvM/owners  Sold during ICO in September-October 2016: 30,000,000 LKK - 300,000 shares.   The current crowdfunding is a 1-year-LKK-forward-contract and about 50,000,000 LKK - 500,000 shares.   That means in my own words: An Investor has the advantage to buy into the 1yLKK (for 0.04 CHF) below the LKK-market-price, but after activating the contract (pulling the 365-day-trigger) it would be locked for 1 year until he gets 1 LKK for each 1yLKK.  But: After the crowdfunding, an Investor is free to decide to trade the 1yLKK as a contract, or to pull the 365-day-trigger. It's also his choice to do that whenever he wants - if. The official explanation can be found in the linke above (2 - Fact Sheet).   For the available supply on the market that means: It first stays at 30,000,000 LKK but increases after 1 year - dependent on how much will be sold during this Crowdfunding and how many of the Investors will activate the 1yLKK and when they will decide to do that. It won't be all at once.     Because of your question if more LKK will be issued: Sergey Ivliev said this on telegram in January:  ""there is no plans to increase number of shares of Lykke Corp, hence no ""inflation"" for Lykke coins""    With other words: That doesn't mean that the company won't sell more shares in future.

Yes, the Bitcoin-rise pushed also LKK a little bit down in between. I even expected Bitcoin to rise but decided not to sell because it never feels safe with all the blocksize-drama-war and China etc. I also didn't sell FCT.  But, to your questions:  Total supply is 1,285,690,000 Lykke Coin = 12,856,900 LKK shares, so it's even a little bit more. Total value is about $63 million.  Will ne Coins/Shares be issued in the future? Theoretically that is possible and back in September or October I've talked with Richard Olsen about that and he explained how it's usually done in companies. But some weeks ago (January) the same question was asked on Telegram and Sergey replied that there are no plans to issue new shares.  Just found the comment on telegram. Quoting Sergey Ivliev: ""there is no plans to increase number of shares of Lykke Corp, hence no ""inflation"" for Lykke coins""   1) I'm not totally sure why they've chosen the ""100 LKK = 1 share - design"", but I believe it's to make it also useful as currency including the possibility for micro-transactions. Lykke won't be only about being a trading-platform but will also focus on payment etc. (Debit Card is also planned). And one can think of Lykke-Coins as a useful Crypto-Currency while being backed because it represents ownership.  2) Like said above, the value is even a little bit higher. And that's often somehow controversial and I thought a lot about it myself before I've decided to invest. It's also kind of subjective and about the own strategy, but my view on Lykke is that while they are not loud like some others when it's about marketing, they really push the project forward. And compared with some other projects and teams behind, I believe the value is fair, even more when it's about future potential. If Lykke should be successful, and right now I don't see reasons to believe it won't be, there is not really a limit how it can grow into multiple spaces.    What is interesting, because you've also mentioned Factom: I believe to see some similarities but also very interesting differences. Similar is that both teams really focus on delivery. Both teams move step by step while avoiding ""hype-on-promise"". But in comparison to Factom, what always will be a ""background-system"" (but with high potential in my opinion) Lykke has much more potential to be attractive for potentially everybody and a lot of different use cases. I really believe that Lykke can go viral out of itself, maybe already in 2017.   And if we compare Lykke and Ripple for example: XRP, as a currency, is valued at $232,637,449 right now. I've never understood that valuation because even if a decentralized system, the whole project is pretty much centralized. XRP is under the line just a system-currency and unlike to LKK it doesn't represent ownership of the Ripple-Company.  Or if compared with some of the projects with similar goals, like Waves: $25 million marketcap right now. That's much cheaper of course, but Lykke is far ahead and especially the people behind are simply on another level.  And if we compare it to Factom: It's a shame that Factom is not already valued much higher! ;-) But I expect it to fly in 2017.   That's of course my personal view and no investment is ever totally safe or predictable. But in my opinion this is one of a very few pearls in the Blockchain/Crypto-Space while I'm very sure that about 99% will have no real chance. It needs so much expertise in a lot of different areas to get a project on a road to success - I think, that's underrated by a lot of teams and also a majority of Investors.

Anyway, I agree with you, the 100=1 ratio must be because LKK will also act as some form of currency and maybe that will bring some kind of stability to it. You can see how projects with more than 1 billion coins are much more stable (Ripple, Sia, Digibyte, Doge, lol).  I mentioned Iconomi because I'm afraid regulation will crush it and Lykke seems to have a very clear roadplan in the future and are based in Switzerland which is crypto paradise.

And speaking of similarities between Factom and Lykke I forgot to mention the point you speak about. Both use the Bitcoin-Blockchain as a base. Both are in a way complementary to Bitcoin that they can even be seen as helpful for some of Bitcoins problems. Scaling of course but also transaction-speed for example. And even more important: Both stay independent at the same time, can and will utilize also other Blockchains.  And it's kind of a fun fact that there are some Bitcoin-Maximalists out there who believe Bitcoin should be the only Blockchain and BTC the only currency and all projects with an own token should just die. They don't get, that exactly this design is a continuation of Bitcoin itself.  I believe that there will be ""many"" Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies in future that are connected, some will be more adopted and accepted than others, but the whole system together will be unbeatable. And a project like Lykke, without own Blockchain but utilizing all Blockchains that are relevant, will act like a revolving door in Crypto and beyond and into multiple economical use cases and spaces.  Others will do that as well of course and it will also be about competition. But this whole space is so young and there nearly endless room to grow, that it's a safe bet that quality will push through.  Btw, because in the end it's about the question if a project is a good investment or not: My own investment-strategy is also about the context, about the established system and what I believe is likely to happen (banking and currency crises ""everywhere"", especially in the EU). I focus on those projects I believe to be able to connect and grow into established use cases but also benefit of a possible downfall. And that's also best seen in Factom and Lykke, since both projects have a changing effect on the established system and both are likely to benefit from crises (others as well of course). But if we think especially about a currency crisis (Banks in the Eurozone and Euro itself could break) - what will people try and do? It will be about getting rid of the Fiat-currency, as fast as possible, and into something that is seen as safe haven. And Lykke offers exactly that. It is and gives choice.   Long story short: Projects like Lykke and Factom (and some others) just have to move on. Richard Olsen often says ""go with the flow"" and I believe that is really key. There is a dynamic for such projects. When we will look back in some years it' very likely in my opinion that we will say: ""Timing couldn't have been better!"". ;-)",False

But I believe that the economical system will collapse because of the inherent economical structure. It's a debt-system. It was said by many that Bitcoin would be some kind of pyramid scheme or snow-ball-system. But that's more true for the established financial system and I'm not an economical expert but I'm very sure that there is no solution - that escalation will be the base for change and ""solution"". Until we run into the next trouble. Humans are humans - I don't expect an upgrade soon.   Quote  By the way, what do you think about Chronobank, it's related to this thread because I know Lykke will add the token once it's released.  Yes, Sergey said on telegram today that it will be on Lykke in early march. I'm not sure yet what I think about it. One reason is that I would have to look much deeper into it to really have an opinion. Until now I think that it's very interesting and I'm eager to see how it will develop, especially over time. But I'm also sceptical because it seems to be very experimental on all important fronts. Technically it's very connected to Ethereum. Economically there are some things I'm really unsure about (stable tokens) and socially it becomes really complex since it will be about a reputation systems etc.  If we think about Blockchain and why it's so magical: One of the most important aspects is to get human weaknesses as much as possible out of the system. Factom is a continuation of that for example. But Chronobank can't do that and assumes a lot of rational behavior. They assume rational markets, otherwise their Tokens won't be stable or it will need a lot of money to ensure stability while the whole system could suffer if the value  should go down. Maybe there is something I miss here - but right now I'm very skeptical about that point.  Another one is the complexity of all the involved social aspects and the reputation-system. They somehow compare their concept with Uber. But that's just about ""A guy drives me from A to B - I check if I'm still alive - yes, good work!"" It's a whole different thing to evaluate the work of a designer for example. And reputation systems are usually very vulnerable, fraud attempts included.  I'm very unsure how to handle such a complex system. If you take a look at page 16: https://chronobank.io/files/business_outline.pdf  Just that is a challenge. Over time, if Chronobank should get traction, it may become less important because the more companies will use Chronobank the more stable the system should become. But they will need to be fast to get traction and that could turn out as a problem. They also need a lot of money because liquidity will be needed. If there should be unstable markets for their tokens and if they shouldn't have the liquidity to stabilize it, I'm not so sure how they should be able not to just go down because the whole system would lose credibility. I don't believe in rationality of economical systems and I don't believe in reputation-systems once it's about high meaning and complexity. That's why I'm very sceptical. But... it's also a little but too much guessing involved because I didn't look deep into it.  Under the line I hope that it will work out because it's absolutely an interesting concept.",False

Lykke being a full fledge company and located in Switzerland aims to bring all people on board with a simple KYC approach. Bitshares seems to be for crypto nerds only, as many of these projects and we are scattered around many sites and coins. Most crypto fans think it's so easy to have BTC or to even have access to BTC, why would you need to buy BTC to then buy other assets? You are just losing money, people just don't get it but that how most of these projects work. So fiat gateways are the top priority here, however that's very hard to achieve, many promise they can pull it off, like Waves for example, which could also be compared and Ripple was eventually considered to be a digital marketplace like this. If you check Gatehub they offer some assets and some gateways.  I think what mostly separates Lykke from this is that it's an hybrid of centralized and decentralized approaches as tempus said, so far it works flawlessly and it is very intuitive, these two things may seem irrelevant for the average crypto user but they may be the most important aspects for blockchain companies to make it and be successful. I also see the comparison with Factom tempus mentioned, the project itself isn't that much complicated, I'm sure an engineer or very experienced dev can implement the op_return option and register data for a company in either Ethereum or Bitcoin blockchain. But Factom, similar to Lykke are actually aiming to create a product they can use and consume, make a bridge to the old ways, guiding old industries and business. This is similar to the old Apple debate about Wozniak and Jobs, the only way to bring technology to the average consumer is to make it friendlier, easier, fun to use. Most engineers and developers live in their own little world and are just waiting for people to discover and improve the by tech themselves.  The problem I see so far with Lykke in this early stage is that many people won't use an app for trading, so a desktop/web version could be the killer app here (I know it's coming soon). If they add more assets and options with time (I know they will) I'll definitely move most of my trading to them in a second.",False

But, like you say: Desktob/Web-Version could become a killer App not only because many will find it more practical, but also because of the more psychological effect.

They invest before the most important steps are done, very often ""just"" in an idea. The ICO on the other hand was done on Lykke when it already was a working platform and after they've released the trading App.  And if you look at the progress since that time: I don't know of other projects that are so fast in development and show that much progress in all important areas.  That being said: When it's about the price, there can be a lot of different opinions and it's about a lot of aspects. One is Bitcoin for example. If you look on the charts of other projects - the rising BTC-price was constant pressure on nearly all others. Most important in my opinion is: Lykke is not that known yet. It's growing of course but the real increase of users and customers and Investors will happen once Lykke will be accessible over the Web-based-terminal and once it's fully licensed in the USA, once the platform is fully developed etc. And there is much more to come. It's just not that easy to imagine how and how fast Lykke will change in the coming months.  My impression is that many, maybe even a majority, believe Lykke is small since the most visible and experienceable part is the App, and many seem to focus on what's not possible yet. But if we compare Lykke to other projects with similar goals - it's far ahead and much faster when it's about progress and most important: It's real quality and lead by professionals. The team itself is worth many millions. All together they must have hundreds of years of experience and expertise.  Plus: If you think about the price and imagine how it would have reacted on Poloniex on all the news - it would have pumped for sure. I believe it would be much higher now. But would it be better if it would have been a pump-and-dump-game? Lykke is a serious project with a long-term vision - no hype. That means: First it needs a base to go further. And Lykke only starts here but will go beyond Crypto, will connect between ""both worlds"" (Crypto and established system).  Some may think it's overvalued. But I believe it's an opportunity, especially for us Crypto-Guys because they start here. And they do that because they know that we understand the potential of Blockchain. The ""negative-side"" may be that Crypto is very often about different kinds of projects: Unprofessional hypes with only one sense: to be manipulated Pump-and-Dump-Schemes on Crypto-exchanges, and just btw: the majority loses like Gamblers in a Casino.",False

It's a little bit complicated ;-) -  more the other way around:  100 LKK entitle to 1 Lykke-Company-share. The price right now, on the exchange, is at about 0.05 CHF  If you decide to buy into this Crowdfunding, you buy a forward-contract (that runs for 1 year) at 20% discount. The price is 0.04 CHF instead of 0.05 CHF.  This is the explanation: https://forward.lykke.com/files/Fact_sheet_2017.pdf  Let me try to ""translate"" it:  If an Investor buys 100 LKK now for 0.04 CHF in this ICO it's in fact buying a contract between Lykke and the Investor that runs for 365 days after pulling the ""365-day-trigger"". The Investor is also free not to pull the trigger and to sell the contract (It will be traded after end of the ICO). If he believes in Lykke's potential he can pull the ""365+trigger"" what means the contract becomes effective. It's like signing a declaration to receive the shares in 365 days.   Practical it means: Let's say you buy 100 ""Contract-LKK"" in this ICO for 0.04 CHF and you pull the trigger right away, you get 100 LKK in 365 days. And let's say the price is 30% higher then, your profit would be 50% because you bought the ""contract-LKK"" 20% cheaper.  Or: Let's say you buy 100-Contract-LKK but you don't pull the trigger, because you are uncertain - you can even decide to sell it to somebody else. And maybe the one who buys it from you pulls the trigger and declares his intend to receive 100 LKK in 365 days.   I hope it makes it clearer. It's not that easy to explain ;-)",False

The ICO last year was about purchasing LKK right away. Those LKK are free to buy and sell since the the ICO has ended.   The current ICO is about buying ""LKK-Contracts"", like LKK-Futures. With other words: You buy a contract to get LKK in 365 days (if you pull the trigger) at 20% discount.   Imagine it this way: I have LKK in my wallet that I bought in the ICO in September 2016. And we both could make a deal - a contract:  Let's say all my LKK would be worth $1000 at the current exchange-price. You give me $800 (20% below the current market price) now and you get my LKK in 365 days. If Lykke makes good progress and the price goes up, so that the LKK in my wallet will value at $1500 in 365 days, you make not only 50% profit but 70% - because of the 20% discount we've agreed to in our contract.  That's what Lykke offers in this ICO, but a little bit cooler: An Investor who buys such a contract is free to pull the ""365-day-trigger"" whenever he wants - or to trade the LKK-contract. Once the trigger is pulled, what is like signing the contract, it will run for 365 days and the Investor will receive the ""real-LKK"" in 365 after pulling the trigger.    Edit: Didn't see the edit before I posted ;-)  Regarding volume and price of LKK on the exchange: Interesting will be to see if some will sell LKK to have money to buy into the ""LKK-Contracts"", because it would be a little bit paradox: Pressure on the exchange-price, but at the same time a promising sign because it's a long-term-decision (at least if an Investor pulls the ""365-day-trigger"").

I think that the team made a decision until now not to be on other exchanges and I think it's smart to build a base first, especially to not make a pump-and-dump-game out of it.  Or with other words: Best scenario is to get serious and informed Investors in this who are able to understand the project - not only what it is right now but also what it will be about in the future and that this project really has potential for the long run (unlike to some others) and want to participate with their Investment - without being impatient.

But somebody asked a similar question on telgram (if there will be inflation) and Sergey replied that there is no plan to issue new shares - so ""inflation"" will be zero.    Quote If no new coins are created does that mean this is more of a Proof of stake coin? No. LKK' are issued as colored coins on the Bitcoin-Blockchain. This gives a good explanation/overview:  ""The term ""Colored Coins"" loosely describes a class of methods for representing and managing real world assets on top of the Bitcoin Blockchain.  While originally designed to be a currency, Bitcoin's scripting language allows to store small amounts of metadata on the blockchain, which can be used to represent asset manipulation instructions. For example, we can encode in a Bitcoin transaction that 100 units of a new asset were issued and are now credited to a given bitcoin address. A colored coins wallet can create a Bitcoin transaction that encodes sending 50 units of an asset from one address to a new address, and so on.  (...)"" https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Colored_Coins  Or this site: http://coloredcoins.org  So, there won't be any kind of ""mining"" or ""staking"". But once Lykke will be profitable and company and shareholders should decide not to reinvest profit, Lykke will pay dividends to it's shareholders.   Quote Since the coins represent stock in the company does it mean we will never have a situation where there is a reverse split or increase in the number of shares? Like said above: Theoretically it would be possible that Lykke would issue new shares like companies do it from time to time. But there is no plan for that, so the number of LKK will neither decrease nor increase.   Quote     What powers the Lykee blockchain? Transactions from the wallet? Since Lykke doesn't run on an own blockchain, but is build on top of the Bitcoin-blockchain and LKK are issued as colored coins (like all assets that are and will be listed on Lykke as exchange will be represented as colored coins) it's not needed. The Bitcoin-Blockchain is secured by the miners.",False

But to say a calculation is good when it's in fact not correct and to make claims like an ""the investment on lykke will be vaporware, it will be gone"" without further arguments - how to reply on that?  And the LKK-price was pretty stable in comparison to others while Bitcoin went up very sharp between September (ICO) until now.  Another thing is: I understand the comparison to usual Crypto-Coins, since I also come out of Crypto. But Lykke is a company and while usual Coins very often are not even useful for anything else than trading, LKK represent company-ownership. It's by far not near to all the shitcoins out there to say it in Crypto-terms. And btw: There were and still are a lot of Zero-premine-Scams. There are multiple ways to scam people while there are only a few really good projects with not only skilled but also professional and honest teams who act really transparent.

If you look into the Github of Lykke: https://github.com/LykkeCity  Last update 16 minutes ago. It won't be easy to find a project with such a high activity on all fronts.   But of course: An Investment in Lykke is a high-risk-investment how it's true for all startups and how it's true for Crypto in general.

Yes, at least so far and as far as I know. But again: It's really usual for startups. It's also usual that startups distribute shares over time because they do more funding-rounds. If you take a look at Factom for example, they already had several funding-rounds as company (I'm not speaking about their System-Currency Factoids that were sold in the initial ICO - 50% btw).  One question: What do you believe would have been better? I mean, we are talking about a startup and assumed Lykke is legit (I have zero doubt about that) and the team works hard to become successful, one can say: Lykke and all Investors are on the same side, right? Do you think it would be better for Lykke and all Investors if nearly all shares (or whatever higher number) would already been sold out?",False

And shouldn't the question be: What's best for Lykke because that's also best for Investors?  If you think about it, let's say they would have done such a big ICO: Would people have bought that much of a very young startup that gets increasing attention but is not a hype yet? The answer is: Only if they would have sold it really damn cheap. Would that be fair? I believe no, because they've already delivered great stuff. They've put a lot of work and expertise in what is already there and useful and: free to use. The App is for free and they charge no fee.  At the same time there is much more to come, and they are very hard workers and it's really an impressive team - btw, there are many more working on this project than those who are visible on the site. And more shares will be distributed over time. There will be more funding rounds in future, because it's a simple fact that startups need funding. I don't know if I'm right but I believe the biggest Investor is most likely Richard Olsen himself. And others who work on this are most likely also funders. If true that would mean: They are not only those who work for the success of the company, but they also have the biggest part of the financial risk.   On the other hand: Investors can give money and that is a risk of course, but also an opportunity. And who wants shares of Lykke can buy. If you want to buy with little money it's possible right now on the market. If you are a millionaire and you would like to buy a lot, it would most likely also be possible.   Thing is: In the end it's a question if somebody believes that Lykke is a good project with a lot of potential for the future, and not only for some months like many of these ""Coin-Projects"" or not. And that question is highly dependent on the question if the team has the quality and abilities and can be trusted or not.  That's why I always (not only Lykke) recommend to do deep research about the people behind a project - also with the question in mind if they are honest or if there might be signs for the opposite. And the Lykke-team is really transparent and they give their best to prove that they not only have the skills but also the personalities. With other words: They don't simply say ""Trust us, buy this!"" - they want to convince with what they are building. At the same time they are very open for all kinds of feedback and very welcoming for all kinds of people who might be helpful. That's the reason for Lykke-Streams: https://streams.lykke.com   A good start to get an impression about the team is this video btw:  Richard Olsen about Lykke idea and objectives https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leXWIhS4Y3k  It's from a team-meeting that first wasn't even meant to be published. It's no marketing-material, but it gives very good insight about Richard Olsen, the team and Lykke. ",False

I could drop names here of projects who have done ICO's in summer 2016 and are near to dead now.  The Lykke-team has built a lot before they've done the public ICO. That's the reason why it already was possible to do the ICO on the own platform. On the other side Lykke would most likely get more attention if LKK would have launched on Poloniex. But there will be other ICO's and Lykke will get increasing attention (that's already the case).  In general can be expected: Increasing intensity (visible) on all fronts, marketing included.

And of course, the price of 1 share is dependent on the price of the ""Coin"" which can be thought of like a combination of currency and share with all pro's of both but no con's in my opinion.  About the valuation: Unfortunately I don't remember it was said, maybe on slack: The valuation of the company was measured professional. They didn't chose it like ""flipping coins"" ;-) , but in the end the market will make the decision.   My own opinion bout it's valuation is: First I was critical about it myself, as an Investor (still readable on this thread), because I thought it may be too high. But the more I looked into it and compared it to other projects, the more I came to the opinion that it's fair, because of the great fundamentals and in comparison to other projects Lykke already has a lot to show, has pushed out an already working product and what also needs to be considered is the great team behind and what they are able to do not only on the development/coding-front but also the tons of experience they  have about all other aspects. Richard Olsen already founded a very successful company (https://www.oanda.com) and Lykke has even more potential.  And it's not only Richard Olsen, but also many others with deep expertise in their fields. There is much more happening behind the curtain than is visible and also more than I know (and can understand) personally. It's not easy to keep track, but safe to say is that it won't be boring.

And the development-front also never stands still: https://github.com/LykkeCity   I've already seen a demonstration of the next App with margin trading etc, and it will be awesome! ;-)    What I want to say with all that: I even believe Lykke is worth more than the current valuation, especially in comparison to other projects that are often only Coins or with tokens that don't necessarily need value. What I expect is that once Lykke is fully regulated in the USA and has implemented all the features to be attractive also for Forex-traders, it will become hard to ignore it. Even if hard to believe: Lykke has the potential to become the major player not only in the field of Crypto-exchanges.",False

But unlike Factom, where a significant rise could easily happen within a year, I believe that Lykkes approach, turns it into something far more longterm und maybe even more unlikely for Lykke shares to reach something like 250$ ... making a coin 2.5$ as Factom is roughly about. Are the Lykke shares supposed to be traded on regular stockexchanges or will their price always be determined by the coinprice?",False

Not that much because of the use-case but I also believe to see some similarities. When I've found Factom it was totally under the radar, nobody seemed to care about (speaking especially of Oct-Dec 2015). But those who looked a deeper already could see the potential and how professional the team is. What's also kind of similar: Both projects are a very good combination of business but also idealism. And both are very good in lowering the barriers for potential customers/users.  Regarding future price-potential and how fast the price can develop, I believe both projects are in a different situation, mainly because of one point: Factom is more a background-system and also it's customers are not that much guys like we are. That may change with applications on top of factom ""for everybody"", but Factom itself will always stay a system running in the background.  Lykke has much more potential to get a lot of attention, to go viral, and I have no doubt that will happen. Right now the project is somehow between already usable and also already userfriendly on one side but not very known on the other - and regulations in the USA are yet to come and a lot of features plus desktop interface etc. But over the next 6-12 months there will be big releases and endless improvements. At one point I expect a real user-explosion. And that would also drive the LKK-price because in the end it could turn out as a much better investment and store of value than Bitcoin for example.  If Lykke-shares will be traded on stock-exchanges is an interesting question. I don't know tbh. Could be possible somewhere in the future. But since 100 Lykke-Coins entitle to claim Lykke-shares the prices will always be related. And maybe we will see a future first that regular stock-exchanges also run on blockchains. I believe that will happen in the next few years.",False

But Lykke's business-model is not trading fee - they follow a zero-fee-policy. Lykke acts as marketmaker and will also be a platform to do ICO's and so on.  Regarding the LKK-price: I believe it's kind of a paradox situation, because the increasing Bitcoin-price leads to increasing attention on the whole space. That's helpful. At the same time Lykke needs to meet some important Milestones and will do that without doubt, but it's early. The real show will start once Lykke is fully regulated in the USA, and once some releases are pushed out Lykke-Coders are currently working on, like...  * Margin trading  * Regulated retail FX  * Offchain settlement scalable to 100’000+ transactions per second  * Ethereum support: multisig wallets, interblockchain atomic swaps  * Payment system provider   ...and there will be more. All together will make Lykke much more attractive, also for the usual Forex-sector and that will boost the volume and will have impact on the LKK-price. People ""only"" need to understand that it's not an Altcoin but the representation of company-shares. Over the last months LKK was suppressed like nearly all Altcoins because of the rising Bitcoin-price. I expect that will change over this year.

Thing is, that the first answer I got wasn't that positive because the App is also needed to go through the KYC-process. I've asked if it's also needed if you would pay with BTC and store the LKK in the Coinprism-wallet - but I have no answer yet.  About your questions about other platforms in comparison: I'm not a technical guy, and I don't know those other platforms very well. But I can tell you this: I was on the search for a good decentralized-exchange-project because I believed and still believe that it's the next logical step. I mainly decided to buy into the Lykke-ICO because of the team. They have a lot of very skilled experts and especially Richard Olsen has tons of experience in that field.  Another reason is: Lykke doesn't use it's own blockchain but the most secure blockchain out there - Bitcoin, while it stays flexible at the same time. It can connect with all blockchains and since it's a combination of a centralized matching engine and decentralized settlement it will also be very fast. With other words: It will make all possible what is possible on centralized exchanges, and I believe it will be superior to Crypto-exchanges how we know it so far. At the same time: Much higher security.   What also got my attention when I looked into Lykke, besides of the team is that it's obvious that they are able to build user-friendy stuff. That's also very important, because even the best technology won't be adopted if ordinary people see too many barriers. And Lykke is very good in that. It's also a ""feeling safe"" aspect which is most likely the most important part ""everywhere"" - people want to be and feel safe.   In general, what I've learned in Crypto and investing in Crypto is: Out of Investor-perspective there is always a lot what is not obvious, a lot of barriers and many problems for a team to solve on many fronts -  software-development, business, legal side, marketing etc. And while it can be tempting to buy into a project that promises a lot in the beginning, maybe even with very skilled Programmers behind, it always needs a close look at the people behind to get a sense if they are capable to reach promised goals and to solve all(!) problems on the way. Many of those teams become overwhelmed because they can't anticipate all what will come. And many just run out of money and very often a project becomes shady because of that (false promises, marketmanipulation etc.)  I believe that just a very few of all the blockchain-projects and - startups that pop up in the Crypto-space will survive. And my list of projects I really believe in is very short.",False

But: Colored Coins can represent all kinds of value, including other Crypto-currencies. I doubt that Lykke will become a multi-currency exchange like Poloniex for example but focus more on other assets because the possibilities are pretty much endless. But I also believe that they will add more Cryptocurrencies over time how they've already done it with Solarcoin and Ethereum will follow soon.  The article about Ethereum-implementation is also a good explanation about Lykke and how it works - also about security:   Lykke is Integrating Ethereum  By Mihail Nikulin, Lykke co-founder and CTO  Lykke is a semi-centralized exchange. This means that the exchange does not take possession of the traded coins (Ethereum tokens, Ethers, Bitcoins or colored coins), but needs to be trusted to match trades correctly. Lykke has a centralized matching engine and decentralized coins settlement. Matched trades are settled on the blockchain in the atomic way. Each atomic transaction must be signed by both parites and the exchange. Still to be able to trade, one should deposit his coins to Lykke exchange. Depositing coins is not equal to trusting coins. How can it be? Lykke uses multisignatures mechanism to hold client's funds. Lykke exchange can not spend any coins without a client's private key. Even if the exchange is compromised and the Lykke key is stolen, the client will not lose his coins. The second key is required to spend deposited coins. Lykke exchange also provides a refund mechanism to guarantee funds recovery in case of emergency.  Mentioned features are coming soon on top of the Ethereum blochchain. In this post you will find conceptual details of Ethereum settlement integration described. Ethereum-Bitcoin swap transactions to provide crosschain atomic exchange will be covered in further posts.

Isn't it a Blackcoin-project?  In terms of Dash: Of course it could make sense for Lykke to integrate Currencies like Dash, especially because it's already kind of established and has a huge community. I'm not aware of talking about it but one reason is also that the team is still very busy with developing the platform and a lot of other stuff. Once Lykke as a platform is further developed it's likely that they will think more about what to add etc.  TAU-Chain: I don't know much about it. It's been a while that I've read in their thread, but I'll take a look into it.   It could be good to make a ""suggestion-site"" or something like that, but more transparent then it's on Poloniex to discuss Pro and Cons of what Lykke should/could add. Or maybe it even could be done about https://streams.lykke.com to send in and vote on proposals. But it might be too early for that. Attention has to increase first and it is increasing but not enough yet. That will change with what will come in 2017.  For now we can use the thread for suggestions. I'll make a list and keep it updated and forward it to the team. But like already said: They are very busy to get some important releases out and Cryptocurrencies won't be that much the focus like it's the case on usual Crypto-exchanges.

Quote Is the marketplace decentralized?  If not, how is this different from Poloniex or any other centralized exchange/marketplace?   In the link above (Ethereum-integration) there is an explanation:   ""Lykke is a semi-centralized exchange. This means that the exchange does not take possession of the traded coins (Ethereum tokens, Ethers, Bitcoins or colored coins), but needs to be trusted to match trades correctly. Lykke has a centralized matching engine and decentralized coins settlement. Matched trades are settled on the blockchain in the atomic way. Each atomic transaction must be signed by both parites and the exchange. Still to be able to trade, one should deposit his coins to Lykke exchange. Depositing coins is not equal to trusting coins. How can it be? Lykke uses multisignatures mechanism to hold client's funds. Lykke exchange can not spend any coins without a client's private key. Even if the exchange is compromised and the Lykke key is stolen, the client will not lose his coins. The second key is required to spend deposited coins. Lykke exchange also provides a refund mechanism to guarantee funds recovery in case of emergency. (...)

But I'm not the only one who is interested in Lykke. Compared to other projects that did an ICO Lykke has more Investors than most of them. But the situation is very different. Usually there is an ICO and then there is a lot of activity because of the question when it will launch, on which exchanges it will be, how the price will be etc. And once a project is on an exchange there is usually pressure on the team to release something to help the price etc.  This kind of activity is kind of missing until now, but more because of Lykkes strengths (it is the exchange, there was no time between end-of-ICO and launch and the price is pretty stable) and not because of weaknesses. I don't want to say it's good that there is a lack of activity, because more activity would generate more attention. But it's not a sign of people being disinterest. It's just patience.   Thing is: I have no doubt that the situation, when it's about attention and activity etc., will change hand in hand with development progress and other news that will come. What can be seen here are just the first steps. And it will most likely change very fast because this project is faster on fundamental side than others I know - and it's much bigger than most people think.",False

Lykke will be about forex-trading like Oanda, but because it runs on the blockchain there are kind of unlimited possibilities when it comes to assets.

Lykke targets everybody and will be a marketplace for potentially ""everything"". It also will be possible to send money very easy and fast from country to country. Let's say somebody in the USA wants to send his family in Africa money - that will be possible very easy, fast and cheap and very practicable, since Lykke will be regulated all over the world (Africa is already safe) and connected to banks. People will have much choice if they want to stay in Crypto (Bitcoin for example) or want to switch to the most useful Fiat-currency. That's one use-case besides investing in and trading Currencies and all kinds of assets.  It's a major aspect that Lykke will be very complete in my opinion and will make it as easy as possible for everybody to get access to all of those markets.  A plus is also the team of Lykke, especially Richard Olsen, because he already did with Oanda (Forex-exchange: https://www.oanda.com) what he wants to do in a larger scale and highly decentralized and ""easy-to-use-for-everybody"" with Lykke.

(not 30% - in CHF it's about 7% to the ICO price)  But: It's not a reaction on or a decision about Lykke, it's because of the rising Bitcoin-price.  But, what can be seen as positive is:  1. If there would be no reaction on the Bitcoin-price on Lykke it would be more a sign that it's not used. Or the other way around: The reaction on the Bitcoin price is hurtful of course, but it shows that Lykke is already on it's way to become a natural market with reactions on the whole context - in this scenario Bitcoin.  2. With 1. in mind: A rising Bitcoin-price can be seen as public-relation for free for all Bitcoin-related startups, and Lykke is one of them. Bitcoin is already more in the news and the media-echo is also much more positive as it was in 2013 for example. It becomes a serious Investment and also more and more people outside of Crypto think about it, because more and more people lose trust in Fiat-currencies. Why I say that: Lykke is a perfect solution for exactly that - a very ""easy-to-use-door"" into Bitcoin, into Crypto and into digital assets etc.  With other words: If Bitcoin should hype even more, it will supress all others even more. But it also will make PR for solutions like Lykke. And once Bitcoin will go down again (and that's a safe bet if it should develop a bubble), a lot of people will invest their Bitcoins into all kinds of quality-alts and LKK will be one of them.    The second point is my personal strategy in general, not just in LKK but also in some other projects I consider as pearls. I've invested in a way that it's something like a base for all kinds of scenarios. If BTC should be stable, the development-progress of those projects will drive the prices up. If Bitcoin should hype, I will take the loss in between, but BTC won't rise endless - and most likely a hyping Bitcoin-price will even lead into a fee-event (blocksize-problem) and that could even lead into a hard crash at a certain point.  And I've seen what happened to LTC in late 2013 once people began to anticipate that Bitcoin would go down: It exploded from a $50 M marketcap to $1 bn, because a lot of Bitcoin-Investors sent their money directly into other Cryptos. That will happen again and I even believe more extreme because now there are more really good projects in this eco-system.",False

And just to avoid potential misunderstandings: I help with community-communication but I'm not constantly in communication with the core-team since they are very busy. So take my posts as combination of what I know but also personal opinion when it's about questions like that ;-)    What I believe about all kinds of Blockchain-projects in general is: There always will be competition for all good ideas and solution and that won't end. I don't believe that there will be one project for a certain use-case that will be kind of ""unchallenged-on-top"" while others will be out of the game. But that's also not needed because there will be no lack of demand.     But what all projects really need is flexibility. If early decisions should turn out as barriers later - that could turn out as really bad because other newcomer-projects may find solutions to do the same in a more elegant and superior way and that would most likely turn out as a risk. But if a project is early while staying flexible at the same time, it can benefit a lot of what is called first-mover-advantage and has some chances to become a major-player.  And that's what I believe to see in Lykke because I know that they focus on quality but in combination with flexibility. It's something that Richard Olsen mentioned several times - the importance of flexibility. Also the open-source-aspect of Lykke is part of that and there are already much more people working on this than ""just"" the core-team and on all fronts: To get licenses all over the world for example, IATA is another example, the high activity in the Github of course, and so on.  There is some chance that Lykke will be the first project of this kind that will be available globally. And in combination with the easy-to-use-aspect plus the focus on security and for what it can be used - from private persons to companies - there already may be some first-mover-advantage.",False

Do you mean Bitcoin-exchanges?  Thing is that Lykke can be seen like a bridge between the established financial system (Forex-trading-platform - all kinds of Fiat-currencies) and the Crypto-space (Crypto-currencies and other digital assets as colored coins). What is very important: To get legal access worldwide (regulations, licenses) and that's a focus for Lykke right now.  It's about three major points:  - easy access because it's easy to use - secure - it's not a centralized platform but a network while the exchange is semi-decentralized - legal (Lykke aims to get licenses worldwide)  That is already different to what we know so far. There already are regulated Crypto-exchanges in nearly all countries but they are centralized and for different purposes. It usually needs more than just one exchange and whenever Fiat is involved it becomes complex. That may be not a big problem for those who already are familiar with Crypto but Lykke is not just about that. It's about giving easy and secure access to potentially everybody who is able to use a smartphone and/or a computer - and it's about giving choice since Lykke will give access to Fiat, Cryptocurrency and all kinds of digital assets.  It can be used to  - invest in value (with the aim for profit) - it can be used to send value - it can be used to store value securely.

Are you that new to Crypto or was there a reason to re-start with a fresh account? ;-)  But, I basically agree. ICO's always are a big risk since they usually are about new projects and it's never sure how a project plays out over time. This ICO at least always gave choice since it always was possible to sell back. And the reason why the price of LKK is below it's ICO-price is not disappointment about the project, or a reaction on a lack of progress how it's often the case in other projects. It's a reaction on the rising BTC-price.  The unusual situation of Lykke also may play a role since Lykke is it's own exchange and LKK is not a Poloniex-gamble - that would bring more attention of course. But I personally am not concerned and my prediction is: I won't lose money with this.   Btw: One year ago in September Factom launched on Polo. The price went below it's ICO-price short after launch and ""nobody"" seemed to care about Factom at all. The daily volume was below 5 BTC very often and there was some complaining about it on their thread. I bought whenever I had money and my cheapest price was 0.00018 BTC. The price right now is 6 times above ICO-price (which was 0.0005 BTC) in BTC and much more in Dollar, the ATH (0.008) was more than 10 times of the ICO in BTC (and, again: in Dollar it's even more since BTC is also higher).  What I want to say with that: Those who sold their Factoids below the ICO-price one year ago also were those who lost money - noobs how you call them. Those who bought and showed some patience made a lot.  Exactly that potential is why I bought into Lykke. I focus on projects I consider as pearls before a majority pays attention.",False

I believe that there is no device that is ever totally safe as long as there is a connection to the internet.

When it comes to Lykke: I'm not totally sure right now, but I believe at least it might already be possible to do the step with the 12-backup-words offline. But, more important: Of course it's work in progress and they really have a focus on security and also user friendliness and Lykke also won't be just about App's in the future.  Lykke is one of those projects that will grow in many ways/directions significantly and it's hard to know exactly how it will look in future. It's much more complex as it might seem now and also already bigger than many recognize. But I believe progress will happen pretty fast in comparison to others, because of the big team that is working on this.",False

I believe the answer is ""yes"". The reason is: Usually a big project like this publishes the idea (whitepaper etc.) and does an ICO without much real to show on development-side. After the ICO it takes some time until launch and the tokens hit an exchange, in best case Poloniex. Polo is also kind of an attention-booster. All projects, even much smaller ones, benefit from that.  Lykke is the other way around: They go step by step more into the public while they've already delivered a lot, so they are able to sell LKK on their own platform. That's a big pro in comparison to others who just sell future-promises. But when it comes to the factor ""attention"" it doesn't get the quick boost. It's more slowly increasing for some time, but I believe at a certain point it will explode in combination with big news, that will come without doubt.   Thing is: If I'm right with that, Lykke will have much much more volume in future and that won't be just LKK since it's about digital assets in general plus forex-trading (like Richard Olsen did with https://www.oanda.com/lang/de/). And THAT (high volume on Lykke) will make LKK even more to a buy. And that might be the point when other exchanges could join the game.",False

It's somehow similar to import private keys into a Bitcoin-Wallet.   From the FAQ's:  Is it safe to keep my Lykke coins in my Lykke wallet long-term?  We think so. While Apple phones have very good security preventing any malware from recovering data from an app, you should keep a lock code on your phone and take other measures to prevent people from accessing your wallet. It is very important to create paper backup of your wallet - just write down 12 words seed. This seed will help you to recover your private key in case your device is lost or stolen.  Is it possible to use the wallet to do an offline cold storage?  Assuming there is no malware already on your computer or phone, there are two ways to do that:  Be sure to save the twelve-word password of your wallet in a few different places, then delete the wallet from your phone. You can always re-download it and recover your coins using the password. Send your coins to a Coinprism wallet and back up your private key there to an offline device. https://lykke.com/city/blog/2016-10-05/lykke_ico_faq",False

One reason is most likely the Bitcoin-price. Since the ICO has ended until now the Bitcoin-price is up about $100 and problem is often (also visible on Poloniex) that a rising Bitcoin often leads to overreactions. A lot of Altcoins went down more then Bitcoin went up. I'm glad that LKK is not that much affected like some other investments I'm in.  But in general: The LKK-price will rise once Lykke will get more attention and once more people understand it's potential and when some important milestones are met (on development side but also regarding regulations etc.). And that will happen over time and most likely with increasing pace, because at one point one leads to the other. Progress will lead to more attention and more attention to more use and a rising price and a rising price leads to more attention and there already will be more incentive to use it and to buy LKK and so on.  And before all: Once the dynamic I'm speaking about will set in, it also will lead to more user-participation when it comes to spreading the word. More feedback on all channels (retweets, more activity here or on reddit etc.). Lykke will become more visible and more attractive.

In general investing is always a risk and we are in a ""high-risk-market"", but in comparison to other projects, I'm convinced that Lykke is one of a very few pearls. Since I'm in Crypto (2013) I looked into a lot of projects and I personally focus very much on the teams behind because in my opinion it needs it all:  1. A great idea 2. Skilled people who are able to develop and deliver 3. Skills on the business-side 4. In best case connections 5. Honesty  And Nr 5 could also be Point 1, because nothing is worth anything if a team is dishonest and just in the game to make money on the back of their investors and the market. In Crypto are a lot of projects that are no clear scams but at the same time shady and some could even be called ""long-term-scams"".  Lykke is really different and much better than everything I've seen so far, because everybody already can see proof for all those points. I don't know of any project that already has delivered so much before going into the public. And what they really care about, more than other Crypto-projects is ""consumer-friendliness"" - it is already visible that they focus very much on useful design and easy-to-use-aspects to lower all possible barriers that could avoid wider usage. Additionally: Security.  And in my opinion that are two points that are still missing in Crypto which is a problem for wider adoption in general (Bitcoin included).  When it comes to the business-side and connections: Especially because of their founder/CEO, Richard Olsen, it's more than just potential. I mean, he is co-founder and former CEO of oanda and like a combination of ""market-scientist"" and businessman and also idealist and he is very respected since decades - he as a person is already a bridge between the worlds (Crypto - established system).   I even believe that this could go viral. Reason is especially the combination of:  1. userfriendly 2. security  Plus: Constantly increasing demand in general.  And what is underrated even in Crypto is the potential of digital assets as colored coins. Most Crypto-Investors focus on Cryptocurrencies or other tokens like ETH-Gas etc. But the ""real economy"" will focus on solutions to trade real value they can issue easily as colored coins.  So far I can't see any weaknesses...",False

A market-making model which is based on the flows of buys and sells, determines the price of LKK. The fiat prices are determined by tapping into deep liquidity pools.

In the forex market the orderbook will not give much information, since you need the aggregation across the worlds markets. Lykke competes in the FX market against venues which move billions per day, and the market has a different character than Cryptocurrency marketplace. Lykke's market structure is very different from also the regulatory perspective. Maybe to make it simpler to understand you can think of it this way: Lykke wants to be an alternative to New York stock exchange, London stock exchange, etc. and the global marketplace. Although in currencies, people don't even quite know that there is Reuters/FXAll, etc. Note that LKK market and the ColoredCoin market are very different asset classes in this regard. No crypto-exchange so far has a full license (what Lykke has for the Asian market). Bitstamp e.g. has acquired some license status, but its not the same. Bittrex in that sense is unregulated.

People will naturally assume that there is a password recovery feature should they forget their password (which they always do). This is going to create a lot of trouble as people end up being locked out of their wallet upon losing/changing phone or inadvertently logging out of their wallet without making sure they know the password. It is critical that the wallet app explain unambiguously that the wallet itself will become unusable should people forget their password and that Lykke won't be able to recover it. The wallet app should also require people to backup their private key on paper (and put it in a safe place without showing it to anyone) so that they always have a last resort mean to recover their wallet should they lose their smartphone and forget their password and/or pin. Please Lykke make sure your app is fool proof. It will look bad to regulatory authorities if shareholders come complaining that they are not being able to exercise their rights as shareholders due to technical reasons like losing access to one's crypto wallet.  Another issue I see is that although the app allows you to backup your private key as a brain wallet, it doesn't currently offer a way to restore the wallet using said private key. At least I haven't seen anything like that after removing the app and trying to recover from the private key.  Last but not least Lykke needs a desktop wallet and this wallet should be open source and compile under Linux, Mac and Windows. Smartphone security is shaky at best, and nobody in their right mind is going to trust their smartphone with 5-digit figures, like what some people are probably investing in this ICO. I for one feel really uneasy about that. I have never trusted my smartphone with more funds than I usually have in cash in my physical wallet (so a few hundred dollars at most), and refuse to use Paypal or credit card from it for fear of this information being compromised. It feels really awkward to suddenly have to trust this poorly secured device with a large sum and hope it's going to be alright.  One more thing: I understand that LKK and other Lykke exchange based assets are really OpenAssets colored coins. Does that mean that they can be sent to any Bitcoin address and controlled using another OpenAssets client unrelated to Lykke? If that's the case it could be a solution to ship a desktop wallet quicker as developments could be based on some existing OpenAssets implementation.",False

What the price will be, I can just tell you what I personally expect but don't take it as prediction:  I don't expect something like a hype how we've often seen it when a project launches on Poloniex months after they've done on ICO. Lykke is different in nearly all aspects. It's not a hype but what we can see is increasing attention. The ICO also is no hype ICO but what is likely: Longterm-Investors bought while short-term oriented Investors most likely are carefully - because there is not that much attention.  One could see as negative that there is not that much attention yet to expect huge volume and high volatility but my personal opinion is that Lykke has a stable base on all important fronts. Great fundamentals and very fast progress, most likely more real supporters as Investors then just short-term-speculators (why I don't expect much sell-pressure) and what I believe are key-aspects: Lykke will be very attractive also for those who didn't even think about buying LKK yet, because it will be used from typical Bitcoin and Ethereum-Speculators and even more interesting for the future are digital assets as colored coins, and the both key-aspects:  1) security 2) easy to use  If I think about the price it means this (my personal expectation):  The more people will use Lykke because they want to buy BTC or ETH or another Digital Asset, the more ppl will make the experience that it's a great platform and LKK-shares become attractive. I expect that a lot of future users will become LKK-Investors.",False

I want to invest in some Lykke coins and give my support to the project but I am having difficulty in doing so.  Credit card payments are not easy and straightforward as advertised on the site...you have to go via a third party to buy a USD voucher, and for a one-off purchase, this third party wants you to register an account with them, asking you for a username, password, full name, full address, verified email, verified mobile phone and date of birth.  This is as much information as one would provide to Lykke and is more than some of my banking institutions have, but to simply purchase a USD voucher with your credit card that is immediately converted into Lykke coins anyway, I feel the process is excessive and intrusive and potentially discourages small investors who may not use BTC etc.  I am certainly discouraged...  Lykke support mentioned to me when I wrote to them that they may be able to process a credit card transaction manually but there was no clarification about how to do this.  I also had some trouble understanding the English clearly in the email.  I am aware that I can purchase in Bitcoin, but all of that is new to me.  I looked at my local exchange and realized after looking through their FAQ's and how things worked that their spread was circa 5% - so in essence simply to buy 0.5 BTC for example I'd be looking at fees of about $15-$20 USD (depending on how I deposit funds to them) Way too high in my view and certainly doesn't give me confidence that cryptocurrency is bringing down transaction fees.  Ridiculous.  In short, I am left with asking someone else to purchase Lykke for me.  My questions to you are (specifically Lykke X who I note is a regular on here, and ""tempus"" who also helps out a lot) if it is possible at the moment to transfer lykke coins from one lykke wallet to another one.  I don't see anything on the app or on the FAQ on the website that indicates this, but surely I'm wrong?  LKK to LKK should be an instant transfer, cost-free right?  With this confirmation I'll probably have a solution to this problem by asking a friend for a favor.  Alternatively, if there is a way before the deadline that I can pay by credit card without the excessive requirements of the ""creditvoucher"" company (who I've never heard of and wouldn't want to give so much information without assurances of exactly who they are and why they would need it to buy a voucher!) please do let me know.  I'm totally new to bitcoin, the crypto world etc, but I agree with the idea of disruption in financial services!  Thus far though I don't see any barriers coming down at all - in fact, this ""simple"" credit card transaction has been harder than at any point for me in the last 15 years.  Look forward to a response.  Thanks.",False

What Lykke will be about in that context:  R.O.: ""Lykke addresses issues that regulators wanted to solve for decades – we are highlighting these features: new type of matching engine based on price, time and spread priority, which addresses the risk of flash crashes, intraday interest payments, which ensures intraday liquidity during periods of stress, ability of immediate settlement, which is a continuous clearing system for all types of asset classes and can address the issue of too big to fail. We highlight, why our exchange can solve problems of the existing financial system and then last but not least prepare our applications in a meticulous fashion – we have some excellent lawyers, who support us.""    This also says a lot about Lykke and how it's different to what we know from usual Crypto-projects and ICO's   Q.: What is your strategy to build user growth? Lykke hasn’t got that much attention until now, could you discuss your marketing and partner acquisition strategy?  R.O.: ""I did not want to go around with power point slides and pitch abstract ideas – I wanted to deliver products and let products speak for themselves. We use state of the art technology that is highly abstract and difficult to comprehend. As with smartphones and all the apps – they speak for themselves. We want to build a viral product. In addition, we are building three other services that will support our marketing efforts: a competition platform, where we do crowd sourcing for all our services….in this way we have people that contribute to the Lykke project from around the world and they will all be our ambassadors. In addition, I am dreaming of a open access publication platform with prize cascades for the best contribution of the last hour, last six hours, last 24 hours, week, month etc…these cascades reward contributors and editors. This will hopefully attract top quality unbiased news content which is important input to a free and efficient market place. Third, I want us to build a Wikipedia for BigData – a simulation and real time environment for forecasts, trading recommendation with a crowd-based approach. Innovation and stellar products should drive users to our services…and finally our strategy of being open and transparent – we try to be authentic.""   About Ethereum and other Blockchains:  Q: Will Lykke be fully built on the Ethereum platform? And if so, will you be considering using other blockchain platforms?  R.O.: ""Yes, this is key for us to integrate Ethereum – so this is one of our big projects in the coming months. We will be very user driven and will integrate all the blockchain platforms that have significant traction. We think that is important to integrate – the success of the blockchain revolution depends on building an efficient and inclusive market place, which is fair in the true word and everyone has access to and get an efficient price for his digital asset.""

LKK represent shares of a semi-decentralized exchange. Out of their (Lykke-team) perspective it would be kind of weird to develop this project and to ask other exchanges if they would add LKK.

If that is expensive or cheap - it's impossible to say that and nobody else can decide for you. What an Investor buys is future potential like always.  But I can tell you my personal view on Lykke in comparison to other ICO's.  Not sure if you've heard about Augur: https://www.augur.net It is about a prediction-market-platform. The ICO price was at about $0.53 if my information-source is correct. Right now it trades at $7 and a marketcap of > $70 m.  And I don't know much about that project but as far as I know it is more about a promise yet. In my opinion it is a hype. Maybe one with potential but I don't see much to say ""yeah nice price, it should be above $70 m!""  Lykke is already there. It is a working exchange. There is proof that they are able to build user-friendly applications and there is already proof that they are very fast in development. If LKK already would trade on an exchange since months, the price would have exploded with the release of their App. I'm sure about that because that is how Crypto-markets react. The market also would react on every word of Richard Olsen, a man who has much experience as founder and CEO (Oanda - forex trading). Even more it will be about the expertise and connections of him and his team in all kind of important areas.  If I try to find weaknesses I see only one until now: A lack of attention. But I also know that they see this ICO just as a first step into the public. It's not even that much about money. If I try to find reasons why this should fail - not be used, I really find nothing. Because: Even those who don't want to invest and even more those who don't know about Lykke at all, will find interesting what this platform will offer. Everybody can use it for free - zero fee. And nobody needs to store his money on an exchange and live in fear of hacks etc.  There are so many incentives while they are very good in removing barriers that I have no doubt that it will be used. And when that starts it's nearly a safe prediction that it will grow and grow and grow. And in my opinion it's about two main-aspects:  1. Access for everyone - userfriendly (still very rare in Crypto) 2. Security - people want to feel safe and that is very hard in Crypto and beyond  And that's why I invest. I see as ""proof-of-abilities"" what already is delivered. But what I buy is the potential I believe to see. And while nothing is without risk, this is unlikely to fail if I compare it with other projects that want the same while Lykke is superior on all fronts I know of.",False

I will definitely look into this more before I invest anything. It looks very good I've installed the exchange and wow. If this works It could go worldwide as really big. Especially if margin trading will be available. I can't wait for this to come out . Will be a rocket launch  Do you know if they will have a website too ? Android and Ios app is probably why this ICO has not reached their goal yet. Also can this LKK be mined ? as 1.2B coins is quiet a lot and will be interested in mining these coins.  Thanks.,False

But after installing it I also thought ""wow!"". I really like user-friendly applications because I know that it's not easy to improve complexity into something that everybody can use.  1) Margin Trading: is already on their roadmap:  * Margin trading (Q4 2016) * Regulated retail FX (Q4 2016) * Offchain settlement scalable to 100’000+ transactions per second (Q4 2016) * Ethereum support: multisig wallets, interblockchain atomic swaps (Q1 2017) * Payment system provider (Q2 2017) * Regulated institutional FX (Q3 2017) * Fixed income products, commodities (Q3 2017) * 1 billion USD average daily volume (Q4 2017)   2) Yes, there will be a web-based terminal while the private key will stay on the phone. It will also be possible to generate keys offline to be secure.   3) No, LKK can't be mined. It's not a typical altcoin as cryptocurrency. In my opinion it's much better: LKK --> shares of the company. If successful they will pay dividends.

But it's true, it is a very skilled team. They have experts for all important areas: https://lykke.com/leadership.php  And it's also true that their goal may seem ambitious, but I'll give you some informations that may put things into perspective:  Richard Olsen (the CEO of Lykke) is the Co-founder and former CEO of Oanda: https://www.oanda.com  Oanda is a forex-trading platform:  ""OANDA is an outgrowth of the Swiss Olsen Group and was created to serve as an internet trading platform to automate techniques based on the group's research in foreign exchange trading.[3] Much of OANDA's technology is based on algorithms published in the book High Frequency Finance,[4] which was co-authored by Dr. Richard Olsen, a principal of OANDA and co-inventor of these algorithms."" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oanda_Corporation   What I want to say with that is: Lykke won't be just a Crypto-exchange like Poloniex. It can be seen more like a bridge or a door between both worlds, and when it comes to Crypto it won't most likely be that much about smaller Crypto-currencies like they are listed on Polo, Bittrex or other Multi-Currency-exchanges, but more about colored coins - digital assets (but also about forex-trading).  Richard Olsen gave a very insightful interview what Lykke will be about here:  The Future Of Currency https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmZBtKL7ZcM   And if you count that all together, it could very well be that Lykke will be like Oanda on the one side (established financial system) and about digital assets on the blockchain.  And what I believe is really huge potential:  - more secure than usual exchanges because semi-decentralized - very userfriendly  Those two points are key-aspects in my opinion. Because everybody, if already in Crypto or not, is on the search for ""feeling safe"" and ""I'm able to handle it"". Both is still missing for a lot of people while the combination of both is pretty invincible. And there already is proof that they are able to build that. It is an already working product and I have no doubt that they will continue with fast progress and improvements on all fronts.",False

Issuers can offer the solution to their customers without needing to build the infrastructure for themselves.  If banks trade fiat currencies, which is the biggest market in the world by nominal volume circa 5 trillion/day, they only can settle within 2 days. With Lykke's solution they can settle within 60 minutes. There can also be many advantages from the customers point of view compared to a traditional bank deposit. People in mainstream finance see the benefit of that, but they don't have an idea how it relates to Cryptocurrencies and speak of private blockchain. With Lykke institutions can issue ColoredCoins which are essentially IOU's and settle these between them, in a much more efficient manner.

If we think about the risk that early Investors could sell - that was one of my initial concerns, but I doubt it now after I've learned more about this. Early Investors are usually strong supporters and that is most likely even more true for this project.  The key-point will be user-growth. And that is the aspect I'm generally very optimistic. Until now Lykke doesn't get that much attention, but until now they also didn't make much marketing but they've build a stable base for it on all fronts. In the opposite to other projects, the fundamentals are already there. Plus they have access to the established financial system, Lykke can be like a bridge between the worlds.  And: Since absolutely everything (and in all areas) is about security and user-friendliness, Lykke is superior to all other Blockchain-projects I know so far.

Quote Quote from: bones on September 28, 2016, 11:53:01 AM Could you explain why here you say. So ICO price is 3x higher than the earliest funding rounds  First funding round was in July 2015 at not disclosed price for 500k CHF.  Second round of funding was at 0.014 CHF in March 2016 (corrected spelling).  The 0.004 CHF per LKK was the price in December associated with the competition. Participants of the marketplace competition received LKK at this price and could choose to convert to CHF. It was possible to buy at 0.14 CHF in March, but I think not many chose to do so.",False

Many have asked the same question and in that answer the statement was incorrect. ICO price is 0.05 CHF, and ask price in March was 0.014 CHF. Price in August was 0.025-0.05 CHF. This refers to LKK price. 100 LKK = 1 share.  To explain the issue more. There exists currently no ColoredCoin exchange. So it was not possible to float the price right from the start. Now that Lykke exists it is possible to trade ColoredCoins. Coinprism allowed Lykke to create LKK and transfer them, but not price them. So to bootstrap everything Lykke relied on smaller transactions. Now that everything is in place LKK can float soon. We're currently implementing the matching algorithms for LKK, which are different from the fiat ColoredCoin matching algorithms.",False

We also talked on phone and he - tried to - explain me some of the economical aspects behind Lykke and that is one of the most interesting stuff in this project. But I'm not able to explain it because I didn't understand it totally myself. It's way too complex but what I can say is: He is really an expert. Same is true for other members of his team. For himself that's not a secret, because there is a lot to find about him on the internet.  Another thing was that he reassured me that this absolutely not a project to make money for a few. They will be fair to all Investors and I personally have no doubts about the honesty of the whole team.  Then he also explained that Lykke as a project is different, also regarding leadership and ""going into the public"". They want to do it step by step, without much pressure but not slowly - with increasing intensity. One of my critics was a lack of attention and that I'm unsure about the price after the ICO because of that etc. But they have a plan and since I've learned more I believe it will work out. He also told me that they don't focus on selling the ICO since Lykke is well funded. The ICO is more a first step into the public. Another guy of his team called it ""first test"". And like everybody can see: Without artificially hype. It's more about building a natural dynamic and that all aspects, one after another, will work together.  This is the mail I've already quoted:  Quote from: tempus on September 22, 2016, 06:34:52 PM (...)  Richard Olsen - CEO of Lykke:   ""The wholle Bitcoin Movement is inspired by the vision to replace human decision making with software algorithms. Algorithms are better, because the cannot be manipulated.  Nick Szabo gave an excellent talk at our Zurich event, where he explained his long-term vision of mapping the subtelty of the legal system that has evolved over thousands of years into software code. Nick highlighted the diffuculty of this task - a good legal system is highly refined and we cannot easily create software code that has all the subtelty of our legal system. The short comings were clearly visible in the DAO event.  I am approaching the issue in the following way:  Lykke follows a really big vision - I want to disrupt financial markets and create a fair playing field accessible for everyone. This is much more than just a matching engine with a user interface and an interface to blockchain - we talk about creating legal entities around the world, complex financial engineering, building a brand, hiring people, all the pushbacks from incumbents that want to make our lives difficult...a long list.  We have to kick off big projects that are essential for the project to fly - I will highlight just two projects: we need to build a open access publication platform for news stories in different channels...a transparent financial market only works in context of independent high quality reporting. Today, the news industry is highly monopolized and starved from independent reporting - I plan to create an open access publication platform, where prizes are available for the best contribution of the past hour, past 6 hours, past 24 hours, past 1 week, past month, past quarter, past year - the prize cascades have a dual function - they reward the author and his editor...it is easy to win an hour prize...more difficult to win a whole cascade. The prizes are good ranking tool of the quality of reports and incentivize the contributors. We plan to create many different news channels. I want to build a truly independent news reporting platform with Economist-like channels, a long list.... To evaluate companies and other assets with all the financial instruments - in depth reporting is essential.  Another big project is a bigdata information system - we live in the world of 'digital data', but there is no global informaiton system with real time forecasts for all the digital data that is being collected. In weather forecasting this is standard - big data models collect the meteorological data and then generate detailed weather forecasts around the world. The same has to happen with all the digital data that society is collecting. I dream of a Wikipedia for big data - the real time information system then feeds the risk management system, which are then used to price financial instruments, etc. Today, there does not exist a big data information system - central bankers continue to rely on ad hoc collected data, excel spread sheets, etc.  Sorry to say - it is just crazy how the financial world today functions. I want to clean up the mess and introduce highest quality standards at all levels. I have a very clear vision of how I can make all this happen...it is an exciting journey, but much more complex than a simple software code that tells us, if this happens, then do this....we are in a hugely multi-dimensional space.  Any investor, who buys Lykke coins runs a big risk - he depends on the judgement of the Lykke team, its core investors, my own capabilities...to increase the likelihood of success I am building Lykke to be extremely fragile - all our software is open source, if people are not happy with what we are doing, they can just copy the code and start a competing company that does better work. There are not sharholder agreements that prevent people from selling...this is good, because anyone can sell when he wants, i.e. voting with his feet...this sends an immediate signal to everyone and forces Lykke to regroup...  In building Lykke I am inspired by biology - I try to implement subtle mechanisms that bring Lykke back into its dynamic equilibrium.  There is another question: strictly speaking the Lykke coins are an entitlement to Lykke shares - they are a digital representation of Lykke shares. To become a full shareholder, the owner has to reveal his name to Lykke - this is a legal requirement from Swiss law. It is more efficient to just deal with colored coins, because then we can take advantage of the full digital efficiency. We will pay dividends, etc. to Lykke coin holders.""",False

In the first seed stages there was essentially zero interest - very few enthusiasts and supporters have build the project to what can be seen now. If an ICO investor now contributes funding, the company is in an entirely different form where a lot of the risk is gone. Yes, it would have been profitable to invest in seed stage.

So ICO price is 3x higher than the earliest funding rounds       But here you say  LKK is worth 0.012 CHF (mid price), up from 0.004 recently    Quote from: LykkeX on March 18, 2016, 10:23:22 AM There exist  1,250,000,000 Lykke coins (LKK). 100 coins represent 1 share in the legal entity. Lykke AG is based in Zurich Switzerland. The founder of the project is public and has considerable background, having founded Oanda, one of the largest Forex brokers, see [1]. The total outstanding LKK is valued at 15M CHF, so that each LKK is worth 0.012 CHF (mid price), up from 0.004 recently. The LKK can be currently converted in a manual process to CHF. It is currently in discussion how the exchange to BTC will happen, since the exchange hasn't launched yet, but is planned for release in Q1 or Q2 2016.  In terms of distribution it is perhaps difficult to compare with Proof-of-work or Proof-of-stake system. LKK does not have its own blockchain, but uses the Bitcoin blockchain. The exchange of tokens can happen off-chain. In that sense it is more like a traditional corporation, as it also registered as such. The reason to own the token would be to to expect return in form of fees earned from the marketplace. It is currently a startup project, but the initial phase is nearing completion. The wider project was launched last year in an open format October 2015 (see [2]). There are currently 10-20 people actively working in the project. The closest analogy is a crowd-based exchange, rather than a purely centralised exchange. It is not a decentralised exchange in the sense of Counterparty or Mastercoin, etc.  While getting wider circulating of LKK is also a goal, programmatic distribution in the sense of the known currency systems is not planned. Tokens can either be bought on a market, or earned through contributions.  For the concept and also source-code, I'd encourage anyone to have a look at the wiki and ask questions here. We're currently building on OpenAssets and NBitcoin, but also keep track of all the developments.

But I wouldn't count much on the fee and I don't believe in the ""bridge-currency"", because in most cases that won't be needed. It's possible to trade anything against anything and I doubt that a bank will buy into XRP, which is unstable, to use that as bridge. And even if that should happen in some scenarios I don't see any indicator to evaluate XRP or how it's connected to the value of the company. Of course, it's possible that I'm wrong here, but until now I consider xrp-as-fee as the only safe thing to say.  And if I understand their system correctly, it's not even close to a blockchain but relies on too much trust into people.   Quote   I agree that Lykke offers similar benefits but with the addition of making LKK coins. Either way, if you think about it, 10k LKK coins would be 100 shares in a company that it's on its beginnings. Without proper earnings yet it's hard to give a valuation on what would be the proper value for a single share, we know there are more than 100m shares basically and more than 1 LKK billion coins.  Lykke already has a working project and it's cheap enough to invest in my opinion, it's much less risky than other ICOs. However, I don't see x4-5 ICO prices any time soon since there's zero buzz about it and one can say the current price is fair if you put it all together without doing any predictions on potential. Many thinking this is just another ICO with some russian guys in a garage playing crypto with nothing to show for may think it's overvalued, 1000-2000k sats would be more adequate and I could agree with that if this was the case.  But I think we can all agree Lykke is already way ahead...  That they can issue new coins was my major concern. But if we compare it again with Ripple: Ripple won't create more XRP but the company holds the majority of the total supply while I don't see much connection of XRP value to the value of the company. Both companies can inflate the market, but Lykke as company would lose in value if they would do that careless.  Under the line trust is always the major point in all of those projects and that's also true for pure Cryptocurrencies without premine and without ICO because there is no lack of dirty tricks to make a quick buck on the back of Investors.  And regarding trust I had the advantage that Richard Olsen personally explained me a lot about it all. He didn't do that with the intention to convince me to invest, more because in one way he liked my (critical) feedback, but also recognized that I had some misconceptions. And I can understand that others may not have the trust like I have now, but my recommendation is: Those who think about the question if they want to invest in this project, should also focus on exactly that while doing research. There are a lot of informations about Richard Olsen and also others of his team.  Good to begin with is this:  The Future Of Currency Lykke Wallet is the new project from Oanda. Built using Blockchain technology, it could revolutionise currency and how we pay for things, Richard Olsen, CEO and Founder, Lykke. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmZBtKL7ZcM  To get an impression about his vision, this speech is great:  The power of the small world phenomenon | Richard Olsen | TEDxZurich https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKzjwV_N68I  In the description of the video are already a lot of good infos about him.  Overall there is no lack of information about him and his team and what they're trying to build here. And I believe it's really important to get an impression about them and what they want, to come to a decision if to invest or not.   *************  But: Besides the question if somebody wants to invest in this or not, there is simply another major point: It's for users and it already is usable. I really believe, that this will have impact. Because if I don't think about LKK but if I would like to see this project grow the answer is a big yes. I'm paranoid. I hate it to have much value on exchanges and that's why I always deposit and withdraw and so on. Additionally there are a lot of projects without good wallets yet and it's a never ending story of importing private keys (cold storage) to get something on an exchange and so on. Somehow I like it because there is a good learning curve by doing all that, but what I know: There is still no solution for the average user in place and that is true for 99% of all what's out there. And this project is different and will most likely give access to a lot of different assets, from Crypto, colored coins to Fiat (FX).  And one thing I always focus on are reasons why something won't be used. I call that barriers and there are a lot of possible barriers (lack of trust - psychological, lack of abilities - fundamental, lack of accuracy - fundamental ...etc.). And until now I don't see any barriers in this project. It's just hard to get attention and to get traction but with such a base it's just a matter of time.",False

Factom targets companies, institutions and even governments with their ""honesty-system"" and so on.  But what I figured in Factom and really liked and still find fascinating: They did a very good job in removing all kind of barriers that could prevent wider usage. Especially their economical design is genius in my opinion, with the conversion from the system-currency (Factoids) that can fluctuate, into the fixed in price and non-transferable software license (Entry Credits) - and the cryptocurrency is burned through that process. Even banks don't have to think about all issues crypto can be about (volatility, regulatory issues, security/hacks etc.). And the value of  Factoids will reflect the usage and react on good news because of speculation.  That being said: I see that principle in Lykke as well but of course in a different way. They are also very good in removing all kind of barriers that might prevent wider usage. And in contrast to Factom, Lykke has no limit regarding it's target group (in fact, Factom also is not limited but they don't focus on the private persons yet). And the combination of easy-to-use and ""feeling safe""/security in it's fundamentals is really great in this project.  And what I said above about companies and that trust in a team is the major point is also true for both. Both teams are very skilled regarding the fundamentals (tech and also the business-side). Both teams have good connections. And: Both teams show some idealism as well. That's a mix I always like but it's really hard to find.    ************* By the way: My prediction is that Lykke and Factom will form a partnership someday. Would be a perfect fit in my opinion, because Lykke could do this with Factom:  ""Factom gives you the ability to publish immutable data AND establish yourself as an authority that publishes immutable data. Over time, the validity of that data can be judged and your reputation as an Oracle can be cemented. Factom also by its nature is accountable because one can conduct full audits on all published data."" https://www.factom.com/blog/smartcontract-factom-announce-collaboration  And both last deals of Factom are about publishing stock-data (Intrinio and DataYes).  Not sure if Lykke would need another system but if ... I would like to see them coming together. ;-)",False

I'm also a recent FCT guy and bought my share at 200k and below before it pumped for good. To me it's still the most undervalued real working project in crypto. I still think XRP will have a market, especially a forex one, they have their license. I don't buy into the whole banks will buy it up until $10 each but there's a reason for it to exist. I think you can say the same thing about XRP and Ripple and Bitcoin and Blockchain. Ripple is much more suitable for a lot of stuff than the blockchain, it really is and it's an amazing technology, you should read more about it. The problem is that it clashes directly with the philosophy behind most cryptocurrencies. This makes XRP some sort of hedge in my crypto portfolio.

All the other ICO's I didn't buy, like Waves and Rise and Heath and whatever.   And yes, attention is missing here. But what I know now is that they don't need to sell the ICO. It's more a first step into the public and without much marketing. But I have no doubt that they are able to bang the drums if needed.  But in general there are a lot of indications that there might be several big news. Just what they'll release in the coming weeks and months, if there won't be delays, will be big. Plus the IATA-conference etc. They have connections into the business-world, so it's likely that there will be good news and it's likely that they won't ever need the usual crypto-marketing like Lisk did it near to perfection.",False

Kordek is very young) but I also have some concerns. I'm not sure about the whole idea in general. At one hand I like the sidechain-concept, on the other hand I'm not so sure that there will be much App-Development and until now I don't fully understand if that is really decentralized concept for App's or not and not even why App's necessarily should be. Some certainly, others maybe not. I really don't know if it's a idea that will be big or is already doomed - but that's maybe more because of my own lack of knowledge.  Safe is in my opinion: They won't give up any time soon. They will do their best and that's a reason why I think Lisk is something worth to watch.   Quote I got some Antshares for the exact same reasons you mentioned. I think it does have some long term potential too since anything attached to China could be huge for obvious reasons. This and their team and connections is what sold me. Don't really know much else. I was looking since months for a good decentralized - exchange - concept and ANS was the first one that convinced me because of the skilled team and it's obvious that they didn't start with it just 2 weeks before the ICO but years before. I believe it's a good concept and I also like their eco-design (ANS as shares and fixed supply plus ANC as a coin like Gas which will be paid out to ANS-holders) and I know that they are taken seriously in China. What I'm unsure about is the blockchain itself. I believe to see the risk that it could be pretty much centralized or centralize over time since it's about voting the servers in and I believe that could be corrupted with voting-power.  Since I found Lykke I really prefer this concept, because it does make sense to keep it semi-decentralized or semi-centralized built on the Bitcoin-blockchain. It's more effective with the matching engine and the Bitcoin-Blockchain is more secure at the same time. At least Bitcoin is not easy to corrupt.   Quote     What do you think about Iconomi, I personally feel they should take a look at Lykke if they really want to make some good investments for their upcoming funds   I have no clue about Iconomi. I looked into it but I'm really unsure. One thing is: It's an Ethereum-coin and I have a lot of doubts about Ethereum in general. TheDAO was very revealing about many aspects, from rushed out tech combined with weaknesses of Ethereum itself to an idealistic concept on one side, which was funded and hyped up by Ethereum-guys itself on the other, with the goal to fund other Ethereum-projects ...and right after the hack they bailed it out and so on. Of course, Iconomi is not theDAO but just the way they praise it with ""high profits"" and so on is a style I don't like.   It is something I will watch, but I won't buy into their ICO.",False

I also had a lot of questions and Richard Olsen explained a lot in a mail. He allowed me to quote him in this thread.  So I will do that again, because it can clear up some misconceptions. I'll highlight the lines about LKK (last few lines).    Richard Olsen - CEO of Lykke:   ""The wholle Bitcoin Movement is inspired by the vision to replace human decision making with software algorithms. Algorithms are better, because the cannot be manipulated.  Nick Szabo gave an excellent talk at our Zurich event, where he explained his long-term vision of mapping the subtelty of the legal system that has evolved over thousands of years into software code. Nick highlighted the diffuculty of this task - a good legal system is highly refined and we cannot easily create software code that has all the subtelty of our legal system. The short comings were clearly visible in the DAO event.  I am approaching the issue in the following way:  Lykke follows a really big vision - I want to disrupt financial markets and create a fair playing field accessible for everyone. This is much more than just a matching engine with a user interface and an interface to blockchain - we talk about creating legal entities around the world, complex financial engineering, building a brand, hiring people, all the pushbacks from incumbents that want to make our lives difficult...a long list.  We have to kick off big projects that are essential for the project to fly - I will highlight just two projects: we need to build a open access publication platform for news stories in different channels...a transparent financial market only works in context of independent high quality reporting. Today, the news industry is highly monopolized and starved from independent reporting - I plan to create an open access publication platform, where prizes are available for the best contribution of the past hour, past 6 hours, past 24 hours, past 1 week, past month, past quarter, past year - the prize cascades have a dual function - they reward the author and his editor...it is easy to win an hour prize...more difficult to win a whole cascade. The prizes are good ranking tool of the quality of reports and incentivize the contributors. We plan to create many different news channels. I want to build a truly independent news reporting platform with Economist-like channels, a long list.... To evaluate companies and other assets with all the financial instruments - in depth reporting is essential.  Another big project is a bigdata information system - we live in the world of 'digital data', but there is no global informaiton system with real time forecasts for all the digital data that is being collected. In weather forecasting this is standard - big data models collect the meteorological data and then generate detailed weather forecasts around the world. The same has to happen with all the digital data that society is collecting. I dream of a Wikipedia for big data - the real time information system then feeds the risk management system, which are then used to price financial instruments, etc. Today, there does not exist a big data information system - central bankers continue to rely on ad hoc collected data, excel spread sheets, etc.  Sorry to say - it is just crazy how the financial world today functions. I want to clean up the mess and introduce highest quality standards at all levels. I have a very clear vision of how I can make all this happen...it is an exciting journey, but much more complex than a simple software code that tells us, if this happens, then do this....we are in a hugely multi-dimensional space.  Any investor, who buys Lykke coins runs a big risk - he depends on the judgement of the Lykke team, its core investors, my own capabilities...to increase the likelihood of success I am building Lykke to be extremely fragile - all our software is open source, if people are not happy with what we are doing, they can just copy the code and start a competing company that does better work. There are not sharholder agreements that prevent people from selling...this is good, because anyone can sell when he wants, i.e. voting with his feet...this sends an immediate signal to everyone and forces Lykke to regroup...  In building Lykke I am inspired by biology - I try to implement subtle mechanisms that bring Lykke back into its dynamic equilibrium.  There is another question: strictly speaking the Lykke coins are an entitlement to Lykke shares - they are a digital representation of Lykke shares. To become a full shareholder, the owner has to reveal his name to Lykke - this is a legal requirement from Swiss law. It is more efficient to just deal with colored coins, because then we can take advantage of the full digital efficiency. We will pay dividends, etc. to Lykke coin holders.""",False

If you download and install the App you just have to give a mail-address and your name if I recall it correctly (I did that too fast to remember every step).  And regarding the share-aspect, Richard Olsen writes:  ""strictly speaking the Lykke coins are an entitlement to Lykke shares - they are a digital representation of Lykke shares.""   How I understand it: We Crypto-folks can buy and trade it like any other Cryptocurrency or token and of course also after this ICO because the market will take over right after if I'm right. As long as we don't want to give all informations --> LKK = entitlement to Lykke-shares. And everybody can decide at any time if he wants to become a full share-holder by law.  The interesting part is: It's already safe that the share-aspect will determine it's value.

I just saw how the price shot up and all the talking about the news and decided to buy into XRP even if I didn't like the very high XRP-marketcap of > $250 M. And I was very surprised to find out that there was so much sell-pressure. It seemed as if some whales took the chance to unload their holdings, even if the price was pretty much down in comparison to earlier days.  And what I found out is: Nobody really seems to know why XRP even should exist. It seems to be abandoned by the company itself while they still own the majority of the supply and sell it whenever they want.   Is there a plan B for XRP? http://www.xrpchat.com/topic/763-is-there-a-plan-b-for-xrp/   Under the line I'm unsure about XRP but what I want to say with that: Lykke has found a much more elegant and fair solution with LKK. And if this project should become successful, and I believe it can be much bigger than Ripple because Lykke has a lot more to offer and a team of experts with connections and it already has a lot to offer - Meanwhile I believe it's cheap while I first believed it's overvalued.",False

In Lykke things settle on a public blockchain - no need to invent new consensus algorithms.  If one parties trusts another it means that it can use that party as a creditor. Institutions can issue credit as ColoredCoins on public blockchains, and settle between them off-chain. This architecture allows: a pricing mechanism of any currency or asset, native cryptographic currency and issued currency to interact in a single system. Indeed, LKK coins are not central to the converting mechanism - ColoredCoinsUSD can be traded for ColoredCoinsCHF, etc ,without touching LKK (In Ripple XRP is always the medium). Any kind of bank, payment institution, even central banks, can in principle use OpenAsset protocols. The credit in the system are the issued coins, and not native to the marketplace. Indeed while the goals can appear similar, the approach is very different.  The team has closely studied the Lightning network proposal: http://lightning.network   But again, with Lykke there is a notion of a trusted intermediary which issues coins. In Lightning the so called hubs don't issue proper credit, and there is no market price.",False

I don't have deep knowledge about it, but I've read some discussions and that many XRP-Investors are very disappointed.   And after learning more about Lykke I'm glad to see that this won't be like Ripple and that the value of LKK is deeply connected to the value of the company since it's about shares.",False

Usually I don't like it that much to do things on a smartphone but just the App shows a lot about how they do things. I mean, it's  really an ""easy-to-use-solution"" - self-explaining and with a very nice design.  What I really like about this project and if we focus on ""just"" the APP:  - it simply can be used as an easy-to-use wallet. - even more interesting: easy-to-use exchange  And that already has value. But even more important is the security-aspect. I believe that it's good to be kind of paranoid in Crypto, if we think about private hacks but maybe even more about hacked exchanges or fraud.  And if we focus on that:  - a (semi-) decentralized and easy to use exchange with fiat-implementation, plus bitcoin, plus ethereum, plus all what will be added there (could be everything as colored coin) plus: They can do ICO's for other projects and so on.   Yesterday I've asked in their slack if it will be possible to implement a cold storage-feature, a way to generate keys offline and a way to import keys if needed and they seemed to be very open to do that.   And that all combined:  1) easy-to-use and very well desgined 2) secure  --> 1) and 2): as wallet --> for ""everybody"" --> 1) and 2): as semi-decentralized exchange --> for ""everybody""  - Fiat - colored coins - most attractive Cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum etc.)  Plus: Not ""just"" an App-solution but also a browser-access is obviously under development.  Plus: All their FX-expertise and connections into the business-world  Plus: 0% fee   If I ask myself: Where are barriers to use this? I don't see any. It already is highly attractive for guys like us and that will increase. It's just not very known yet. But that will change without any doubt. It also will find more users out of this (Crypto) space if they do ICO's for other projects in the future. And... access to the established financial system and all the business-connections they have. I mean, Richard Olsen is really well known and respected.  The more I learn and think about it, the more potential I see. First I believed it may be overvalued but that could very well turn out to be a very wrong conclusion.",False

Now being a digital asset it will have value, market makers will do they thing (they are already doing that, Ripple has increased in price a lot in recent weeks).  Also, a tiny amount of XRP is burnt after each transaction so it's deflationary. I think unless Ripple completely abandons the idea of XRP (they are the major holders so it's naive to think that) they price will continue to rise on adoption news and deals just as any other project.  I agree that Lykke offers similar benefits but with the addition of making LKK coins. Either way, if you think about it, 10k LKK coins would be 100 shares in a company that it's on its beginnings. Without proper earnings yet it's hard to give a valuation on what would be the proper value for a single share, we know there are more than 100m shares basically and more than 1 LKK billion coins.  Lykke already has a working project and it's cheap enough to invest in my opinion, it's much less risky than other ICOs. However, I don't see x4-5 ICO prices any time soon since there's zero buzz about it and one can say the current price is fair if you put it all together without doing any predictions on potential. Many thinking this is just another ICO with some russian guys in a garage playing crypto with nothing to show for may think it's overvalued, 1000-2000k sats would be more adequate and I could agree with that if this was the case.

I have always wanted to transform foreign exchange markets into a level playing field, where everyone has equal access and can trade with ultra-thin spreads. I have been looking for a technical solution that could turn the dream into reality. In 2011, I discovered that blockchain technology was ‘the’ answer – so it was only a matter of time to find the right opportunity to launch the initiative.  (...)  So what role will be left for margin FX brokers in this new blockchain world?  The number of instruments and volume traded will explode; there will be three exciting business opportunities: retail traders will look to fx brokers as community and event organizers to gamify trading and to socialize with other traders. FX brokers will increasingly become community builders. This will provide them the opportunity to market third-party investment products and launch their own investment products.     And, about the wallet:   How has the market reception for the Lykke wallet on iOS been so far?  We have received a lot of praise for the user-friendliness of our wallet – we know that we are on the right track; I love the thrill of developing a product that has the potential to go viral.    ****************   What I find so interesting is: My impression is, that there is not just the wish to start a dynamic to get this known but a thought-out concept. Like I've said before, one of my concerns was, that I believed to see a lack of attention and that may be still the case. But since I know that they don't focus on selling out the ICO and obviously did not make big marketing for this like we know it from much other and in fact smaller projects (Lisk did a very good job regarding marketing their ICO - others as well), this ICO really seems to be more like a little first step, while it can be expected that they're able to increase intensity on all fronts.  And, what is also different: The usual Roadmap if a project does an ICO is:  1. Announcement - marketing 2. ICO - marketing 3. waiting - sometimes many months 4. Launch - exciting, but still not much to show 5. Development (if a good team) - price and volume very often go down 6. Releases (if a good team) - first time an Investor gets real and fundamental feedback if he bought quality   Lykke: They've nearly upturned that process. An already released first Product - now they go into the public and do an ICO. Plus: No waiting after the ICO. Market will take over immediately and it won't be a Crypto-exchange but another proof for their own product, because this will be on their own marketplace.  And if we have that in mind and focus again on their roadmap....     Margin trading (Q4 2016)  Regulated retail FX (Q4 2016)  Offchain settlement scalable to 100’000+ transactions per second (Q4 2016)  Ethereum support: multisig wallets, interblockchain atomic swaps (Q1 2017)  Payment system provider (Q2 2017)  Regulated institutional FX (Q3 2017)  Fixed income products, commodities (Q3 2017)  1 billion USD average daily volume (Q4 2017)   ....and add, that this won't be just about Crypto but about all assets, including what Richard Olsen already did with Oanda (foreign exchange company), add the possibility that they will do bigger marketing..

What is IATA?  It's the International Air Transport Association https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Air_Transport_Association   And there is an interesting tweet:  IATA shared an inspirational idea at #WFS2016 - IATA digital coin. Lykke is proud to have had a chance to contribute https://twitter.com/LykkeCity/status/779223316452167680  Including this video:  IATA Digital Coin https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kip-uUa6h6o  Who published that video? Lykke.   What will this Digital Coin be about? In short: To make money-transfer easier, more secure, faster etc.  There is also a PDF about the IATA-conference:  World Financial Symposium - Supporting Sustained Airline Financial Health https://www.iata.org/events/Documents/wfs16-program.pdf    Just two quotes:   17:10 – 17:20 Industry cryptocurrency See the proof of concept comparing international wire transfers and blockchain payments around the world. Could this technology enable the creation of an industrial currency such as the “IATA Coin”? What would be the advantages and what would be the limits? Can this be the payment of the future?   Right after:  17:20 – 17:45 Panel discussion: FinTech - Impact on the CFO and the finance team What is the finance department looking like in the future? what is their role, or they still needed, what skills are needed in the new Fintech organization. With the help of Fintech, can we turn the finance department into a profit center focusing on decision support and strategic partnership.

That's not a guess anymore. Will this IATA-Coin come? Most likely it's already in development or even finished. I doubt that there would be a first PR-video if it's just about an idea. Will that Coin launch on Poloniex or any other crypto-exchange we know? They obviously call it ""Industry cryptocurrency"". It's safe to say ""no"". Will it be on Lykke - I believe the chance is high.   And that shows a lot of the potential of this project. Crypto won't stay in the Poloniex-world.

He is a very kind man and explained many aspects of this projects. And it's indeed different but also very fascinating and a great chance in my opinion.  I would like to give something like an overview how I understand it right now:  The vision behind  Maybe it can be described as ""decentralize everything"". In other blockchain-projects that is often a headline as well, but with focus on the technical side - Blockchain. In Lykke it's also meant regarding the persons who contribute. Of course, there is a core team of professionals with expertise in many different areas, which can be seen here:  https://lykke.com/leadership.php  ...and who takes a look at the fundamentals (technical development, also business-side) will find out that they've already delivered a lot what is just a promise in other projects.  Regarding public relations it's different to other projects. But the goal is to get more and more people involved who understand Lykke as project more as a dynamic movement. While other projects have a marketing strategy, Lykke starts to go step by step into the public with people who are not necessarily marketing-professionals but Contributors who understand the vision behind and explain it in their own way and autonomous.  Richard Olsen told me, that he would like to see a dynamic which will show what Lykke is about step by step and over time without pressure and without dominant leadership regarding it's external representation. He is aware that this can't happen with ""one hit"", but convinced that it will happen over time - a dynamic process, maybe even faster than one may assume.  I personally already recognized some hints on that approach because I found this very fascinating speech of him when I started to do some research about Lykke:  The power of the small world phenomenon | Richard Olsen | TEDxZurich https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKzjwV_N68I     Financial Side - ICO - Investor perspective  I personally was surprised to see a project like this with fundamentals like Lykke already has it doing an ICO, but without much PR and marketing. The reason is: Lykke wants to build a base, also on Investor side, but they are not focused on selling the ICO now. It's more a way to make first steps into the public and getting more people involved.  I've also asked him if Lykke will issue new LKK for other funding rounds and the answer is yes. Lykke will act as company and the way they do this is usual for companies. Future money they'll raise will increase the value of Lykke so it's not necessarily the case that the price would go down because of that. And since previous Investors are in line with the vision of Lykke it also has not to be much of a concern that there will be ""profit-dumping"".  With other words, of course this is a risk but it's also a chance, because who does some deeper research will recognize that they are ahead regarding the fundamentals and that is very well thought out and as far as I can say: They have an already working (semi-) decentralized exchange. The tech is already building trust if more and more people will use it.   And I personally believe that's the key-point. While I believed, priority would be selling the ICO the real priority seems to be more to get people involved and to use what they already offer and will offer in future and that will be a lot. Richard Olsen was very open about many things that will come and I would be even allowed to write about it. But, to be honest: That were too much information in too little time, so I'm not able to write it down in a proper way. But...   - It was about the technical side and obviously they are moving fast on that front - The same regarding business-side  (He also told me some things about economic principles but I'm not even close to understand it. A little bit as if Einstein would explain me physics.)     In general the public side can be seen as a translation of principles Crypto is about. Of course, Lykke is a very professional company but with a clear focus on fairness and building up trust over time. And like they didn't rush out the tech they are not in hurry to do a marketing campaign to build an Image of Lykke out of nothing in a short time. It will be more like bringing proof out of itself. And my personal opinion is that I have no doubt that the people behind this can be trusted. With other words: Typical concerns everybody in Crypto has, whenever it's about the question ""to buy or not to buy"" into a new project may play a role for this ICO but I would be surprised if that will be the case for long.   Who has the question: Buying into this or not? My advice is doing research and downloading their App and try it out: https://lykke.com/lykkewallet/  I personally believe that what they are building will be a key-point and like already said: It seems that they are far ahead when it comes to building a decentralized asset-exchange. And since it's already high quality I have not that much doubt that it will find an increasing number of users.",False

He allowed me to quote him in this thread. I'll quote the most important parts of his mail. You'll find the answer to your question in the last lines:    Richard Olsen - CEO of Lykke:   ""The wholle Bitcoin Movement is inspired by the vision to replace human decision making with software algorithms. Algorithms are better, because the cannot be manipulated.  Nick Szabo gave an excellent talk at our Zurich event, where he explained his long-term vision of mapping the subtelty of the legal system that has evolved over thousands of years into software code. Nick highlighted the diffuculty of this task - a good legal system is highly refined and we cannot easily create software code that has all the subtelty of our legal system. The short comings were clearly visible in the DAO event.  I am approaching the issue in the following way:  Lykke follows a really big vision - I want to disrupt financial markets and create a fair playing field accessible for everyone. This is much more than just a matching engine with a user interface and an interface to blockchain - we talk about creating legal entities around the world, complex financial engineering, building a brand, hiring people, all the pushbacks from incumbents that want to make our lives difficult...a long list.  We have to kick off big projects that are essential for the project to fly - I will highlight just two projects: we need to build a open access publication platform for news stories in different channels...a transparent financial market only works in context of independent high quality reporting. Today, the news industry is highly monopolized and starved from independent reporting - I plan to create an open access publication platform, where prizes are available for the best contribution of the past hour, past 6 hours, past 24 hours, past 1 week, past month, past quarter, past year - the prize cascades have a dual function - they reward the author and his editor...it is easy to win an hour prize...more difficult to win a whole cascade. The prizes are good ranking tool of the quality of reports and incentivize the contributors. We plan to create many different news channels. I want to build a truly independent news reporting platform with Economist-like channels, a long list.... To evaluate companies and other assets with all the financial instruments - in depth reporting is essential.  Another big project is a bigdata information system - we live in the world of 'digital data', but there is no global informaiton system with real time forecasts for all the digital data that is being collected. In weather forecasting this is standard - big data models collect the meteorological data and then generate detailed weather forecasts around the world. The same has to happen with all the digital data that society is collecting. I dream of a Wikipedia for big data - the real time information system then feeds the risk management system, which are then used to price financial instruments, etc. Today, there does not exist a big data information system - central bankers continue to rely on ad hoc collected data, excel spread sheets, etc.  Sorry to say - it is just crazy how the financial world today functions. I want to clean up the mess and introduce highest quality standards at all levels. I have a very clear vision of how I can make all this happen...it is an exciting journey, but much more complex than a simple software code that tells us, if this happens, then do this....we are in a hugely multi-dimensional space.  Any investor, who buys Lykke coins runs a big risk - he depends on the judgement of the Lykke team, its core investors, my own capabilities...to increase the likelihood of success I am building Lykke to be extremely fragile - all our software is open source, if people are not happy with what we are doing, they can just copy the code and start a competing company that does better work. There are not sharholder agreements that prevent people from selling...this is good, because anyone can sell when he wants, i.e. voting with his feet...this sends an immediate signal to everyone and forces Lykke to regroup...  In building Lykke I am inspired by biology - I try to implement subtle mechanisms that bring Lykke back into its dynamic equilibrium.  There is another question: strictly speaking the Lykke coins are an entitlement to Lykke shares - they are a digital representation of Lykke shares. To become a full shareholder, the owner has to reveal his name to Lykke - this is a legal requirement from Swiss law. It is more efficient to just deal with colored coins, because then we can take advantage of the full digital efficiency. We will pay dividends, etc. to Lykke coin holders.""",False

But in a project like Lykke (and some others as well) it's never just about the code. It's about everything.   Just for example, if we focus on expertise you can take a look at the team here: https://lykke.com/leadership.php  If you do some research about the team it becomes even more interesting. There are tons of infos about Richard Olson, about his financial data-treasury, his data-science and Oanda of course, he is called ""Innovator"" in some german articles I've read and so on.  Or Sergey Ivliev for example:  Lykke cofounder Sergey Ivliev is Named Best Risk Manager in Russia and CIS https://lykke.com/city/blog/2016-06-13/lykke_cofounder_sergey_ivliev_named_best_risk_manager_in_russia_and_cis  Btw, a very interesting interview of him about Lykke - a good summary to get an overview:  MR. IVLIEV, LYKKE: “THOSE WHO WANT TO WIN SHOULD BE GRABBING THE OPPORTUNITIES BLOCKCHAIN OFFERS” https://worldcore.eu/blog/mr-ivliev-lykke-want-win-grabbing-opportunities-blockchain-offers/    But also all the other names. In fact that was the first aspect that really impressed me: The Core-team behind this project.   And regarding the risk of copying code: Another project could try that, but that wouldn't mean much if they don't have the expertise to run something like that. And there are even more points, like connections and so on. Under the line I don't believe that will be a risk. Or, maybe more precise: It could be a risk if they wouldn't move forward. If they would all go on holiday for some months - yep, in that case the risk would maybe increase. ;-)   But one look on their roadmap - no holidays any time soon:     Margin trading (Q4 2016)  Regulated retail FX (Q4 2016)  Offchain settlement scalable to 100’000+ transactions per second (Q4 2016)  Ethereum support: multisig wallets, interblockchain atomic swaps (Q1 2017)  Payment system provider (Q2 2017)  Regulated institutional FX (Q3 2017)  Fixed income products, commodities (Q3 2017)  1 billion USD average daily volume (Q4 2017)",False

But, what is also relevant:  1) Since that time there was a lot of progress. If we imagine a project on Poloniex that started at ""level 1"" (not much, if anything, to show) at price X,  and pushes something out like the Lykke-team did in the last months: The price would have gone x10. It's no exaggeration because I've seen that in Factom. And that is just one example.    2) Usually early Investors are true believers/supporters and not just in for a quick profit. This is no shitcoin that was started with some nice design and nothing more but a pump group behind.   What I believe will be the keypoint: Increasing number of users. That's something I thought about a lot since I've learned more about this. And it's never easy to get traction for a new project. But exactly regarding that I expect them to be very good. If we compare:  Would a usual person without relation to Crypto make an account on a crypto-exchange? Nearly nobody. It's very complex for the average person. But Lykke makes it easy. And in future it won't be ""just"" about the App.  Since I thought about that I'm pretty much convinced, because Lykke can be an open door and a bridge between the worlds at the same time. And that is pure potential.   *************  And btw: There was another concern I had. In relation to it's potential there is a lack of attention in my opinion. But after talking with Richard Olsen it became clear: They've not even started yet. They do this step by step but fast. This ICO is more meant as a first step into the public and I can't say anything about the price after it, because I agree that it may be unpredictable.  But: It's also possible that if the number of users increase just because of their abilities to build a great product (and there is already proof that they are able to do that) and if they start a marketing campaign - and I have no doubt that a project like this also has the ability to push that button - it could very well be that this ICO is an opportunity, especially because there is not that much attention right now.  In Factom it was the same. Very low attention and those who were invested started to complain and just a little later there were the first big news and the price never came back.",False

There might be the possibility that this project is so different in many aspects that thinking in common Crypto-rules and ""ICO-rules"" and expectations might lead to wrong conclusions.  If we imagine Lykke would be an usual project and be traded on Poloniex since march - it may very well be that the price would have increased x5 or even more and be at a $65 M - marketcap now. And like I've already said: It's normal that earlier Investors got a better price but also took a higher risk while a project is in it's first steps. Factom and a lot of other projects increased in price over the last months because of steady improved fundamentals and progress in general and of course: Increasing attention because of that. Some months ago Factom was not even recognized much.    And Lykke obviously already has the fundamentals. I mean, the App is very well thought out and the exchange is obviously already working. It's not just a promise anymore while nobody knows if it will ever be delivered.    What I'm unsure about are not the fundamentals which are great in my eyes. The market-situation might be hard to predict and not follow the Crypto rules. But: There is something that I find really fascinating: LKK-shares will be traded exactly on that exchange they represent ownership for. Psychologically that could turn out as psychological barrier to sell. Of course I can't be sure about that, but early Investors already have demonstrated confidence in the project. So it's unlikely that they all will turn into greedy dumpers before the real show has begun at all. Additionally they would have to dump shares of Lykke --> on Lykke. That's something I really like. ;-)   With other words: It may be possible that this project already plays and will continue to play by other rules than we know in Crypto. Obviously they don't only target us but they start here - in Crypto. If this will turn out to be successful it's possible that it's not late to buy in but still early and even that it might be not so expensive how it seems. If we compare it to Heat for example, which had a $20 M ICO if I recall it correctly (I never believed in it and still don't believe it's a good project). But: Where would the price be if there already would be a working and well thought-out decentralized exchange? Maybe even above $100 M. Lykke already has that and will be valued at about $65 M after this ICO.  A key question will be if they'll get attention and users. But that's also an interesting aspect because attention generally increases over time if there is quality and ongoing progress. I've seen that in Factom. Without much marketing at all (at least not really for the Factoid-market and Crypto-folks) attention increased out of itself and that's a continuing dynamic. Lykke is different to Factom regarding purpose and target. But similar might be, that they follow a longterm strategy instead of trying to hype rushed out releases.  At least worth to keep an eye on.",False

Already read all this post pages and the whitepaper, i am starting to invest on crypto-currencies related fintechs, made my first investment in ICONOMI, around 8 BTC and i am looking for the next one. I have a financial markets background (15 years experience in Risk Management) so i have some questions related to the viability of the business rather than the technological part which i don't have the expertise to analyse.  Off course the concept is extremely appealing, an universal exchange that you can replicate any type of asset is something huge. So what i am trying to access if the concept can become a reality, in terms of company management, expertise, regulation, risk, etc etc etc. And if this is a good opportunity at a fair price.  So following are my questions :  1-) Initially you had 1,250,000,000 Lykke coins which was increased later to 1,285,690,000 as explained already and 100 LKK represents 1 share, so you have at this moment 12,856,900 shares of the company Lykke Corp        1.1) In which situations can the number of Lykke Coins increase again ? In case this happens again, current shareholders get diluted, is there any mechanism to prevent shareholder dilution ? Why did you increased the number of shares in the first case and not only just sold coins of the major holder ?        1.2) 100LKK represents 1 share of the company, is this a voting share or just a share that have the right to receive dividends if this gets distributed eventually ?       2- Exchange License              2.1- why U.K. ?       2.2 - How much does this license cost ?       2.3 - What are the regulatory requirements to acquire this license ?  3- ICO Cost      3.1- Right now i see in Lykke Wallet i can purchase LKK @ 0.05119 per USD, who is setting this price ? is this free market or the majors holders ?     3.2 - Do you have any financial projection that you can share that explains the rationale behind this valuation ?     3.3 - This is not a question but just my view of the current valuation, from older posts the current valuation  is around 65.5mm USD with a projected revenue of 3.6mm USD, this puts a market Cap / Projected Revenue on 18.19, there are some exchanges traded on the market that we can use as peers comparison, CME trade at around 9 / 10 (30.5bi USD MKT cap per 3.3Bi Revenue), BMFBOVESPA trades around 10/11, and those are not projected revenue, those are realized revenue. Although i understand that there is a potential growth for the business, i see this price a little bit inflated.  i will stop here, i will read the whitepaper again to see if i have any new ones.

I don't understand the private-section to be honest and for what it is.  - If I would delete the App (or destroy my phone or whatever), I would only need the 12 words to get my wallet back, right?

Total funding pre ICO was 1.5M CHF (roughly 1.6M$). Some of the investors are public, see links above.   - Are there any restrictions or can the company (the owner) sell as much LKK as they want whenever they want?  Some capital is reserved to buy LKK.   - Could the blocksize limit become a problem for Lykke?  Great question. Offchain solutions are being worked on. Lykke has a different view on liquidity and trust in general, so it represents unique solutions to them. ColoredCoins can be created and traded off-chain - then they can settle on-chain. The issuance is unrestricted, so in that sense it could be seen as a solution to scaling.   - While I believe it's unlikely it could nevertheless be possible that Bitcoin could hardfork and split into two chains: What would Lykke do?  This is not an issue. The question at the moment is about Ethereum support, and how trading between chains should work. If Bitcoin would fail (which seems very unlikely), then any secure public chain can be chosen.   - There is a Trading- and a Private-Section: Does that mean that if my LKK are in the Trading-section they are on the Lykke-exchange and I should move them somehow to the private section to be safe with the backup-key? I don't understand the private-section to be honest and for what it is.  - If I would delete the App (or destroy my phone or whatever), I would only need the 12 words to get my wallet back, right? But how?  - Is there a way to generate a cold-wallet?  Will post answer later. These are reoccurring questions we should have an FAQ for.   - Is it possible (and if yes, are there plans) to add other Crypto-Currencies/Blockchain-projects on the exchange to trade them on Lykke (let's say NXT or Factom - just for example)?  - Is there any time-estemation for a browser-setup?  - Are there chances, maybe even plans, to connect Lykke to Oanda?  1) It is not planned to list other native coins. Lykke is about issuer based coins mostly, that is coins which can represent in some form traditional assets.  2) Oanda - no. Lykke is more of a replacement for any FX broker. But clearly having worked on building Oanda - one of the largest Forex brokers in the world - influences decisions in Lykke. There is no partnership between these companies. There are talks with other FX providers for various purposes (FX hedging and marketdata).    About FIAT:  - If I would sell Lykke or BTC for Euro (I'm from germany): Would/Will I be able to transfer EUR to my personal bank-account? Will Lykke partner with a bank like bitcoin.de and kraken do it with the Fidor-bank?    Lykke has already a banking partner. Yes, you can already use it to deposit/withdraw (SEPA).   - There are already some providers for Bitcoin-debit-cards (Xapo for example): Are there any plans that Lykke will also go into such a direction?  Debit-cards - no. The focus and core expertise is on markets and trading.    ...but: Is it impossible for them to add LKK? I mean, if they would want to add LKK, they could do it, right?   Correct, they could. It is the question whether they want to choose to and why. Commissions for LKK trade are and will remain 0.",False

I believe it would be best just to disclose those informations. I mean, it's understandable that early Investors had the opportunity to buy cheaper.

But the impression that it seems to be important to keep it secret how much LKK were sold prior to this ICO, could do more damage than help to make this ICO a success. For me personally it's the number one reason to be carefully in general, whenever I have the impression there could be something to hide - while I actually think that this is a good project. I have no doubt that it's legit and not comparable to some other hyped up and basically corrupt projects like theDAO for example (which wasn't just a fail because it was hacked) - and a lot of other ICO's.  But of course: A question for every Investor, who doesn't want to buy blind, is how the price will be after an ICO and if something is overvalued or not. It's also about attention and market-reactions etc. And of course, Lykke will be different in many ways. It won't be a Poloniex-Coin and the market won't play by the usual crypto-rules. But some things never change: If there are many with a lot of LKK in a high profit zone, it could very well be that they will bring some pressure on the price, especially if Bitcoin should go up. That's also something to consider in Crypto for those who pay with Bitcoin and not FIAT. And this ICO is a ""Crypto-ICO"". And it's not a cheap one.",False

To build these relationships requires expertise and a certain background. From that point of view maybe Ripple might be more comparable, although even then the model of trust is very different.

Unlikely in the short-term, but technically feasible. Lykke is its own exchange and earns fees on the spread, not commissions. It implements currently Bitcoin ColoredCoins, so any wallet which scans Bitcoin blockchain for OP_RETURN can understand the transactions taking place. You can find much longer writeup here: https://lykke.com/Lykke_Outlook.pdf  In theory other exchanges can implement ColoredCoins too. I'm not aware of any (metaco.com was a planned exchange as far as I know). Lykke targets eventually the entire Foreign exchange market which is much larger. The founder and CEO has build one of the largest Foreign exchange brokers in the world Oanda. Oanda does 5 billion $ volume a day (http://fairreporters.net/economy/largest-forex-brokers-by-volume-in-2015/).

We are working on the launch website for all information about this funding. Please contact us if you want to become more involved. The movement is growing.  ""What is an ICO?  On September 12, we’re launching an initial coin offering — similar to The Ethereum Foundation, The DAO, Ripple, MaidSafe, Augur, Steem, and others. It’s a way for our enthusiastic traders to trade our stock by buying it at .05 Swiss Francs now, then they can hold it as long as they want and trade it whenever they like. Since we’re just getting started, this could be a chance to get in on the ground floor of something big. And we want our community to benefit. A few things about our ICO: It runs from Sept 12th to Oct 10, 2016. Until that date, the price of Lykke coins will be .05 CHF — five Swiss cents. This offering is for 30 million coins, so if it sells out, we’ll raise 1.5 million CHF to fund operations and license applications for the next 6–8 months, when we expect to have our second ICO (we hope at a higher price).  To participate, you’ll need to download the Lykke wallet.  After a successful ICO, the market value of the company and its coins will be 64 million Swiss Francs. At that time, the market will take over the price, so it could go up or down significantly. We’ll publish a detailed prospectus soon.""",False

Will it already be possible to buy the ICO with FIAT about that APP or is that for later?  2. And, related to the APP: Because I didn't know that the ICO will be via the APP, and because I just wanted to check it, I wasn't very carefully and typed the 12 words into my computer. I don't believe my machine is corrupted but I would want to be safe on that side. Should I just delete it and download it again to have new private keys?  3.

Lykke AG is based in Zurich Switzerland. The founder of the project is public and has considerable background, having founded Oanda, one of the largest Forex brokers, see [1]. The total outstanding LKK is valued at 15M CHF, so that each LKK is worth 0.012 CHF (mid price), up from 0.004 recently. The LKK can be currently converted in a manual process to CHF. It is currently in discussion how the exchange to BTC will happen, since the exchange hasn't launched yet, but is planned for release in Q1 or Q2 2016.  In terms of distribution it is perhaps difficult to compare with Proof-of-work or Proof-of-stake system. LKK does not have its own blockchain, but uses the Bitcoin blockchain. The exchange of tokens can happen off-chain. In that sense it is more like a traditional corporation, as it also registered as such. The reason to own the token would be to to expect return in form of fees earned from the marketplace. It is currently a startup project, but the initial phase is nearing completion. The wider project was launched last year in an open format October 2015 (see [2]). There are currently 10-20 people actively working in the project. The closest analogy is a crowd-based exchange, rather than a purely centralised exchange. It is not a decentralised exchange in the sense of Counterparty or Mastercoin, etc.  While getting wider circulating of LKK is also a goal, programmatic distribution in the sense of the known currency systems is not planned. Tokens can either be bought on a market, or earned through contributions.  For the concept and also source-code, I'd encourage anyone to have a look at the wiki and ask questions here. We're currently building on OpenAssets and NBitcoin, but also keep track of all the developments.

Wish to invest some bitcoin after understood something now obscure to me. Lets do some math: 100 lykke = 1 asset of the Lekke AG 3,3% of the project value already founded with 500 M CHF at the exchange of 0,012 CHF per 1 lykke. It seems the 1st try to add a real connection with a virtual token to a real asset and i found it really interesting but... How much Lykkes owned by developers ? What are you going to do you guys to get further funds ? Ico? Ipo ? private sell ? Do you mind of the people who will care to vote for every single step and project ? I'm really interested to know this project better and to invest. Wish you my best luck guys. Regards",False
