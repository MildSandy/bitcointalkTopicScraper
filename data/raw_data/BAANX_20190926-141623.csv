Lets work together to:  1) ensure crypto to fiat payments are fast and easy in all EU countries and around the world - something we are passionate about at Baanx - faster payments and same day transfers into bank accounts for fiat to crypto and crypto to fiat are key for a healthy cryptocurrency market. Protect the supply of money and value!  2) create crypto-payment applications on mobiles that are easy to use and integrate into the existing framework - something we are doing right now - so crypto is used day to day everywhere  3) deliver crypto balance insurance - why should you suffer when someone steals your crypto or hacks your account? Baanx changes all that - we make sure this doesnt happen and give you cover if (very unlikely with our systems) it does.  4) Baanx also allows not just 1 brand - but we allow new brands to open on our platform - changing the way Crypto-Financial Services, Blockchain and Banks are run - lets share licenses and let the most popular brands have their own Crypto services fast - Baanx delivers on this key point of decentralising ownership and avoiding centralisation of power.  We hope you will support our team with 100+ years of Bank and Fintech experience between us and help us to make real change in the market.  Thank you again for all your support so far, any questions just get in touch with us on ico@baanx.com or Telegram Baanx Chat",False

Main differences though are that: 1) Baanx.com Platform and system manages back office and customer support through automation and AI (robo-advisors provided by 3rd party tech partner) 2) Baanx.com system manages all Cryptobank operations within the system in phase 1 - as because of licensing regs you need to maintain control of the Cryptobank operations. 3) As new Baanx.com Cryptobank brands grow they can (at critical mass) break away from the automated system and (if they wish) actually run with their own license to have greater control over the operational elements of the Cryptobank. 4) You don't ""buy in"" as we are choosing Brands and Social / Charities who have strong brand followings - Baanx.com is running an ICO to make this almost free to manage - they then market to their customer followings.  So in short Baanx.com platform manages the Cryptobank for them - the Brands are marketing it - until they get their own licenses and are big enough - then they can have much greater input into more variables as we release smart contract based elements in v2.",False
