I did not expect so many brokers FX and CFD would welcome the offer of Non-Zero as well, that's great news because the most important in the project Non-Zero is the adoption of brokers!  So, since the crypto markets are falling (about 15% for now) and I think it will continue until the end of the year. I sold all my ETH, XRP and BTC (not a big amount but still) to buy NZO Token (right now with a 25% bonus that will offset the recent decline of the market).  Since I think the crypto will go down again, at least until the end of the year, this allocation allows me to lock the value of my crypto investments for a few months (until the ICO).  *** This is NOT purchase recommendations here, it's just my VERY PERSONAL opinion and it is sharing my Crypto Portfolio as I did often during a dedicated webinar (in French) ***",True
