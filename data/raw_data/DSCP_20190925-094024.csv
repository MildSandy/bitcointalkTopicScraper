There's no central data storage in Disciplina just because of the privacy issues. The student needs to register via the educational institutions he studies in. The educational institutions store all the meta about their students (their names, photos if applicable, etc.), just like they do now. They also store the mappings between the student's DISCIPLINA address and his personal data.  We, as Disciplina, can only guarantee that a student with DISCIPLINA address ""A"" received a grade ""B"" for a certain course ""C"" in an educational institution with DISCIPLINA address ""E"". All the personalization is done via overlay protocols (probably like disciplina name service on top of the blockchain or some centralized services). The recruiters are expected to do their due diligence and check whether the educational institution indeed has the address ""E"", e.g. by checking the website of the organization.  The educational institutions are responsible for compliance with the regulations, like they are now. DISCIPLINA doesn't introduce any new challenges in this respect.",False

Very good question - Recruiters and other interested parties are offered paid access to the information about the academic history and achievements of the studentsr. By using this data, recruiters can narrow the search to person they are looking for, with an effective algorithm of candidate search by their skills and fields of expertise.

The report on PoS algorithm actualisation is delineated in greater detail in the technical documentation of the project. The Witnesses, as in other cryptocurrencies, will be rewarded for the launch of each block with commission fees from transactions made in that block.

I think in the future this platform will help many students realize themselves in life. Employment services will be available only to students or ordinary people can also take advantage of this? Great question! The ecosystem is (mainly) focused on Academic institutions, teachers, students and HR people. Most use-cases fit within these persons. However, one of the advantages of the platform is ''The opportunity to store the data on personal achievements in digital form and provide the access to the data through the unified platform which guarantees its permanence and credibility'' & this could also be the personal achievements of ordinary people!  Quote from: olamidey on April 20, 2018, 03:07:21 PM  The best part about Blockchain technology is, it can be used for almost any sector, including travel, gym, health and many more. Only one sector have not experimented and that is the HR and educational sector, Disciplina can proudly say they are the first to achieve this ( that is if it pulls through) who knows it might be the next shocker to the cryptocurrency world.

I would love to all invite you to the DISCIPLINA community on Telegram https://t.me/tchmpls. If there are any questions, feel free to ask them either here or on Telegram - questions will be answered a few times a day on Bitcointalk, 24/7 on Telegram!     Hi Hodlvcl, very glad to hear you like the DISCIPLINA project. As you can imagine, there are many legal reasons why there cannot be commented on future exchanges. DISCIPLINA is an utility token, the main payment tool of the DISCIPLINA platform will be the DSCP token. The users of the DISCIPLINA platform will be able to issue a Cryptopay co-branding plastic card with the option of immediate conversion of DSCP tokens to fiat money.  All information that is available will be shared!  Quote from: Kurrie on April 19, 2018, 06:00:57 PM If I understand correctly, the blockchain is available worldwide for any country. Is that it?  Hey Kurrie, that is 100% right! To give you a great example, TeachMePlease will be the first project to use the DISCIPLINA blockchain.  TeachMePlease provides the conditions for efficient and effective cooperation between academic institutions and private tutors, and their students. TeachMePlease has no territorial borders, which allows schools and private tutors from around the world to offer their programmes to potential students anywhere on the planet. Isn't that amazing?",False

Sure, the educational and recruiting market is huge, it would be strange if no one targeted it. First of all, there are such projects as BitDegree, EchoLink, ODEM and so on. Their goal is to store all the diplomas from people all over the world in the Ethereum public ledger ‚Äî this is illegal in most of the countries including Russia and EU due to privacy regulations. There is also Sony Global Education project, based on Hyperledger, that aims on storing educational records in a consortium blockchain. This is a better solution, but it does not suit the needs of HR ‚Äî there will be no opportunities for trustless validation of the certificates.  Contrary to the solutions I described, our project aims at providing both privacy and verifiability of the data. There is no existing platform upon which we can build such a system (neither Ethereum, nor Hyperledger really suit our requirements).

The performance of the entire system depends on this organisation, and not on the community. In order to ensure real decentralization, a technical token pool will be formed after the launch of MainNet. This will prevent one stakeholder to have more than a 50% share and thus could influence the functioning of the network. Technical pool will be formed in such a way that the share of tokens from the total volume of token issue will be 45%, and this will be distributed between three independent organisations. Thus, tokens will be distributed in the following ratio.  More: https://disciplina.io/WhitePaper_eng.pdf",False

We are planning to list our token on several exchanges, but their names will not be disclosed yet due to legal. However, I can say that one of them is in the top10 of coinmarketcap. Information of the size of the commission and the model of the token, we really can not yet give, because Now the architecture is only describing, and we have not yet approved all the provisions until the end. In any case, thank you very much for taking the time to examine our project ((=",False

I don't wanna argue here, but your answers give me another HUGE RED FLAG.  Basically right now on ""pre-sale"" stage, how you call it, you are selling ""nothing"" for 0.0005 ETH. It's not even ERC20 token, it's really nothing. And a buyer can't do anything with it. Just wait and pray.  You have nice looking fancy websites, complicated structure, and I have no doubt about the strong team, and blockchain developers.  But could you imagine any sophisticated experienced investor to put a penny in a project without clear valuation and exit strategy? You are betting on stupid hamsters fell in love with fancy graphics.  That's not fair. Shame on you!",False

All pre-sale investors and main stage investors will get ERC20 tokens. And they would be able to withdraw them as soon as they want after main stage complete. You can register at our investor panel account.teachmeplease.io and already now you can provide us with your ERC compatible wallet address.  After that, when our main net will be started all who would have our ERC20 tokens will change them to our Disciplina blockchain tokens as 1=1. Before that you would be able to trade ERC20 token as you want. After you would be able to trade you DSCP tokens as you wish.  We are really sorry that not all that info is fully clear right now, but we are updating our web-site and channels to make it transparent for all. So i will double check now that this info would be posted correctly on all our channels.    ",False

This starts at 20% for the first year. For example, if I had 1 million coins when the minting begins, after a year, I'd have 1,200,000.

We arrived at the conclusion that sphere of education needs to be fully modified and an educational blockchain system can become a solution.  Our partnership with international developer of blockchain systems Serokell gave us insight that we have not only the will but also all the resources needed to create such system.  Due to this, after holding talks with several large investors and funds and receiving their support and endorsement, we decided to postpone ICO until March 2018. We retain the date of the closed pre-sale which will start on November, 27th.  Date change is necessary for detailed elaboration of conception of educational blockchain and for preparing high-quality presentation for all potential participants. In that context TeachMePlease will become the first platform which will highlight necessity, importance and functionality of educational blockchain.  We believe that appearance of educational blockchain will revolutionize the sphere of education and will spur a great number of qualitative changes in related spheres. In the near future we will issue an official press release which will contain detailed information about all the changes in our project and plans. Follow up the information on our official website teachmeplease.io and on our pages in social networks. As for the bounty campaign, work on the part of the tasks is suspended and some new tasks will be added.  The number of your stakes will be fixed and doubled at the restart of ICO in the first quarter of 2018.  We want individually note the work of translators who had done great job. All your stakes at this stage are also doubled. At the same time, we add tasks for upgrading announcements and answering questions for extra stakes.

Therefore, public blockchain solutions, which store all of their transactions in open access ‚Äî Ethereum or EOS, for example ‚Äî are unacceptable. At the same time, private blockchain solutions, such as Hyperledger, do not provide enough verifiability of the data stored on them.    Minting in DISCIPLINA  Unlike traditional PoW mining, the DISCIPLINA platform provides energy-efficient PoS minting. The users will get rewards for any productive activity devoted to transaction processing and supporting the network. The network rewards the users proportionally to the volume of DSCP tokens on the balance of each user.  More about DISCIPLINA  Market       |   In June 2017 Sberbank confirmed the need in the system with the fair    |   history of achievements by giving the 1st price for the team    |   with the blockchain CV project on the annual hackathon.  Token sale The main payment tool on the platform will be the DSCP token together with a smaller payment unit named Logic. DSCP tokens distributed during the campaign will later be converted to native tokens in a 1:1 ratio after the start of DISCIPLINA MainNet (second half of 2019).  Tokensale is finished! Hardcap reached. Alpha version will be ready this August. Thank you for your interest in DISCIPLINA.   The users of DISCIPLINA platform will be able to issue a Cryptopay co-branding plastic card.  Attracted funds distribution  Team  Our team consists of over 45 experienced software developers, managers, and marketing specialists. We believe in having the whole team under one roof.

DISCIPLINA Tokensale is finished!  The DISCIPLINA project, the first blockchain to create verified personal profiles based on academic and professional achievements, has finished its ICO. By the start of public presale the project had raised 28691.88 ETH. By the beginning of public tokensale the funds had reached 29060.04 ETH. Tokensale has been stopped on July 19 at 12:25 UTC due to the fact that the project has reached its hardcap. The DISCIPLINA team would like to thank everyone who supported the project and participated in the campaign. It was an important step for all of us! The team is currently finishing its work on the project alpha-version that will soon be available on the website.  2. A few words about our own blockchain architecture DISCIPLINA:  The platform will contain confidential information: classes, assignments, grades, and test results. Therefore, public blockchain solutions, such as Ethereum or EOS, which have open access to all transactions, cannot be used. At the same time, private blockchain solutions, such as Hyperledger, do not provide enough public verifiability. To ensure full support for the needs of the platform, a wholly new educational blockchain will be developed: DISCIPLINA   Private layer. The private segment does not allow any data except hashes to open access. This is done to store private and personal user data, as well as those materials that are protected by copyright or commercial confidentiality.  Public layer. The public segment provides the access to the data that verifies the integrity of the private chains and the reliability of the data stored by the network.  Educational institutions - any state or private online and offline organizations that conduct any and all educational activity. Tutors are also included. It can even be a simple marketplace offering the sale of study materials. Tutors, private teachers or small online marketplaces can cooperate in pools to not maintain DISCIPLINA node on their own. Every educational institution has its private chain and the opportunity to monetise educational records stored there.  Witnesses manage the public chain of blocks that will record hashes of the private blocks generated by each educational institution. To confirm the validity of blocks the witnesses uses a consensus algorithm. The permanence of the data stored in the private chains is guaranteed. The witnesses won‚Äôt have access to the data itself, only to the hashes of the data.  Recruiters and other interested parties are offered paid access to the information about the academic history and achievements of the students.  Minting in the DISCIPLINA. Unlike traditional PoW mining, the DISCIPLINA platform provides energy-efficient PoS minting. The users get rewards for any productive activity devoted to transaction processing and supporting the network. The network rewards the users proportionally to the volume of DSCP tokens on the balance of each user.  3. Dear community! We are proud to introduce you to some more details about our project.  TeachMePlease‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe first project based on DISCIPLINA, an educational blockchain platform  TeachMePlease is an international platform for the cooperation between educational institutions, tutors and students. This project helps students find and immediately pay for courses, registered by educational organizations or teachers.

Surely, this is a very important part of platforms functionality, but our primary goal is to create useful and efficient tools for our users. Thus, a teacher who has knowledge but doesn‚Äôt know how to teach would be able to create his own educational course with our tools. In this way educational institutions would have effective instrument to control their teachers and to create online courses and programs. Students would have tools to search courses that suit their interests, to plan their activities and to communicate with teachers. Moreover, system of reliable comments and rating based on blockchain technology would be a very significant part of the platform. We want a person to have an ability to provide fair CV to the potential employer which will contain information about education and qualifications. To attain this goal, we`ll work with classic offline educational institutions to implement trustworthy register of student grades, achievements, & academic history and e-exams based on smart-contracts. Our platform is not a simple webinar software. It`s a complex solution in the field of education.",False
