As you may know that Coinbase(USA) coming to Japan, Japanese residents occupy the half of the total demand in the world cryptocurrency markets.  Japanese residents can purchase altcoins ONLY through Japanese registered companies due to the current regulations.  Therefore, the appetite of those Japanese residents is surely going for SocialGood, that is to be dealt with by Japanese registered companies.  After you get SocialGood, this huge buying demand will give you the profit.  As I wrote in the Whitepaper, SocialGood will be listed on several exchanges in several countries.  Let's make society better together by SocialGood.  Soichiro Takaoka, Twitter https://twitter.com/SoichiroTakaoka  Soichiro Takaoka, Official Blog http://blog.stakaoka.com/  Soichiro Takaoka, Facebook https://www.facebook.com/SoichiroTakaoka  ________________________________________  [ MARKETTING MANAGER MESSAGE ] Subject: Request For Proposal  Thank you very much for your interest in our ICO to be a business partner of the SocialGood Project. As you know, Japanese dominate approximately 60% of the world cryptocurrency markets. And we are a cryptocurrency marketplace creator originating from Japan and have launched our ICO late April. We would like to welcome your participation and, a suggestion if any, to the partnership.   1. Our goal　(outside-Japan) We aim to raise USD 200 Million value in SocialGood by the end of December 2018. We plan to achieve it by sales to institutional investors and bulk token purchases, and by the crowd sale.  2. Our current situation We emphasize that due to the following features of our ICO we would like to keep our marketing activities conservative, focusing on legal and regulatory compliance,  and reputation sensitive.  (1)   We filed the Form D with SEC of the U.S. (2)   The ICO is a spin-out project of a FinTech company (established in 2005) registered at the Japanese Financial Services Agency. (3)   The core AI technology utilized for the project is based on the joint development with a prominent world-class university in Japan. (4)   We have got the approval of Listing of several exchanges.  3. Our proposals For the partners who mainly gather potential investors through online channels, e.g., Telegram, SNS, and support token sales completion by crowd sale.  Please create your own LP (with the linkage to our official website https://socialgood-foundation.com/), by which you convey site visitors to our official site. We leave it to your own efforts when it comes to the advertisement of your LP. We will pay you a commission, by BTC, ETH, or fiat currency, based on the percentage of the sales as the result of such traffic controls of yours.  It is important very much for you to make sure that your LP is not misinterpreted or understood as our SocialGood official site.https://socialgood-foundation.com/  Please share your estimation on how much you can sell by when. Based on the estimation, we then consider how much amount of tokens we can allocate for the partnership with you. Additionally, we will be able to consider the upfront rewarding payment from us to you by SocialGood at the commencement of our partnership even though your sales are not yet started.  Raising USD 200 Million value in SocialGood by token sales is challenging for sure. We, however, are firmly confident that we can accomplish it if we can team up with many partners together. We are looking forward to your participation from the bottom of our heart.  Our CEO, Soichiro Takaoka, has the experience of gathering USD900m investment amount from individual investors in Japan only by online marketing. We are looking forward to your conference call with Soichiro Takaoka. Based on the outcome of the conference, please send me a proposal of what you can do for us. And then, let's discuss details of what we can do together. https://socialgood-foundation.com/contact/  “Why you should hold SocialGood for a long term?”  FYI, there are voices and reactions from those who purchased SocialGood.  There is the various reason. ①“The SocialGood is the largest ICO (USD 500 Mil) in Japan. Money raised is used for advocating and advertising SocialGood. Its price goes up. I have no doubt about it.”  ②“Japanese are said holding the cryptocurrency market by more than half volume of trades. But they can only buy listed cryptocurrency in Japan. So, once SocialGood gets listed, I think it will attract huge demand. Now SocialGood is only for investors outside Japan. So, it is really the time for us to buy to make money.”  ③“If institutional investors pour trillions of dollars to SocialGood for the sake of the ESG investment, SocialGood market value may outperform Bitcoin.”  ④“Social Good Project is a decentralized Amazon platform. Just like Airbnb and Uber, SocialGood is eye-opening and enlighting,”  ⑤“It is the 8th ICO which filed the registration with the SEC by submitting the Form D. It gives me the impression that it is doing bet to abide by legal compliance”  ⑥“The project is supported the technology development by the collective work of the world top level leading-edge AI R&D experts.”  ⑦“Building up the token ecosystem is supported by blockchain patented technology. It will give the project strong competitiveness.”  ⑧“I am strongly for the idea of SocialGood. It says it makes the society better. I love it. Kiss it goodbye to the bounds of race and nationality.”  ⑨“It is for institutional investors just like the Telegram which raised USD 1.7 Bil. However, it is also open to us. Rare opportunity for the individual.”  ⑩“With SocialGood, you can enjoy cash back every time you buy things. It's valued and I love it. I want to hold it for good.”  📌Tokensale Now! https://socialgood-foundation.com/tokensale/  📌Further information is below. https://socialgood-foundation.com/  After you buy token, write a blog and let me know from this form. https://socialgood-foundation.com/contact/  Yours sincerely, Marketing Managers Social Good Foundation Inc. 18F West Tower Otemachi First Square, 1-5-1 Otemachi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, 100-0004 JAPAN",False

Each time holders of SocialGood purchase items from companies participating in the Social Good Ecosystem™, they automatically receive a cash back payment of some percentage of the purchase price. Simultaneously, an AI algorithm provides part of the cash back payment as economic support to organizations contributing to society globally. The SocialGood cryptocurrency is designed such that its asset value is expected to increase, providing value for participating in the ecosystem from outside, so that the ecosystem will grow automatically. This provides a win-win-win for consumers, companies, and society. Applications to patent this mechanism as software based on blockchain technology have already been submitted in Japan and the US.  The Social Good Ecosystem™ will grow automatically.
