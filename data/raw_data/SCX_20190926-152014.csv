They just delay and delay about the token distribution. Most of the members in their telegram group are bots. No real team shows up to face people's question and their admins just ban anyone who tries to raise any valid question. What pisses me of more about this project is that someone hiding behind his PC release a monthly update on Medium saying nothing concrete about the project itself rather talk about the delay of the distribution.,True

Incorporation of Blockchain Technology, and some of its underlying fundamental properties such as decentralization, transparency, immutability into any system, undisputedly gives it a redefining edge. When this Blockchain technology is integrated with other modern-day technologies like IoT, AI, BigData, the result is a far more advanced platform or product with a high number of use cases and advantages.

We at Swachhcoin, believe in the power of unity and togetherness. Swachhcoin has joined hands with Komorebi to be an active member in this revolution and provide its users a number of other utilities in addition to those already in place. The Komorebi Alliance is led by INGOT Coin, a fully integrated blockchain-based Wallet with a Digital Bank, Brokerage, Exchange, Certifier, and Initial Coin Offering (ICO) Accelerator; all rolled into a holistic ecosystem. Komorebi currently has a number of prominent members as of now, namely, Bolttcoin, MFChain, Bineuro, Black Insurance, PlaceToRent, Stella amongst others.  Hirander Misra, Chairman, and CEO of GMEX Group commented: ‚ÄúWe are entering an era where the value of individual Blockchain enabled ecosystems combining through joint ventures will lead to a new paradigm of Token Augmenting Partnerships (TAP) creating a network effect, which will propagate to create greater value.‚Äù A number of other organizations are also set to enter this Alliance in the coming week. This is inarguably the most revolutionary development in the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency domain where an Alliance has been formed with so many well known ICO‚Äôs which individually have a highly recognized capable team and technology from across the globe. Komorebi has already witnessed a lot of traction with over 50,000 members in its Telegram Discussion group within a couple of days of its formation.

New Schemes Rolled out by Government like Swachh Can, Swachh Grih etc, SWACHH can disrupt the Indian population's attitude towards waste management.

There are different issues and problems of urban and rural waste management in the world today. With no adequate facilities to embark on its management, certain government institutions and bureaucracies find it difficult to manage waste due to the frequency of waste disposal which is proportional to the population of a nation.  With the need arising to combat environmental pollution, badly- managed landfill sites which cause vermin incinerated waste which is toxic when burnt thereby causing environmental degradation. Therefore the need for a system to be created to curtail waste as a whole is highly important because we could clearly see it‚Äôs a global problem.  https://steemit.com/blockchain/@da-primate/swachhcoin-solution-to-global-warming-using-blockchain-technology",True

Swachhcoin is one such solution that was created out of the need to make Earth a cleaner and better place to live, for us and for our future generations. Focused on the waste management industry, the platform integrates various solutions under one umbrella of blockchain technology to provide its users with one of the most effective value propositions that are currently available in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space.  The platform was founded by Aditya Kumar and Prashant Chaturvedi, two environmentalists from India one coming from technical background and other from science background, had a clear objective from the start: to eradicate poor waste management throughout the world and reduce the carbon footprint that is related to food, industrial, chemical and non-biodegradable waste.  Together, the co-founders made Swachhcoin to be a one-stop solution that did not only focus on waste management but also incentivized the practice for its users at its core level, thus cementing that it was not just going through an idealistic approach but by a rock-solid, real world implementation in its mind.  The project currently has its pre-sale in progress which is set to end soon. This means that this is just the perfect time to look into the project in order to analyze its various offerings and capabilities, so one could determine whether or not Swachhcoin could be the right investment for them.

There‚Äôs a great news for all. Upon receiving inputs from our community and current bearish markets, we gave a consideration for extension of our Presale.  Officials announced, Swachhcoin Pre-sale has been extended, given the interest and requests for the same. It will now continue for another 10 days that ends on 29th June 2018, 23:59 UTC.  We are very pleased to announce that we significantly surpassed our first goal of 50% SCX (total allocated for Pre-Sale) during the first round of our whitelist presale, and the current price per token is $0.045 with a 40% bonus.  Given the scope of returns and the noble cause that underlies the Swachhcoin, our community across channels has also been multiplying each day. We recently celebrated 54K+ following on Telegram.  We believe in the power of our project as the waste capital is projected to soar up to $375.5 billion by 2025, and we don‚Äôt have much time before that to bring a paradigmatic shift in recycling sector. Our vision being Zero Wastage concluding the sustainable use of resources.  Why Swachhcoin relies more on feasibility?  The waste recycling industry is on the verge of a demographic ‚Äòtime bomb‚Äô and it demands a revolution, not just a change. The lack of efficient techniques and payment solutions plagues the world. Until now, we have seen services, individuals and organisations across the globe, working hard to make best out of waste.

The issue of waste management caught my attention in the early 2015 and since then there has been no turning back. I initially worked as volunteer in various awareness and cleanliness campaigns organised by local NGO‚Äôs. The results I got after digging deep into the prevailing waste generation and management practices globally were extremely disturbing. I felt that we were heading towards a doomsday and the only chance we have at avoiding such a fate was to act with all our might by developing and utilising the best possible technologies available to mankind.  https://medium.com/@swachhcoin/story-behind-swachhcoin-and-journey-so-far-35105840f9b,True

An overlooked case of plastics and the problems caused due to it. We use plastic products on a large scale, unaware of the fact that how many problems it causes to the environment and ultimately affects us. Talking about marine pollution due to plastic products; the major sources of plastic wastes in our oceans are plastic bags and plastic packaging materials. These particles are large in size and they break down into plastic particles of 5 mm size which are termed as micro plastics and thus results in marine micro plastic pollution. Although there are various recommended ways of recycling plastic waste but not all waste can be recycled and also not every country has capabilities to adapt these techniques. Due to the durability of plastic, it lasts longer taking so much time to degrade, which results in dumping of plastics as land-fill and a portion of it ends up in rivers and eventually it reaches to the oceans. Use of plastic micro beads in day-to-day products also contribute to marine pollution as when we use them for our personal care they get washed out through drains and eventually end up in the oceans. According to a UN report in 2010, between 5 million to 13 million tons of plastic was found in the oceans which was eventually found inside the stomachs of water bodies. According to a Professor of marine biology, Plymouth University, a quarter of the fishes that are sold in the markets contains plastic. Shocking results came in a study conducted in 2015 in the United States of America when it was found that nearly 8.1 trillion micro beads end up in the oceans everyday. But soon after this study companies such as Clarins and Procter & Gamble decided to remove these micro beads from their products. These facts reflect the threat we are under. But just by merely discussing about this problem won‚Äôt solve it then ‚ÄúWhat should we do‚Äù, so here are some instances where this problem was rather countered with: ‚Ä¢   In July 2016, The Grantham Institute at Imperial College London suggested that by managing plastic waste at source itself is the most effective way of reducing marine pollution. They believed that plastic should not be thrown away as it can be a valuable raw material in various places such as in building roads. ‚Ä¢   Rwanda launched a Vision 2020 plan under which they banned the use of non-biodegradable polythene bags in 2008. The outcome of this plan was that Rwanda became the world‚Äôs first plastic-free nation. ‚Ä¢   On 14th November, 2017 , The Blockchain Development Company (Technology Start-Up) calculated and neutralized the annual plastic of organizations and families by purchasing credits using Blockchain Technology. ‚Ä¢ On 16th May, 2018 , National Geographic launches ""Planet Or Plastic?""- a multilayer initiative to reduce Single-use Plastics and their impact on the World‚Äôs Ocean. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt these instances make us believe that if we determine to fight against this problem then it can be countered effectively so let‚Äôs take a pledge that we will stand together and fight against it in every possible way.‚Äù  https://medium.com/@swachhcoin/we-depend-on-plastic-but-now-were-drowning-in-it-3cda0f2277ed",True

India, 6th March 2018: For as long as one can recall, planet has been poised with the problem of too much wastes and lack of valuable resources. Various kinds of wastes are being produced and disposed off in an uncontrolled and unsustainable manner causing an irreparable damage to our environment. On the other hand, there is a huge global crisis of various valuable resources from electricity, biogas, rare earth metals to timber, paper etc. The important thing here is that, most of these valuable resources can be extracted from same wastes which are carelessly disposed off. Also, the waste processing industries are equipped with archaic technology which greatly limits their ability to process the wastes efficiently into valuable outputs.  ‚ÄúSwachhcoin‚Äù clearly has a disruptive vision of completely overhauling the waste management sector globally to overcome these issues through its sustainable, rewarding, profitable and technologically advanced ecosystem. They believe that waste is the greatest untapped resource present in abundance all around us and a lot can be done by the present and future generations to overturn the prevailing mindset of masses towards waste. ‚ÄúSwachhcoin‚Äù has brought together a number of advanced technologies that will work in sync with each other and will be offered to any existing waste management industry adopting the ‚ÄúSwachhcoin‚Äù platform. Some of the tools offered by ‚ÄúSwachhcoin‚Äù are: SWATA, SWATEL, SWIOT which stands for Swachh Big Data, Swachh Adaptive Intelligence, Swachh Internet of Things. There is also SWBIN and SWAPP, which stands for Swachh Bins and Swachh DApp. Individual users will be rewarded tokens for disposing off wastes in SWBIN thus encouraging proper waste disposal. The wastes collected from the SWBIN will be transferred to state-of-the-art processing facilities to extract useful products out of wastes which will be ultimately sold to bulk buyers in exchange for tokens.  https://www.socialnews.xyz/2018/03/10/indian-cryptocurrency-swachhcoin-launched-to-boost-swachh-bharat-campaign/",True

In the next 30 years we will see so many technological advances, constructions and inventions that will for sure make our lives easier than what we are experiencing now and definitely easier than what are ancestors living in their caves had experienced.  However what would happen if our environment doesn‚Äôt support those advances? We all are very sure how strong our environment is and no matter how intelligent mankind is, we can never challenge the nature. The fact the environment is getting exhausted is very well seen by the rising temperatures, changing climatic patterns, frequent floods, unpredictable weather patterns.  One of the most important environmental conditions that need immediate attention is the melting of the glaciers. Glacier is a dense body of ice that has been formed where the accumulation of snow exceeds its ablation over many years. Glaciers aren‚Äôt formed instantly. They need centuries for their formation. Hence their melting must raise a concern.  Glaciers are found in the western United States, Alaska, the mountains of Europe and Asia, and many other parts of the world. Their melting is a normal process with many dependent on the fresh water for survival. However their dramatic melting which we see now, isn‚Äôt normal.  Scientists found that while much of the melting a century ago was most probable due to natural variability in the climate, it is now primarily caused by anthropogenic global warming resulting from industrial greenhouse gases.  Rapid industrialization in the past is the major source of global warming. We have in the past burnt a lot of waste. Fuels from automobiles and the indiscriminate burning of waste, have all increased the level greenhouse gases, which in turn trap more heat in the earth‚Äôs atmosphere thus raising the average global temperature.  With an increase in global temperatures, glacier ice is melting faster. This will lead to a rise in sea level which will have a direct impact on those living in low lying areas. Moreover glaciers absorb a little heat and reflect the remaining back into the space. With their disappearance the earth is now absorbing more heat causing the temperature to rise even further.  Scientists have also concluded that the global trend in glacier meltdown began in the mid 19th century began after the ‚Äúlittle ice age‚Äù where temperatures in some parts of the world were below for many decades.  Melting glaciers have many effects. For example, the melting of glaciers will affect drinking supplies of the millions who rely on meltwater rivers. In addition to that when glaciers melt they will lead to a rise in sea level, which in turn will cause flooding of the coastal areas. Recent research also shows how flooding affects the rotation of the earth. Research shows that the yearly changes are calculated from the glacial signals. The contribution of glaciers to the total excess length of the day signal is less than one part in 150 of the observed signal.  Thus we can easily conclude that the disappearance of glaciers will harm us. It will lead to destruction of mankind if it is not taken care of. By reducing global warming and thus preventing glacier melting we will help save mankind in the years to come.  https://medium.com/@swachhcoin/melting-glaciers-effects-causes-3c513e4f3ec",True

So why is it so useful? It is because ‚Äúenergy‚Äù the power that the whole world is running behind, can be produced by using the municipal solid waste. Yes you heard that right. Let us see how we can do that.  Today waste is a gargantuan problem for the world. However our continuous efforts have led to the development of a way to convert this waste into a useful resource. There are many items around us that can generate heat, and surprisingly waste products are one of them. Heat generated from waste creates electric power which is an asset to the earth because it can eliminate elements that ruin the ozone layer.  Globally the amount of solid waste generated is 1.3 billion tonnes per year. There is so much garbage generated daily and many countries are simply wasting it by burning it. However as mentioned before this waste can be used to generate electric power. One such method of electricity generation from waste is by using biogas. Biogas is a gas that is produced from organic matter such as food waste, animal waste etc. Biogas is formed by breaking down this organic matter biologically.  https://medium.com/@swachhcoin/putting-energy-into-waste-to-create-energy-from-waste-4f89ed87e9f1",True

Swachhcoin aims to develop a global ecosystem to disrupt the waste management sector by acting as a complete technology developer and service provider. In simple words, we will develop all the tools and technologies needed by the existing waste management industries by leveraging Big Data, Internet of Things, Adaptive Intelligence and Blockchain Technology which will be extremely suitable for large scale adoption. The ecosystem will have incorporated incentivising mechanism where all the waste contributors, weather they are individuals or industries, will be rewarded monetarily in tokens for contributing waste which will ultimately be processed to be converted into products of high economic value by the waste processing industries. The distribution of reward at the waste contributor end will be done through advanced waste collection bin designed and developed by Swachhcoin named as SWBIN. SWBIN will have various features like but not limited to Waste separation at source, User identification, Reward distribution etc.   Initially, we will focus on solid waste management and eventually expand our scope. We aim to enforce waste collection from every possible place where waste waste is generated. They can be domestic household, industries, hospitals, even the rural areas(through special program named Swachhcoin Rural Welfare Program).   The two main parts of the swachhcoin ecosystem are: 1. Waste contributor 2. Waste processor. Waste contributor will be given incentive for proper waste disposal thus encouraging them to do so. Waste processor will be able to dramatically increase their operational efficiency and capabilities though the highly advanced technology adoption.   The amount and quality of output of high economic value that can be produced after processing the waste is highly reduced due to intermixing of waste. I personally appreciate the enforcement of such a rule. SWBIN developed by Swachhcoin will have various features, one of them being Waste separation at source.   We believe that the global waste management sector is filled with a number of quality small and big innovation and there are also organisation working to solve the problem of waste management the world faces, but their success has been limited due to various factors, two most important out of them being their singular effort and lack of technically advanced tools at their disposal. We aim to eliminate both of these.   We are currently focused on solid waste management.   Our R&D teams keeps on working to find any possible way to make this system as best as possible.   Our Whitepaper and other project related details will be announced soon. If you have anymore question, feel free to ask.   Cheers Team Swachhcoin",True

Individuals and organisations will be rewarded for the waste they contribute that is ultimately converted into products of high economic value.   General notion for waste disposal, however, not everywhere ,and also not for every kind of waste is that people pay the waste collection agencies for their waste to be collected. We believe that with the application of correct technologies and harnessing the maximum potential of the waste, this trend can be reversed. People should actually have their monetary share in the economic value of the product the waste generated by them is being transformed into.   The exact mechanism of reward will be different for different kind of waste contributor and the geographic and economic condition of location.   For instance, urban households will dispose waste to their nearest SWBIN. SWBIN will identify the user, evaluate the reward based on few basic parameters, the SWAPP(Swachh DApp) will facilitate reward allocation to the waste contributor. The system will directly be owned by the waste processing agencies in partnership with Swachhcoin Foundation. The waste collection and reward distribution will differ for Industrial waste, Hospital waste, Rural waste etc.   All the project related intricate details will be announced soon, including whitepaper, partners etc., which i believe will help you understand the working of the project better. If you have anymore questions, feel free to ask.   Best Wishes Team Swachhcoin",True

Not only this, by adapting Swachhcoin platform, the waste management companies will be able to dramatically increase their profits while increasing and easing their operational efficiency and capabilities. All this while creating a cleaner and greener environment.   Problems  Throughout the world, mankind is facing a massive problem of too much waste and scarcity of resources. The amount of waste being produced has kept on increasing over the years and the trend is expected to continue aggressively. According to some estimates, annual global waste generation is expected to reach approximately 2.5 Billion Tonnes well before the year 2030. Important thing to note here is that the amount of waste that being recycled or processed to make useful products out of it has completely failed to catch up with the waste generation levels. In fact, to say so would be an understatement. Most of the scarcity of resources that we face globally are the ones that can be manufactured from the waste that is being disposed off irresponsibly and is damaging our ecosystem. Thus there is an immense need to deploy the most advanced, state of the art technology so that we stand a chance to tackle this immensely massive crisis.  Proposed Solution  It is not a hidden fact that the global waste management problem  we face cannot be tackled by a handful of people or organisations. The willingness and contribution of the mass is the key in successfully achieving our objective. The best way to encourage people to properly manage their wastes will be to incentivize them monetarily for proper waste disposal and raise their awareness about the issue. This is the core of the solution Swachhcoin offers. Also, it is a scientifically proven fact that the amount of high-economic-value outputs that can be obtained from the accumulated wastes is tremendously reduced due to various types of waste being intermixed, thus degrading the unique property/individuality of the same. Swachhcoin will implement waste segregation at source in SWBIN to eliminate this problem. The traditionally running waste management industries  have poor infrastructure and the archaic technologies available to them greatly limits their operational abilities. Swachhcoin will eliminate this problem and take the technological abilities of the company to the state of the art level, thus increasing their profits significantly. The additional revenue obtained from deploying technologies such as AI, Big Data, IoT and Blockchain will increase their efficiencies and profitability, thus the additional capital invested in upgradation will be justified over a certain period of time. The cost of these additional investment will also be covered from ways that are currently absent in this sector such as revenue obtained from advertisement (on SWBIN). With the help of extensive research and development, a complete business plan, including break even point, will be made available by Swachhcoin to the adopting industries thus breaking the barrier of technology adoption.    How it works ?  Swachhcoin will act as an global ecosystem to bring together the enormous but currently siloed and disorganised sector of waste management which otherwise is filled with commendable big and small inventions where individual companies are working to the best of their capabilities to bring about a change in the degrading environment and planet but with little success. The Swachhcoin ecosystem will be the most technically advanced, broad and efficient waste management platform, which unlike any other player, will employ Adaptive Intelligence, Internet of things, Big Data and Blockchain, together, in sync with each other, thus enabling achievement of ground breaking waste management efficiency. Not only this, it will incentivize any and all domestic households globally for contributing the input in the waste processing industry in the form of Swachh Tokens.  How are we different from others ?  The platform offered by Swachhcoin is unique in number of ways. Currently there are other waste management platform but none of them are as broad and as technically advanced as Swachhcoin. Some of the features which makes us unique are: Users are given monetary incentive to manage their waste ,whereas, traditionally, people used to pay for their waste to be collected from their homes. The range of outputs produced after processing the waste are over Twenty. Leveraging not one, but four most advanced technologies i.e. AI, Big Data, IoT and Blockchain. Freedom to sell and buy produced output in both Fiat and Tokens. Apart from profit making business model, our platform has integrated autonomous philanthropic work. The above mentioned key featured makes this platform better than any other available and years of research, correct partnerships and development gives us edge over any developing platform in this domain.

Needless to say waste generation is going to be tremendous. Swachhcoin‚Äôs aims to make whole of waste management sector decentralized, autonomous and technically advanced so that the problem of too much waste and lack of resources such as energy and other potential goods of economic value that are produced upon processing waste materials can be minimised if not eliminated. Swachhcoin‚Äôs domain of action relies in the area of gap between the total waste produced and the net waste treated or recycled. Currently the gap between the two is highly disproportionate. A constant and smart effort is required to decrease this gap between the two. Also, since the waste generation, in sync with the increasing population is not expected to decrease anytime soon, there will always be the need to cope with it and thus an ever increasing need of such a platform..
