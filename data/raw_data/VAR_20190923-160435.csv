MISSION  VARcrypt is the world's first blockchain specific hardware agnostic platform designed specifically for VR (Virtual Reality), AR (Augmented Reality), legacy content (film, television, music, print, video games) and software applications.  VARcrypt derives its name from a combination of both VR and AR resulting in the combination of VAR which when integrated with a cryptographic blockchain content distribution, rendering, and Payment processing protocol; creates VARcrypt. In addition to VR and AR content distribution VARcrypt will distribute legacy film, television, music, software, print, and gaming content via its blockchain with the specific aim to protect artists and content creators and ensure that they can enjoy the lowest cost content distribution possible so they can keep the majority of the profits generated from their  work.  The future of immersive content and software will not be either VR or AR, it will be VAR.  ABOUT US  VARcrypt will be powered by its very own token, VARcoin (VAR). VARcoin will enable users to publish and view content on VARcrypt for global distribution of VR, AR, film, television, music, sports, print, video games, software, & real estate into a combined blockchain powered ecosystem that will deliver a powerful experience.  We believe that the future of the Internet will be about experiences. Immersive experiences bring people together, inspire new ways of thinking and when virtual reality, augmented reality and Blockchain technologies are combined into a new technological ecosystem we believe that technology will be the future of the internet. VAvRcrypt is creating a user-focused interface that enables the global distribution, encryption, and monetization of content that is fair and transparent that simply does not exist currently.  Each new media format to emerge has represented a step forward in immersion and presence. From immersive video to mixed reality, content is becoming indistinguishable from real life experiences. Through Blockchain technology this content can now be completely encrypted to protect content creators and owners, monetized in a more transparent and efficient manner (especially when one is familiar with the difficulties faced by content creators and owners who have had to collect from major television networks and Hollywood Film Studios), and distributed globally.  Content creators and owners no longer have to sell off content rights by territory but can go global immediately upon publishing their content on the VARcrypt Blockchain.  Since 1974 when the TCP/IP Internet network protocol was designed it has evolved into a technology that allows any computer to communicate and connect to any other computer globally, the Blockchain protocol is repeating the same process all over again but in an exponentially more powerful way. Where TCP/IP is a communications protocol, the Blockchain is a value-exchange, encryption, distribution and monetization protocol.  What we are passionate about is building an ecosystem, unlike anything that has ever been build before - a decentralized, streaming and downloading, hardware-agnostic, and independent platform for Immersive Media including VR, AR and Mixed Reality (MR). All this is being built around a user-friendly interface that will give the user Content Creation Tools (CCT) and the possibility of getting paid instantly in a transparent fashion.  Simply put this is the future of the internet.  VARCRYPT PLATFORM AND PLAYER  VARcrypt ’s main mission is to provide an elegantly simple hardware agnostic ecosystem where blockchain technology can be combined with VR, AR, and legacy content together for the benefit of artists and content creators.   VARcrypt as a company does not want to be beholding to any one hardware provider and desires to remain completely independent.  To achieve this VARcrypt will charge distribution fees for content distributed so it can remain independent and is working with best in class coders to develop and integrate VR and AR  seamlessly into the VARcrypt app and website ecosystem.  We believe that our user-focused interface, blockchain transparency, and hardware independence are strong advantages that other larger content and hardware companies will not be able to replicate and are currently not available anywhere else.  VARCRYPT ECOSYSTEM  VARcrypt users will be able to use VARcrypt's own token, VARcoin (VAR) to access a variety of VR, AR, film, television, music, and gaming content via the VARcrypt app and website. This is a front-end consumer-focused service and should at a glance echo “a YouTube for VR/AR/MR”. Content creators and artists will be able to upload content and determine the price at which their own content can be sampled, rented, or sold.  Content will be distributed via the VARcrypt blockchain via the VARcrypt website and Android & iOS apps via mobile and hardware devices such as Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and others. VARcoin will be the token that allows users to rent, buy or sample a diverse array of content in more cost-effective cryptocurrency token based micro-payments  VARCRYPT CONTENT CREATOR  The 1st of a variety of Content Creation Tools (CCT) that will be available in the VARcrypt ecosystem is a VARcrypt app for Android and iOS which enables its users to create simpler and more spontaneous VR and AR videos and content with their smartphones to be directly uploaded to VARcrypt.  One of the Content Creation Tools we are launching is a virtual reality app for iOS and Android aiming to make 360- degree videos as easy as Snapchat and we are exploring the possibility of linking this with a our very own VARcrypt lite wallet.  Our strategy is to heavily support and inspire the creative community by both proprietary tools diversifying content on VARcrypt.
