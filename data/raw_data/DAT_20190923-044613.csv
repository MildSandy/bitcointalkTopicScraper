Something is really strange here and would be great if somebody could share some insiders info about the real condition of the Datum project.  I see DAT token is still listed on exchanges and traded with enough volume. I don't see any scam accusation from ICO investors and this should be the case if there is no contact from the team for a long time, especially when there is no development. Is hard to believe in this growing price and volumes if nothing is happening and the team disappeared. Of course, it could be a manipulation (pump and dump) if the price will grow fast (actually happening) and collapse to almost 0 (even faster) just after.  I was here at the beginning and participated in the bounty. I keep holding my Datum tokens and keep watching the price but didn't follow the roadmap and development closely, so I want to ask somebody from the team or a member which is here frequently for some insights on Datum project and latest news because looks like very far from death project taking into consideration price and volumes.",False

""trading platform"" - for data, unlikely, many bigger players have tried this and are trying, they are well funded and a lot bigger. There is some data trading for AI in the crypto space. ""The reality is that one of the most popular decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum network, CryptoKitties, has only a few hundred daily users."" - yes no-one cares about Dapps. A simple fact to observe. ""However, the adoption of blockchain technology is lower than expected; "" - not exactly, we are now entering into a period where only those things that are really used will survive, part of the normal tech cycle, Dapps are not important. There are many other blockchain technologies which are being adopted other than Dapps. Now is the right time for value investing in those things which will survive. “I don’t see [the next wave of growth] happening at the moment. I would be surprised if anything really changes in this market by end of this year - there's plenty of growth, just not in dapps.  http://www.ejinsight.com/20181113-data-breaches-raise-public-awareness-of-risks-to-privacy-datum/ ""The user can choose to authorize individual merchants to send advertising messages to them, and will receive a token issued by Datum, named DAT, in return."" - no no no, no-one will care. User's don't want to control this, this is time consuming to control for the user, for the individual merchant they won't have a large enough user base to advertise to. Those users who do use it are after the DAT coin and are scamming the system. There may be a small sub-set between scammers and normal people who might care but thats a small overlap of two larger sets of people. People are time poor and don't care - more people don't even use more than 5 apps on their phone from week to week, they definitely won't use the Datum app. People don't switch between 50 apps during their weekly life, they just go back to a few small ones which do what they want, ie, whatsapp, banking or whatever. Datum app won't fit into that sub-set of apps. Its fundamentally unworkable as presented by Datum. ""We can’t get Facebook and Google to change the way they store their users’ data,” Haenni said. “What we are basically doing with Datum blockchain platform is building an infrastructure where developers can properly get access to your data, in a way that the user maintains trust and control over it.”"" - Firstly no-one cares, on the one hand it sounds idealistic that developers can use this to get access to user data in a nice way where users will have control but without user data then developers don't want it and you can't get user data without developers, its a chicken and egg problem. You need one before the other. You either need data OR developers before you can get the other. Why? Because you can't have a build it and they will come attitude. If you look at other businesses such as https://www.swipecrypto.com/ you can see they have managed to get user data by partnering with a swipe screen, the swipe screen which already had user data can feed that data into their system, the chicken and egg problem is solved. That's called a razor and blades business model https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor_and_blades_model - one thing is a cheap commodity, the other is the value.  The vast majority of what is said is sales stuff and doesn't matter its all fluff, and where a solution is presented its really unworkable.  There are solutions to this problem but that's not it, I'd love to see if they get it and see the solution because there is a real solution and its kind of obvious.",False

Let me explain, S3 backup services have been around for a long while and there was a period of years where price and performance competition occurred and many businesses which didn't gain customer volume disappeared and I saw them disappear during that competition time as they competed for lowest price and fastest speed, or added a larger feature set, etc. In particular I have deep knowledge on NAS backup to cloud including virtual NAS on cloud, so I know this area well. Now the S3 backup market is mature with many large players, its trivial to search for S3 backup services and you can easily google and find unlimited PC backup with S3 for fixed price per month. Its really a mature market. Then there are S3 coin projects like storj and siacoin which are very low cost s3 storage.  Also on a technical level, the idea of storing S3 objects and also writing to a blockchain is a bit strange because S3 performance may be limited by the speed in which they can write to the blockchain, depending on how they do it (synchronous or asynchronous write) and I don't really see the benefit of the blockchain for the storage of the data since the other services give SLA guarantees of their storage anyway. Really customers only care about features, price, speed and cost, reliability, on a comparative basis, they don't care about sales hype and they don't want to switch providers because once your storing your S3 data on one store its a pain to go to another.",False

Just the calculus of business experience, logic and reason would have shown it cannot work.  What are you? A database? a platform (PaaS) for Dapps? just a login for Dapps? a data marketplace? your poor at all of these when compared with competitors, just look at any other competitor company in these dimensions, there are winners in those dimensions and clearly those winners are far ahead of you. You can't even compete with those and your not even close. No-one goes to the second best company, everyone goes to the winners because the second best company is likely to die.  Do you make anything more convenient? Nope. McDonalds makes food more convenient, no waiting time.  Do you add value to any pre-existing thing? Nope. Flavor in water makes water more valuable, its called Coke.  Do you save me money? Nope, you cost money and I won't make money from using your stuff, unless I use the mobile app but its not much money cause your coin is so worthless now.  Do you save me time? Nope. Getting a bus ticket saves me time instead of walking.  Your an empty database with low reliability (most crypto companies die), a Dapp platform with no dapps and only a login, a data marketplace with no data, no way to buy and sell data so your really not a data marketplace, no data to buy because no data in the so called marketplace. What insanity is this? Don't you realize you need data before you can have a data marketplace? So you should have tried to get data first then make the data marketplace.  There's no more datum weekly newsletter on twitter, clearly you gave up because you won't be releasing things weekly. You won't be releasing anything anymore.  No-ones going to want to open your app in order to open a dapp. Its a long roundabout way for someone to get to open a dapp.  No-one really wants Dapp at this time, its a novelty.  Your mobile app is painful to get started with, lots of trouble to create some key thing and then I get what for my trouble, the ability to launch dapps which don't exist, why should I care as a mobile user, I'm going to open this and close it and bye-bye.  Your mobile app looks great but has no personality, looks cold like something from Microsoft that I can't care about.  Your mobile app adds no value if I use it, it doesn't make anything more convenient, it doesn't provide a new feature I was looking for when I am using my mobile phone.  Blue background with green buttons is just a ugly mix of blue and green, clearly that's an adaption of the original design.  Its clear your mobile app has no users, 100+ users on Android store and its never going to grow, oh it looks pretty but who cares.  I can just encrypt my data and throw it into another database, any database, such as IPFS or any, and I get the same as yours and more likely faster and more reliable. Definitely more reliable as there's no likelyhood of a crypto-startup like yours surviving with a coin dropping like that means no reliability promise.  You don't have any way give me monetization if I do place my data into yours.  There's no data marketplace to buy and sell data.  You have close to zero data in your network, not even a terrabyte and the data you do have clearly does not grow, so no-one is using it. So if no-one is using it, logic dictates I shouldn't use it.  As a mobile developer I want a reliable database, if your not giving me a reliable way to store and search my data then I don't really want to spend time on you. Your a crypt startup which along with the other 75% of dead coin from last year is likely to die, why I want to store my data in yours if you have a greater than 50% probability to die.  Your a product and service without a distribution channel, wow. No distribution channel for your product and service - do you understand, just if people come across Datum. OH MY FUCKING GOD. Not even an association like swipecrypto to associate yourself with another well known product like a a swipe screen which would give you data easily since this is already injected into mobile phones.  Your trying to be a service platform, not a product, you open up as a service platform with no customers, you can't just create a platform and expect people to fill it up, it never worked that way, in all my experience I've never seen that happen. Did you ask any busines advisor if that is a good idea or not? You got to get customers first and help them in some way and then later build and launch the service platform with those customers so that you get their help and approval and promotion and win-win, their reference, their customers as well. Its like opening a store without any food inside the store and everyone looks inside and says wow - empty store, thats stupid, I'm moving on. You should have opened the store with famous brands like Pepsi.  No-one cares about Datum anymore from the ICO days. Your so down in price everyones sold off. No human being is going to buy datum coin except for people trying to make a quick buck doing buy and sell day trading because there is no expectation that it will rise. Its now inevitable it will die.  There is now no expectation of a new release of anything from you guys, you have delivered everything you said you would and no-one cares, you have set up for no new release. No more setup for any new release. Do you just try some random thing and say, oh lets see what the feedback will be from customers and we will adapt from there? Did a book tell you that? Did a book also tell you to ask for advice from experienced professionals? So where does it go from here? Potentially try to get dapps to attach to your mobile app? but what benefit do they get from that effort? Why does anyone want to go to effort without any return.  When your Datum coin volume goes down to 0 then you can't sell any more coins, your market cap is 1 million now.  No-one will use your API because ... do you know why? I don't need to say, it was clear from the beginning why no-one would use your API, anyone with experience would know why.  No network effect, a network effect would be if there is some data in the database which I can link with which can add value to my data and the building up of data in the database would increase the network effect of positive benefits of data linking but no network effect. No network effect of if one customer joins they refer other customers. Just in general, no network effect.  Why didn't you know all these dead-end paths wouldn't work out? Life is a large chess game, there are dead-ends, places where you shouldn't go because from that position it then becomes harder to win. Did you have advisors or business strategy? From your current position how are you going to win.  Right now your only a brand name with a failing coin which you have been for almost all of the existence of Datum.  OMG.",False

When a network effect is present, the value of a product or service increases according to the number of others using it.[1]  The classic example is the telephone, where a greater number of users increases the value to each. A positive externality is created when a telephone is purchased without its owner intending to create value for other users, but does so regardless. Online social networks work similarly, with sites like Twitter and Facebook increasing in value to each member as more users join.",False

If not, you will soon. Privacy has always been a hot topic, but it’s going to be talked about even more in the next few months. You have the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to thank (or blame — depending on your perspective). However, the law can be confusing, especially the official version of the regulation.  What Exactly is the GDPR?  It’s a new privacy regulation passed by the EU Parliament that provides very strict guidelines (and very hefty fines to companies) on handling users’ data. The GDPR has been in a two-year transition period and will be enforced on May 25, 2018. One of the goals was for all countries in the EU to follow the same privacy regulations.  The GDPR includes a number of regulations for companies (check out the key points here), but the overall goal is for people to be more informed and more in control of their personal data. One of the biggest changes is that personal data now includes more than it used to — location data, online identifiers and metadata are now considered personal data.  Is Everyone in Favor of the GDPR?  No. Some businesses and privacy experts are not happy about the new law. One concern about the GDPR is that the way it can be written leaves the regulations open for interpretation. Emarketer reported that PageFair is taking a literally interpretation while ad retargeting companies are assuming that web-browsing data does not count as personal data. International News Media Association also points out that GDPR l may also give Facebook and Google even more control over digital media. Additionally, the GDPR may hurt publishers that rely on ad retargeting. According to to CyberWorld magazine, another point of controversy about the GDPR is how the EU can make companies not located in the EU comply with the regulation.  If I Don’t Live in the EU, the GDPR Doesn’t Affect Me, Right?  No. The GDPR will likely affect you. The regulation doesn’t apply just to companies in the EU or people in the EU. All companies that handle EU citizen data will have to comply, at least for EU citizens. And it would look pretty bad if a company took fewer precautions with some customers’ data while protecting others’. It’s expected that most companies that have to comply will do it for all customers. And because the internet has made the business world much more global, its likely that at least several companies you do business with be affected.  Does this Mean My Data Will Be Safer?  Probably. One of the ways companies will comply and keep custody of customer data is through higher levels of encryption, known as pseudonymization. This means storing the data and the encryption key in separate places. Additionally, you now have to be notified within 72 hours of a breach, which means you can take precautions sooner.  Am I Going to Have to Sign More of Those Confusing Privacy Policies?  Yep. But the good news is that, hopefully, you will be able to actually make sense of the new privacy policies. The GDPR specifically states: “the request for consent must be given in intelligible and easily accessible form, with the purpose of data processing attached to consent.” And a few sentences later, the new regulation even uses the words “clear and plan language” in reference to new privacy policies.  Because no company wants to pay the hefty fines for violating the GDPR, look for education campaigns about privacy — especially from social media platforms. Facebook got a head start on the May 25 deadline with videos (using cartoon chameleons) about privacy topics and letting EU users know about the privacy check feature. To make it easier for users to manage their privacy, Facebook is also launching a global privacy hub. Now all of the privacy settings will be in a single place and most likely offer more control of the data than before.  The bottom line — GDPR is a big shift for companies and no one wants to pay the expensive fines. It will be interesting to see how the new policy plays out in reality. One thing is for sure — expect to hear much more about GDPR in coming months as we learn more about the impact of the new regulation.  https://blog.datum.org/what-does-gdpr-mean-for-you-f3ad8f3014f0",False

The obvious reason is to avoid a scammer, but if the developer is trusted, then the ICO has a higher probability of success. EOS, for example, was successful because the CTO, Daniel Larimer, was also behind other successful projects like Steemit, Bitshares and DAO (probably not that last one)  Does the technology solve a problem – if the underlying technology does not actually have a real-world use, then it is doomed to fail. Determine whether the technology has any edge in the markets because, if it doesn’t, then it is again doomed  Look at the escrow terms – ICOs will place some funds in an escrow account to refund investors in case the project fails. Look at these keenly to know just how safe your investment will be  Avoid Icos raising funds with the help of celebrity endorses is purely illegal  Avoid icos distribute massive tokens in bounty programs and promotions to hype the coin price in exchanges  ================================================================================  Hoskinson (former chief executive and co-founder of Ethereum) raised concern about ""unrealistic"" cryptocurrency projects entering the space.

Datum’s three co-founders, CEO Roger Haenni, COO Gebhard Scherrer and CMO VC Tran  This is the time of year when people often say, “Out with the old and in with the new!” At Datum, however, things are a little different. We embarked on a huge mission in 2017. At the heart of that mission is the desire to help you #TakeBackYourData and #GetPaid to do it. Things are really starting to roll now and we’re continuing in the same direction, full speed ahead.  Thanks to the DAT token, which is currently being traded on five exchanges, over 7 million USD was raised in the second half of 2017. While the Datum token sale can be called an ICO, or Initial Coin Offering, we prefer a second meaning for these letters: Initial Customer Onboarding.  What does that mean?  Simple. It’s turning our backers and followers into a real community of users. As of this posting, Datum has an email list of over 75,000, along with more than 33,000 followers on Twitter and a Facebook following that is just as robust. Since launching the Datum Test Network, just a few weeks ago, already over 20’000 data transactions happened with a total volume of 167,000 DAT Tokens. As people wake up to the need to get control of their data, we will continue to spearhead the #TakeBackYourData movement through all of these channels and more.

For you and everybody here in this forum i will show you the calculation of your business:   According to your posting you invested aproximetely 15 ETH in Datum on 29th of November.  on 29th of november the price of 1 ETH was 470 Dollars.  the price of 1 DAT at 29th of November was 470 dollars (1 ETH) divided through 25 000 DAT Token = 1,8 Cent !    Today the price of 1 DAT Token is 6 cent and was 8 cent hours before.  Today your investment  would be worth between 15500 dollars and 20800 dollars !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   But YOU sold way too early on Etherdelta. Etherdelta is the platform, where this things happen. The experienced traders are using this plattform, because they know, that there are  beginners like you and others, which are panic sell right after the ICOs...  You should learn about this things before you make investment decisions. Look at me ! I learned about that and i havent sold on etherdelta. A also followed the price on etherdelta the first days after the ico, that was the typical dumb action to get the price down, so that some newbies gets panic and sell. you was one of them apparently. this isnt about DATUM, this is about you. if you don't see you fault and learn about that cryptocurrency things, you will get fucked again.

Eventually, they changed the rate to 25000dat per eth given the fast rise in eth price. I think overall prices fluctuated between 1 and 3 cents give or take.

Is the data people would be selling not already available through data brokers at a far lower price?  At first blush, this idea seemed awesome. Now I can make money from data of my Facebook/Echo/Gmail etc by opting into datum and reselling on datum's marketplace. But then I realized that by dong so, I don't necessarily opt out of ongoing data collection by those platforms (there's often no way to opt out). So the data is now redundant; i.e. the data is for sale in two places, and my guess is the data brokers price is a going to be pennies. If so, there's no/little incentive for me to sell it on my own.  Is the idea that this marketplace would be used far in the future when services exists where we can actually opt into and opt out of various collection services (including datum)? As far as I know, most of the major platforms that collect data wouldn't allow me to fully/significantly opt out?

Datum is not marketing play, not is an IoT play.

That number is Annual Revenue Per User - ARPU. So, that's how much you're worth to advertisers and businesses every year. Of course, you could also add in the whole advertising industry which targets your eyeballs - so you could take 546 billion USD p.a., and divide it by 7.4 billion (total number of people in the world), or 4.77 billion (number of people with a mobile phone) or a similar number. That would be from USD $73.37 to $114.47 in addition to our calculation.  Realistically, even though we speak a lot about Google and Facebook (because the audience here is very tech savvy), realistically speaking - a lot of advertising is on other medium we do not even count. TV, cinema, printed ads, banners, catalogues, billboards, magazine ads, and other alternate means of advertising.  Datum looks into advertising as one source where people can monetize.

I frankly doubt anyone with 2 functioning brain cells doesn't notice this since you land on bitcointalk. Personally, I don't like it, but I understand in many countries the rewards for bounties translate into nice sums of money. It's mostly from those countries I guess where people decide to shill or bountyhunt for projects. I've posted a couple times about it, just to show some examples of how bad this has become on many threads, were people don't even bother to change a bit complete paragraphs from cryptosites online talking about a project. It happens too that many times you cant even follow the ""logic"" behind certain posts nor even the language which is often so incomprehensible you have to ""backtranslate"" mentally what the guy was trying to say haha. In my opinion often the organized and so transparent shilling doesn't benefit a project. It may be good to draw some attention to it but if it's all artificial it wont really benefit from it either.   I personally started to doubt about some I was in after reading the tons and tons of copy/pasted opinions from one project to the other and a kind of shilling that almost seems a bad joke....so I can understand your frustration. Now I think a project CAN be good even if there is organized shilling mostly because all projects seems to have it anyway. At the end of the day it's just a ""little"" (from our perspective) income for some people who might be in countries with economic problems... I'm in Datum since before the summer and have recently noticed a big wave of newcomers to the project which I welcome but I understand many will disappear once their bounty obligations end, and that's how it is...

The amount of paid content which is floating around, and the agencies that pitch themselves to the cryptostartups is quite frankly, a torrent. However, at Datum we are working on building real products and services. Good news is that we now have solid design wins, and we're working hard with our partners on making those wins public in time.  Datum is a story that will be heard much more (with the practical applications) throughout the public raise stage, and after. Sadly, we cannot make CES, CeBIT, MWC, Computex and other 2018 events to come forward in time. Right now, we have an alpha app, Dashboard and others.  There's an Wednesday Weekly update blog coming later today at https://blog.datum.org, and it will contain some things of interest. I'll also post an update here, hopefully in four hours or so.  And if you haven't seen what real news about us are, head over to The Next Web and see how they compared us to... well, maybe we'll get there in 10-15 years, with your support.  https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2017/10/17/watch-google-blockchain-will-set-us-free-data-tyranny/",False

Yet, that number is what gives job to countless employees in public and private services, and also protects you - as you cannot be copied (in theory).  Datum collects data which you allow us to collect.

Facebook and Google aren't evil for getting your data - you after all, don't pay for their service. The main premise of Datum is that we believe (as born Europeans - Gebhard, Roger and VC are Swiss, I'm Croatian by birth)  - is that every human has value, but so far there hasn't been a platform where you could easily monetize your data. eBay created the concept of ""Consumer to Consumer"" becomes ""Consumer is a Business that sales to other Consumers and Businesses""). Did bad things happened on eBay - of course. I admit I got scammed for selling an HTC One phone to a scammer in 2009, I think (cannot remember, but eBay will remember).  I don't know is JonnyTracker the new ""JonnyeBay"", is Niklasmato new ""Facebook"" or new ""David Beckham"" (if you're a runner that wants to share data).

I would say we are opening up as the time goes by, and already now the amount of information shared is more than we did four weeks ago. What is changing is the way how we communicate - we have dedicated staff for Telegram (almost 3000 people there), here at Bitcoin talk (both here and in the bounty thread), we are looking into re-opening Slack or collaborating with different ICOs on the open sourced platform (Slack turned crazy after both Roger and I saw our doppelgangers sending private messages asking for ETH - with anti-spam mechanisms doing nothing).  We've focused a lot of making the public sale available to as many countries as possible, and have looked into every possible angle, including a two tiered approach. It is just that the legal and audit services (we hired two of ""the big four"") aren't moving as fast as this community (or us as a startup) would like. They are moving in a way which takes us as a very serious startup, and I am really happy that we will have an announcement shortly (actually, several of them) which will show just how serious of a company we are.  Look up into the sky, and there's Datum there. Stay tuned.

It may be idealistic, but it would be a huge accomplishment/success for all parties if we can get legislation passed that prohibits companies like Facebook and Google to sell personal data of their users. With the privacy laws already in place it is not that farfetched to say that personal data stays property of the source.

I don't believe it cuts out facebook or others as the middleman, because they will keep selling your data. At this point, Medium seems like an alternative that needs to make itself interesting to buying parties in order for them to come to Datum and purchase their data there.  Think about it: Social media sites and email providers have very up-to-date info about you, which they can sell immediately. That will be highly targetable (in matter of seconds actually), which comes with a price tag. At Datum the user will have to keep their info/interest up-to-date themselves. I don't know how/if people will be doing that very often.  I actually really love the concept, but I do believe it needs some work (or a demo to make it a bit clearer).",False

Things I like:     Huge potential userbase (literally anyone in the world who is happy to get paid for sharing user-data). Massive growth potential as new tech is released that can be used to accumulate data. Clients who buy data from Datum must use DAT token to pay for it.

Viral will IMO be massive. 50% token bonus on the pre-sale (ends Sept 11th).  What I don't like:  Pre-release coin sale poorly marketed which concerns me a little bit about their marketing strategy in general.  I've been informed though that they have realised this error and will be looking to improve it for the official ICO. Their website doesn't effectively enough communicate the offering and the potential.

WEBSITE.....WHITEPAPER.....TWITTER.....TELEGRAM.....FACEBOOK.....BOUNTY CAMPAIGN    Today we are excited to announce the Datum Network, powering the new personal data information economy.  Datum is building the stock market for user & device data  Data is the new Oil and Datum is creating the first spot market for data by turning user and device generated data into tradeable assets. This entirely new market is estimated to grow to $120 Bln dollars and Datum is well positioned to take a significant market share given its first mover advantage.  DAT Tokens are the exclusive currency of this new market, and as it grows, so does the value of the DAT Tokens.  The DAT Token Sale will start on October 29 2017 13:00 GMT.  It will end on November 29 2017 13:00 GMT.    In order to give everyone a chance to be part of the Datum Token Sale we are distributing free DAT tokens Earn up to 500 DAT Tokens for sign up here    What is Datum?  Datum is a decentralized and distributed user data marketplace backed by a blockchain ledger. This technology allows to store and trade user generated data, such as social media data, internet activity data, health and wellness apps data, and also data from wearables, smart home, smart car and other IOT devices in a secure, private and anonymous manner. It lets individuals retake ownership of their personal information so they can sell it directly to businesses on their own terms.     Who is Datum for?  Datum is for End Users Datum returns data ownership back to individuals and let's everyone control whom they share their data with and for what price  Datum is for Storage Node Miners Miners running Datum Storage Nodes are paid for storing and providing low latency access to data. All you need to mine is a free disk space and fast internet. No GPUs. No crazy electricity bills. Just DAT tokens coming in to your wallet.  Datum is for Companies Datum allows companies unprecedented access to users data, with users consent. Currently developers are restricted by what Facebook, Google etc offer through their APIs, and these APIs come with massive restrictions and limitations. With Datum companies can buy the user data they need directly from users. No middlemen needed. Simple and straightforward.  Datum is for Everyone Datum provides a simple and easy to use mobile app backed by the Datum ecosystem, Datum marketplace and open API.        Roadmap  At Datum we have one focus - Creating a viable data marketplace to start returning value to token holders in the shortest time possible.   September 2016 Concept Development Founders start exploring large scale data storage for IOT devices in the medical and smart home sector and devise first prototypes of structuring unstructured data  June 2017 White Paper & Concept Validation With the release of the white paper and the resulting community feedback we have fine tuned the concept and laid out the roadmap for the Datum Network  1th August 2017 Pre-Sale & Alpha Version The Presale for the DAT Token starts, DAT allows users to participate in the new data economy. Datum will also release a demo of the Datum app before end of August  29th October 2017 to 29th November 2017 Datum Token Sale The Datum Token Sale will run from 29th October till 29th November or until the hard cap is reached. Meanwhile development of the Datum test network continues  December 2017 Test Network Launch The launch of the Datum test network marks the beta release and will allow basic functionalities to be explored by developers and the community  March 2018 Release Candidate The feature complete release candidate will be deployed to the test network and undergo intensive testing and bug fixing over the next three months  June 2018 Datum Launch The launch of the Datum Main Network marks the start of the new data economy.

Example: Uber used a startup unroll.me that was secretly reading people's Gmail to pilfer Lyft receipts data so they could get competitive intelligence: https://www.engadget.com/2017/04/24/unroll-me-pseudo-apology-for-uber-deal/ With Datum Network its much easier as they can cut the middlemen and simply buy Lyft receipts data directly from users themselves.  3) Streamlined access to much more user data than developers and companies can get elsewhere, enabling a new bread of applications and services Example: With the Datum Network API's developers can tap into much larger and wider amounts of a users personal data (always with the consent of the user obviously), this will allow for new services and also provide an incentive for developers to use the Datum Network, it will be much less cumbersome to simply ask users for permission to use some of their data for a specific purpose, rather than dealing with Facebook, Google & Co autocratic policies  4) Market Pressure: Users will start to demand that companies utilize safe data storage such as on the Datum Network Example: In the last years we have seen so many data leaks, users are getting fed up. Just as you expect your crypto exchange nowadays to handle your funds with care (2FA, Cold Storage, Security Audits etc.) you expect companies that handle your data to treat it with care, that is not the case nowadays, and who really wants to trust companies? With the Datum Network you are back in control what happens with your data  Looking forward to the community's thoughts on this, we are excited to bring this project alive and power the personal data information economy!",False
