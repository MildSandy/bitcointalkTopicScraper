Ethereum, the second-largest digital currency, is down 14 per cent according to CoinMarketCap.  Vyacheslav Grekov, CEO Beverage.Cash project: “Real sector economic integration represents a new era for cryptoworld.“  One of the main reasons for this rise of digital currencies is a hype-based desire of individuals to take economic power away from banks, governments and corporations. The main reason for the fall is the lack of cryptoworld and real economy connection. This turns cryptocurrency into virtual numbers not secured by anything other than hype. Having no financial support, cryptocurrency is doomed to instability. The recent trend is the search for the ways to integrate cryptocurrency into the real economy. The first companies from the real sector of the economy have already begun entering the cryptocurrency market, which is becoming the logical continuation of their business by building new decentralized economic ecosystem.  Vyacheslav Grekov, CEO Beverage.Cash project: “Many forms of cryptocurrency have been created over the last years and each of them has sought the way to integrate themselves into various sectors of the real economy. Cryptocurrency has to have a real worth and usefulness in order to be successful. Current trend of creating currencies backed by the real value helps to fill the gap between the real world and digital economies.”  The situation in the cryptocurrency market at the moment is showing that the currencies secured by real value are not subject to general downtrend and demonstrate a stable growth.

It’s not required by law to write on the label the full list of ingredients used in production of wine or other alcoholic beverage.

First of all we have been producing wine and craft alcohol for eight years and we know this market from the inside. Here you can see our products: http://castlesolis.com/ There are two main problems of beverage market 1.   Counterfeit: The total value of fake wine is around $3 billion, the same is going on with other alcoholic beverage. If you would like to study it in details, follow this link: https://euipo.europa.eu/tunnel-web/secure/webdav/guest/document_library/observatory/documents/Knowledge-building-events/Counterfeiting_of_foodstuff_en.pdf 2.   Quality:  How one could know which one of two wine bottles of Merlo on the shelf in the shop was made from grapes and without chemicals and which one was made from low quality bulk wine using a lot of different chemicals,  flavor enhancers , sugar etc.? It’s not required by law to write on the label the full list of ingredients used in production of wine or other alcoholic beverage.  Bulk wine is accounted for 38% of global wine trade in terms of volume, thus half of the wine sold around the world. To read more about it follow this link:http://socialvignerons.com/2017/09/25/the-importance-of-the-bulk-wine-market-in-the-world/  The revolutionary solution we offer with beverage.cash project (https://beverage.cash/) is the only way to protect producers from counterfeit and protect consumers from dishonest beverage producers.  What we use: 1.   RFID network – tags, readers, active sensors – automatically collects information from the vineyard, vinery, wine cellar (type of grapes, weather information, quantity, quality, temperature, time stored in oak barrels, geolocation and so on) and store this information in blockchain. 2.   Blockchain is a guarantee that information collected by RFID can’t and will not be changed. This is the best protection against dishonest beverage producers. 3.   QR/NFC – labels will be attached to every bottle of the beverage producers who participates in the project. From one hand, these labels is the key to access to all information stored about this certain bottle on blockchain for consumer; from another hand, this is a protection for producers from fake products being sold in the shops.   At the moment several wineries have already given their consent to participate in the project and new requests for cooperation are coming every day.",False
