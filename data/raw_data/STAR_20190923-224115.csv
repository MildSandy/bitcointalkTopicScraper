The centralized way banks and other institutional bodies currently handle loans all over the world leave no choice to the masses but to look for alternatives. This problem is escalating, pushing a lot of companies in the race for providing alternatives. So far many have tried but many issues remain. Lendoit wants to solve the two principal issues:  (1) these companies are offering Fiat money loans, making themselves subject to regulation and thus remaining centralized, and (2) being regulated and dealing with Fiat requires these companies to operate under a certain jurisdiction only, preventing them from arbitrating the different interest around the globe in favour of the loan parties.  Enters the Blockchain: using cryptocurrencies we can allow two people anywhere on the globe to interact without the need for an intermediate, making them find the sweet spot between the different interest rates in their country. For example, imagine a person from Brazil, where the annual interest rate can reach 60%, wants to borrow money from a person in Japan where the annual yield might be 1%. If we will let them negotiate the terms themselves eventually they will reach an agreement around 30% which offers both parties an extremely beneficial deal.  https://blog.starbase.co/p2p-blockchain-based-lending-platforms-lendoit-x-starbase-for-socializing-loss-fe4d0252688b",False

The amount has been returned to the investors which led to a delay of the whole crowdsale.  Now USD 2m (10m - 8m) is left for public crowdsale, exact date will be announced by end of this week as they are currently looking for a good KYC/AML solution first in order to avoid any problems with the Swiss regulations in future.

There are a few reasons why we decided to reschedule the sale.  Starbase is relocating from Singapore to Switzerland. The company’s establishment in Switzerland was schedule to be completed on August 29th but after weeks preparing the documentation and having everything in order, our legal team informed us that the name we submitted on our application is no longer available. They are expediting the process to complete the process with the new name this week. Starbase as a company is not allow to accept funds (ETH, BTC, Fiat) until the company has been registered properly in Switzerland. Secondly, without a registered name, we had to delay the pre-crowdsale transfers from our partners.  The partners are aware of the situation and supported the decision.  To address the issue with the rising ETH price and the crowdsale low cap, we have decided to fixed the ETH price at 2390 CNY for the pre-crowdsale purchases using the average on August 29, 2017, as agreed in the original agreement with our partners.   We are also in the process of a 3rd party audit of the smart contract.  This will assure the development of the contract is following best practices, help identify any security issues, if any and provides a transparent view to our community.   We apologies for the delay and will continue working toward starting the crowdsale on September 5th.   Best Regards, Starbase Team",False

Last week, the Starbase team has discussed possible regulatory implications of the STAR token with MME, our legal partner in Switzerland, which is specialized in blockchain matters and the conduct of TGE’s. (Token Generation Event).  Due to the current boom of TGE’s all around the world, national regulators will be reviewing closer the involved business models. ""Revenue/profit right"" tokens may be classified as ""securities"" in certain jurisdictions. We already received such an opinion from a Singapore law firm.  If the STAR tokens are classified as securities, STAR tokens will have less liquidity, because most exchanges will not list STAR tokens and serious international regulatory challenges may arise for Starbase company and platform, which even could result in the delay or complete default of the release of the Starbase platform.  So after days of internal discussions with MME and within the team regarding the risks and liabilities connected to the revenue function of the STAR token, the Starbase team decided to remove this revenue function.  However, as it is an important aspect of the project that STAR token users benefit from their engagement, the revenue function will be replaced by other attractive functionalities, including new feature of priority and/or discount of token purchase by staking and payment rights for bounty campaign system as a service for project owners.  STAR token holders who stakes STAR tokens to staking contract can priority and /or discount purchase projects tokens issued and sold on Starbase platform.  “Stake” means locking up tokens to a contract in a certain period of time, so stake mechanism will make less supply, and more needs for STAR Tokens.  Please find here our renewed draft of the token terms and condition: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/assets-cdn.starbase.co/docs/2017/07/Starbase_token_terms_v13.pdf Please look up the ""Regulatory Risk"" para 37 also.  As per the renewed draft of the token terms and condition, a reward input functionality may be implemented in the future. We will assess this option depending on the blockchain token regulatory landscape.  Our goal is to best serve our stakeholders’ interest and financial objectives.  If you have any questions or opinions, please let us know.  If you don't reply within two weeks from now, you will be considered as agreeing on the new token terms and condition.  Best, Starbase Early Purchase Team    After big changes like this in theory I can demand to get back my ETH no ? someone can help me maybe ? It's a nice project but that was the first reason I invest in...",False

If an idea is attractive enough for the general public, they can contribute towards the idea to make it a reality. The introduction of crowdfunding platforms as a mean to support ideas is now possible. Most of such platforms are currently tied to traditional models. They deal in fiat currencies, and therefore limit their global outreach. Starbase, on the other hand, is a crowdfunding platform which exclusively relies on blockchain to bypass territorial limitations. The cryptocurrency-based crowdfunding/crowdsourcing platform is founded by Tomoaki Sato, a blockchain engineer. The platform allows startups and individual project creators to list their product ideas and goals, to raise funds from the diverse cryptocurrency community. Starbase supports a range of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc., to make it easier for both the contributors as well as the project owners to send/receive transactions. Even institutional investors, VC firms, angel investors can become part of the Starbase community and invest in projects.",False
