Here are a few startups that are leveraging blockchain technology to tackle some of the biggest issues facing our world today:  Healthcare WELL: This telemedicine platform is changing the face of healthcare in two ways. First, its global network of doctors makes affordable healthcare available anytime, anywhere. That means that through virtual appointments, patients in remote or underserved areas can now access medical care, even if they don’t have a doctor nearby. And because the platform is blockchain and crypto-based, problems such as data-accessibility and cross-border payments are avoided. Second, WELL has a buy-one-give-one program in place, so every time you use their platform to purchase a doctor’s appointment, one is donated in a community of need. If world leaders can’t get it together to fix the global healthcare crisis, at least WELL is taking a step in that direction.  Environment PlasticBank: There’s no denying our environment is in trouble, but what if you could help the earth and earn money at the same time? That’s what PlasticBank has in mind. They’re incentivizing plastic waste collection by offering people around the world cryptocurrency, goods, and services in exchange for their plastic, which they then recycle. The world gets cleaner, plastic is kept out of our oceans, and the people who need it most are able to earn money from the process.  Education ODEM: On-Demand Education Marketplace is a blockchain based education startup that’s globalizing online learning by letting students around the world find their perfect course and teacher. Operating on blockchain technology (and crypto payment) not only makes the payment process borderless, it also helps keep costs down by eliminating the middle-man.  Poverty BanQu: BanQu aims to solve global poverty through blockchain, by connecting refugees, the displaced, and the world’s poorest to the global economy. 2.7 billion people don’t have access to banks and other financial institutions because they lack a verifiable identity. BanQu is hoping blockchain will help fix that, and will create a digital identity for those who need it.",False

In a world marked by inequality, global healthcare doesn’t fare any differently. The African region has access to only 3% of global health workers, and many countries in Africa have less than one doctor per 10,000 people. By contrast, countries in Western Europe often boast three or four doctors per every 1,000 population members. Helping to solve that inequality became an integral part of WELL’s business plan. But the question was how. The answer is a complex, multi-pronged approach that, when it comes together, has the potential to affect real change.  Achieve global availability. The WELL network is only as good as its reach. By using blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, WELL users avoid cross-border payment problems. That means anyone with an internet connection can use the platform, giving users the ability to get the healthcare they need, no matter where they are in the world.  Close the gap. WELL’s global network is the first step in battling the uneven distribution of physicians worldwide. On the WELL network, a patient in Africa can see a doctor in Europe, and a patient in Central America and see a doctor in Canada.  A stronger one-for-one model. WELL has established a charitable giving arm, which donates a doctor’s visit in an area of need for each one purchased through its platform. It gives patients in more affluent areas the ability to help others, without having to do anything other than book an appointment. WELL believes that while the one-for-one model can’t hurt, it can also be better. That’s why instead of simply donating a doctor’s visit in an underserved community, WELL is working to train healthcare workers. The patient still gets the care they need through a telehealth visit, but the doctor providing the visit works with local nurses and other healthcare workers to help improve the care they’re giving. Suddenly one-for-one becomes one-for-many, as entire communities can benefit from an increase in knowledge on the local level.  Join the healthcare revolution and be part of the change",False

While the technologies haven’t reached such a level that robots can completely replace doctors, this is unthinkable without the close connection to medical education. ODEM, which aspires to be the Airbnb of international education, is collaborating with WELL by using the blockchain-based ODEM platform to streamline the organization and delivery of specialized medical training courses.  The telemedicine adepts, like WELL followers, understand that not everything can be cured online. There is a similar story in education: physical presence in the classroom is still necessary to acquire specific knowledge and skills. A short-term or long-term in-person training program for medical students is quite essential but in an updated form.  WELL was attracted to the idea of partnering with ODEM because of the companies’ shared vision of using blockchain, or distributed-ledger technology to creatively disrupt their target industries; medicine and education. Besides, within the both platforms — WELL and ODEM — doctors can earn tokens, developing and providing educational programs for young specialists.  Rich Maaghul, ODEM’s chief executive officer, says:      To enter a medical school is a pipe dream for many people all over the world. ODEM and WELL is going to make it real. Through establishing an education on demand system and a global marketplace based on the blockchain they assume to reduce the costs for high-quality education and push the market to create more efficient educational programs with an individual approach to each student.   “We are glad to cooperate with ODEM in striving to promote high-quality medical education and make it more accessible and modern. We plan to encourage WELL’s senior doctors to share their knowledge with younger specialists. It would be great if the most active on the WELL platform doctors create original educational programs on the ODEM platform as well.” said Ildar Fazulyanov, WELL’S chief executive officer.",False

This International Women’s Day, we at WELL want to highlight some of the ways that telemedicine is being used to improve women’s health around the world. And for the latest updates on how WELL is changing the telehealth industry, follow our Telegram group at https://t.me/joinwell.   Preventative visits: It’s 2018, but women still bear the brunt of household and childcare labor, despite also holding full-time jobs. That means going to the doctor is just one more item on women’s endless to-do lists that often gets skipped. But thanks to telemedicine platforms such as WELL, which connects to IoT devices and allows you to check things like vitals at home, you no longer need to go to the doctor in order to see a doctor. We’ll work on fixing the gender inequality in household labor next, but while we’re waiting, you’re no longer off the hook for your annual physical.  Lactation consultants: We can rattle off a list of the benefits of breastfeeding, including nutritional value and a lower risk of disease and infection for babies, but none of that matters if you can’t get your baby to latch. But who has the time — or the energy — to go to a lactation consultant when figuring out the needs of a newborn? Luckily, now lactation consultations are available online, so you don’t even need to get out of your pajamas in order to up your breastfeeding game.  Breast cancer consultation: There’s very little that’s more frightening than cancer, and navigating the waters alone can be overwhelming. But when your health is on the line, you want to make sure you’re doing everything right. Dr. Rebecca Kaltman’s breast cancer consultations helps to streamline the process and ease some of the fear, all online. From providing second opinions to coordinating care and even researching clinical trials, Dr. Kaltman is helping women feel a bit more in control, even when they’re at their most vulnerable.  Cervical selfie: In developing countries where there’s a shortage of proper medical care, the cervical selfie — a photo of your cervix that’s taken through a device that attaches to your phone — is replacing pap smears and helping to detect and curb cervical cancer. It may not be your top selfie choice for Instagram, but it can help save your life.  Birth control: Gone are the days of having to go into the doctor’s office just to get a refill on birth control. Thanks to telemedicine, prescription services for everything from the birth control pill to yeast infection meds are available online. Which gives women greater control over their bodies — and their time.",False

WELL is eliminating country borders by making high-quality healthcare accessible anytime, anywhere. Its growing global network of 1,600 doctors and specialists speak a multitude of languages, including English, Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Russian, Hebrew, Japanese, and more, making it ideal for travelers. And WELL is built on blockchain technology, decentralizing medical records, giving patients control over their data, and eliminating problems of cross-border payments, so you can go on vacation in Thailand, consult a specialist in Moscow, and rest easy knowing that your doctors have all of the information they need, while your data remains secure. Not only that, but travelers can do good by doing WELL, and give responsible tourism a new meaning through WELL’s social mission, which donates a doctor’s visit to a community in need for every visit purchased through its platform.  TravelChain gives travelers control over their data, letting them decide what information to share and with whom, while providing a better-curated tourist experience. Travelers earn tokens by granting access to their information, which they can use for tourist services or exchange for money. At the same time, TravelChain uses machine learning to better understand its users and anticipate their needs, so when you do choose to share your information, you receive travel suggestions, promotions, and discounts that are meaningful to you.  Together, WELL and TravelChain are working to create a better travel experience that you’re in control of. So TravelChain can suggest the perfect spot to stop and smell the roses, and the perfect WELL doctor to prescribe an allergy medication.

That makes the running of hospitals more efficient - telemedicine enables quicker detection of patients’ major warning signs and less hospital readmissions  As more cutting-edge high-tech equipment becomes available to take telemedicine to even higher levels, the efficiency of telemedicine will be even greater. And that's where WELL comes into play With WELL customers enjoy the benefits of telehealth solutions. Patients have access to leading doctors and specialists, 24/7 365 days a year via the highly practical and efficient WELL web and mobile platform.",False
