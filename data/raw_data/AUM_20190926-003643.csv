The team is an investment firm bringing a decentralized cryptocurrency ecosystem to all of Latin America. Currently Latin America makes up only 1% of the total volume in crypto with Mexico being half of it so far. From my understanding of the team’s vision, Latin America is riddled with corruption and people’s economic freedoms are caught in the middle of it. Alteum's mission is simply to give the people an easier way to enter this market and achieve more freedom. Now I'm going to explain better what they're doing.  For starters, they're building a fully functional exchange with FIAT to crypto pairings of the many different Latin American national currencies. What's very important is that they already have the legal authorizations approved to make this happen. I can’t comment on which exact pairings they will initially start out with, but what I do know is that as the market grows, they plan to have all the different Latin American fiat gateways made available, providing all these people lower barriers into crypto. While Latin America is the primary target market, this is a huge first mover because we’ve all been stuck using expensive services like Coinbase, losing even more money having to send between exchanges, and having to trade between different coins just to get the actual tokens we want. It's frustrating as all get-out. Imagine how big it will be for these people to have an exchange that you can buy every token directly!  Now I'll review the AUM exchange token, which is an ERC223 token so MyEtherWallet compatible. AUM is exciting because it will not be just your standard exchange token that provides trading fee incentives and things of that nature. Alteum's vision is for AUM to become the digital coin of Latin America, serving as both a store of value and utility token with legitimate use cases in peer-to-peer lending. From my understanding, the exchange will offer investors the ability to freeze their AUM tokens as a source of collateral. Users will be able to apply for loans at low interest rates, only receiving their AUM back once you've paid the loan. No expensive intermediaries, collateral verified on the blockchain = more transparency, more efficient, no need for high interest rates, no credit checks necessary, no red tape… and from an investment standpoint, when more and more people stake their AUM as collateral, it gets locked out of the circulating supply and its value will increase. The exchange along with Alteum’s token are just a couple of the building blocks that will create this new ecosystem. In addition to all this, they are building their own Alteum blockchain platform for other Latam projects to be built on. Just as NEO was popularized to be the Chinese Ethereum, Alteum is aiming for their platform to be the NEO of Latin America... which will be huge in terms of potential value of AUM! I'm sure I'm doing the team an injustice trying to explain it all, but they will be rolling out more details in the near future with summit meetings and interviews coming soon.  With how ambitious this is, my analysis turned towards the team next to see if they have experience with handling finances as well as a technical background. It does turn out that the chief financial officer (CFO) is ex JP Morgan with experience in Mergers & Acquisitions and he was also previously CFO of an energy retailer. So this guy is definitely an all star player. Also, decent portion of the team consists of backgrounds in information technology and software engineering, which is important to the development of their exchange and platform. I joined the Telegram awhile back to keep an eye on the project and they have been constantly rolling out new developments and are staying ahead of their roadmap which is very reassuring.   Token metrics and ICO structure:   Total Supply: 50,000,000 AUM Circulating Supply (tokens sold): 37,500,000 AUM Market Cap based on all tokens sold in ICO: $24 million (NICE!)   Pre-ICO: starts Friday, February 16th Offering: 11,250,000 AUM @ $0.55 per token   ICO: starts following pre-ICO completion, ends March 15th or once cap is reached (whichever comes first) Offering: 20,650,000 AUM @ $0.75 per token   What I like about their offering is that no matter what part of ICO you get in on, we already know bare minimum how hot exchange tokens are. AUM has only 1/3 of the circulating supply of BNB and KCS tokens (offered around the same price I bought KCS for back in December). And the token offers even more value based on this ambitious financial ecosystem and blockchain platform they're trying to create. As for their roadmap, the first step is that the exchange will launch right after the ICO, no later than April 1st, so this will all happen fast. I’ll leave links below to their site, white paper, and telegram/facebook/twitter so you can get up-to-date, take a look at the project, and get involved while it’s still a small community. I’m excited at looking back on this call and bringing it to your guys’ attention! A big thank you will be appreciated lol... Please though, don't just blindly invest. Take what I said, then do your own due diligence, join the telegram, and find out for yourself. And let me know what you think! About the project, about the review, I need more opinions and want to keep improving.""
