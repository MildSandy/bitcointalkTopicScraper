How are the people supposed to browse Hostcoin sites?  The main problem with Namecoin was not being officially integrated with either existing browsers or the Namecoin wallet itself. People is supposed to install 3rd party browser plugins  to be able to resolve Namecoin websites, and 3rd party plugins are less trustworthy than an official one.  Or they should manually do complicated setups.  I hope you will provide official browser plugins, or dedicated browsers like TOR , maybe integrated into your wallet.
