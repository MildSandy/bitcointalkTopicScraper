FIRST PROJECT OF ITS KIND. FOR MEN,"The Man Cave Project  Who we are:  The Man Cave is a cryptocurrency project designed to empower men to be the people they have always wanted to be. We want to empower men with the clarity and abundance mindset to go out and achieve anything they can dream up or think of -- the potential is in all of us, we just need to realise this for ourselves  Vision:  Our vision is to create a thriving hub for men to prosper, communicate and network with other men where we can share ideas, learn new trades, be better people, or just sit back, relax and have a beer whilst talking to friends.  There is a dire need for a space for men to come in and just, well, be men. There is often a world that’s telling us what we ‘should’ be, rather than letting us accept us for who we are. If you look take a look at spaces for women -- those are already ahead of us; they teach each and every woman that it’s perfectly acceptable to be a woman, and it is. Why not have a place for men that does the same?  BroCoin:  Brocoin will be the fundamental underpinning of the work that we do in the man cave. We want to incentivise our users to participate. We want to create a community coin that will be used to reward participants for their continued involvement in the cave. We plan to have participation levels, random rewards, gift days, lotteries, quiz tokens and so much more. You will be able to use BroCoin on our sister website to buy, share, read, and participate in manly things. It’s not fully operational yet, but rest assured after the ICO we’ll be hiring people to make it just right. We plan to host community events, and hopefully invite popular speakers along to our cause; you will only gain entry to these events with BroCoin, but you can earn BroCoin easily by participating in some form in The Man Cave.  Incentivized participation model  What is a community without areas of interest to dive into? Not a community. We already have several men and women that have offered up their time to create materials of learning or worth for newcomers to divulge in. Currently we have beer rooms, bbq rooms, wellbeing, football, music, dads, emotional stability and many, many, more. People that want to come into our cave and “contribute” their time to creating materials for other men to peak their interest will be rewarded in weekly payments of BroCoin. Think of it as a weekly wage for your time. Time is money, and we can’t ask people to do it for free. Some of us are skilled listeners, others are skilled artists, we even have some skilled barbequers!! (BraaiBoy, he’s famous on YouTube)  Anyone with a skill or trade can be a contributor! Just ask the community developers in the Cave and we’ll take you through a simple process.  ICO  Tokens:     134,000,000 Tokensale: 100,000,000 Marketing:  13,400,000 Teams:       13,400,000 Bounty:        7,400,000  Buyers of BroCoin will get an equivalent share drop of EasySocial tokens should they wish to participate in the ICO, and by doing so would give them a better holding on the future chains that will emerge from EasyDex.
