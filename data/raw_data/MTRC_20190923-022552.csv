If you are an MTRc holder, your token value may get depreciated by 90% from a nominal value in case you buy MTRc closer to the end of ModulTrade Token Distribution while some earlier investors during Pre-Sale are still at par.  You might be thinking — how long will it take to recover MTRc price and to grow the demand on the token? And how could you contribute to MTRc price increase?  First of all, one should accept the fact that there’s no reason preventing MTRc from the growth. But it’s undeniably that MTRc being a utility token is very much dependent on and driven by trade volumes on MT Market that uses MTRc to settle transaction and make fee payments. Therefore, we should think of the boost of Global Sale in MTRc and increase demand for MTRc on the exchanges.  ModulTrade has developed an action plan that contains practical steps to facilitate the above and reach the objectives. The worldwide release of the enhanced MT Market and the start of a Global Sale in MTRc are designed in order to increase the demand for MTRc and create necessary liquidity on the market. The Global Sale campaign is scheduled for the next week!  During the campaign anyone can buy cool items from Apple product range — Apple Watch, IPad, Iphone; products from Sony — VR, PlayStation and etc. at a real discount of up 50%  To buy cool stuff with crazy discounts at MT Market Buyers have to top up MTRc balances and get ready their wallets for the Global Sale.

ModulTrade creates a foundation for the launch of ModulTrade blockchain based platform in African region.  LONDON, June 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ModulTrade creates a foundation for the launch of ModulTrade blockchain based smart-contract platform (MT WALLET and MT MARKET) in the African continent after signing agreements with leading financial & logistic organizations and meeting with an Ambassador of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Baikov.  Leading logistics company SIMAT, and SERFIN, one of the key players in financial services and a representative of Western Union in Côte d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso, will both benefit from using ModulTrade products; ModulTrade Market and the ModulTrade Wallet, working on the ModulTrade blockchain currency, MTRc.  Having already signed deals in China with successful adoption and use of ModulTrade applications, the move into Africa marks a pivotal change in a market where there are more smartphone users than those with bank accounts. One of the key benefits ModulTrade provides is taking the full trade cycle online. Trade can now be executed through smartphones, tablets or desktop, with smart-contracts ensuring trusted transactions between both buyer and seller.  SIMAT will benefit from the ModulTrade Market's capability of cross-market trading, and the delivery of goods around the world. This partnership will open the doors for MSMEs who have before struggled to export and import through traditional trade flows.  The partnership with SERFIN will see ModulTrade's Wallet added to 800 outlets as a choice for money transfer and payment, and the ModulTrade Market a secure trade platform for SEFIN's clients – the MSMEs.  The partnerships have been welcomed by Russian Ambassador Vladimir Baikov, who agrees with the need for a new platform like ModulTrade to allow easier and safer cross-border trade and transactions for the African market.  Further to SERFIN and SIMAT, discussions are in place with other businesses, of which partnerships will be announced in due course. Current partnerships will commence with a pilot from July.

During our visit to Africa MT team (CEO (Evgeny Kaplin) and Co-Founder (Jean Chaanine) has several important meetings with key representatives from different industries. We will share the main highlights and agreements on MT Market & Wallet future development on this continent on daily basis.  Africa is a huge market for digital and blockchain solutions. There are more people with smartphones than with bank accounts. ModulTrade products — MT Market and MT Wallet provide all in one solution for payments and trade through a smartphone.  Our first stop is the largest economy in French-speaking West Africa and the third largest in West Africa — Côte d’Ivoire. Africa welcomed us with nice weather and hardworking atmosphere. We held two (and we still have two more — we will share the details later) important meetings here today, where we presented our idea and main products.  First, we presented MT Wallet and MT Market to Mr. Madi OUEDRAODO, CEO of SERFIN and his team (representative of Western Union in Côte d’Ivoire and Burkina Faso).    Online banking is taking over traditional banking all over the world. Opening branches for banks can cost a fortune and can also prove to be ineffective. This fact was first realized by the banks themselves. It motivates them to provide online banking and payments services to their customers via digital channels and social media.  We agreed on adding ModulTrade in their brands to deliver their clients (800 local counters in Cote d’Ivoire and Burkina Faso) and make MT Wallet a tool of choice for money transfer and payment; MT Market will become a SERFIN partner tool for trade for their clients (Micro businesses and SMEs).  We will then engage in connecting ModulTrade and SERFIN networks of clients to open their financial services (e.g. prepaid cards) and to collaborate on both platforms with each other.  After that, we headed to Mr. Stephane Eholie, CEO of SIMAT, a logistics company. They were interested in our capabilities of carrying out worldwide deliveries in terms of MT Market.    There are more than 70,000 small producers in Africa and more than 18 Bn €+ of export and import flows through the continent. ModulTrade aims to penetrate this market and generate over 100 mln € profit.  We agreed to test ModulTrade ecosystem (MT Market & MT Wallet) with SIMAT clients in summer 2018 with further commercial launch before the end of the year 2018.  Why do all the organizations need MT Wallet and MT Market?  All in one solution for digital payments and trade services based on the technology of the future — Blockchain  Adds Trust to the Trade — Letter of Credit and Escrow secured by blockchain  No SWIFT required for cross-border payments  Connects every Businessman with a Smartphone to financial services and trade  No Intermediaries (like Rotterdam) to Buy or Sell African goods globally — You can sell to final buyers and have secured payments   Tuesday will be a challenging day, yet full of opportunities.  Stay in touch to check tomorrow’s highlights,  MT team.",True

It is our second day here in the beautiful country of Côte d’Ivoire, West Africa. The day indeed proved itself to be full of opportunities — every meeting shows the huge potential of ModulTrade products in all industries. After having met with different industries’ representatives yesterday, we further met with four more organizations today to share our ModulTrade’s solutions.  The first meeting was held with Mr Guy Mbengue, CEO of Association for Promotion of Export, and his team. The export of agricultural and mineral products enabled the country to maintain a positive trade balance over a period of 15 years. It has thus become crucial for the country’s trade industry to have an efficient and modern payment system. With its blockchain-based payments system, MT hopes to provide just that. We presented our products to them and discussed possible use cases.    The next meeting was held with Mr. Hermann TRAORE, COO of West Africa’s Regional Stock Exchange — BRVM. With their central site located in the country’s urban center Abidjan, this stock exchange is common to all 8 of the West African countries. It is the world’s only exchange to connect a large number of countries over an entirely electronic and integrated sharing system. We talked about further improving BRVM’s network with MT’s idea of smart-contracts, MTRc and other unique blockchain solutions.  Modultrade is expected to participate in the digital transformation of BRVM and bring value for members for money transfers with MT Wallet.  There’s a big opportunity for MT Wallet in Africa, where there are more than 0.3 bn€ generated from mobile payments, resulting in more than 60 bn€ of cross-border payments in UEMOA made through mobile applications. MT-Wallet has a real chance of penetrating this market and becoming a trusted payment service.    The third meeting of the day was with the CEO of Association of Banking Professionals and Financial Institutions (APBEF-CI) — Mr. Serge KOUAMELAN — and their legal and operations teams. The organization works to bring together a large network of banks and financial institutions in Côte d’Ivoire. It aims to promote the development of banking related activities in the region via profitable relations between its members. The meeting focused on enhancing the association’s operations by making use of our platform’s modern payments method that uses blockchain tokens — MTRc. Moreover, our blockchain-based system offers faster and cheaper solutions to their network for banking services like transactions and funds transfers.     Our fourth meeting was with Mr. Aka Mathias NGOAN, CEO of National Organization for Agriculture Producers in Côte d’Ivoire (ANOPACI). The organization brings together various Ivorian agricultural sectors and has currently 30 member associations. Our meeting was focused on improving the organization’s operations by integrating our proposed MT technologies. Their main aims include defending the rights of producers and improving living conditions of farmers. We hope to speed up the company’s progress and help them effectively reach their goals.     Looking forward to our third productive day here!  Stay with us to get more updates about the upcoming meetings and their results!  MT team",True

Thus ModulTrade Ltd was incorporated in UK, London.

In addition, some cool features like token exchange and buying for fiat will be added soon.  Why did we decide to make another crypto wallet? On the way of building ModulTrade blockchain based marketplace for small businesses, the ModulTrade team understood that we have to provide an easy and secure gateway for SMEs to allow them to enter into the crypto environment.  Transactions in MTRc are free in ModulTrade wallet. To give our users an incentive to start using the wallet, we decided to remove all commissions related to MTRc transactions when using the ModulTrade wallet. Global Trade Finance was never so easy and cost-effective.  Main page of MT Wallet    We have been working hard together with our UX designers to make it as intuitive as possible. It is a new leap in way of operating with crypto — the MT Wallet will help professional crypto enthusiasts and every crypto newcomer in his day-to-day operations with BTC, ETH and of course MTRc.  Following our baseline and regarding best practices — we spent a lot of time and resources to make MT Wallet safe and secure. As a target, we plan to be compliant with PSI DSS standards and pass the subsequent audit in the near future.  The MT Wallet is based on “three whales”: cost-effective, easy to use and safe.  After operating for one year in the crypto space, we have to admit it was a great journey. We have seen bull and bear markets, ups and downs, but managed to survive. It was a pleasure working with such a supportive community!  Birthday is always good time to announce something special — you can now trade MTRc on Livecoin.net!   — — —    ModulTrade CEO, Evgeny Kaplin, with 17-years experience in Trade Finance Business, started the revolution in Global Trade with the help of Blockchain technology aiming to provide secure and efficient trade services without intermediaries.

Why should anyone invest in you?  You are not a legit company and you not even registered. There is no legal reason for wanting our KYC so stop playing this bs KYC game. It was never a problem before why only now? Because you are using the KYCc tactics that many are using now.  I encourage everyone to make negative tweets about this campaign.

As we stated during ModulTrade Token Distribution MTRc will be listed on reputable exchanges within 3 months after the end of the Sale (Jan, 30)  In March ModulTrade got confirmation from 2 exchanges for listing. One of the exchanges is proceeding with MTRc onboarding and there is 10-15% chance to be listed in March. The other exchange (planned for listing in March) unexpectedly indicated deposit of 100BTC to be blocked at exchange. Such amount is a significant amount for ModulTrade and will cut Product Development budget. Therefor this exchange is on hold until we negotiate reasonable terms.  Meanwhile we would like to assure that we have all confirmations from the reputable exchange for MTRc listing and you will see it traded as promised by ModulTrade team during the Token Distribution (3 months after Jan, 30).  We also would like to highlight that a primary goal of ModulTrade team is to start MTRc circulation within ModulTrade platform which will drive demand for MTRc and its organic price increase.

Find ModulTrade Roadmap update below.  ModulTrade Team has been busy over the recent weeks to proudly announce our updated roadmap with some interesting upcoming events.  Within the next months, our team will develop three main items of ModulTrade Product which will intensify the usage of MTRc  MT4Mining — “All you need for mining”  MT Wallet — “Fiat/crypto gateway — Secure & Easy”  MT Button — “Trade Finance on the blockchain for Marketplaces”  In parallel MTRc will be listed on well known and reputable exchanges, ModulTrade will partner with market leaders in finance and other industries and will invite Strategic Investor to develop and launch together a new era in global trade.  MT4MINING — Global platform for crypto-mining industry  MT4Mining is our first implementation of the Modultrade core feature. It will provide the Letter of Credit on the blockchain secured with escrow smart contracts for each trade. We consider this specific marketplace as our test subject for the Modultrade core.  People can use the platform for buying and selling mining-related items. In addition, it is possible to buy and sell services complimentary to crypto-mining locally and globally like maintenance, colocation, and consulting.  We will spend a lot of time monitoring the progress of the platform and the needs of the users. In the future, we will be opening up more specific markets. This year we hope to reach over $10million in trades.  ModulTrade Wallet  We will present our own MTRc wallet that will give you the following opportunities:  Legitimate crypto/fiat gateway for corporates and individuals  Easy cryptocurrency transfer and exchange. Our wallet will support MTRc, BTC, and ETH  Easy payment on the ModulTrade marketplace for orders on our platform  By October , we want 10,000 registered users. The beta version of the wallet will be launched several months before.  Plugin MT Button for existing Marketplaces  We are working on a plugin button ‘Trade with ModulTrade’. This allows marketplaces to offer new user experience to its customers — secure trade and payment service on blockchain. Users can buy something on a website using ModulTrade platform functionality. It’s comparable with a PayPal ‘Buy Now’ button. By August, we want to integrate this button in three well-known marketplaces.  MTRc Exchange Listing  Within the next month MTRc will be listed on a well-known and reputable exchange. At the moment of writing, we are in the process of finalizing agreements. And within next 12 months, MTRc will be listed on more top exchanges.  MT Holding in Singapore, Strategic partnership and investor  ModulTrade will serve an Asia-Europe trade flow and will establish a holding company in Singapore to strengthen itself in Asia as well. Within next 6 months, a number of partnerships with market leaders will be established and ModulTrade will engage with a well known strategic investor.  Besides that, we are working hard on the platform itself. We are building relationships with crypto-mining and computer equipment producers, resellers and service providers. At last, we are as well working on defining the legal grounds for trade deals in target countries.  Execution of ModulTrade Roadmap will drive the usage and demand for MTRc. That should lead to a stable MTRc price increase within 2018. Users will start to use MTRc to trade on the platform. New investors will start buying MTRc on the secondary market at exchanges.  We expect a bright future for ModulTrade in 2018 and would like to share the success with our supporters, platform users and investors.  The very Best!  ModulTrade Team",True

William Mougayar wrote a great article on tokenomics. He points out that many so-called ‘utility tokens’ don’t provide utility. Many projects do not evaluate the use of their token properly, resulting in a non-utility token being sold as a utility token.  We, ModulTrade, want to show the true value of our token by answering a selection of questions from William his article on ‘Tokenomics’ (1). We will answer each questions with Yes/No and provide a short explanation.  Is the token tied to a product usage, i.e. does it give the user exclusive access to it, or provide interaction rights to the product? Yes. It is the key to transact in ModulTrade (MT) Value Ecosystem, as all fees on trade contracts on MT platform will have to be paid in MTRc. ModulTrade builds a value ecosystem for global trade, i.e. a digital networked value structure that is real-time, global, connected, digital and cost-effective.  2. Does the token grant a governance action, like voting on a consensus related or other decision-making factor or does it grant an ownership of sorts? No.  The MTRc token gives no rights in ModulTrade company and doesn’t represent participation in the company.  3. Does the token enable the user to contribute to a value-adding action for the network or market that is being built? Yes.  For instance, third parties could build solutions within ModulTrade Value Ecosystem and on top of MT platform, whose usage will be charged in MTRC. It will also enable third-party developers / service providers to gain access to a wider target of users / clients, while reducing development and user acquisition costs.  4. Does the token result in a monetizable reward based on an action by the user (active work)? No.  There’s no reward for mining or other active work by the users. The value of MTRc token is determined by pure market forces (supply and demand). It is nothing like an equity stake that could entitle you to dividends.  5. Does the token grant the user a value based on sharing or disclosing some data about them (passive work)? Yes.  If we approach from that point that MTRc is the entry key to our ecosystem, then if we share someone’s data in our ecosystem it indirectly brings value to the token holder as the track records can provide more accurate risk profiling for lenders thus lower interest rates for users.  6. Is buying/selling something part of the business model and can users create a new product or service? Yes.  ModulTrade is a multi-sided platform business model; in order to work properly buyers and sellers must buy/sell their goods and third-party users must provide services / solutions that enrich the ecosystem.  7. Is the token required to run a smart contract? Yes.  8. Is the token required as a security deposit to secure some aspect of the blockchain’s operation? Yes.  There’s an escrow-account mechanism to provide trust between the buyer and the seller, and as well create a secure environment. The token will be staked in the smart contract which acts as an escrow agent.  9. Is the token used to pay for some usage? Yes.  Trade fees and usage of third-party solutions on the platform will be charged in MTRc.  10. Is the token required to join a network or other related entity? Yes.  The token is required to transact on the platform.  11. Is the token given away or offered at a discount, as an incentive to encourage product trial or usage? Yes.  12. Is the token your principal payment unit, essentially functioning as an internal currency? Yes.  Trade fees and usage of third-party solutions on the platform will be charged in MTRc as its the internal currency for MT platform.  13. Does your blockchain autonomously distribute profits to token holders? No.  Profits are not shared to token holders; the MTRc token gives no rights in ModulTrade company and doesn’t represent participation in the company.  Conclusion  The MTRc token is clearly a utility token being used as an internal currency within the ModulTrade Value Ecosystem. It will be used as well for charging usage fees for third-parties’ solution built around ModulTrade Service Platform. The token doesn’t return you dividends and as well doesn’t give you rights in ModulTrade, as that’s the definition of an equity token.  https://medium.com/@ModulTrade/understand-the-true-value-and-utility-of-the-mtrc-token-4e60a40512b6",True

It is happening now and it is being led by ModulTrade – an innovative project, developing a global platform which may soon revolutionize the cross-border trade across the world.  Trade finance has long been seen as the preserve of banks to control and manage. Companies, unless they were big multinational concerns were often limited by choice and then forced to accept fee structures that along with currency risk instruments seriously cut into margins and rendered the whole exercise redundant.  No more, the ModulTrade platform effectively smashes the banking cartels and heralds a new era in freedom to pursue trade deals at minimum cost in time, revenue and process management.  The costs, lack of transparency and time taken to establish letters of credit meant the trade finance process was ripe for disruption. In 2016 four students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) decided to challenge the status quo and launch a platform that would connect in real time buyers and sellers of goods, and put back trust into trading relationships.  The team’s bluechip background in commercial banking and commerce meant they understood the workflows and risk profiles, and being entrepreneurs saw the potential of how blockchain technology could deliver a transformational experience and operating system.  The key insight that the team landed upon was the use of smart contracts and how their application in a closed network would act to cover both the purchase and consignment of goods in real time. Advances in tracking systems and wider improvements in blockchains – the team have settled on the Ethereum network – meant that once the underlying architecture had been specced out, ModulTrade were able to move quickly to deliver a minimum viable project and engage with the potential customer.  Since launching the vision for the platform in September 2017 the team has found themselves in continuous discussions with both investors and businesses who seeing the potential of the system have been keen to become customers and backers of the project. In particular in Asia, in the emerging “One Belt, One Road” economic region the reception has proved to be overwhelmingly positive. This month on a recent trip back to China, ModulTrade signed a number of partnership agreements that will not only support the adoption of the platform as core conduit for trade through the region but will act to create an ongoing demand for MTRc, the ModulTrade token.  So as the ModulTrade token sale enters the last phase of completion investors should take comfort from the fact that: the list of advisors has increased and grown with more technical and market experts joining the team as the full benefits of the platform become apparent. The platform has been tested and is now operational, and working to make “democratization” of trade a reality. And that customers, large scale buyer, are engaged with ModulTrade to put orders on the system and stimulate growth.  Ultimately, all investors have to undertake their own due diligence on any project but in the case of ModulTrade, they have more than honored their commitments as set out in their white paper and have driven themselves to realize the vision, without compromise.  So the process of transformation in trade finance is happening, the revolution is real and the chance to be part of it, for a short time, still exists.

London, 25th January, following on from a successful series of meetings in Asia, ModulTrade CEO, Evgeny Kaplin arrived in London to participate in Crypto Economy, a two day event dedicated to token raises and ICO sales.  The presence of ModulTrade at Crypto Economy marks the beginning of the end of their own fundraising journey that in little over 5 months has seen them cross continents, join incubators, sit on numerous panels and win plaudits, top ratings and many friends in many markets for the ModulTrade platform.  In 2017, the world learnt about the opportunity to democratize international trade for SMEs and how the team had through the use of smart contracts set out to fix the lack of trust in cross border trade. The message of meet, commit and execute began to resonate across the globe and each week more and more people joined the Telegram channel and the movement to offer transparent and fair terms of business for enterprises; businesses who want to trade internationally but were being priced out of the market by high commissions and excessive charges for letters of credit and bank guarantees.  As much as ModulTrade have solved the problem of how to operate at scale, a fair and open trade ledger and supply chain, they have also highlighted a number of failures in the current model. Inequalities that have registered with small business owners and members of the public. As a result they have received extensive backing from industry and crowd sale participants, support that means 2018 will see the expansion of the platform and the start of the SME global trade economy.  The final day to participate, and buy the ModulTrade token: MTRc is drawing near and with the closure of sale, the beginning of a new journey, to deliver better process, better prices and ultimately better outcomes for the SMEs across the globe.

In addition, we think that globalization is still an ongoing process. ModulTrade helps companies to even further globalize.  Interconnectedness Globalization has resulted in greater interconnectedness among markets around the world and increased communication and awareness of business opportunities in the far corners of the globe. More investors can access new investment opportunities and study new markets at a greater distance than before. Potential risks and profit opportunities are within easier reach thanks to improved communications technology. Products and services previously available within one country are made available to new markets outside the country due to globalization. In addition, countries with positive relations between them are able to increasingly unify their economies through increased investment and trade.  Maintaining Competitiveness Globalization has had the effect of increased competition. Companies are broadening their target area, expanding from local areas and home countries to the rest of the world. Suddenly, some companies are fighting strong competition from outside their home country. This forced them to source materials and outsource labor from other countries. This story of ‘sourcing and outsourcing’ turned many companies into global ones, actively seeking for production locations and partners for new ventures. Globalization has facilitated this and made the transition to global markets easier.  Technology and Efficiency More advanced systems are needed to facilitate global trade. Globalization pushed us to create better systems to track international trade. ERP systems are one of the solutions provided to support global trade.  Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is a process by which a company (often a manufacturer) manages and integrates the important parts of its business. An ERP management information system integrates areas such as planning, purchasing, inventory, sales, marketing, finance and human resources.  This technological innovation in global trade has enabled a more efficient environment. Technology empowers efficiency in global trade and reduces cost and time. In addition, production processes became more efficient due to globalization as companies want to maintain their competitive advantage.  However, we still find a gap between globalization and blockchain. Blockchain could help companies become even more ‘global’. It helps companies to save time and money, storing data tamper-proof and improving communication.  Companies could use smart contracts in which they can define their business rules. These smart contracts can be used when trading with other companies, creating an environment of trust. ModulTrade provides such a platform where companies can trade safely using smart contracts acting as an escrow, including all business criteria.

And yet, after years of tireless effort and billions of dollars invested, nobody has actually come up with a use for the blockchain — besides currency speculation and illegal transactions. Whilst we have to admit that blockchain is still in its infancy. Many issues like unwanted centralization, slow transaction verification times and low throughput aren’t easy to solve. We have to try and find a happy medium between security and speed. Many use cases of supply chain management using blockchain have been proposed, built and tested. But, did they think twice about this decision, or are they just driven by the hype? Let’s create a simple SWOT analysis to get a better image of blockchain in global trade finance.  Strengths Operational Efficiency Facilitates easier sharing of information about certain products or trades. No more documents that have to passed along. We can now register everything on the blockchain. Secure encryption and tamper-proof data storage. Eliminates central authority who has full access to the data.  Opportunities Provides a platform for Big Data and analytic research. Gives back control to the user e.g. instead of Google and Facebook using your data, you can control who gets access to your data. All these permissions will be stored on the blockchain. The world is becoming more digital, so more people will accept the concept of blockchain in their daily lives.  Threats Scalability issues: too many transactions (overload), although several solutions are present. Unwanted centralization: mining pools and large mining farms. Quantum computers (in the future) who have the ability to decrypt data. Hype and fast changing environment. There is always the possibility of mining attacks, and hacks.  Weaknesses Business rules change frequently, blockchain doesn’t. Blockchain is mostly not modular. An old encryption module cannot easily be replaced. What if business rules change and we want to export data to a new blockchain with the correct data models? A blockchain doesn’t provide an immediate out-of-the-box exit strategy. Potentially in conflict with existing approaches to regulatory compliance, for example GDPR regulations. Concept isn’t easy to grasp for a newcomer. We need good education to make mass adoption possible.  Conclusion ModulTrade aims at bridging the gap between trade finance and blockchain by offering an easy to use platform for global trade. The platform makes use of blockchain technology to enforce trust, traceability and transparency. ModulTrade has the power to disrupt global trade finance because it can help you to cut bureaucracy costs and make the trade process more efficient.

As a result, It’s been a very rewarding and fruitful journey, with tremendous achievement in the launching of the MTP strategy in one of the most important market’s in global trade – China.  During the roadshow, several mutually beneficial and productive meetings took place with a targeted group of potential business partners, such as suppliers, bankers, investment companies, private investors, logistics participators and associations, governmental resources partners, crypto exchange platforms, media experts and KOL.    Following said discussions, we are pleased to share some of our key highlights and developments, below. These are all instrumental to the development and expansion of the MTP, to the benefit of both users and partners and we are looking forward to taking these further down the line. Miners Suppliers  We met with iconic mining factories such as BW, Panda miners, Yibite, and Avalon, based in two of the most prestigious regions of Shenzhen and Hangzhou. These companies are onboard and have signed agreements with concrete plans to put their products on the MTP. This strategic move of bringing key miners into the global trade flow through the MTP has been agreed in line with the timeline to make it happen.    2. Investment companies, groups and individual investors We’ve met with local investment companies, groups and individual investors, who expressed interest in exploring the possibility of investing into the platform with serious plans for evaluation and follow-up. This feedback maintains the very positive feedback on the pioneering endeavors of applying Blockchain technology to B2B global trade.  Special credit and thanks goes to Sail group, Ucaninv investment company, YK investment group, along with the individual investors who we had the pleasure of meeting.    3. Chinese Crypto platform To be more user-friendly in China, the MTP spoke with some of the most prestigious and fast growing crypto platforms, such as ZB, EXX, and 8BTC. A few cooperative frameworks have been agreed to go with an action plan to get STQ into the list, to allow easy and secure access for the millions of potential Chinese investors.    4. Association and governmental resources partners We’ve had rewarding meetings and visits with local associations and partners who have governmental resources and backing: such as, Guangdong logistics associations, the governmental-authorised association to cluster the logistics-related ecosystem, with wide variety of suppliers, logistics services providers, and government involvement.  One notable example is P.G logistics, one of the top integrated SCM solution providers in China, with 80 rep offices throughout China. Cooperation from such B2B business will be carried out within an agreed portfolio and timeline.    5. Media experts and KOL Media and industry KOL has always been a critical part for entry into the Chinese market, and our roadshow returned some solid responses from Media experts and KOL. We have been in discussion with some of the most credible finance and high tech media outlets,s such as DailyFX, Tecent Finance Guangdong, ifinance channel of Ifeng, and feedback has been very positive with talk of excitement and anticipation on the bright future of MTP. Some specific cooperative plans from a local media and marketing perspective have been reached, with more to follow.    Why China and its four key economic hubs?  To give you an insight into why ModulTrade has selected China to expand its MTP, see below details on each of the four regions visited during the roadshow, with their individual appeal and benefits.  Shenzhen — The center of high technology and information technology manufacturing center, one of the most famous production zone for miners globally and with favorable industry force for Blockchain technology;  Guangzhou — the south gate of China, and the center of one of the most dynamic economic center Pearl River Delta, also gains its huge fame of the international trading center for the century trading platform — CANTON FAIR  Hangzhou — A city with great importance and significance for the Ecommerce industry, where the head quarter of Alibaba, locates, and very dynamic ecosystem of online business, along with the startup entrepreneurs and business endeavors for new and high technology, such as crypto investment, Blockchain technology.

Whilst we have to admit that blockchain is still in its infancy. Many issues like unwanted centralization, slow transaction verification times and low throughput aren’t easy to solve. We have to try and find a happy medium between security and speed.  Many use cases of supply chain management using blockchain have been proposed, built and tested.

Global trade does have a problem, with a global trade finance gap of about $1.6 trillion globally (source) and 56% of SME trade finance proposals are rejected. The root of the problem lies in the lack of trust between counterparties who don’t know each other and the typical solution is the letter of credit (LoC), that is outrageously costly (up to 4–15%). It harms businesses and consumers alike. Those involved in international trade — whether manufacturers, trading houses, transportation companies or banks — are seeking ways to ease the situation and cut time and costs. The process — from issuing to approval of the letter of credit, which usually takes between seven and 10 days — could be reduced to less than four hours when using blockchain. A common trade finance offering provided by banks, and increasingly by alternative financial services providers, is known as factoring, and involves a bank paying the seller of goods before the buyer of those goods makes the payment. Naturally, banks charge rates — typically 4 percent to as high as 8 percent — to the supplier for this service, but assume the risk that the buyer delays payment or even defaults. Despite that protection, factoring is a costly undertaking for suppliers, eating significantly into margins and introducing an element of insecurity to the payment picture. And setting risk aside, processing costs related to manual work, document collection and coordination of remittances are high. Blockchain has the power to reduce risk, costs and time for both parties, without the need of a bank cutting your profit margins. Modultrade, our initiative, tries to reduce risk by enforcing trust on the platform we are developing. We aim for helping MSMEs to meet, commit and execute trade globally easily, in a trustful and efficiently manner. The use of smart contracts acting as an escrow service is our main focus because they have the power to reduce risk and costs for both parties. The simplified workflow of the smart contract is as follows. 1) The Buyer deposits funds into the smart contract which acts as an escrow agent. 2) Funds are locked in the smart contract until release conditions are met to impose trust. 3) Funds are released to the Seller upon successful delivery in a specified time horizon. 4) Funds are released to the Buyer if no delivery occurs in a specified time horizon.    A fee is still required when using the escrow service, however this will be a much lower fee than traditional fees charged by banks to deliver this service. ModulTrade just requires a 1% fee, which will be paid with the internal currency MTRc (ModulTrade token), issued by ModulTrade. The MTRc token will act as an efficient instrument of value exchange in the ModulTrade ecosystem.  Begin to restore trust in Global Trade!

ModulTrade aims to remove the barriers of entry into global asset trading, opening the doors for small and medium enterprises. The approach of ModulTrade has four key components: blockchain-based smart contracts, an already functioning trading platform, an up and growing reputation network and marketplaces for various assets.  ModulTrade is here to remove the barriers and lower the fees levied by investment intermediaries and banks, and produce a more democratic system of global trading for any-size companies.  ""The way we are building the ModulTrade platform means that any user, from anywhere in the world, at any time, will be able to monitor and review their own trade cycle. There are 400mln MSMEs worldwide, and 56% of these have their finance proposals rejected compared to only 7% of larger companies. This is a massive discrepancy, and ModulTrade’s Value Eco-system (MVE) aims to narrow this gap considerably,"" noted the project's founder and CEO, Evgeny Kaplin. In addition to running a successful trading platform, the ModulTrade ICO is already gaining speed. More than 5.7 million MTRc coins have been sold in a pre-sale, with a nominal value of 8,196 Ethereum. The ICO is ongoing, with funds accepted in Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as fiat for larger investors backing the sale with more than $10,000.  The reputation of ModulTrade precedes its ICO, with high grades and accolades from reviewing companies. ICO Bench has given the project a 4.4 high rating, while ICORating has given a ""Low"" risk rating. CIO Review has lined up ModulTrade as a Top 20 Blockchain Startup in 2017.  ModulTrade will emulate letters of credit and bank guarantees through Ethereum-based smart contracts, thus achieving a real-life application of the power of the blockchain.  The ModulTrade token sale event is in Phase 3 right now, offering a 10% discount off the token price at 700 MTRc for 1 ETH. Phase 3 continues until January 8.    source: https://cryptovest.com/news/modultrade-opens-the-world-of-trading-to-small-business/",True

The MTP is built on blockchain technology to provide a secure platform, with smart-contracts in place to replicate traditional trade instruments such as letters of credit and bank guarantees. Transaction fees at MTP are as low as 1% (compared to bank charges of anything between 5-15%), crucially saving businesses money. ModulTrade officially launched the fully-functional version of MTP on 21 November, 2017.  Recently, the MTP executed the first successful blockchain based trade from China, with goods successfully delivered to Russia. The whole process was seamless, with the sellers’ confidence in successful receipt of payment secured in the knowledge of the smart-contracts locking in funds right up until the product was delivered to the buyer. This is a huge milestone in not only the development of the MTP, but for the wider global trade and fintech industries. Explore the possibilities of digital global trade on our MTP.  In conjunction with the MTP launch, ModulTrade have created their own crypto currency, the MTRc architected on the standard ERC-20. The MTRc can be used for payment of products and services within the platform, as well as other compatible currencies such as ETH. The MTRc will also be used for charging trading and usage fees for third parties’ service and solutions. If you’re a business in need of funds, the MTRc token can be borrowed, following reputational checks.  ModulTrade are in full swing with their token main sale, offering participants the opportunity to be a part of a revolutionary change in global trade. Current special bonus is 15% until 26th December, 2017.  Discover more here: https://en.modultrade.io/",True

Present industry overview shows the massive shift in the world of trading. Trading companies are getting bigger and medium sized companies are disappearing due to lack of access to trade finance instruments. 2. 10 years ago, we didn’t have the technology to build out such a solution like ModulTrade. Now, we do and more and more companies, like Uber for example, are creating new platforms which cut out the middleman to create an easy and streamlined user experience. 3. ModulTrade has a large scope for the future while the system is ideally suited for MSMEs as it facilitates the access and the contact between buyer and the seller. The Blockchain technology solution is great as it solves the issue of trust by guaranteeing payment of goods through smart-contracts. 4. In the short run the ModulTrade Platform will be immediately demanded by ready manufactured goods traders rather than commodity. 5. The platform will give access to smaller players to participate in global trade, with traditional trading houses having to ‘share their piece of the trade pie’.

The digital marketplace allows micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) from anywhere in the world. Thus, to trade with freedom, on a secure and trusted network. The application of smart-contracts replicates traditional trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and bank guarantees. Since adding a layer of security and instilles trust as funds are locked in right up until goods are delivered.  In conjunction with the development of the ModulTrade Platform (MTP), the team created a new crypto currency, the MTRc – an ERC-20 based token. The MTRc can be in use for payment of products and services within the platform. As well as other currencies such as ETH compatible to be in use on the MTP. The MTRc will also be in use for charging trading and usage fees for third parties’ service and solutions. If you’re a business in need of funds, the MTRc token can be borrow, following reputational checks.  With an estimate 400mln MSMEs worldwide, and 56% of such companies trade proposals rejected by traditional institutions. The MTP provides a much needed solution to companies who want to complete a full trade successfully. However,  in a trusted environment, grow their enterprises and play in the same field as larger counterparts.  As well as providing a new-found opportunity, the value of the MTRc is to increase. The growth is usually relies on the growth in number of users and the potential number of users. Since as we have outlined stands at a huge 400mln MSMEs. Of course, there needs to be a minimum level of adoption, but with the ModulTrade’s core team making every effort to on-board users, and the outstanding benefits of the MTP, it is set to be a success, and in turn the MTRc has great potential in increasing in value over the coming years.  Overall, thanks to the creation of the MTRc every business with access to a smartphone or desktop will be able to operate global trade (trade enabler), every service provider will be able to offer their services on MTP (service enabler) and every software developer will be able to build their applications on the top of MTP (3rd party application enabler).  In the future, the introduction of MTRc into the digital currency world will make it easier to trade, minimise costs and increase efficiencies. Further fintech solutions will benefit from this new token, as well as from the technology built to power the MTP. Developers will benefit from leveraging on the existing infrastructure, rather than spend time and money to develop their own eco-system.  Together, the MTP and MTRc, solve the current global trade problems such as lack of trust and rejected trade proposals, by offering real-time global trade on a digital network, a safe and secure platform and all at a much lower cost to the user.

In light of the “One Belt One Road” initiative of Chinese People’s Republic that is expected to bridge the ‘infrastructure gap’ to accelerate economic growth across the Asia Pacific area and Central and Eastern Europe, it’s extremely important to develop the regions into a cohesive economic area through building infrastructure, increasing cultural exchanges, and broadening trade routes. Anticipated cumulative investment over an indefinite time scale is estimated at US$4 trillion or US$8 trillion.  As far as economic ties and trade expansion go, the lion share is devoted to small and medium enterprises who are undeniably the backbone of the economic growth in the world.  In support of bridging said infrastructure gap, ModulTrade have found themselves in a unique position by providing a means of developing the economic growth in China, as the company has a great focus supporting the abundant Chinese small and medium enterprises who are seeking global opportunities to expand and explore the untapped potential of cross-border trade.  But how is this pioneering company doing this? ModulTrade has created a new digital trade hub, the ModulTrade Platform (MTP), built on blockchain technology and applying smart-contracts to replicate the traditional trade processes such as letters of credit and bank guarantees, but at a much lesser cost to the user and with increased trust between the buyer and seller.  The MTP serves users with easy to use tools to successfully complete a trade cycle between countries. In addition to the existing functionalities, ModulTrade has taken steps to further make the MTP catered to small and medium enterprises specifically in China, by developing the webpage and product interface in the Chinese language and integrating China Post and S.F. Express as a 3rd party service provider for delivery of the goods.  With its global ambition, ModulTrade has impacted the entire eCommerce industry as it has supported the first batch of goods sold from China on the blockchain via the MTP in early December, with payment made entirely in cryptocurrency (ETH). As stipulated in the smart-contract by the transaction counterparties, the goods were prepared for dispatch and securely shipped cross-border by local delivery company China Post, and delivered to the buyer by Russian post in Moscow, Russia. The carrier carefully inspected and packed the goods for the shipment. The buyer received the parcel at their doorstep in a weeks’ time and was absolutely satisfied with the quality of the goods, the delivery service and the ease of executing the trade on the MTP. Right after the parcel receipt, the correspondent amount in ETH automatically transferred via the smart-contract and hit the wallet of Chinese seller immediately. As a result of executing trade on the MTP, both parties saved considerable time and a significant amount of money.  As one of the core ambitions of ModulTrade is to allow micro, small and medium enterprises to trade with ease from anywhere in the world, coupled with the success of the first trade from China on the blockchain, we can proudly declare that our platform connects the continents and addresses the needs for global trade participation. And we’re more than happy to welcome all businesses and enterprises to join us in this revolutionary journey of changing the Trade Finance industry for the better.  Here’s how the China trade with Russia worked step by step, with the successful purchase and delivery of a 3D printer delivery:  1. The seller has a 3D printer to sell:    2. The seller publishes their proposal on the ModulTrade Marketplace — MTP https://product.modultrade.com:    3. The Buyer selects the product and orders the printer.  4. The Buyer and Seller set a smart-contract where funds are deposited via the smart-contract.  5. Seller ships the goods once sees the funds locked by the smart-contract (a courier picks up the goods):    6. The seller changes the status:    7. Smart-contract is tracking goods delivery with help of carrier’s API.  8. The Buyer receives and checks the parcel, and updates the status for the Smart Contract:    9. Upon the goods are delivered Smart-contract releases funds to the Buyer:     Find out more about ModulTrade and our Token Sale at https://en.modultrade.io/  Join us on telegram: https://t.me/ModulTradeIO  Follow us on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/modultrade/ and Twitter https://twitter.com/ModulTrade for latest news and developments.",True

ModulTrade https://en.modultrade.io recently launched its ModulTrade Platform https://product.modultrade.com (MTP), a new digital marketplace where micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) can meet, commit and execute trade with freedom. In conjunction, ModulTrade created its own digital token, the MTRc (based on the standard Ethereum) to allow transactions to be made within the eco-system securely and with ease. As we look ahead to the future of the business, we predict and explain how MTRc token owners will be able to increase their assets and why the value of the token might grow. There are three key factors which must work in harmony for a successful asset growth, including:  Network value growth. Number of potential users. Rate of adoption.  Firstly, when we set out our business plan, we thoroughly researched the audience and the market, which in turn calculated a forecast of a significant increase in the value of MTRc, mainly due to the growth of the underlying ModulTrade network made up of MSMEs, third-party service providers and third-party developers. In any case, the network value growth is usually much higher than the growth in the number of its users (Metcalfe’s Law https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law states that a network’s value is proportional to the square of the number of users). Explained in figures, a 2x growth in users could lead to a 4x growth in network value, a 10x to 100x, a 50x to a 2,500x, and so on. Secondly, the next question is how fast can the network grow? The growth in the number of users depends on the potential number of users, then on the adoption rate. In this instance, the potential number of users is huge, with ≈400Mln MSMEs worldwide, plus all the third-party service providers / developers. To give you an idea, this is at least 27x the number of the current Bitcoin Blockchain wallet users (≈15Mln) And thirdly, the adoption rate depends on the following: How useful the ModulTrade Platform is to the potential user (it solves an existing problem by providing MSMEs the chance to trade, while boosting enterprises’ revenues); How long ModulTrade takes to develop the product/platform (ModulTrade have already developed a beta version of the product); How good a business is in acquiring new users (the ModulTrade team are multicultural and multidisciplinary with global reach, and the MTRc token sale is evident of a strong marketing programme). In summary, the approach, potential users and the ModulTrade teams’ efforts to grow a user base, all align towards MTRc having great potential in an increase in value over the coming years, and it is evident that the underlying network does indeed have the potential for a huge and fast growth. ModulTrade is in phase 1 of its main sale, offering a 25% discount until 12 December.

It's been emotional since the beginning of this week in this thread!   I would like to thank you all for the support and for challenging the platform either!  As a little recap till date and some hints of the forthcoming events.  1. The platform is doing awesome. It's up and running. We have a good track-record of executed transactions! More interestingly, the trend of new user connections showing North-East.  2.  The ICO sale is great. As we've almost reached the softcap by now.  3. The level of user adoption is in line with our projections. In general, the adoption level is not very high in disruptive technologies by the time of launch. Moreover, as it's rightly pointed out, ModulTrade is among the lower share of ICOs who managed to deliver the operational MVP during the ICO. And probably that makes the industry adopters puzzled.  Of course, we're working a lot to enhance the user experience and make it absolutely handy and native.  So all in all, we're doing well and absolutely happy to deal with the things we're running right now!  Going forward, we're planning to participate in must-be events and will be announcing some great collabs very soon!  So keep watching the news and stay tuned!",True

Edging ever closer to successfully reaching the soft cap, we are receiving new contributions daily from around the world, with participants benefiting from a 25% discount — this ends on 12 December, so take part now and don’t miss out on this opportunity. ModulTrade are on a mission to democratize global trade through the creation of a new digital marketplace, where micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) can trade with ease and freedom. The team have identified and addressed the needs of MSMEs by building a solution that eliminates the traditional barriers for entry in global trade, such as lack of trust, high entry costs and the complexity of trade-related operations.

As you probably know, ModulTrade participated in BlockShow Asia conference in Singapore.  Here find the news updated from the conference.  Earlier this week, ModulTrade CEO and Co-founder, Evgeny Kaplin, took to the stage at the BlockShow Asia conference in Singapore to proudly present the new and fully functioning ModulTrade Platform — a digital marketplace for MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises) to trade with ease and freedom. To a packed audience of interested investors, start-ups and developers, Evgeny explained in detail the journey from conception and development, through to the recent launch of the platform by the ModulTrade tech team. The launch of the ModulTrade Platform now means that any MSME from anywhere in the world can confidently trade between markets, trustfully. The announcement was well received, with glowing praise on the adoption of blockchain technology and smart-contracts to minimise costs and increase efficiencies through replicating traditional bank processes, but at a much lower fee and with the bonus of user security and trust. More so, that the team at ModulTrade are shaking up the financial trade industry, opening trade routes wide for MSMEs and have created a new piece of technology that will influence the future of fintech.

I start thinking the MTRc can grow a lot in the next years, ‘cause the network has a huge potential: • The token value depends on network growth; basically, the MTRc is like a token to access the underlying network (made up of enterprises, third-party service providers and third-party developers). The greater the network value, the greater the MTRc value • Network value growth is much higher than the growth in the number of its users (proportional to the square of the number of users; in figures, a 2x growth in users could lead to a 4x growth in network value, a 10x to 100x, a 50x to a 2,500x and so on) • Growth in the number of users depends on its potential and on the adoption rate, and they both look big • The potential number of users is huge (≈400Mln enterprises plus all the third party service providers / developers vs ≈15Mln Bitcoin wallet users, for example) • The adoption rate can be big as it depends on the incentive to use the platform, on how long it takes to develop it and on how good they will in acquiring new users  Enterprises are incentivized to use the platform ‘cause it solves a real problem and it can really boost their revenues. The product is already available in beta so platform development is not supposed to take long. The team is very good: multicultural, multidisciplinary and they’re showing great marketing skills in the MTRc campaign so far.",True

Struggle no more, as ModulTrade has now officially LAUNCHED its global digital trade platform (MTP).  Please visit https://product.modultrade.com/ and start to trade around the world, trustfully and at minimal costs.  From today, every business operator, no matter their company size, location or service, can meet, commit and execute trade on our fully functioning blockchain based platform. Through very simple steps, whether you’re a buyer, seller, or both, you can easily register and update your profile, add a shipping and pick-up address, and use ETH wallet with a ModulTrade account to make your secure and trusted transactions. Our application of smart-contracts means funds are locked right up until products are received, so you don’t have to worry about paying for goods before you see them. We integrated DHL (other logistic companies will be added soon) so you can track the progress of your delivery in real-time, on the MTP.  If you want to sell a product, all you need to do is follow these simple steps to trade with freedom: 1. Create your proposal to sell your product 2. Select your method and terms of payment 3. Select your delivery terms and logistics company 4. Publish your proposal — a link will be created which you can share on other channels. Upload high-res images to best market your product. 5. Receive confirmation from MTP when the buyer has sent funds to a smart-contract 6. Ship your product and send tracking number to smart-contract — use our integrated DHL service to track progress in real time 7. Receive payment — as soon as the product is delivered, funds will be automatically released to your wallet  And, if you’re a trusted buyer… 1.Select a proposal you want to buy 2. Confirm your details to ignite the smart-contract 3. Confirm the trade by sending money to the address of the smart-contract (seller will ship your product once they are notified that funds are on the smart-contract) 4. Track the delivery of your product in real-time 5. Receive your goods 6. The payable amount is automatically transferred to the seller.  To allow entrepreneurs to test the ModulTrade Platform, some MTRc has been released for free float in the system. Users may buy and sell MTRc at a nominal price of 1ETH = 700MTRc at the exchange, Etherdelta.com. And you can buy MTRc with 30% discount at ModulTrade Token Distribution at https://en.modultrade.io/  Soon, the ModulTrade platform will buy MTRc at a nominal rate for fiat from merchants. Currently, both sellers and buyers may choose between MTRc or ETH payment token, with plans to soon accept other ERC20 tokens, along with fiat (USD, EU, £ etc.).  A unique one-stop digital hub, the ModulTrade platform will change the way you trade, open networks across the globe, and provide a platform which will ultimately save you time and money.

I've familiarized with various trading platforms like yours (for example Storiqa) and unfortunately they have a common problem with accepting payments in ETH. Would you introduce other possibilities apart from ETH? Of course it's hard to say which cryptocurrency is stable right now, perhaps USDT? Actually it's kinda odd situation when ETH's rate keeps fluctuating and the product's price cannot be guaranteed! Thus, microenterprises and customers would face with exchange rate risk by concluding long-term contracts.  You shed the light on the problem of using banks as middlemen in running business. However, the problem is more complex while famous retail groups charge an extremely high markups and annual rebates. I’m not even talking about fines and mutual claims to each other. Even if deduct banks and retail groups from this vicious circle we face with the expediency in expanding the number of third-party logistics companies that are capable of managing heavy&large item deliveries! This information could be used in your presentation.  Nevertheless, I see that the project looks promising. Hope that with the help of crypto community and concerned people you would be able to find effective solutions answering these calls by using the blockchain technology!  All the best, felix007kr",True

Crossborder trade is all about currency exchange rate fluctuation if the parties deal with different currencies irrespective of fiat or crypto. In the world of fiat, the Indian counterparty that buys from the Polish manufacturer has to take care of the INR vs. Euro or Zloty currency risk while committing the contract. Likewise, the Polish has to offset the exchange risk when the account is credited with export proceeds. So both parties either put currency exchange clause into the contract to minimize the above-mentioned risk or apply for trade-related service - the hedge. Moving forward, trade-related services are very much considered and shall be gradually enabled.  Thank you for emphasizing on this topic!",True

Actually, the return of the item isn't an independent transaction but a part of the product sale cycle. Hence, if the item is returned due to a particular reason: non-satisfactory condition or not in line with the contract specification, it's handled under the same smart-contract. And it's going to be treated by smart-contract as non-delivery. Finally, the smart-contract will end up as canceled without any crypto transfer to the seller. Thus, the smart-contract helps to avoid any mess and secure the purchase for both parties (the seller and the buyer).  Thank you for being with us and keep watching!",True

Scrolling through the pages, I found one interesting question and decided to spend some time on it. - So how can the buyer benefit from dealing with MT platform apart from regular sales and purchase transactions?  And here're the advantages that I wanted to zoom on to make it handy.  Definitely, the buyer shall benefit from lower expenses with MT while compared to the bank's charges that might be as much as 15% of transaction volume in different cases. And here I even take the time spent out the equation. The buyer may also choose among a wide range of merchants offers. And the transportation charges can be minimized on the top of it while MT provides the option. Not least, MT platform will provide a selection of various trade-related consultancy services, such as taxation, customs, market research, inspection.  Hence, MT will create a user-friendly ecosystem combined with cutting-edge blockchain technology!  So let's wish the best of luck to the hardworking project team and everyone who is participating the pre-ICO and will join the ICO sale at the later stage!  Stay tuned!",True

Contrary to traditional markets it seems to happens that crypto investors only look at the total amount of tokens and do not look at the distinction between public tokens and reserved tokens to determine the price of the token. The result could be that the price drops 60% without even considering the bonuses. Not sure how to prevent that.",True

Irrespective of payment terms, naturally, the risks of loss, damage and theft may occur and covered by adequate insurance which is usually arranged by the seller. Hence any trade proposes insurance where goods delivery is involved. MT will connect 3rd party service providers such as logistics, insurance, inspection etc. to enhance customer experience and insure the value proposition. The cases of wrongdoing or non-delivery will trigger a smart-contract and the payment as well. No goods - no money!  No doubt, MTP will conduct verification of trading parties in order to ensure the greatest customer experience and minimise counterparty risk. As far as the buying party is concerned, the smart-contract allows to trigger the payment and release without the seller's authorisation once it's signed. Hope that clarifies.  Stay tuned!",True

Regarding escrow - the smart contract itself will hold the funds in escrow for the duration of a trade thus simultaneously being an escrow agent and a guarantor of trust. However, since some of the counterparties will prefer using e.g. fiat currencies in their transactions anyway, MTRc will play a role of an intermediary denomination token for trade, while there will be a usability option to automatically exchange MTRc to the currency of choice (including fiats).

Thank you for your comments and support as well as for challenging us)  Let me share some thoughts on MTRc value (ModulTrade token) https://modultrade.io/  1.Every trade executed by SMEs on ModulTrade platform requires MTRc - to pay commission in all cases (for Smart-contracts or additional services) - to pay for goods in case the trade contract is set in MTRc  2. Most SMEs require money to start buying (more info here https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/financialsector/brief/smes-finance) - To help SMEs ModulTrade and MTRc holders will provide MTRc to SMEs based on their Reputational Capital - ModulTrade introduces Trade&Reputational Network -  for every user Limit in MTRc and related fee will be calculated (Reputational Capital) and will be changed based on user trade behaviour.  3. Merchants are waiting for SMEs to start buying - ModulTrade will agree with Merchants to accept MTRc for the goods (we are planning a pilot with our German partner https://www.contorion.de/) - and ModulTrade will buy back MTRc from Merchants they got from SMEs (for fiat or cryptocurrency) - and ModulTrade will provide MTRc to SMEs - see point 2 above.  While there is a limited number of MTRc distributed (~$5-15mln equivalent), Every next $10mln trades served on ModulTrade will require equivalent of $2-3mln in MTRc (or up to $5-7mln in case of wide MTRc acceptance) simple mathematics will give >50% value increase for every new $10mln trades ( or 2-3 in case of wide MTRc acceptance)  We expect >$50 mln to be served by end of 2019 . and you may calculate the value of MTRc in this case ($50/$10*(0.5 or 3)) = 2.5-15 times . It is not a promise but what we expect  will be happy to answer your questions",True

Wonderful question. We do not want to restrict our users to a limited set of payment options. The payment methods that you saw in the prototype (ETH, MTRc, Paypal, Credit Card) are there to demonstrate that we would like to support as many types of methods as possible to make it convenient for our users. It is true, that paypal is costly, but it can be a method of choice for certain users (for example in those jurisdictions where cryptocurrency is banned). BTC is also an option and we plan to include it too.  This is also why we introduce MTRc. On one hand, we need a convenient proxy token to use in our processes and transactions; on another hand, it should be independent enough to appreciate in value in direct relation to the growth of the ecosystem. Basically, the bigger the ecosystem is (buyers, sellers, partners, 3rd party service providers, etc.), the more valuable MTRc becomes. Of course, to transact directly in MTRc will be cheapest.",True

I would like to dwell a little on the practical application of blockchain in cross-border trade. Why are we going to use blockchain? May it help? All these are purely life case issues.  So let's take a zoom on some problems experienced by various actors and the ways to address them.  Blockchain can be useful in situations where participants would like to reduce their dependence on an intermediary service provider (e.g., banks, central securities clearing house) and have their trust in counterparty they deal with. Problems arising from the abuse of trust, such as fraud, have significant negative impact on business and trade: the global financial cost of fraud is estimated to have been more than $4 trillion in 2016. (Gee, J. & Button, M. (2017). The Financial Cost of Fraud 2017. Available at: https://www. croweclarkwhitehill.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/crowe-the-financial-cost-of- fraud-2017.pdf)  Blockchains hold the promise of reducing the trust gap by making actions within the system independently verifiable by each participant and accountable through the public auditing.  Blockchain helps to build secure value transfer system which is very much needed while dealing at international level. Based on consensus mechanism the payment turned to be a completely decentralized activity which is triggered through smart-contract execution. Hence the seller account is credited once the conditions are fulfilled accordingly and couldn't be intervened from outside.  I believe the above plays out to be handy and definitely considered by ModulTrade.",True

I think that currently the root of the problem lies in the lack of trust between counterparties who don’t know each other. The typical solution is a letter of credit or other bank guarantees, that is costly and that involves a daunting process. Typically: - After negotiation, buyer and seller sign a contract. - Buyer's bank supplies a credit letter to seller's bank, which guarantees seller will be paid whether certain conditions are met. - Seller gives goods to a carrier and receives a bill of lading. - Seller provides the bill of lading to its bank and receives the payment. - Bank gives buyer the bill of lading, so that he can present it to carrier and receive goods.  My understanding is that the blockchain can really help here as smart contracts could be used to replace this time-consuming workflow process. And at a lower cost. How much could the process be sped up with a blockchain platform solution? And how much could a business save on average?",True

Thank you for your question. Let me picture some example. For instance, let’s take trade data, which serve as the backbone for the trade finance workflow: the approval and matching of data found in trade documents such as invoices can be a trigger for events that follow, such as the transfer of ownership or execution of a payment. By facilitating easy access to data and end-to-end transparency of the entire value chain, crypto technologies can facilitate an improved exchange of trade information. The real-time visibility of events along a supply chain means that financing triggers can be identified sooner, which means that funds can be released faster. Also credit ratings and risk assessment procedures could benefit from a better availability and auditability of trade data. Abstracting from trade data, with a blockchain based trading platform in place and a cryptocurrency properly designed for the purpose, it would be possible to build a value ecosystem, with features to support applications that third parties could build and that are yet unimagined: Ethereum ecosystem docet. Some of the most imaginable use cases which could stem from a value ecosystem for trade finance include, for instance, supply chain digital tracking, a blockchain-based Digital Thread for Additive Manufacturing (DTAM) underpinning all the transactions occurring throughout the digital and physical life cycle for additive manufacturing and trade finance solutions based on IoT-generated data.",True

The platform, if successful, aims to change the way we trade around the world. It would allow small businesses to compete with larger businesses on a global scale. ModulTrade is being developed by a London-based company. The token pre-sale started on October 3, with a general crowdsale taking place throughout October and November.  that say bacause today many small businesses avoid international trade because of the logistical costs. It’s not always feasible for small businesses to enter into partnerships with businesses around the world. Many small businesses don’t even know where to begin – so even if a market exists, that market may be under-utilized.  With that said ModulTrade plans to use two key blockchain technologies to create its “ModulTrade Value Ecosystem” (MVE):  With a smart contract platform that replicates traditional trade finance instruments (like letters of credit and bank guarantees) while allowing businesses to establish trust with trade agreements.  The MTRc, an Ethereum ERC20-based token, which will enable frictionless trade with a borderless currency; that token will be accessible to any business with a smartphone, allowing small businesses to execute trade in real-time, globally, and in a cost-effective way ModulTrade aims to combine the development of a value ecosystem with a new crypto token, helping the platform become “one of the few pioneers able to improve the trade finance industry by connecting millions of enterprises” in an efficient, trustful, and easy way.

The major differentiator for Modultrade is we are in a very niche space where huge domain expertise needed to build an excellent system that works for everyone. Only big banks have the domain knowledge but they lack the technical expertise and the openness to come up with a solution like this. So we have very little competition in this space and continue to do so at least in the near future. We also have a first mover advantage in this space which could also help us shape the future in democratizing global trade for small businesses.  As an early investor, you can earn on the good discount ModulTrade offers at Pre-sale (40%) if you buy MTRc now.  You can also use MTRc to finance B2B trade of ModulTrade users once the platform is launched. It will give 5-30% flat on your investment    Also which exchange you gone add you token to because i can see i have already in some of token sale affiliate got  token but problem is they added to exchange is not reputed or good so not getting proper price for that investment . So if you can also provide some light on what exchange you may include or talking with to include after sale complete .  It's too early to talk about naming exchanges, but are having early discussion with a number of exchanges. We are planning to be listed in some good exchanges rest assured. Please let us know what exchanges you would like MTRc listed, we'll do our best to be there.",True

Thanks Pjames for a great question. EBay-Magento is a good comparison as far as our marketplace is concerned but we also offer banking/finances and other trading services like logistics, taxation etc to complete the transaction. We are a complete end-end platform for global trade.    As many of them might not be aware of the complexity of global trade, I thought I'll give a brief introduction to ModulTrade, Trade finance and blockchain so we can have a lively discussion.The entire team is committed to answering / clarifying all your questions and doubts. Please fire away. I also encourage everyone to try out our prototype which is available in modultrade.com  Regards Karthik   Modultrade democratizes Trade Finance  Trade finance is the process, by which importers and exporters mitigate trade risk through the use of financial institutions that serve as trusted intermediaries. These intermediaries provide assurance to sellers (in the event the buyer doesn’t pay) and contract certainty to buyers (in the event that goods are not received).  Payment and delivery terms are documented in a letter of credit (LC), and the financial institutions delivering this LC receive fees for assuming risks, as well as for documentation and oversight of payment terms.  Due to the nature of global deals (distance, differing local laws, withholding taxes, customer knowledge) the use of LC has become a very important aspect of international trade. LCs facilitate 47% of global trade finance (circa  $2.8 trillion per year worldwide).  Yet, letter of credit is a cumbersome process. Banks typically require a pledge of securities or cash as collateral for issuing a letter of credit. Banks also collect high fees for service, typically a percentage (ranging from 5 to 20%)  of the size of the letter of credit. The drastic criteria for a bank to issue a letter of credit, as well as the high cost of it make it difficult for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to be included in this process . Half of SME applications are rejected, (compared to only 7% for multinational companies). “Unmet demand for trade finance is $700 billion in Asia, and $120 billion in Africa.”  ModulTrade is a platform based on blockchain smart-contract (for the automation of the letter of credit) where MSMEs can participate easily to the trade finance processes : Letter of Credit, deal financing, tax management, … etc..   ModulTrade’s Value Ecosystem (MVE) is based on MSP (multi-sided platform) , which aims to create value through the network effect for the following three main constituents:  Trade counterparties (sellers and buyers), delivering to them a platform of trust and reputation, simplicity of trade and an instrument for value exchange and trade initiation (i.e. Modultrade Coin or MTRc) . Modultrade is this global marketplace where trade services meet trade participants.  Third-party trade related service providers (e.g. supply chain providers, lawyers, tax officers, financial institutions and fintechs, ...etc.). These providers meet on modultrade open platform to contribute to the trade service of counterparties.  Third-party trade software developers, delivering trade solutions on top of MTRc functionality.  At Modultrade, we use the three key features of blockchain to simplify trade finance:  (1) cryptographic security, allowing parties involved in trade to collaborate easily and cost efficiently, (2) distributed ledger and network allowing transparency, traceability and global footprint  (3) consensus mechanism providing trust among the deal participants:  Together, these features provide the foundation for building a new generation of a “democratic”, trustful and efficient trade finance system. In this new hassle free system, SMEs, which are the main components of local modern trade, can expand and  take part in global trade.",True

Is there a Problem? the only way for millions of SMEs to survive and compete in the current world is to be involved into Global value chains (you may find more in the WORLD BANK 2016 report  https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/world_trade_report16_e.pdf) So there is a need from over 400mln SMEs to start trade globally.  Before such solutions were simply impossible due to the size of SMEs. Banks simply did not want or were not able to help them. 56% of SMEs trade finance proposals are rejected by banks, compared to only 7% for multinational corporations. https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/financialsector/brief/smes-finance  2. How can Blockchain help?  the thing is that Smart-contract is a natural replication of such banks' instrument like Letter of Credit or Guarantee. in short, before Banks guaranteed that Buyer will pay if Seller will ship the goods and banks charged 5-15%. Now, smart-contract can execute the same function at almost zero costs and there is no middleman (bank). for more detials you may check animation in the product section on our Project site https://modultrade.com/  3. Why ModulTrade? Our team came from the Industry (including Tade Finance and transaction banking) and kind of creating a user interface for smart-contracts on blockchain that SMEs can use. and also integrating related services which SMEs need - to have end-to-end user experience in B2B trade (marketplace to meet, logistics, financing, payments, etc to execute the trade)  We deliver all in one solution to enable SMEs to trade globally and the core is a smart-contract on the blockchain.
