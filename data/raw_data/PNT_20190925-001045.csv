Global Decentralized Platform,"ICO Analysis: Pointium  Published on April 30, 2018 By noahsayres  Token To recap, the point of Pointium is: For consumers:     Manage Your Points Easily     Pointium Wallet allows you to manage and integrate numerous partners’ points at once.     Get Promotions Quickly     Promotion Feed is the quickest way to check out.     The special promotion of interested companies.     Use Points in Various Ways     Users can exchange their points for Pointium tokens (PNT), or use their points in the Pointium Shop For Businesses:     Reaching More Customers     Pointium’s partners can easily sell and market products to Pointium users.     Enhance Rewards Program’s Performance     Reduction of business costs and increased access to liquid capital Pointium Wallet also provides businesses with an easy marketing opportunity through both the Promotion Feed and the Pointium Shop. If utilized intelligently, the businesses could deliver their promotions and sell their products/services to all of the users with a Pointium Wallet. The token distribution is as follows:     ICO: 50%     Team and Experts: 15%     Reserve: 15%     Foundation: 10%     Seeding Businesses: 10% Use of proceeds is as follows:     Core Development: 60%     Operation & Admin: 20 %     Marketing & Sales: 15%     Legal & Accounting : 5%  Team Simply put, the Pointium team is great. Pointium’s CEO has been a project manager at Dell & IBM for the past 13 years. Their COO was a decorated business operations manager at Bank of America who then worked for Amex as a business development head. Their CTO is a veteran software developer who over 10 years of work experience at both IBM and HP. They also have some phenomenal advisers, including the director of marketing and sales at American Airlines and the executive director of the strategic planning team at Huawei.  Verdict I want to love this project. I still like it. But it’s just shy of a slam dunk in my view.  Risks     The decentralized approach of the Pointium team towards onboarding partner businesses seems like a pointless shot in the foot of their own growth.     The blessing and curse of their business model are that it is entirely dependent on a network effect. Therefore, the intelligent thing to do would be to attempt to maximize the number of network participants by any means necessary. -4.5     There are many blockchain solutions to rewards points management attempting similar solutions, which limits the degree to which any of them can truly solve the issue of there being no universal rewards points exchange sans a monopoly. -2.5  Growth Potential     The token economics of the Pointium model is beautiful in its simplicity. The entire concept is to simply make existing rewards points an additional medium of exchange.     If they have a lot of partner businesses sign up, this could be game-changing. The existing connections of the team gives me hope that this could be a realistic future for Pointium. +6     The high token supply makes a pump and dump scheme unlikely. +2.5     A truly great team. +4  Disposition We arrive a final score of 5.5 out of 10 for Pointium. Although everything about the economics of their solution makes perfect sense to me, and the team looks great on paper, Pointium as a whole has not convinced me why their platform will become the overall winner in this space. If you can stomach the uncertainty, this could be an interesting ICO token to hold, although the high token supply means that this would make astronomical gains unlikely regardless  Proof: https://hacked.com/pointium-ico-review/",False

Global Decentralized Platform,"   Thank you for your concerns. However, we'd like to point out your several opinions and explain the advantages of our projects over others. First, this kind of project has been successful or at least well proceeded (although it depends on the definition of ""successful"" in your mind). Please take a look at the similar other projects such as Points Loyalty Wallet and AwardWallet, which are the biggest competitors among lots of similar projects. These companies have already well established their business since 1999 or 2004. Second, in addition to this proven business model, Pointium sought to apply the blockchain technology to our project to benefit from the more enhanced trustworthy, reliability, and transparency of transaction. These are clear advantages we have over the traditional competitors because, as you might already know, these can make the development and maintenance costs the lowest with an equivalent performance. Third, the traditional competitors have only provided the system for tracking miles and points and lacked of the marketing programs, which are the largest concerns for partner businesses. In contrast, Pointium provides the Promotion Feed and Pointium Shop which are the platform for marketing programs and payment at once, incentivizing the users and business to participate in Pointium.  We hope you satisfied our answers. Please kindly take our project into consideration. Thank you!",False

In that regard, Pointium can create the value to the ecosystem by connecting the consumers' and businesses' needs.  Second, compared to the competitors, Pointium has two additional features: Promotion Feed and Pointium Shop. In the Promotion Feed, the businesses' loyalty programs and marketing can be reached to the users of Pointium with our mathematical circulation model. Because this gives a direct marketing program to businesses, it can easily incentivize the businesses' participation, which can be hard for other competitors. In the Pointium Shop, the users can buy the businesses' products or services with their points. By integrating the payment system at once, it also gives the usability and applicability of Pointium to the users and businesses. Finally, as Pointium is based on blockchain platform, we can create and maintain these systems with really lower fees! These are our best advantages that other competitors do not have.

Global Decentralized Platform,"   First, Pointium focuses the needs of customers and businesses. For the customers, Pointium allows them to manage and exchange their numerous points for Pointium Token (PNT). For the businesses, they get an opportunity for reaching more customers and selling their products via Protection Feed and Pointium Shop. In that regard, Pointium can create the value to the ecosystem by connecting the consumers' and businesses' needs.  Second, compared to the competitors, Pointium has two additional features: Promotion Feed and Pointium Shop. In the Promotion Feed, the businesses' loyalty programs and marketing can be reached to the users of Pointium with our mathematical circulation model. Because this gives a direct marketing program to businesses, it can easily incentivize the businesses' participation, which can be hard for other competitors. In the Pointium Shop, the users can buy the businesses' products or services with their points. By integrating the payment system at once, it also gives the usability and applicability of Pointium to the users and businesses. Finally, as Pointium is based on blockchain platform, we can create and maintain these systems with really lower fees! These are our best advantages that other competitors do not have. For detailed information, please also consider reading our whitepaper. Thanks!",False
