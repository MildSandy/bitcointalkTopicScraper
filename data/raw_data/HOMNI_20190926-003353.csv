But what can break any house? Fire, flood, or even wind… In the era of informational technologies as we live in, these destroying factors for the reputation obviously include our online life.  Just think. How many reputations of influential people suffered from their actions on the net? How many couples divorced or broke up because of actions on the net? How many friendships were ruined by the actions on the net? Millions of people use Internet for communication and lose the closest ones because of it. If you didn’t encounter such situation at least once, you’re lucky. But what’s the chance that the next one won’t be you?  Thomas Moore said: “We need people in our lives with whom we can be as open as possible. To have real conversations with people may seem like such a simple, obvious suggestion, but it involves courage and risk.” Passwords, Touch ID and Face ID can never guarantee that your chats will always be hidden from the eyes of other people. But what if you had a space, where you could communicate freely and not be afraid of disclosure? No need in any courage, and no risks? We are not talking just about anonymity, we are talking about complete impossibility of getting the information about your chats and what you actually wrote in them. Isn’t that amazing? This is what we offer to all the world under a short name: Homni. We are creating a sort of the bulletproof vest, which secures everything you send or receive in it. So yes, you can buy iPhoneX, your beloved one will not be able to find out your secrets.  And, of course, good news: Homni is selling tokens for its secure messenger right now! And yes, you can be the one, who can get them right now with an awesome bonus of +35%.
