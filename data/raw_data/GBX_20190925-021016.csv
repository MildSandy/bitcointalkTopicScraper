Thank you for reminding me and the team to take down the old website we have had since 2009. This business is no longer in existence, hence there is no reason to keep the site up. For clarification, MTG Capital has no relation with the other MTG Capital Group or MTG Capital Associates or any other MTG firm. Ours was a proprietary trading and asset management company. Most of the Globitex team were involved in this business, which has shaped our relations as colleagues. Mr P Storm is not part of the team, completely unrelated to Globitex. With regards to your other remarks, please note that the whole team of Globitex has gone through a thorough European regulatory scrutiny. As a licenced group company, our credentials as a team and individually have been thoroughly verified.",True

The chief aim of maker/taker fees is to stimulate trading activity within the exchange.  In simple terms, if you place a limit order to buy at a price lower or  sell at a price higher than the current market rate of an asset, you can expect to pay lower/no fees compared to someone that just places a market order and immediately buys/sells at the current available rates.

The revised date for the public token sale will be announced shortly, so please check back for further updates or join the Telegram channel to hear the news first. Meanwhile GBX tokens will continue to be available via an ongoing pre sale for contributors of EUR 10,000 equivalent or more.  The Globitex exchange is already operating real euro, bitcoin and bitcoin cash exchange platform albeit in limited Beta mode. It is therefore important to ensure that the project has the best possible start. Postponing the public sale of GBX until after the fork will ensure a safe, secure and transparent token sale process for all.  Please keep continuing with your bounties, this ICO will go ahead soon.  Thank you for your continued support,  Token Market ",True

Institutional Bitcoin exchange Globitex, which is currently in limited beta, is holding a token sale to scale up operations with the aim of making Bitcoin a truly global currency. The exchange already offers institutional level FIX API for direct market access for algorithmic traders, paving the way for the virtual currency to become a universal medium of exchange across the full breadth of the international financial and commodity markets.  Bitcoin’s biggest problem: liquidity  Whilst the Bitcoin protocol has been undergoing concrete steps for Bitcoin’s technical scaling, Globitex’s founders recognise the chief issue holding back its wider use is liquidity. Bitcoin is still relatively thinly traded, with low volumes by conventional market standards. Despite being the ideal currency for international settlement across the spectrum of the financial and commodities markets, it cannot serve this purpose without a step-change in market depth and trading volumes.  https://coinidol.com/globitex-launch-token-sale/",True
