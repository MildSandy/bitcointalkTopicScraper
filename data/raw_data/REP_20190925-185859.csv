I am very much interested in prediction markets and saw so much potential in Augur. I've tried out most of the features and in total, I find it very desillusioning. Not only is the user experience rather weak, but also, they seem to make errors which you would not think such a well-funded team would make. The complexity to engage in markets, to observe and keep control over the own orders and positions is frustrating for anyone who is not an expert in trading. And the handling of the oracles will perspectively allow spammers to paralyze the whole system to scale.  I do not understand how a team which had a straightforward mission, which had lots of time and capital to develop come up with such weak results. Is it the complexity of such a product which I am  underestimating?  Maybe, but even if it is so, I am pretty sure that blockchain-based prediction markets will not be working as Augur in the future. I am interested to see what the other competitors will come up with or how new players with new approaches will try to enter the field of prediction markets. Any of them obviously has a second mover advantage.  Happy to hear your opinion on Augur.",False

Created by the Forecast Foundation in 2015, the crowdsourced prediction protocol raised $5.5 million by selling REP tokens long before the term initial coin offering (ICO) had taken hold. Now, after the release of a new version of its white paper, the system that would allow global users to bet on the outcomes of real-world events is getting close to a test launch.  But while Augur will allow people to bet on all sorts of events (from which team will win a specific sports game to whether the Dow Jones will break a certain price), the founders say users will have only one market to make when it goes live.  The Future Foundation's operations lead, Tom Kysar, told CoinDesk:  ""Essentially, we are going to launch Augur with one market, and that market is: 'Will Augur be hacked?' or 'Will there be a critical vulnerability discovered in Augur' by a certain date?'""  If that seems risky, it is. But according to Kysar, it will be well worth it in the end.  In parallel with the bet, the Augur team will run a bug bounty, seeding the market with bets that the system won't be hacked. In this way, a confident hacker could then take the other side of those bets, and go to work trying to find flaws in the protocol to collect a big payday.  ""From what we heard from our auditors, we'll probably be the largest and most complex application to be attempted to be deployed on ethereum,"" he said. ""I think it's very naive to think we could launch 6,500 lines of Solidity code being bug-free.""  In an effort to give outsiders plenty of time to find potential bugs, the team will be running the controlled launch for something like three months.  Augur is going through its second round of smart contract audits right now, and once complete, a live launch could be just months away, the team said.  Security model As for what will be made available at the time, the platform is expected to finally permit real people to serve as ""reporters"" in the markets.  New markets need to designate a trusted reporter to determine how a bet resolves. Odds are, many of these will probably be bots of one kind or another, maintained by trusted developers (not unlike Polyswarm's approach to threat assessment).  Still, as outlined in the white paper, the system has two levels of dispute resolution in case participants disagree with an outcome.  At the most basic level, all Augur users are enlisted in resolving a disputed market. If a market dispute rises to the highest level, Augur forks into new ""universes"" for each outcome, and that's when a crowdsourcing procedure kicks in to determine the correct outcome.  An attacker could try to force an incorrect outcome through an attack, but the Forecast Foundation's models suggest this shouldn't be profitable.  In any case, whenever users participate in deciding how a market resolves, they will need to stake REP tokens to do so. Any time they stake on the correct outcome, they stand to earn a return.  ""The system does also attempt to shift the value of REP upward, or downward, when needed by adjusting the fees that are given to reporters,"" Alex Chapman, Augur's lead contract engineer, explained. ""While the cap of rep is below our target level, the fees will go up every week and vice versa.""  Yet, as the team has been working on the project, they've realized there are limits to how far a project should go on distributing all work. Early on, the team wanted to have every market decide by participant votes. While that's still the backup plan for markets with disagreements, the team has come around to the idea that rewarding centralized decision making turns out to be more efficient.  Kysar said:  ""Distributed reporting is really a worst-case scenario.""  https://www.coindesk.com/augur-ahead-one-oldest-icos-close-going-live/?utm_content=buffer0faa0&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer",False

The idea is to then launch bounty programs, and then after that eventually launch with one market which is a security market ""Will the funds in this market be stolen?"" with the idea that there _probably_ will be / using a PM to predict security issues and provide extra incentive to find them.

The global online gambling market is worth over $37 Billion USD per year1. How much of that market will be captured once they learn of platform that is fair, decentralized, anonymous and has lower fees? Additionally what % of the worlds 2.5 billion unbanked2 gamblers who will use this platform? This is not to mention the many other uses of the platform, for which I'm not sure how to quantify value (maybe someone here does?).  The selloff you're seeing now are ICO buyers salivating at high returns, rather than properly estimating the value of the project; at least one good way to estimate value is by looking at the possible market share capture. The ICO share price is irrelevant to the value of the project.  The project appears to have a stong team, and is led by Joey Krug, a Thiel Fellow. Their communication as far as I've seen is professional and realistic. In the distribution of their token alone, it is clear they're professional and conscientious. These indicators suggest to me that the team has a very good chance of delivering and maintaining a very solid, highly disruptive product.  Look at the current market size above, and make some conservative assumptions about what % of that market you think will be captured by this product. Look at the caliber of the team. These methods may provide a better idea of an appropriate market cap for Augur than what is currently being offered on this thread.  1https://www.statista.com/statistics/270728/market-volume-of-online-gaming-worldwide/ 2 http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/counting-the-worlds-unbanked",False

Let's say $10,000,000 is being traded on market predictions a day when the Augur network is live (the same as the current Ethereum daily volume). Let's say the avarage fee is 1%. That makes $100,000 in fees a day. If I have 100 REP I own 1/220,000 of the total available supply. I would make $100,000 / 220,000 = $0.45 a day. It would possible be higher if not all REP is being used for reporting.  So 1 REP would make $0.0045 a day. Not much. In that case the current value of 1 REP at about $9.80 is in my opinion way too high.  Am I right on my calculation?",False

Basically, Ethereum has three benefits: 1) Ethereum's smart contract system allowed us to focus on our business logic, 2) being on Ethereum allows us to easily integrate with other Ethereum apps, and 3) Ethereum's subcurrency API will allow Augur to be currency-agnostic.  I think it's important to distinguish Ethereum-as-a-development-platform (and blockchain) from Ether the crypto-token.  Ethereum is a tremendously useful development platform; ether is just a token which will be one of many crypto-tokens (including Bitcoin) that can be used on Augur.  Augur is intended to be currency-agnostic.  In fact, after we launch, one of the first major features we're planning to add is the ability to use bitcoins directly on Augur, via BTCRelay sidechain.   The other question was what level of involvement Robin Hanson and Ron Bernstein have had in the project? I recently watched the video of Ron talking with someone from your team. His support is one of the other reasons I've been more interested in what you are doing versus Hivemind and Gnosis.  We've talked to Robin Hanson a few times, and his advice was quite good, but overall he has not been too involved in the project.  Ron Bernstein has been very actively involved.  Joey and I have been meeting with Ron almost every week for the past 6 or 7 months, and Ron is intimately familiar with Augur at this point.  He's also on our Slack and regularly contributes to the discussion.  Over the months, we've incorporated a variety of Ron's suggestions into Augur.  His most visible contribution is the wholesale removal of the market scoring rule system and its replacement with a regular order book.  (MSRs have some nice theoretical properties but empirically don't work so well, so we ended up replacing the MSR with a regular order book, which works much better.)  Ron and Joey presented together last month at the NYC Ethereum Meetup -- if you click through that link, there's video of the event posted on Youtube!",False

The short answer is, all Rep-holders will not have to vote on every event, as this would of course not scale!  Instead, the number of reporters required to vote on an event scales with the volume traded in the event's market.  More volume traded = more reports needed.  Specific reporters are assigned to events at random, weighted by their Rep holdings.  For details, please see Joey's in-depth blog post on scaling Augur.",False

An example. We have 2000 rep holders and 10mln events to reporting period. If we take 100 report per 1 holders, we will have 40 holders per 1 events, with different amount of rep. So it will be very centralization and unreliably. Also if it will be not high liquid market, so reporters be a less then 40 per one events? What if market itself will decide the result of events? If event for a long time traded on liquid market  with the odds close to 100%, this market outcome may be determined without the participation of reporters with same 100% accuracy. Because It will be infinitely costly bet against events, whose outcome is already known I will try to read blog post, but not native language",False

Are you asking whether there will usually be a lot of reporters for each event?  The answer is, it depends -- the number of reports (rep) assigned to each event depends on the volume in that event's market.  Reporting also has two ""backstops"" to make sure events resolve correctly:  The first is that after reporting, events' results can be appealed by posting a bond, which re-submits the event for reporting, this time to all reporters.  If the second result is the same as the original, then the bond is lost.  If the second result is different, then the bond poster gets their bond back, plus Rep from the reporters who reported incorrectly the first time.  The second is (if the first backstop still gets the answer incorrect) that any Rep-holder can pay to ""fork"" Rep, which splits Rep into two classes.  This works as follows:  Quote In one class the reported outcome for whatever event was the cause of dispute is said to be right, and rep is redistributed accordingly.   In the other class/branch, the event is readjudicated and remove the outcome on the pre fork branch as a possible reporting choice, then rep is redistributed as normal, except people who said the original outcome in the original fork lose rep.   Note: Whichever outcome was truly the correct one would determine which branch had rep that actually held value.  This would be akin to a Bitcoin hard fork scenario.  The winning fork, of course, would be the one with the most voluminous markets, which would be determined by the fork that represented reality, which would have a higher market cap.  Markets go to the most popular fork by default after 2 months.  You can see the nuts-and-bolts of the 2nd backstop on the forking.se contract.",False

The primary thing that 5 million dollars buys us is the freedom to take our time and really build a secure product.  If you rush your product, you get The DAO.  We fired Paul (the Truthcoin guy) from his position as advisor when we found out that he'd been secretly competing with us, as this was a significant, undisclosed conflict-of-interest.

If all we do is marketing, then why am I (one of the core developers) on here responding to you?  Shouldn't we have a crack marketing team that handles this kind of stuff?

A few months ago when I saw the price collapse of REP on the price charts (bravenewcoin.com and others) I had no idea what was going on. And was naturally worried.  The REP price you saw on the charts was actually the price of REP IOU's sold by a single exchange (Gatecoin).  They participated in the token sale and were selling IOUs for their tokens to people on their exchange.  As I understand it, their exchange was hacked and went offline, and after that the price chart websites just didn't have any sources of data for REP any longer.  Long story short: the REP price shown on the charts was probably not accurate to begin with, as it represented a REP IOU (rather than actual REP tokens) and the volume traded was quite small.  The only concrete market price for REP is the price at the conclusion of the token sale ($0.59/REP, if I remember correctly).   Other than reddit, is Augur REP active on some exchange such that it has a market value that is listed on some price chart? I searched and haven't found any.  I've heard people are trading small amounts of REP IOUs through one of the Ripple gateways (Gatehub, I think?).  As with Gatecoin's ""REP"", it's important to know that these are just IOUs.  For legal reasons, real (non-IOU) REP will not be tradeable on exchanges until Augur's live release.   Will you email out Augur newsletters to keep subscribers updated? What is the best way to receive updates on Augur progress?  Yes, we do have a newsletter.  There's a signup for the newsletter on our landing page.  We limit the newsletters to relatively big news items to keep it from feeling spammy.   For the REP I purchased in Aug 2015, do I need to do anything with it? Or just let it sit until the next phase of Augur is launched?  Just let it sit for now.  There will be a ""dry run"" (probably in a month or so) where we'll distribute ""play"" REP using the same distribution mechanism the live release will use.  This will be 100% optional and the only reason to participate in this is if you'd like to help us test.  Otherwise, there's nothing you need to do until Augur's live release.   Thanks again for keeping us updated.  Thanks for participating in the token sale.

Otherwise, it would be a conflict of interest as in case of The Dao and the recipe for disaster.  1) The reasons we decided to build Augur on top of Ethereum (rather than as an independent blockchain) are detailed in this blog post.  The very short reason is, building on Ethereum allowed us to focus solely on our business logic, without needing to program, deploy, and secure our own blockchain.  2) Augur will ultimately be currency agnostic.  It will support all tokens that use Ethereum's subcurrency API, including the stablecoins in development on Ethereum.  Bitcoin will also be natively supported via BTCRelay, a sidechain linking the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains.  (Easy integration with other projects in Ethereum's ecosystem is another significant benefit to building on Ethereum.)  Bitcoin integration won't be part of the initial launch, but it is the first big feature we'd like to implement after launch.  The only overlap between the Augur and Ethereum teams is Vitalik; he's one of our advisors.  Our technical efforts are separate from those of the Ethereum core team.  Augur pre-dates most of the general-use contract programming and JS tools in circulation now.  As a result, we have our own custom-built stack on top of Ethereum.  This relatively narrow focus has some security and efficiency advantages; for example, two of the tools that have been the most error-prone (the Solidity language and the web3 JSON RPC tool) are entirely absent from Augur's stack.",False

The orderbook is filling up slowly and first trades are starting to happen:  https://www.ripplecharts.com/#/markets/REP:rckzVpTnKpP4TJ1puQe827bV3X4oYtdTP/BTC:rvYAfWj5gh67oV6fW32ZzP3Aw4Eubs59B?interval=30m&range=3d&type=candlestick  To sell your account on GateHub:  Create an account at http://wallet.gatehub.net/ and log in Connect the GateHub Fifth REP gateway (you'll see large buttons to do this) Request a REP account deposit - see below Create a Ripple Wallet on GateHub (if you don't have one already) Add trust for GateHub Fifth's REP (again a large visible button) When your REP is credited to your wallet, transfer it to the Ripple Wallet Click Trade and place sell orders. I suggest selling against Bitstamp's BTC for now.  This is from the About GateHub Fifth Help page:  How do I deposit REP that I want to sell?  All deposits involve manual handling and take up to 24 hours. Some deposits, especially Ethereum buy-in account deposits, may be processed faster (within one hour).  The deposit process differs depending on whether your account was a Bitcoin buy-in or Ether buy-in.  Depositing a Bitcoin buy-in REP account  To transfer your Bitcoin buy-in Augur REP sale account to GateHub, you will be guided to send an e-mail to the Augur team, requesting to transfer the REP account to GateHub Fifth. When the Augur team has transferred the ownershipa and GateHub Fifth has successfully claimed the account, you will be credited REP IOUs on the Ripple network.  Depositing an Ether buy-in REP account  To transfer your Ethereum buy-in account to GateHub, you’ll need to confirm the transfer of the account by sending an Ethereum transaction (with a minuscule amount of ETH) from the Ethereum address that you used to buy REP in the presale. This transaction constitues your signed request to the Augur team to transfer the REP to GateHub Fifth instead of to you when Augur launches.  -----  Sorry if this seems a bit complicated, but the GateHub team is working on making the process simpler. If there are further questions (I expect some especially if you're not familiar with Ripple) -- I'll answer them here, or you can contact us at fifth@gatehub.net. Thanks!",False

So nobody has them. They do have an account that is attached to the amount of augur/rep  they have. This account can be sold so when augur releases the reps, you will get them.  Gatecoin was selling augur/rep based off a couple peoples accounts that sold to gatecoin. Gatecoin then issued a proxy token for reps based off the total supply of these purchased accounts and started trading on their exchange.  You could buy and sell but could not remove the proxy tokens from your gatecoin account until augur releases the reps. Then gatecoin was hacked.  Liquidity is simply the amount of available ""cash out"" there is. A token/coin can have a value of $10 but if there are only $100 traded daily, the liquidity is low/ non existence.  Be careful when looking at the value of any cryoto. Look at the volume/liquidity.  Doesn't do you any good having a coin worth $100 if nobody is selling.  Hope this helps.",False

I posted an update a few weeks back here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Augur/comments/3tk233/augur_development_process/cx76oc0 I just updated the TODO list on the backend with the things that have been completed since the time of the post (you can view it in the link above). I've almost gotten ""implement backstop one where everyone reports on a market/event"" done and then I'm going to start on ""implement forking."" At that point, the core protocol will be more or less completely implemented on the backend sans various polishing and bug fixes. So then I plan to refactor the code and remove various artifacts not necessary due to the old consensus algorithms and make it overall a bit tighter, cleaner, and simpler as well as write a test suite for the new consensus algorithm to test all the backstops (everyone reporting on an event and forking). Then after that, it'll be time for security audits! The last blog post I made was on scaling things, and scalability is going quite nicely implementation wise. There probably won't be a technical blog post from me for a while since I'm focused on implementing things at the moment. However, Ryan has been making a flow diagram of the entire system from start to finish (including all the edge cases / backstops), which I think would be something useful to post once it's finished. So that'll probably be our next post (the diagram following the creation through resolution of any given market on Augur and what that all entails in fairly plain English). As for the front-end / graphical-user-interface I try not to give predictions or dates about it because they tend to be quite wrong (it's very hard to estimate software release dates when you're developing the software, and nigh impossible when you're estimating software built by someone else). Although I don't mind giving estimates about my software , I estimate we'll have the first backstop implemented by the end of this week sometime and implementing forking will probably take another week or two. So I suppose the backend will be pretty much feature complete, although an ugly codebase, by Christmas! Although this doesn't really mean anything besides warm fuzzy feelings from both my and your perspectives since we can't actually see all this cool stuff yet! For the front end, we've hired someone who used to work on InTrade's UI, and our UI will be migrating over to a more traditional (although sleek, simple, and beautiful) InTrade style UI (although a large part of this UI is already built, and there is an announcement (good news) surrounding this that should probably be made into a blog post or posted on Reddit). I honestly would not bet on it (the front end / UI beta) being done by Christmas. That said, the new UI is probably an order of magnitude better from a design (and implementation) standpoint, so we have that to look forward to, even though I see no way how it could possibly not be late at this point. I'd like to finish up this first backstop in the backend, then next week I'll write up a post on that announcement and add in some variant of the above and wrap it all up for an email update for people who don't check random reddit comment threads (presumably, most people ).",False

However I am wondering how will you handle to sell your coin (70% of value after IPO).  For bitcoin let say you will have 14.000 bitcoin it's quite ok as it represents around 0.1% of total bitcoin amount so the price should not be too much affected.  Now let's say you will get 1.4 million Eth that is around 2% of total supply of ETH so 20X more than with bitcoin, here you will have a huge impact on the ETH price.  Scenario 1: You will dump your ETH after IPO which will crash the price of ETH, so you will get a part of the value after IPO (as it will not be possible to selll all at same price)  but it would be quite fair for investors, however if everybody's know what will happens the price will crash before IPO due to FUD...  Scenario 2: You decide to sell your ether during few months which will put a constant sell pressure, so that will make the price of ether dropping week after week + the FUD associated, thus you will get only a small part of the money you should got but the shares from ETH buyers of REP and bitcoin buyers of REP will not change, so it is not fair for bitcoin investors (shares diluted and ETH sell provide you few money).  Scenario 3: An alternative scenario, like an auction for the ether with some discount but the ETH are blocked for 1 year for exemple like this only long term investors would be interested.  I don't know what is your intention but I remind you that your decision will have huge consequences on ether price.  If you could inform us about what is your plan that would be nice.

On Monday, August 17th we are starting our Reputation Token crowdsale at 12PM EST. We meticulously went over the options for token distribution methods and although a crowdsale was not exactly our favorite choice, it was the one necessary as the tokens need to have value in order for our decentralized oracle system to work. We wrote a a blog post going into a bit more detail about why we are using a crowdsale, I would encourage everyone to check it out http://www.augur.net/blog/why-a-crowdsale-is-necessary-for-augur-to-work-some-updates.

What Augur seems to be is:  1.  A prediction market, using bitcoin as the medium of exchange, but also allowing you to use other currencies, including it seems, Truthcoin, and, for stability (ironically!?) the US dollar  2.  using Augur one can avoid the numerous anti-gambling laws that apply to prediction markets (sad but true, as I am a fan of prediction markets; iPredict in New Zealand is one such example)  3.  using Augur you can buy or sell shares in a prediction, and it is locked in the Augur blockchain.  If your prediction comes true, then somehow (not 100% clear how) you can collect on your bet, if: (i) a super-user, or users, with high ""reputation"", reports that the event occurred as predicted, and, (ii) once this super-user(s) (with typically many such super-users reaching a consensus) says a prediction has occurred, then the Augur blockchain is 'unlocked' and people who made bets one way or the other can collect, via the blockchain, on their bet (if they won), or, if they lost, their bitcoins/truthcoins / USD amounts are also transferred to the winners.  4.  From the OP "" If such an individual is dishonest, they are punished, and if they tell the truth, their reputation increases (this is discovered via principal component analysis)."" - what is the punishment?  A hit in their Reputation points?  I suppose so.  Can any reader confirm the above?  TonyT",False

Your summary is pretty spot on, I'll clarify a few things:  1.  Exactly!  As for the US dollar part, the way it would work is as follows: you buy some bitcoin, then when you want to use the Augur platform you can sidechain the bitcoin over directly.  The problem with this is if we make a prediction on something that happens a year from now, we may not want to keep our money wagered in bitcoin that entire time.  In this scenario what would be best is if we could hold USD, unfortunately there is no cryptocurrency-usd, however we can convert our money into a seigniorage-based coin.  Basically, if more people use the coin, supply goes up, so as to maintain par value with the USD.  One example of this is Nubits.  2.  No comment.  3.  This is more or less correct, with the exception that anyone can be a reporter on outcomes, not just an elite group of super users/oracles.  The more accurate you are, the more your reports are weighted.  4.  Yep, their reputation points take a hit. ",False

Like many brilliant ideas around these parts, I am left wondering ""where is the implementation?""  I think you will find that determining ""the truth"" or in the language of your whitepaper ""accurate reporting"" is the crux of the biscuit.  I see from your blog you are tackling this head on and moving past the days of suggesting that ""Googling"" is somehow part of the solution.  if we could trust a predetermined third party to report on outcomes we wouldn't need your project.   I think you will find that some use of proof of coin holdings by reporters for trust of event reporting is a good way to go.  You will also need to make a decent analysis of the monetary risk of corruption of reporting source (I guess people are using the name oracle for this which I don't like but hey that's pretty typical of language).  In other words, if the bids and asks on a given prediction market really start to heat up and the amount of BTC at stake starts to reach some function of the BTC that is being held and counted in use of reporting the event outcome, the reliability of this market is compromised.
