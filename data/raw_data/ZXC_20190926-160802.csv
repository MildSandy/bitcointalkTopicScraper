The 0xcert Framework is a free and open-source JavaScript library that provides tools for building powerful decentralized applications. Our mission is to equip application developers with a secure, agnostic and opinionated framework with conventions to enable interoperability between applications.     What does it solve?  Let's imagine the 0xcert Framework as a funnel that untangles the complexity of the current way of building a dapp and narrows it all down to just a few lines of code. But you don't have to push your imagination too hard. Here is what the difference looks like.    Needless to say, this brings enormous reductions to developing time and needed personnel (both equal lower budget). Also, you can be much more confident in the quality of the final outcome, as the Framework follows strict conventions and standards.  The main features of the 0xcert Framework  Apart from making the code a whole lot more cleaner and transparent, the Framework serves as an essential contribution to the decentralized world for the following reasons:  It supports creation (minting), management, and verification of ERC-721 non-fungible tokens (assets). This way, you can tokenize and trade any unique item or asset you like on the blockchain. It provides management of ERC-20 fungible tokens (currencies). So you can add a financial value expressed in fungible tokens to your non-fungible ERC-721 asset. It enables and executes many-to-many atomic operations. You can create and transfer multiple tokens (either fungible or non-fungible) on the blockchain in one single transaction. It provides conventions for interoperability between different applications. With this, you can work with many applications in the same way without having to adapt to different systems.  To learn more about the 0xcert Framework, the Protocol, and the 0xcert news, please refer to:  The 0xcert Framework documentation The 0xcert Framework repository: please consider contributing to the open-source and free framework, The official 0xcert website, Our news blog.",False

The vision of 0xcert is to provide an open protocol for non-fungible tokens to a wider tech audience.  Blockchain was first built for the financial capital; now it is ready to take on unique digital and real-world assets. With use of non-fungible tokens the idea of storing intangible assets such as copyrights, patents and goodwill, as well as tangible asset ownership such as property, equipment and inventory is now possible like never before.  --------- WHAT PROBLEMS ARE WE SOLVING?  Slow adoption of NFTs, lack of interoperability, costly and slow development of NFT applications, no mechanism to verify authentic issuers.  Due to low-level blockchain complexity, the wide adoption of non-fungible tokes and blockchain in general is slower than it could be. The lack of conventions prevents interoperability among applications. Developers trying to develop their own decentralised application using non-fungible tokens face long development time and huge risk in their development process and security, lowering the overall efficiency and adoption rate. The resulting ecosystem of digital assets is under risk of  being fragmented, with non-interoperable dapps and underlying data.  One of the major problems in the future may not be the technological barrier to issuing ownership rights of different unique assets on the blockchain, but rather the authenticity of issuing entities. Currently there is no mechanism to attest credible NFT issuers.  --------- HOW DO WE SOLVE THIS WITH 0xcert?  0xcert is an open source protocol that translates one-of-a-kind digital or real-world assets into non-fungible tokens (NFTs) - unique proof of ownership available from the blockchain.  The vision of 0xcert is to provide an open protocol for standardized and certified non-fungible tokens to a wider tech audience. With 0xcert, you can build on top of the non-fungible token standard, employing a complete toolset, development framework, and a set of conventions for various use cases. This results in shorter development time, lower risk and cuts cost associated with developing blockchain solutions. A wide range of decentralized applications and business models can be supported, giving companies the power to fully utilize the potential of blockchain technology.   --------- ECOSYSTEM   The purpose of 0xcert is not only to build out a technological layer, but also to unite the community around NFTs. Therefore, we will work with different stakeholders on different levels, ranging from R&D in the 0xcert Labs, further 0xcert protocol development as well as with protocol users and the general NFT space.      --------- PRODUCT - 0xcert protocol 0xcert is an open-source permissionless protocol for non-fungible tokens on the blockchain.      Conventions and upgraded functionality for non-fungible tokens Non-fungible tokens built with 0xcert conventions are called Xcerts. Conventions are community-driven standard data inputs and are determined for each asset type. Xcerts represent standard non-fungible tokens, which also hold an imprint of an asset. With the 0xcert protocol, we can further validate proof of existence, authenticity and ownership of these assets without third-party involvement.  Plug & Play framework The framework consists of SDKs in various programing languages, detailed documentation and other developer tools. It is built so that libraries directly interact with the 0xcert protocol and developers can bypass low-level blockchain complexity.  Deploy a new Xcert smart contract[/b]    Minting a new Xcert token     Transfering Xcert tokens   DEX for fungible and non-fungible tokens Decentralised exchange is one of the key supporting components in the 0xcert framework. DEX represents a set of smart contracts installed on the blockchain which allow for a trustless exchange of multiple different types of fungible and non-fungible tokens as single atomic operations. Although not all NFTs are meant to be traded (ID, credentials,...), most others (art, collectibles,...) are seeking additional liquidity, which can be provided through an exchange.  Open source and blockchain agnostic 0xcert is an open-source and community driven project. Its first implementation is built on Ethereum. However, due to the blockchain-agnostic nature of the protocol, expansion to other blockchains will follow (e.g. NEO, Wanchain, EOS,...).   ZXC TOKEN The ZXC token is a protocol token and is introduced to align issuing parties with dapps and the community. The ZXC token is also a part of the extended 0xcert ecosystem that spans beyond the protocol itself. We envision its usage on a few layers, which further decentralize important elements of the corresponding ecosystem.     Fees Dapps developed by 0xcert (e.g. KYC and Academia pilot projects), may use the ZXC token as the basic liquid asset for these dapps to operate on the protocol - similar to gas on the Ethereum blockchain. There are also a number of other use cases within dapps that may use ZXC: bidding, granting access, rewards, loyalty programs, staking, etc.  Decentralised governance Over time, a decentralized governance may be introduced to further strengthen the 0xcert community. 0xcert aims to be a community driven project - various stakeholders come together to co-create an ecosystem around the protocol itself. In this light, the decentralized governance model may be introduced in the future to drive protocol-level development updates, conventions and update integration.  Issuer Verification Registry An important piece of the proposed protocol will be authenticating and assuring the validity of issuers building with the 0xcert protocol. Each NFT issued requires a deployed main (Xcert token) contract and a mechanism that will attest the validity and the issuers identity.  We are proposing a token curated registry to pursue a decentralized approach in validating the issuers of NFTs. Ultimately, a new issuer would stake a portion of tokens to get listed, while the existing holders will have the ability to approve or challenge the listing.  MINI APP - 0xcert Manager - LINK Smart contract configurator and deployer app. 0xcert manager allows everyone to create a Non-fungible Project. You can simply enable and configure the features of your non-fungible token smart contract, review and deploy to the Ethereum blockchain. World first NFT smart contract configurator! Stage: MVP, working proof of concept, deploying to testnet  --------- USE CASES  The 0xcert protocol is best described as the underlying technological base layer upon which new use cases can be built. Developers will no longer need to have advanced Solidity skills to create blockchain based solutions for unique assets. The simple to use libraries allow for fast and safe production, which in turn allow for more creativity and flexibility with subsequent solutions.  Possible use cases include:  identity, certificates, academic credentials, artwork ownership, deeds, land titles, collectibles, etc.  You can also read our extensive use case articles on art and cellectibles: ERC-721 Hitting a Home Run - READ HERE Millions, art, fakes and blockchain - READ HERE  --------- WHY BLOCKCHAIN?   The potential of the blockchain technology is much more than cryptocurrencies. It will enable people, companies to put IDs, certificates, real estate data and other important information of the real world assets on the blockchain.  The case for using blockchain, specifically for non fungible tokens and 0xcert has to be made in each vertical separately. For example:  Identity and KYC would benefit for having a 0-knowledge proof token. This would drastically lower KYC costs and allow for a reusable identity token.  Art and collectibles can gain from history records and provenance. Imagine that each piece of art has a full history available and verifiable, without the possibility to being faked or altered retroactively. Imagine having your diploma issued on the blockchain as a digital document that is recognized by all authorities around the world — no need to translate, notarize, verify it.  Academic credentials and certificates[/size] are a prime example. Imagine having your diploma issued on the blockchain as a digital document that is recognized by all authorities around the world — no need to translate, notarize, verify it.   Without a doubt, blockchain is the right technology for managing digital assets of all kinds, primarily due to its features, such as security and immutability.   --------- TOKEN GENERATION - CROWDSALE - JULY 4th, 2018     Token name: ZXC (ERC-20) Total tokens minted: 500M Soft cap: 5,000 ETH Hard cap: 20,000 ETH Tokens on public offering: 250M (50%) Price of ZXC token: 0.0001 ETH, 1 ETH = 10,000 ZXC Blockchain: Ethereum (ERC-20) Currency Accepted: ETH   --------- INTRODUCING THE NON-FUNGIBLE  TOKEN      --------- TOKEN DISTRIBUTION     Lock-Up for Contributors: None Lock-up for Founders: Locked for 6 months then 12.5% and 12.5% every three months.

You are talking about adoption in general. Once more and more projects launch using NFTs, it will also become easier to understand for regular users or even crypto beginners. The idea is though, to hide all the complexity connected with blockchain and NFTs - specifically blockchain development. The regular user will only have to deal with end-user UI within specific applications that run on top of the 0xcert protocol. On the other hand, developers will also get a shortcut so that even non-ICO and non-blockchain projects/companies can easily use blockchain and NFT technology.  Hope this answers your question",False
