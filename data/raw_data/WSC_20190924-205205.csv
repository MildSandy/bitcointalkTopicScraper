One of the ways to attract money I see in the release of tokens. One token will be equal to the cost of the month of using the service and approximately 1% of the tokens will be sold at the current stage. Now I see the cost of the month as $0.1 per month. After improving the algorithms and usability, I see the price of a token corresponding to a monthly payment of at least $2 or $5  Issuing a token does not mean ICO  Of course, the release of tokens can not be done without development plans and the announcement of improved work algorithms. Now I see the utility of the MVP in saving time. I follow the general background of the market, such as - which news is broadcast positive or negative, - which is published according to forecasts of market growth and bitcoin - what is the relation to bokchain technology. It is enough to read the headings and look a bit that is highlighted in the main part of the article. If the background is positive, then everything is ok in the medium term.  Now we need to find projects that will grow, for this I use the main page of the site and have my own analytics on coins that have already been ""shot"" - i.e. grew more than average market growth.  I follow all the new coins that fall into the first list on the main page of the site with a pie chart and the second table (the table shows coins with the growth of mentions in 2 times and more in comparison with yesterday). If there is a new coin which was not there yesterday, then I figure out what news is on it and what schedule. Usually, for decision making, there is from 20 minutes to a couple of hours so as not to miss the initial movement. There are cases when the coin has soared upwards and only after that they started talking about it. Here you can go on a rollback from the maximum price, but this is a completely different strategy.  I take into account the events that hit the calendar. By events it is important to know when they were announced. Just at each event a date is written when it was published, the second date when the event takes place. When considering news on coins, I pay attention to published forecasts, mentions in media and tweeters of authoritative people with a good audience.",False

The 35% discount have been extended for the whole Pre-ICO Sale stage. We also tend to offer even bigger discounts to those investing in large amounts.  Quote from: ranggenga on March 28, 2018, 11:10:30 PM Still learning about this Wall Street Coin. How much profit that will be gain for any investor in a period of times? Need to know about it to decide whether I need to invest or not  We cannot estimate an exact profit, neither are we allowed to do so. However, at this stage (Pre-ICO) the price is 1 WSC = 0.5 USD plus the 35% Discount (around 0.32 USD per 1 WSC Token), and during the last round of the ICO Sale, WSC Tokens will be offered at the rate of 1 WSC = 0.9 USD. After the WSC Token is listed on Crypto-Exchanges, the planned 15% Token Buy-Back should keep a price higher than the ones offered during the ICO sale.  Quote from: Samk on March 30, 2018, 08:16:48 AM HAVE A DOUBT THAT WILL THE DECENTRALISED EXCHANGE BUILD ON THE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY WILL HAVE A COIN OR A PHYSICAL COMPANY STOCKS IN IT.  IF STOCKS LIKE FACEBOOK, MICROSOFT, GOOGLE ETC.. WILL HAVE THEN COIN WILL ROCK.  Blockchain Technology is inevitable and more and more huge companies are implementing it on different projects everyday. You can find news about such projects here: https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain (A trusted source for Crypto-world news). With this in mind, we cannot deny the chance that even companies like Facebook, Microsoft, etc. will offer their Stock Shares on the Wall Street Coin Platform. After all, as mentioned on our Thread, we will organize and systemize the stock market, bringing stability and identity verification, transparency, security and trust to a traditionally insecure stock market. Therefore, we hope that clients will favor our platform rather than a centralized traditional stock market, and even the big companies will have to offer their Stock Shares where the clients prefer them.  Quote from: Rolcrypto on March 30, 2018, 10:33:21 AM How does wall street coin tend to bring,  transparency of every stock investments and their complete security with the use of ethereum blockchain network?   We plan to do this through the use of Smart Contracts. Smart Contracts are protocols designed to verify and facilitate the negotiation of a contract. It aids the successful completion of a transaction without the interference of a middleman. Smart contracts are autonomous as they are not controlled by anyone, but rather they self-execute transactions as initiated by two parties. On a very basic note, smart contracts function in calculating, storing information and sending of transaction to accounts.  Quote from: assasin21rus on March 31, 2018, 08:39:50 AM what will your experts do without the help of your future platform, do you have a very useful coin?  Building a Decentralized Stock Exchange Platform and using Wall Street Coin as the only payment method are the main goals of our ICO. Therefore, ensuring the guarantee of a healthy daily trading volume and liquidity.  Quote from: Samk on March 31, 2018, 09:03:26 AM My doubt is that whather they will make a platform that will be like stock market or they will allow the the stocks to buy and sell at their platform.  Our platform is targeted towards offering a Decentralized Stock Exchange Market where companies will be able to offer Stock Shares to the most suitable clients based on their budget and interest.

The platform will be based on Blockchain technology and Smart Contracts, functioning as a Decentralized Stock Trading Platform. To ensure correct stock shares evaluating, avoid fraudulent stock sales and other potential threats to investors, every company listed for public stock sale on our platform will undergo a background check by a team of financial experts.  The current Stock Exchanges are all based upon centralized platforms. Counter to that, Wall Street Coin Platform will be based on Ethereum Blockchain technology, offering full transparency and all-time log of all the trades ever done within the platform. WSC platform will organize and systemize the stock market, bringing stability and identity verification, transparency, security and trust to a traditionally insecure stock market.    OUR MISSION We aim to create a marketplace for the users, where they will be able to operate within a robust and resilient Peer-to-Peer network without having to pay a fee to middlemen, thus, allowing them to avoid deceitful stock selling campaigns and invest directly by themselves on startups or businesses of their interest. By making use of the Ethereum Network Blockchain, Wall Street Coin ensures the transparency of every stock investments and their complete security.  As of now, the brokerage firms possess a massive amount of economic and political power which is growing exponentially as a result of the centralized system they have developed to operate in. A major problem of this centralized system is its vulnerability, which brokerage firms have leveraged upon to manipulate the value and prices of shares and other conditions in a way to magnify their profits at the expense of the investors. With our Wall Street Coin network algorithm, we will change this by allowing companies with great expansive ideas to a greater chance of selling stock shares of their companies, with accurately and legit valued prices, to customers with suitable budgets and interest.    BUSINESS MODEL The Wall Street Coin Platform seeks to procure solutions to the several challenges facing the stock market. We make full proof of the smart contracts feature of the Blockchain technology which is particularly suited to organize and systemize the stock market thus bringing stability and identity verification, transparency, security and trust to a traditionally insecure stock market.  Systemize, unite, and organize the regulation efforts of the traditional stock market Provide peer-to-peer selling and investment platform open to everyone Provide a decentralized system for transactions Develop an immutable ledger for every transaction Create standards for identity verification, transactions    THE PROBLEM WITH TRADITIONAL STOCK MARKET There are a lot of issues plaguing the Stock Market and most of these issues revolve around the fact that the Stock Market runs a centralized system of exchange. There are a lot of disadvantages this system of exchange has brought to the investors as they are not catered for at all. The stock brokers and the companies are usually the benefactors of the stock market all at the expense of the investors. The truth is rather than the market serves the purpose of allowing the investors make profit, the companies and their agents are usually the profit makers. Thus, the customers are usually faced with mistrust, waste of funds, insecurity, capital loss and fraud.  Centralized System The presence of a middleman has brought a lot of mishap to investors as most of the time these investors are usually after enriching their pockets and not the investors themselves. This has caused loss of capital and as such, so many individuals are scared to invest in the Stock Market. In essence, these middlemen are in charge of tracking share ownership and also accessing the official shareholder list and as such, money is usually at the helm of the middleman.  Insecurity and Trust Issues As a result of the almost autonomy which middlemen have, the trade account of most investors is usually not safe. Therefore, most investors usually do not trust stockbrokers to handle business for them, hence frightening them away from the market. Through investigation, it was found out that stockbrokers use their clients account for trade without first discussing with the clients themselves. Although, stockbrokers inform their clients after successful completion of trade, it still does not make such trade acceptable whether or not the client accepts it or not  Long Process to Complete Transactions It takes three days or more to complete a transaction usually because of the numerous intermediaries involved in the process, regulatory processes and even the operation trade clearance. This tends to leave investors at risks as immediately there is a delay in the recognition of the owner, the system most times do not get to recognize such transaction.  Fraud and Theft Instance arise in which Stockbrokers hijack the funds of an investor. This is very possible because most times, they have access to their clients account. Sometimes, they could divert the fund in bits until they are in total control of the money. Some other times, it could be external hackers who would hack in into an investor account to take full possession of the account.  Capital Loss by Investors as a Result of Inadequate Information Most investors no doubt get to lose a lot of their money often as a result of the wrong information given to them by stockbrokers. Since brokers make more profit by trading more, they sweet-talk customers into trading even when they know the market is not favorable. At the end, they make gain at the expense of these investors through the commissions they get. This is loss on the part of the investor.  Costly and Complex to run The tasks involved in completing a transaction is herculean due to the numerous processes and as such, there are usually so many intermediaries who clear trades, some hold assets while others keep records. Every one of these intermediaries are definitely going to charge a fee for their service and as such, it reduces the investment power of the investors. Aside of this, the processes are usually just too complex. An investor cannot just decide to do all of these tasks himself. One way or the other, he needs the services of the stockbroker.  Limitation on Interoperability As a result of the complex process involved, it is usually nearly impossible for investors to think about going offshore with their investments.  Transparency As a result of the centralized system of the stock market, information is usually held on a singular server and as such, it is usually open to hackers. The lack of transparency thus breeds mistrust and fear among investors.  High Transaction Fees The amount of money paid out as commission to stockbrokers by investors is usually discouraging. As a result of the numerous intermediaries, commission associated with them as a result of services they render like record keeping, auditing, verification of trades is usually exorbitant.    WALL STREET COIN SOLUTIONS The Wall Street Coin is targeted towards solving the Stock Trading Market problems through the decentralization and automation of stock exchanges.

Decentralized Platform for Trading As opposed to the natural presence of a middle man for handling of processing, the Wall Street Coin aims to provide the Stock market with a decentralized system in which every one on the platform can see every transaction that takes place. More so, a decentralized system eliminates the presence of complex and time-wasting processes. All that would be needed by the investor and the company is verifying the transactions as they occur.
