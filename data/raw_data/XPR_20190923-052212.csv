Actually, PR Card Tokens will serve the most important utility. Because everyone who holds e.g. ^emusk Token will earn passively every time someone votes on Elon Musk's PR Card, the tokens set the actual Public Reputation Value of each listed token. Why? Because people will either:  1) HODL ^emusk to earn when, someone votes on Elon (or increases, decreases bids, or changes the predictions from plus to minus and vice versa) 2) or they will simply sell ^emusk on the market for profit, and then the new owner will earn the incentive for as long as he/she HODL's the token  Even people unrelated to PR.network will be able earn just holding PR Card tokens on their wallet.

Each kitten is unique, and it's yours! This turns all kittens into unique digital assets, everyone can buy and sell at the marketplace.  Cryptokitties are just like our PR Cards!

Each PR Card measures real-time PR and Value of things.

For PR.network it is critical to have the best available solution. As you know we might manage over 500.000 tokens for different things monitored at PR.Network. This means we need the best available token infrastructure: based on a distributed network, capped supply, smart contracts, near real-time transaction speed and low cost of assets transfer and exchange.  We've been with stellar and ripple since their very beginnings. To be honest PR.network was initially planned for Ripple, however, a poor strategy of the company (turning back from the community towards banks) made us rethink our plans. However, based on our tests our needs e.g. for daily mass redistribution of micro funds from inaccurate to the most accurate accounts is too expensive and too slow at Ethereum.    With Stellar Network we could improve all the aspects of the PR.network. Platform readiness, transfers/exchange speeds (from 10 min to 3-5 seconds) and cost (from 0.2 cents per transaction to really just a fraction of a cent)  Stellar would allow members to create PR Cards token with capped supply in seconds (JimCarrey, FCBarcelona Tokens, using multisig based smart contracts) All PRN tokens would be automatically listed at the distributed exchange of all PR.network tokens and other main cryptos: XML, ETH, BTC, XRP etc. (https://stellarterm.com/#)  We hope Stellar Development Foundation will be interested to help us building the global opinion and real-time value exchange on Stellar.

If you give the card a negative PR, the summary of your traits must be minus so it at least needs to be: -1, if you try to make it 0, the script won't allow you (due to your score for this card is negative). In this scenario find another trait that you can downvote. If you keep giving plus and minus in a balanced fashion you will be able to use all of them.

PR+ and PR- are digital cryptographic currencies with a capped supply of a total of 100 Million.  PR+ and PR- work in synergy to provide security, utility and entertainment through rewards and opportunities to create, hold or exchange Unique Digital Assets (Tokens) that measure the value of public entities and matters.  PR+ TOKEN is an essential asset in terms of usability at PR.network. It executes all requests sent to the network. 100 MLN supply of PR+ is released based on a predefined plan in the Smart Contract. PR+ is utilized as network’s security against spam and Sybil attacks. Users use PR+ to Vote, create PR Cards and PR- Card Tokens. PR+ is based on deflationary supply model in which 100 PR+ is destroyed each time a new PR- Card Tokens is created. Deflationary model ends after PR+ reaches 50 Million Units and no more PR Card tokens can be created.  PR- TOKEN broadcasts real-time capitalization value of all PR Card Tokens created by the community. PR- Card tokens are Unique Digital Assets with a supply of 100 Units per Token. Each PR- Card Tokens measures the total value of each PR Card based on the real-time market capitalization for PR Card Tokens.  Every PR Card owner can create unique PR Card Tokens for each PR Cards in the collection. Holders of PR Card’s Tokens can earn up to 100% of security fees paid by the community depending on the percentage of PR Card Tokens they hold. New Ethereum tokens are generated with a click of a button and automatically added to the internal UDA Exchange and to user’s account balances. Creators of Unique Tokens can hold or trade their tokens with other community members. For every new PR- Card Token generated 100 PR+ is destroyed.",False

The Actual value of all tokens out there depends on the supply-demand ratio which primarily depends on the token utility (or very often just the hype). PR.network's token will have a strong utility and limited, shrinking supply (deflationary model) and we will work hard to create the hype.  You are currently creating the foundation for the platform. All Early Bird Adopters take part in airdrops. PR Cards you hold now are yours. All these cards will generate cryptocurrency for you each time, new voter votes on your card (or existing voter changes votes) You will be able to create a token for each of your cards and trade you PR Cards for crypto. (but then you will not earn for votes on your cards but the new owner will - there might be many owners of 1 PR Card - depending on who holds the token)  See current airdrops below:  Quote from: PRNETWORK on October 09, 2017, 06:16:35 AM An official announcement only to you and nobody else (yet)!  Some of you already know! We have two ongoing incentivized programs:  1) Early Bird Adopter Airdrop.  Where: 3 MLN of PRN Token is allocated to the first 12.000 Active Voters  Details: Members must vote to have a minimum of 20 out of 100 Balanced Votes required. (20 BVs= 20% of Airdrop QTY, 50 BVs = 50% Airdrop 100 BVs = 100% Airdrop) Eardrop Qty depends on the early adopter level (there are 12). Airdrop will be credited to PR.Network accounts as soon as Token Exchange is up and running.  2) The first 100.000 Balanced Votes Bounty  The first 100K Balanced Votes will receive free 100.000 PRN Tokens attached to them and votes will be converted to Public Opinion Predictions.  Details: 1 Token Per Vote will back every out of 100K predictions - this bounty is to test live scenarios for P.O. Predictions - the main component of incentives. Free Tokens will work for members, and either earn or lose value daily depending on users accuracy in predicting opinions. 100K BV Bounty will be credited to PR.Network accounts as soon as Public Opinion Prediction is up and running.

Eagerly awaiting.  Yes, these are different. There will be no limits or balance required between Disagree/Agree on comments but the imbalance info will be included in voters profile info. This is all test run now, so if we see some bad stuff we might consider bringing the requirement for balance too.  100% sure.  We do ICO after main features (mentioned in the earlier post) are released. This is to keep PR.Network platform long-term resistant to all Token and ICO related legal concerns. However! Don't worry! There is a positive side of it! The good news is we can do a pre-registration, with email and small ETH confirmation!  This would give you the opportunity to lock yourself a privileged position in the Community ICO and Pre-ICO before anyone else!  Are you interested in the pre-registration for ICO? Tell us about it here and why do you think ""PR+ will go to the moon!?""   Quote from: teleportlabs on October 18, 2017, 01:36:37 AM The list says 50% allocated for the ICO, is the rest to be airdropped, and wouldn't that significantly harm the value of the token?

ICO is spread over the period of 12 months to support the harmonic distribution of PRICO Token. Information is spread with a speed of light, but it never reaches diverse communities at the same time. Over the period of 12 months, we will have a chance to reach out many among global communities.  Our priority is the compliance. In most of the cases, ICO is used to finance the development of a solution, but we already have a solution. Our ICO funds will be used to support the expansion and mainstream adoption. We’ve already built our BETA solution with no ICO fundraising. In 2-3 months we may complete the entire solution. If we manage to do so, our coins cannot be considered as “Securities” and can be sold in every country with no restrictions. From the legal standpoint of view PR+ and PR- will be “Utility” Assets.

Enjoy this raw version Part.1. about:  - The basic problem we try to solve, - The proposed solution, - Token development - Token Distribution.  Let us know your questions and comments  Part 2 will cover: Voting Rules. Public Prediction Simulation of Payouts   THE PROBLEM  Public opinion polling is in a crisis due to industry’s outdated methods used since the 1930s. In the last few decades, the percentage at which people participate in opinion polls has been dramatically declining and this negative trend is ongoing. With no innovations, it's only getting harder for researchers to reach out people and predict the public opinion as accurately as it should be.  THE SOLUTION  PR.network (PRN) creates a foundation for a new phenomenon – the Public Polling 2.0 –incentivized real-time polling based on the voting system fueled by Unique Digital Assets – ERC20 Tokens. The objective of Public Reputation Network is to use blockchain to revolutionize the way global communities predict and influence the public opinion using a fun and rewarding social media platform.  Public Reputation Network creates a unique blockchain based alternative to public polls and surveys. At PR.network participants do not reflect personal opinions but predict the collective opinion of the majority of people. The platform provides the general public with an independent and rewarding online review platform and lets the global community to participate in the process of shaping the general opinion about public entities, topics and affairs.  PRN Community members are incentivized to keep their predictions up-to-day every day. Each time a prediction is in line with the actual status, at the end of the day, all relevant members are rewarded from the pool of incorrect predictions. According to user’s desired maximum risk per day: 2% up to 100% of Digital Assets gets locked in the prediction pool for redistribution to winners. The loss can never go beyond limits, but rewards can go beyond or under the limit depending on the size and number of incorrect and correct predictions' value and quantity.  PR.network is currently in Beta. During this phase, only basic functionality is supported and only reputations of public entities can be monitored. Over time number of measured categories will grow and may include: products, services, events, shows, games, films, series, music and much more.  UNIQUE DIGITAL ASSETS (UDAs)  PR.network is fueled by 2 Balanced Binary Tokens: PR+ and PR- the Unique Digital Assets.  PR+ and PR- are digital cryptographic currencies with a capped supply of a total of 100 Million.  PR+ and PR- work in synergy to provide security, utility and entertainment through rewards and opportunities to create, hold or exchange Unique Digital Assets (Tokens) that measure the value of public entities and matters.  PR+ TOKEN is an essential asset in terms of usability at PR.network. It executes all requests sent to the network. 100 MLN supply of PR+ is released based on a predefined plan in the Smart Contract. PR+ is utilized as network’s security against spam and Sybil attacks. Users use PR+ to Vote, create PR Cards and PR- Card Tokens. PR+ is based on deflationary supply model in which 100 PR+ is destroyed each time a new PR- Card Tokens is created. Deflationary model ends after PR+ reaches 50 Million Units and no more PR Card tokens can be created.  PR- TOKEN broadcasts real-time capitalization value of all PR Card Tokens created by the community. PR- Card tokens are Unique Digital Assets with a supply of 100 Units per Token. Each PR- Card Tokens measures the total value of each PR Card based on the real-time market capitalization for PR Card Tokens.  Every PR Card owner can create unique PR Card Tokens for each PR Cards in the collection. Holders of PR Card’s Tokens can earn up to 100% of security fees paid by the community depending on the percentage of PR Card Tokens they hold. New Ethereum tokens are generated with a click of a button and automatically added to the internal UDA Exchange and to user’s account balances. Creators of Unique Tokens can hold or trade their tokens with other community members. For every new PR- Card Token generated 100 PR+ is destroyed.  TOKEN DEVELOPMENT PLAN  Until final Smart Contracts aren't released PR+ and PR- three tokens play an important role in the process: PRN, PRICO and PRAir: 12 MLN PRN + 44 MLN PRICO and + 44 MLN PRAir = 100 MLN PR+ Token  PRN TOKEN: - 12.000.000 Supply - PRN is used to perform Early Bird ICOs and Airdrops. PRN facilitates the early adopter’s programs, Community bounties and is used for beta testing the incentivized Public Opinion Predictions. As soon as PR+ and PR- tokens are defined and implemented, PRN will be swapped one to one with PR+. PRN is expected to be exchanged at the internal UDA exchange but there is no plan to pursuit PRN to be listed at external exchanges.  PRICO Token - 44.000.000 Supply – PRICO is used for the purposes of ICOs: PRE-ICO and ICOs. PRICO uses smart contract for ICO schedules and pricing. ICO is spread over 12 months. The highest price bonus is gradually decreasing to reach the official price in the last ICO. As soon as the smart contract for +PR and PR- is set up, PRICO Token will be swapped with PR+ one to one. PRICO is planned to be exchanged at the internal UDA exchange only, there is no plan to pursuit PRICO to be listed at external exchanges.  PRAir Token – 44.000.000 Supply is used for the purpose of future Airdrops. PRAir is a token allocated to the founders, the community and developers. Yearly release of the coin is capped to a maximum of 1 Million PR+ per beneficiary. PRAir token will be exchanged with PR+ one to one, but the release of PR+ will be capped by yearly limits. PRAir cannot to be traded at the internal or external exchanges.    TOKEN DISTRIBUTION PLAN  Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) PLAN: Half of all PR.network Tokens (50.000.000) is distributed through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).    6.000.000 of PRN is reserved for Early Birds Supporters and Adopters 3.000.000 is reserved to Early Bird Supporters - members who’ve been supporting the development of the platform since the beginning. 3.000.000 is reserved for Early-Bird Investors developers, partners and community members. Only signed up members with a minimum of 20 Balanced Votes can participate.    12.000.000 of PRICO is reserved for the Public PRE-ICO PRICO is planned to be distributed from the 7th till the 31st in December. All Ethereum holders can take part in the PRE-ICO to benefit the highest price bonus in the entire public coin offering period.    32.000.000 of PRICO is reserved for the Official ICOs 32MLN of PRICO is distributed every month starting January 7th 2018 through December 31th 2018. The price bonus decreases after every ICO. Unconsumed ICO QTY gets rolled to the next ICO with a lower price bonus. Except the last ICO in December 2018, when 10.000.000 of PR+ is released for offering, monthly only 2.000.000 if released in ICO.    AIRDROP PLAN  Half of all PR.network Token (50.000.000) is distributed through long-term Airdrops. 6 Million is released through PRN Token and 44 million thought PRAir. 3.000.000 of PRN Token is airdropped to the first 12.000 Early Bird Adopters, out of which 82% is allocated to the first 2000 community members. All Early Bird Adopters are entitled to 20% of the Airdrop after reaching a minimum of 20 Balanced Votes. To receive entire Airdrop 100 Balanced Votes is required.    3.000.000 of PRN is airdropped through the Bounty Programs to the Early Builders: Publishers, Voters, Bounty Experts, Web Designers, Solidity Devs, PHP Symfony devs, JavaScript devs, Copy-Writers, Technical Writers, Bloggers and Translators.    44.000.000 of Airdrop funds are distributed through Token PRAir. PRAir is designed to gradually release PR+ to Founders, Community and Developers. PRAir has a yearly release lock of 1.000.000 PR+ per beneficiary and a maximum of 3.000.000 per year for all three beneficiaries.    Founders Allocation is to help PRN founders to continue building more blockchain based solutions. Development programs will provide funds to support the development of the final decentralized version of PRN. Participation programs will support adoption and needs of growing community.",False

Indeed, it's been very quiet lately, we took some time off to enjoy the first vacation since 1.5 years... We are back to work from next week!  PR.Network is a big, international project, and everything takes a lot of time. Only when we the founders, get fully dedicated to the project of this size, things will start turning around much faster. All that you see now has been built in the free time (usually at night as all work full-time). Our dev team, designer, project manager, social media guys all work part-time too. It is our goal and a necessity to build the platform full-time with a dedicated team. This is why we need the ICO. However, in order to start the ICO, we need proper marketing resources and this is what we mainly work on currently - on the money piece.  We are about to hit 5000 Balanced Opinions, we have over 500 members. Some may say it's not many but as for an incentivized public polling network, that has not been promoted anywhere, it's a lot. In order to operate successfully, we need 1000 active members total. 1K will allow us to reduce the statistical error to less than 3%. Many public polling companies base their analysis on 200- 500 responders and they are still successful. In our case responders will be there always to get incentives and we will be proactively building a bigger and bigger network thru marketing expenses.  Talking about the ICO: below is our design for the ICO Landing Page. We wanted to keep in simple and clean. We have it already in the coded HTML version for PC's and mobile devices and now we'll work on the copywriting and the back-end implementation of visual elements. Let us know if there is something you would like to change or add. We will reward all great ideas for a copywriting with rewards.  https://invis.io/AHDJQCYXW#/250212293_LP-Ico  We will not publish it until we have collected our target amount for marketing.  After we'are back from vacation, we promise to provide at least 1-2 updates per week! There is quite a bunch of stuff we need to tell you guys about! If you have any questions let us know and we will reply asap.",False

We planned Pre-ICO for October, but we decided to give ourselves some more time. Our goal is to launch the Basic Predictions before the Pre-ICO. (We should have it ready by end of October) It's important as it can create a huge hype without marketing expenses. Basic Prediction will give early adopters opportunity to use the token before anyone else and test how the prototype works, we will also generate Airdrops directly on the website for all members with min 20 BV's.",False

PR.Network is built to become a public decentralized institution that will broadcast the public opinion using users' predictions. We will be visualizing the public trust so the public polls will no longer be in control of the public perception but the PRN Community! Our real-time platform will be marketed as a better and more accurate, incentivized alternative to the archaic public polling methods that fail big time lately!

Quote from: DISCMAN on September 02, 2017, 12:45:08 PM is this means that if you have no votes in your profile, you will not receive the airdrop? i made one account but did not have a vote on my profile.. Yes, It's not only about who managed to sign up first but also who actively builds the foundation for the project.  Quote from: s1 on September 04, 2017, 03:46:16 PM I have like 6 blank ones.  I mainly use an Android Tablet which does not do well with adding the image - why can't we just add an image from the web?   Instead, it wants a file from your device\PC.  Then, there is that warning that PR.NETWORK is not liable, which confuses me on my liability if I create a card.  Is there any liability? Ultimately, we will plan to pull all the photos from the web through API's. The liability part is to make sure members don't violate the dignity of any person. If there will be any issue due to copyrights we will simply take out the problematic avatars.  Quote from: 2fresh on September 09, 2017, 03:30:31 PM What's the total numbers of users we are at now?

It's also boring to look at prices of cryptocurrencies if we don't hold any. It's similar with PR.Network at this moment. It will all change drastically when we launched the token and each of your votes will become a prediction which will make you +2% or -2% every day depending on whether your predictions are accurate or not. This should make your overall experience much more fun too. We hope it will bring many to the site everyday just like it brings to coinmarketcap or to the exchanges. You will have many graphs, data, news and forum to discuss all the matters related to monitored ""Assets"" and platform.  1) PR.Network needs to be hate-free forever, and this can't be accomplished with discussions on the platform. We need to keep things simple to achieve the total decentralization at some point. There will be a forum that will be linked to every card. Every PR Card will have its own thread and members will have a chance to talk about related topics, put mems, troll, spread FUD, love, hate and many more.  2) We will launch the Bounty Program, User will be rewarded for helping us out to complete the tasks necessary for a successful ICO and platform development.",False

A lot of stuff keep us occupied and we’ve been extremely busy closing the priorities with as minimum delays as possible. Unfortunately, we can't avoid some delays. Today we would like to share only one critical news but there are many more yet to come.  As per the commitment - Today we’ve distributed the first Airdrop batch to all qualified PRN Early Bird Members that have attached the ETH address to PRN Accounts.  In order to see your Airdrop add a custom token to your wallet: Smart Contract Address: 0xf5056ed34e0c233f5a37b830533610a853296388. Name: PRN, Decimals: 18  To qualify in the 1st Airdrop distribution members were required to have at least 20 Balanced Votes.  During the review process we’ve found out the below: -    Out of 299 Early Bird Adopters: 113 didn’t have any balanced votes (BVs) This is primarily due to members have used (+) or (-) votes only, which the script cut at the end of the cycle due to the imbalance. -   186 members have a total at least 2 balanced Votes. -   Only 64 Members have a total at least 20 balanced Votes. -   Out of 64 members that qualified only 43 had Etherum Address attached.  See below for more details:     As initially communicated All Early Adopters are the foundation of the Public Reputation Network. Users from the 1st till 12.000th will be rewarded with PRN Token. (PRN Token will be swapped to a final token as soon as it's completed) The first levels of adopters will be rewarded with the highest Airdrop. There is actually a total of 70% of the EarlyBird Airdrop planned to be distributed the first 1200 founders.  If you've missed the allocation now, don't worry, because you will not lose it as long as you are a member who gets qualified at some point. (we will make a deadline though) E.g.: Lvl 1 Adopters who received only 1000 PRN today still can get the remaining 4000 PRN as long as they achieve 100 BVs. Unused Airdrop will be allocated to PRN Community donations. Note: Next allocations we happen after the ICO, directly at the PR.Network.    Please understand that in the next couple of weeks we will still not be making too much noise about the project but when the right moment comes you will be the first ones to know about it and soon after that we will launch the rocket that will revolutionize the public polling with our reliable, fun an incentivized blockchain based alternative!",False

PR Card holders will be rewarded depending on the number of PRN used to confirm the voting/prediction. There’ll be a little fee attached to every prediction made - 50% of which will go to the Card holder and another 50% for PR.Network development (after the decentralization PR.Network’s portion will go to community moderators)  2) You will earn 2% of PRN token from the pool of incorrect predictions pro rata with other winners if by the end of the day the reputation of the PR Card goes the way you predicted vs previous day but you will lose 2% if it goes the opposite way.  3) Votes count will only decrease in case vote cancelation. No one can influence your vote’s count except you.  4) There is a bug, which we didn't fix yet.  5) Become a Premium member, you get up to 12 votes per week, however, we suggest members wait until we launch the daily refresh of PR Points.    6) Our next big thing will be bounty programs that will be launched in the next couple of days.

How much a PR Card will earn fully depends on the PRN in the pool of incorrect predictions. If there is a balance between both side, the voters and the number of PRN allocated, it will be 2% per day for winners and -2% for the other side. That’s in the case of simple predictions that we will start with first, in case advanced predictions it will be more, however, the risk will be bigger too and those will be implemented at a later stage.  Well, most of the early bird adopters reserved the most interesting PR Cards, cards are Unique Digital Assets which can be sent, sold or exchanged. We don't know how much one will be able to offer for a card. The first Cards will definitely have bigger value than the cards created in the future.

The plugin will broadcast reputation trends for the monitored keyword and give publishers and bloggers insights about their influence on readers. We’ve been working on the design for the App already, however, we have stopped due to limited resources. We will continue working on it after the ICO.",False

Next “waves” of users will take part in the airdrop as well, however, the Airdop allocation will be becoming much smaller. Note: Users will be considered founding members until the 12.000th users.  Yes, we definitely need ICOs! Still a lot of money is needed for the development and to help PRN to become mainstream. For every Airdop QTY there will be an equal ICO Qty. So, basically, every ICO will depend on the Airdrop QTY, which depends on the number of community members, bounties, etc. ICOs are planned to be launched every quarter for the period of max. 12 years. After all PRN is distributed PRN will become fully decentralized managed by the community within our own blockchain application.  Note: Already 5% of every ICO Qty has been reserved by private investors to allow us to operate. Those investors will receive 5% from all ICOs. Agreements have been signed to prevent investors from selling more than 10% of their PRN per year.  Another 5% will be offered to community investors. If you are PRN community member and seriously think about our project, contact us for more information.

At this moment the API doesn’t support name filtering however it is expected to be live next month and PR.Network will be one of the first sites to use it! As soon as it is live your PR Cards will broadcast all the news from more than 70 different sources: check it out here: https://newsapi.org/sources  We are super excited, we hope you too!",False

Thank you, Freo for notifying the community.  We plan to switch into daily cycles after 2 months from the announcement to the Bitcoin Community. Let us explain why as it's critical for you early adopters to understand. Voting cycles are weekly and the number of PR Cards and PR Points is capper per cycle to give everyone equal chances to get PR Cards.  PR Cards are expected to become Unique Digital Assets with a real-time value attached to it, which will depend on the demand/supply ratio. in case every UDA's the Supply will always be capped to 0 or 1 per asset, depending on whether PR Card's holder is willing to sell it or not. The Demand is the number of PRN Token holders willing to own PR Cards. (the reasons for holding PR cards were discussed earlier)  This approach will have the impact on both: PR Card's price as well the Price of PRN Token - We called it a binary value creation.  Early adopters like you already have the advantage as the airdrop will be based on your registration time as well as the number votes you have given per cycles per the votes in the cycle.  Hope you understand now more how lucky you are to take part in this movement in such early stage. Enjoy your weekend guys, please expect some details in response, let our devs to spend some time with the most precious asset - the family.",False

We've continued to fix bugs, out of which the major ones were:  - ""you need at least 1 PR point notification"" couldn't be closed. - the script not deleting duplicated PR Cards and not informing about similar PR Cards in the network. - Issue due to the server RAM overload - Paypal API issue when purchasing a premium plan - No email verification during the registering thru social media - Twitter login gateway now up and running - fixed bugs caused by the change to the random PR Cards listing - Fixed drop-down issue due to not yet ready translations.  The status of this cycle's votes, new community members by country, gender looks as below:      Our community and the number of votes grows steadily!

Not only you may assign (+) or (-) votes to influence reputations of PR Cards. When you reach Experience Level 3 (14 votes - 7 BV's) you get the ability to influence PR Card's traits. Traits are positive adjectives listed on every PR Card. You may influence those by clicking a plus or a minus next to it. PR points are not required however, you may only assign traits to PR cards you voted for with a (+) or (-) PR Point.    Influencing Traits is very simple and powerful when you understand how to use it:  The sum of traits you assign must be in line with the general vote. However, if you've assigned a (+) vote to a PR Card, it doesn't mean you should not assign (-) traits to it. You should as there are no perfect entities, no matter how good reputation they have. You can assign many positive and negative traits as long as you keep an acceptable level of imbalance between positive and negative traits. Your maximum imbalance depends on your Experience Level.  e.g. Assuming you voted a (+) on a PR Card ""X"" and you are with the Experience Level 3. This means You can only give 3 positive traits however if you use a negative trait as well, your imbalance will decrease for 1, and you'll have the opportunity to give another positive trait.  Let us know if further explanation is needed.  The next step is to implement additional feedback system for voters: ""what's your relation with this Card"". There will be many different stakeholders voting on one card, it's critical for the public entities and the public to understand, who are PR Cards for voters: partners, competitors, employees, subordinates, superiors, customers, relatives, etc  Below the initial design of this feature. Note it will slightly be changed in the final version.",False

There was no plan for the undo vote feature – let us think about it, perhaps it could help. At this moment, there is “My Votes” screen where you can change or cancel your votes.  We’re glad you enjoy the experience so far. There will be much more fun with incentives and a Tinder-like App for mobile phones.  Great work, in the last cycle guys:    Congrats to all PR Card holders. Are we going to make PR Cards as successful as .com domains? The time will show, but that's the goal!",False

Please report them directly on the website, you should be seeing something like the below   Another option just send us email to: contact@pr.network  Whenever you reach a higher experience level, you get 2 bonus cards, 2 PR Points and 2 Ghost Points, To achieve Lvl 1:  you just need 2 (balanced) votes  Lvl: 2 - 4 votes (on top), Lvl 3 – 8 votes (on top), Lvl 4 – 16 (on top) votes, etc.  You can also get more PR Cards by helping us to reach out more people. Just use the: ""Invitations"" feature. Every time your email or facebook, twitter contact joins the community and does at least 1 balanced vote you'll get 1 Blank Card (capped to 8 Cards by week) after that you’ll be getting 2 PR points. When the PRN Token is finally live we will reward all the members that helped us to spread the good word by dedicating pro rata x PRN qty considering the number of referrals.

In the last few decades, the percentage at which people participate in opinion polls has been dramatically declining and this negative trend continues. With no innovations, it's only getting harder for researchers to reach out people and predict the public opinion as accurately as it should be.  THE SOLUTION  PR.network (PRN) creates a foundation for a new phenomenon – the Public Polling 2.0 –incentivized real-time polling based on the voting system fueled by Unique Digital Assets – Tokens. The objective of Public Reputation Network is to use blockchain to revolutionize the way global communities predict and influence the public opinion using a fun and rewarding social media platform.  PRN is an incentivized social influence network for communities to reflect and predict the public opinion about public people and organizations.  PRN serve the global community as the most reliable source of information about the public trust and values.  PRN is a platform for public entities to help them identify how to act and behave on a daily basis in order to survive in their public sphere.  PUBLIC REPUTATION NETWORK utilizes the Balanced Binary Voting. The latest voting model invented by PRN founders:  ""In the balanced binary voting overall sentiment of the society is always neutral. In every case, a balancing is necessary for every vote to count. In this model, voters are incentivized to vote on topics they do and do not feel strong sentiment about. When a voter expresses a positive opinion on a topic, the second balancing vote must be negative and vice versa.  Each voter casts first vote on the topic he/she may feel strongly about and balances the vote with the second opinion for another topic of their choice they may not have a strong feeling about.""

This process involves the development of a decentralized organization with its internal digital asset: XPR (capped 100 MLN Supply) XPR is the essential element of the platform as a whole. Token grants its holders the ability to earn incentives for correct predictions about the public opinion. Everyone holding XPR Token will have the ability to vote, create and hold unique PR Cards that represent and measure the public trust and value of all listed entities. XPR Token holders can collect PR Cards, buy them or sell them to others like unique digital assets. Holding PR CARDS will generate rewards for their holders as they will be entities to additional % from the card's losers pool.  Token Distribution: 100 MLN of Tokens will be 50% Airdropped and 50% ICO'ed.  PR.NETWORK is still in BETA - with Token Attached. Every PR Card created in BETA will belong to the PR card's creator after integration with the Block Chain is completed. Every vote cast will count in the Airdrop allocation. Use it and take the advantage as the early adopter.  We raise funds from private investors to envision the integration of PRN with the Block Chain. If you are interested in the project don't hesitate to PM us. We look forward to connecting with devs, potential partners, supporters or interested co-founders.

While we're working on the Patenting, Roadmap and the White Paper, can you guys provide any sort of thought you have on the e.g.:  - turning reputations of public entities into real-time tangible assets influenced by the global crowd. - any pros/cons of the Balanced Binary Voting model you have in mind. - www.pr.network beta service in general, landing, animation, U/I, design, you like it/ you hate it? - Building decentralised organisation for PR.Network, you understand what we want to/not really? - 50%/50% - AirDrop/ICO with yearly cap - pros/cons, your ideas, suggestions? - incentivising users for participating in voting, creating cards, staying active, any other ideas? - Collecting PR cards and trading them like unique digital assets (digital stamps, etc.) ok, not? - What is great and what is terrible about this project.",False

Here some highlight from this voting cycle:  New Votes:   New PR Cards and Stats:   New users are from the US, Australia, Marshall Islands, Indonesia, Malaysia and Poland We already have many PR Cards that represent public women, now we just need more women in the voting community!  If you still don't get the thing, it's really simple: All the PR cards belong to users that created them. There is only one Justin Bieber, Elon Musk, Putin or Tesla. (sorry already in the network) so you can hold unique PR cards of public entities not yet created. How many politicians, Sportsmen/women, musician or brands you know that are not on the Public Reputation Network yet?  We will turn all PR Cards (and later the Public Opinions) into Unique Digital Assets (UDA's) that aggregate real-time feedback about the public trust towards those entities. Cards and Opinions will generate rewards for their creators, users will be able to buy, sell, auction or give away cards like other digital assets. Why would people want to buy those cards? First of all, because they will generate incentives for their owners. Also, how many people you know that love to collect unique assets like stamps, printed cards, etc?",False

The platform is designed to serve diversed communities. Over time all those communities will shape one PRN community that will decide on how PRN's looks like, as well as how the PRN token is airdropped - for this purpose we will utilise the Balanced Binary Voting (BBV) approach.  There is 12.000.000 PRN Tokens (PRN). Every 12 months only 1 Million of PRN will be released. Each release will be based on the BBV approach. Total: 500K Airdrop/500K ICO's per year.  The first 12 months is counted as of the 07th of July 2017th. (3 years after the BBV has been invented) As we still work on the documentation we can only provide you with the guidance on how the PRN is planned to be allocated in the first Airdrop - Approximately 2 up to 3 months from now or after 10k community members reached.  Airdrop will be distributed to:  - Early adopters: The first x batch of verified users will get x qty of PRN. The second x batch of verified users will get x quantity of PRN-parameter, expect up to 12 batches. - Voter's allocation pool - pro rata allocation of PRN tokens based on the number of the balanced votes per given time frame/cycle. - Community Airdrops where the PRN community influences on how many and to whom the PRN Token gets distributed. - Each year only capped 1% of PRN token will be distributed to its founders. Total 12% of the total supply.  Edit: Refer to the major update with the details: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2009143.msg22387799#msg22387799",False
