There are ""a bit many"" buzzwords in your website/whitepaper, but as I'm a Post-scarcity-libertarian nerd, I'll follow and investigate your project (that doesn't necessarily mean I will invest in it).  Is Envienta related to the ""Open Source Ecology"" project started by Marcin Jakubowski? The goals seem to be very similar (and you mention it in you association name), but do you have organizational ties or share technology?  Another question: I find almost no independent information about the Envienta project (but that may be related to the mother tongue of the founders being probably Hungarian).

There is no magic here, but partners from different fields, connecting to our project with their deep expertise, since Envienta is more likely addressing possible integrations and synergies between these exponential fields. That is why we rely on open source, holistic approach to accelerate the integration process. Buzzwords have an interesting nature, think about it: after someone build a working and well scalable model and platform, like ENVIENTA do, and we're all starting to get used to these expressions on daily basis, these are not buzzwords any more.  Inspiration came from observing the same trends in the open source software market (Android, Linux, Ethereum, etc.) in the last 20 years, exactly the same will happen to open source hardware. During the planning phase around 2015, we found there is an existing project (Open Source Ecology) in the US with almost the same approach, focusing on mostly agricultural machines. We thought that would be great to collaborate soon, assuming that strategic partnerhips could move forward everyone. We contacted with Marcin Jakubowski, sending all the materials we had that time, including the White Paper, but there were no answer from OSE. Instead we were notified on the Collaborative Commons Economies Conference in Barcelona, that Open Source Ecology as a name has a trademark protection in the US, so we have to stop to use it. So we're not using these expressions any more, although it's a bit weird to protect expressions containing ""open source ecology"" by law. It's like making copyright on ""drinkable water"" as a brand name. Anyway, synchronicity works very well as we know, in the same time when OSE got familiar with Envienta's approach focusing on self-sustainable households they started the Open Building Institute project focusing on the same goals. So the answer is yes, that would be still great to collaborate and no, we're still not in collaboration, God knows why.  Yes, you're right, the hungarian language is an obstacle. As I used to say, we hungarians have to do everything twice and with double efforts to make something relevant to the world. Consider this, you grown up in a tiny country, where we were taught to speak russian, as the only foreign language that could be useful behind the great Berlin wall. Then suddenly you have to forget it, and learn english at least, because like the sunflower we turned to the west. The other thing is, that Envienta were created by hungarian expats living in the UK, Spain, Denmark, etc. We have no roots and lifelong friends in these countries, thus we have no connections to the media. Although I worked for the biggest media channel in Hungary, it's full with celebrities and reality shows, Envienta is not relevant from this point of view.  Anyway, yeah there are not so much media coverage about Envienta in the wordlwide big press, this project is only 2 years old, baby age. But it gets bigger soon.  You don't have to look for hungarian sources, here they are: http://recity.hu/fokusz/236-envienta-projekt-a-megosztasra-epulo-tarsadalomert http://startupper.hu/interju-envienta/ https://komlomedia.wordpress.com/2015/03/28/envienta-ekolucio-folyamatban/ http://varaljay.com/2015/03/envienta/ http://hu.alternativgazdasag.wikia.com/wiki/Envienta_Magyarorsz%C3%A1g https://tudatosfiatalok.com/paradigma/udvozlet-az-aranykorban/ http://www.programok-budapest.hu/muvelodesi-szint-muszi/envienta-a-kozossegi-jovo-a-tudasmegosztas-napjai http://amivilagunk11-12.blogspot.com.es/2017/10/envienta-kozossegi-jovo-konferencia.html http://mkh.valosag.net/index.php/temakoeroek/oenellatas/3579-envienta--ekolucio-folyamatban http://erdelyipolgar.blogspot.com.es/2015/04/az-eroforras-alapu-gazdasag-fele-az.html  For english sources use Google, I found this one that is relevant enough: https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Envienta",True

For now, you addressed my doubts well so I will continue to investigate. I like that you're taking a more ""mainstream"" approach than other, more nerdy projects in the OSHW sphere.  I assume you know that ICOs in cryptocurrencies have to be met with lots of skepticism, also in this forum. This is not your fault, but a general problem of ICOs - they attract scammers magically because it's so easy to set them up and then run away (For example, I was part of the NXT community - one of the first ICO platforms in 2014 - and lots of people lost their money there) ...",True

Talking with people about this - even if they are very happy to see Envienta as a game changer - it seems an impossible mission. The difference between them and us, that they are talking about it as a 200 years process at least, with linear thinking, we see this revolution is approaching with an exponential rate of speed. Just take a look on the trends, innovation is more likely come from startups and individuals these days. There is a shift also in organizational models.  I was interviewed 2 days ago here, and also talked about this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb9db-8NeXA  We've been working hard in the past two years on our project, that seems a very slow process for the outsiders who usually expected few products and services at least by this time. But considering the fact, that our aim is to take huge part of the social, economical and technological paradigm shift, we soon realized that we have to create frameworks and platforms instead of products and services - these would be the outcomes and not the goals.  If we are talking about platforms and frameworks, we have to concern not only R&D, software and hardware development, but the network of people, the specific and scalable organizational model that enables more and more people to collaborate by free will. So the past two years is about building our team from this network of experts. The organizational model is decentralized, evolutionary teal, which is a purpose driven organization. We put great emphasis on flat hierarchies and self-management technics at the same time, with greater responsibilities on a personal level. We are giving a human centered environemnt for our members and partners, letting them experience their wholeness through their activities. That is equivalent to the open source, holistic approach we working with from the beginning. We think that it is the source of our success, the root of everything we could achieve.""  Few words about the ICO's as we see. I think we have to listen Vitalik Buterin's attention, that 90% of ICO's will fail, because there is nothing behind a given project, only the coins, that created through the ICO. Without the coin 90% of the projects never had to be exist.  If you put real value behind the coin - physical infrastructure, means and resources, products and services and a thriving community itself - there is a good chance to keep the coin's value high enough to achieve a solid growth in the long term. Although we at ENVIENTA are not ICO experts, we are seeing the ICO as a tool and not the goal.  Buzzword alert! In addition we see blockchain technologies as the foundation of the value change in a healthy and secure IoT environment that will lead us to the resource based economy.",True

We're operating as a community controlled initiative with full transparency and as a registered non-profit organization in Spain and Hungary. THEORY OF EVERYTHING When things we produce and our homes become a mini-IoT infrastructure that connect communities across regions, the economic paradigm changes.  HOW DO WE GET THERE ?   II. TOKEN RELEASE AND IMPLEMENTATION  ENVIENTA is a bottom-up initiative that, thanks to the open source approach, can be a source of radical changes. Here we offer a stake by ENVIENTA ICO. The implementation is divided into four phases, depending on how many tokens will we be able to sell and how much capital can we collect.      PHASE 1 - ENVIENTA PROJECT CENTER | 1000 ETH (SOFT CAP)   Building the first project center on Canary Islands, Spain. Our investment plans are always adjusting to the local weather and environmental conditions, containing the easiest locally available and possibly recyclable materials, considering the available expertise and workforce to reduce the expenses. We're using the latest available technology during the constructions and focusing on the combination of accommodation, food supply and local production with a fully digital E-Manufactory. ENVIENTA ultimately provides cheap and well-designed living for individuals, families and communities as an IoT based alternative lifestyle of the near future.

Some of these courses and MOOCS are free of charge and available online thanks to the commons approach. Educating useful techniques to address local and global challenges, inspiring and empowering citizens, students, cultural workers, entrepreneurs, adult educators, facilitators of change, coaches and communities wanting to develop collaborative and participatory practices to empower social change and steward resources. ENVIENTA is committed to creating positive global impact through the millions of people who benefit from our ongoing programs and activities.

The goal here is to develop further and finalize our software platform. ENVIENTA is the first crowdfunding platform aims to speed up the collaborative open source product development, from ideas to prototypes, sales/distribution throughout their life cycle based on circular economy principles. Basically, open source hardware developments are the primary target area, but we also support the development of software and even new social and economic models (e.g. DAOs). Developing the ENVIENTA platform will serve as a kind of startup incubator and as an additional center of other open source hardware projects. The platform will provide collaborative services for the developers for free, will provide legal protection for open source projects and help bring demand and supply together Read More:https://medium.com/envienta-open-source-everything/platform-and-community-workplace-phase-3-6db462553a83   PHASE 4 - PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION | 3000 - 5000 ETH (HARD CAP)  Phase 4 is the implementation of decentralized production and distribution. This is the last step where ideas from the platform can become real, tangible products and we have to provide financial, marketing and manufacturing related analysis continuously to the open source hardware. As ENVIENTA will never have a huge development team, we certainly do not want to put production lines into service. Instead, we will create a kind of franchise system that will make it possible for anyone to become a manufacturer of ENVIENTA products, giving an endlessly scalable manufacturing capacity to all. To apply, several conditions must be met by that manufacturer. These will include support for open source projects as well as the support for ENVIENTA also. So you can build a lean business model around open source hardware.

TOKEN DISTRIBUTION AND SUMMARY Project Name: ENVIENTA Token Symbol: ENV Website: envienta.com  Whitepaper: http://envienta.com/downloads/envienta_alternative_lifestyle.pdf Soft Cap: 1,000 ETH Hard Cap: 5,000 ETH (ICO contributors own 47,4% of total token supply if hard cap is reached)    Maximum Market Cap at ICO: 12,000 ETH if Hard Cap is reached  Conversion Rate: 1 ETH = 100 ENV    Bonus Structure: 1 ETH = 100 ENV   100 ENV (ENVIENTA token) is worth 1 ETH. During the ICO token sale campaign, we highly value our first investors, thus we have defined the following bonus structure. The first milestone is reaching an investment of 1000 ETH (this is what we call a soft cap). This amount is enough to make the first phase of our project come true. In short, if you invest into the ENVIENTA ICO during the first phase of collecting 1000 ETH, for every token bought, the smart contract will credit you 1.3 times more in your ERC20 wallet.  Between 1000 and 2000 ETH the multiplier is 1.15, so for every ETH invested, instead of 100 ENV, the system will allocate 115 ENV to you.. During the campaign, 100 ENV (ENVIENTA token) is worth 1 ETH. + 30% bonus for contributors before reaching soft cap (1,000 ETH) + 15% bonus before reaching 2,000 ETH   Fund Raising Platform: KICKICO.com  (based on Ethereum)  Timeline: TBD  Token Distribution Rate: TBD    THE ENVIENTA TEAM     CONTACT:  Asociación ENVIENTA Open Source Ecología, C/ Lanzarote Duplex Eurovillas No. 15., San Fernando De Maspalomas, 35100 | San Bartolome De Tirajana, Spain  FOLLOW US  WEBSITE | BLOG | TWITTER | TELEGRAM | GITHUB | FACEBOOK | YOUTUBE | LINKEDIN",True
