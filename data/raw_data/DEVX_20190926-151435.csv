Quote  Developeo The future of software development and humanity is on the blockchain.  It is important to understand the macro trends such as the 4th Industrial Revolution. It’s not only blockchain that’s changing the world we live in. The bigger technological movement is driven by frontier technology such as Artificial Intelligence, Neural Networks & Machine Learning, Data Science, Internet of Things, Automation Systems and, of course, blockchain. And as their adoption is yet to peak, the demand for talented engineers increases exponentially, creating a serious market gap.  WHAT ARE THE BIG ISSUES IN THE MARKET? 1: The demand for talented engineers is ever-growing, proportional to adoption of technology driving the fourth-industrial revolution 2 Tech education is insufficient in emerging domains such as Machine Learning, Blockchain, Data Science and others 2 Next-gen jobs require a blend of industrial, digital expertise. Open-source Projects are growing in big numbers. Open-source has become the dominant software development method.  2: Talented engineers are quickly snapped up by “big tech” while opensource contributors are left unrewarded   Some useful information and a good point made above how they are rewarding github contributors, this is a good method to grow and expand and will see full benefit once the project is implemented and see full flow",False

At DEVELOPEO we have innovatively strategized a plan to construct an integral platform with an un-seen reward pool that will be beneficial and lucrative as a revenue model for investors and learners alike. The DEVELOPEO platform will be built to solve the emerging challenges for humanity that are arising daily with the eminent emergence of 'The Fourth Industrial Revolution'.  Devx Bootcamps (2018) and DEVX University (found. 2020-2021)  will be a pioneer in the studies of Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence Law, Artificial Intelligence Behaviour / Psychology, Full Stack Programming, Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Future Banking, Data Science, Cyber Security and Data Art.  These challenges are being witnessed in the daily implementations and continued developments of both the Open-Source & Commercial Software Development and of-course with the radical and incremental implementations of numerous emerging technological breakthroughs.  Our tokens will be utilised through our in built platforms in establishing high industry standard next-gen educational DEVX Boot-Camps and Certifications of Competence. These Boot-Camps(bootcamps are averaging 11,400usd per student) will provide the best quality learning environment and result in industry recognised Devx Certifications of Competence and Quality Assurance upon well earned and successful completion. This will also allow us to create and harness a marketplace for certified and qualified Developeo learners. We will continue and plan to become a pioneering force in the next few years within the educational and especially Learning industry as an internationally recognised brand for decades to come and by effectively preparing platforms and Boot-Camps with the aspiration of finally establishing a one a kind DEVX University.  OUR CORE AIMS ARE DESIGNED TO REWARD YOU - FOR OPEN SOURCE  DEVELOPEO is an innovative Blockchain start-up platform which aims to revolutionize the Open-Source ecosystem by introducing a token-based reward system with an integrated reward structure that can be held within and distributed via the DEVX TOKENS.  This rewarding system will be based on merits earned by the amount and quality of coding work produced and contributed by developers on github, coders and engineers that join our platform. These contributions align with our core aim to create and establish a large user-base that will effectively allow us to reward these contributions and to further outsource these talented individuals through our marketplace. Our rewarding structure has been flexibly designed to provide contributors with valuable tokens which can be instantly converted to fiat currency on any crypto exchange.  The work contributed and especially the codes provided by developers will be reviewed by and from within the DEVELOPEO community with Decentralized Voting System. DEVX have been sophisticatedly built on the Ethereum Blockchain, enabling talented engineers to get rewarded for their software code contributions through our innovatively developed and well executed smart contracts.  What we at DEVELOPEO want, suggest and recommend is that developers, coders and engineers  continue what they are doing and exactly in the way they are doing it. With one crucial beneficial exception just become members of our DEVELOPEO platform, marketplace and long-term ecosystem designed for them to receive meriting rewards in exchange for their hard earned contributions to any Open-Source project.   We gratefully embrace the Github and we are able to fully monitor their contributions through rewards which are distributed at the end of each month through a voting system we call ""Decentralized Voting System"" that is similar to Reddit.          INVESTOR VALUE AND REWARDS OF DEV TOKENS  The DEVELOPEO reward system is designed to simultaneously feed both DEVX and our user-base through the models we have strategized to establish.  Our economic model has been designed to and will accept traditional Fiat currencies and or DEVX tokens. The tokens also can be used directly by students, learners and users to make payments and appreciated by users discount when the payment is made with DEVX. In addition, there will be a 15% Boot-Camp discounts on payments with the DEV tokens itself.   The major advantage in applying this in each of our business models is that a great demand is created in the market for DEVX Token and that we can ensure that our take-back is naturally free.  Each step of our economic model is designed in a way that will make everyone in the community happy and current models in the ecosystem all feed on each other, creating demand while also feeding everybody.  In the Boot-Camps, Certification of Competence and NEXT-GEN University issues such as Artificial Intelligence, AI Law, AI Psychology / Behaviour, Blockchain, Fullstack Coding, Data Science, Data Art, VR  Data Analysis, CyberSecurity, Future Banking will be the focus of learning, training and overall development .  The purpose of DEVELOPEO Boot-Camp is to raise highly knowledgeable professionals fully adapt to future, combining their profession with extreme digital expertise who are well informed and have the best skill sets to handle and become innovative within the latest technological innovations.    The most acknowledgeable reason as to why the Boot-Camp industry has grown and developed is that the current University systems are unable to raise such practical, high quality and specialised people. The Boot-Camp industry is growing so fast and are very expensive. We by-pass these additional costs for users to join our Boot-Camps because our we cover the human resource needs through AI and in other technologies.    DEVX NEXT Blockchain   Also we are planning to create our very own blockchain next year(currently erc20), because we believe if future wants to use ""smart contracts"" as today's legal contracts, it needs to be easy and easily understandle, by everyone. Everyone.  We will create a new smart contract system for our admissions system and also will share this anybody wants to use it.  Secondly and best part, we are creating our own blockchain totally adapted to Future Banking. PSD2 Banking and API Banking will be the future starting from 2018 and we will create One-Click-Student-Loans for our platforms, so they can get their Student Loans(either in Fiat or DEVX Tokens) with just one click without going to any bank but using their own bank still and can start the bootcamp programs or join the university instantly after their admissions are approved.  ------  They can earn by:  Rewards - by contributing on opensource projects. (Our Reward pool starts with 60,000,000 tokens and increasing with every revenue and token price.) Bootcamps - they can earn by teaching/helping in our bootcamps and other programs. Exchange Markets - they can exchange the DEVX.  They can spend by:  Paying Bootcamps - DEVX token accepted with extra discount. Bootcamps are currently averaging 11,400-13,000 usd per student in the world. University Admissions - DEVX token will be accepted in our University Admissions, again with discount.
