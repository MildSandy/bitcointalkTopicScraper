Give your wallet a new name, any name will do  Press enter again and you will be prompted for a password. Give your wallet a new and long password  Press enter again you will be prompted to repeat the password  Press enter again and you will be prompted for the 25 word electrum style mnemonic seed that you retrieved earlier  You will then be prompted with ""Restore from specific blockchain height (optional, default 0):"" Default will start the restore process from the beginning of the electroneum blockchain. If you don't know the specific blockchain height, just hit enter. (Specifying a specific blockchain height will start the restore process from that specific height. This will save a bit of time in scanning, if you know what starting blockchain height your initial funds were transacted for this specific account.)  After you have entered the 25 word mnemonic seed and have chosen your specific blockchain height, electroneum-wallet-cli will generate the same public address and view key as your old wallet and begin the refresh process automatically. (Please be patient as the refresh process may take a while.)  if this has helped in any way in recovering you coins please send alittle my way .. pm for donation address  BUMP ^^  use this to import your paper wallet  electroneum-wallet-cli --generate-from-keys WALLET  - where WALLET is you new walletfilename - you will be prompted for your keys",False

You can't just say something as if it is fact without posting the proof to go with it. Show me the evidence and I would be happy to accept that as a possibility, without evidence it is baseless FUD. I am pretty sure they would come clean about something that huge, it would also not be a reason to hold back on giving ICO investors their coins (yes coins, not tokens). It has nothing to do with it, at all. They would not need to hire a security team for that reason. It would be ETH that was lost, not ETN which is being mined right now and secure in the blockchain. It would be funding for marketing/fees/costs etc that would be lost if that was the case.  I don't even know why I check in here. It is frustrating to read so many ill informed posts and wild speculation. I will stick to the official news channels such as Facebook, until it is launched successfully and the product is in the wild. Then I will be back, because by then most of you will be gone and we can hopefully have more interesting and fact based conversation.

All 5 billion ICO coins were counted as in circulation, which is not true (as they are still locked by the dev team) so electroneum got a way too high market cap than they actually have.

So someone (actually, me ) contacted coinmarketcap to let them know that their numbers are wrong. Of course the ranking 1000+ is too low, but that will change when they update the circulating supply to the correct numbers (all the mined coins).  Also, having wrong market cap/ranking on cmc gives the dev team incentive to delay the launch, since they can then take advantage of a inflated ranking for longer time (the price will probably drop when they actually release the ICO coins). So I think that it is a good thing that cmc has fixed this now.",False

I believe this will be a good project in the long term, they are marketing geniuses and have attracted many non crypto minded people into it. Having a away to get coins (free money) on a mobile phone will surely attract the masses.  Quote from: metallicelmo on November 16, 2017, 09:46:28 PM So this also proves that you need to read the technical specs of a coin. It looks like 90% of people didn't know the mobile mining is an experience app and not actual mining. This has been described in the technical whitepaper from the beginning although they were advertising with it to attract large number of people.  I knew this from day one, and still invested a little just because this coin will get massive attention  In a way that is better than actual mining. Real mining would not yield a great deal of coins on a low powered mobile device but would totally kill the battery and slow the phone down too much to use for every day tasks. I think it is a clever way of doing it, at the end of the day...mined or simulated, you still get the coins.",False

I thought you were suggesting that people lost all their money by buying into a bad project. There is a real good chance of seeing tidy profits in the future even for ICO investors. Saying that, you will likely be able to get more coins after the initial dumping than we could get during the ICO for the same money. At least early on. I agree that it is wise to wait, but this project had some unprecedented success during the ICO. The crypto world is relatively small, but Electroneum seemingly managed to attract people from the outside that know nothing about cryptocurrency at all. The number of people that registered was something like 10% of the entire Bitcoin userbase. That is quite impressive.  So I think people getting in early on the hype for this one is not quite the same. The FOMO was maybe to be expected. Also, I don't invest for early profit. I invested because I wanted to support the tech and because I liked what I read about it. I wanted Electroneum to have the funds to make it a potential future success story, I don't just think with my pocket. I only invest in things I am interested in. Technology being a big one.",False

Electronium is meant to be a coin for future mass market adoption. They obviously intended it to be closer to the dollar one day rather than have a bunch of 000000 in the transaction amounts, making it easy for the average Joe who knows nothing about Crypto. That is why Bitcoin will never be popular outside of the small crypto world, it is hard to get hold of, hard for average non tech people to understand and not at all easy to use. I doubt ETN will ever go as high as Monero and it does not need to. With the right purpose and potential mass adoption, Electroneum could be extremely successful in the future. The success of the ICO and volume on a single small exchange...even with a problematic launch proves that demand is there, once it gets going I believe it will do well.  Saying that, Monero does actually have an unlimited supply. It is 18 Million but after that there will be 158,000 XMR created every year forever. There is a difference though lol.",False

The attacks began happening before the early close of the ICO, at about $30million raised. At this point they should have been working their asses off to correct the issue for a successful launch. I'm sure the reason the attacks occurred was because they bragged about it being secure, however I had to enter an email address and password for signup, no confirmation or anything required. Many accounts have been noted as multiples, which means the number of registered users could be highly inaccurate and may not have the most registered users in ICO history; and we may never know the real numbers.  Now I agree that hiring hacker one is a good move...if they actually hired them....wouldn't mind seeing an official statement from hacker one that they are working with Electroneum.  I personally feel that all trading with ETN should be suspended until the issues are resolved, as currently the only people that are able to sell their tokens are miners, or people that bought on the exchange. This has resulted in a lot of the community gaining a distrust for the devs and ETN. The result will be a dump on the market if & when the ICO coins are released. Furthermore how many newbies to crypto will be scared away by this course of events. Poor communication by the team, lack of viable information when communications are released, and too many delays. The longer it is the less confidence new users will have in cryptocurrencies.  Honestly this could have been handled much more effectively, but now so many investors feel screwed over, and this will likely turn out to be good only for miners.",False

This is what I think:  The ICO generated 4 billion coins, on the exchange I only see millions of coins trading, those that are mined. At this moment the coin is worth 450 satoshi or about 3 dollarcents. They will probably wait until the value is under 100 satoshi or so to avoid people selling the coins they got for 1 dollarcent each (or 0.5 dollarcent in the beginning) and rendering the coin worhtless.  This is extra support for my opinion: if you have over 40 million dollars and tens of people on the payroll it doesn't take that long to fix this thing.

DO NOT QUOTE MY POST AND ANSWER FOR THESE QUESTIONS IF YOU ARE NOT DEV OF ELECTRONEUM.  Thanks!  Hi!  1. Actually the ICO is only a max of 5.98 billion as the 6 billion pre-mine for the ICO AND bounty campaign (20 million ETN). 2. There will be 15 BILLION coins left for miners [EDIT - OOOPS! I entered million instead of billion - just to keep you on your toes!] 3. It's a similar emission algorithm to bitcoin, in that the emission slows over time, with ours slowing with each block. It will be 10 years+ before needing a fork or algo change.  I'm sorry I've not been very active here - as a few others have posted I'm on Telegram nearly all the times, so it's a better place to get an answer.

But why allow miners to continue to milk the token for quick gains? Trading should be halted to protect the price. The only people winning here are the miners, and they are taking full advantage of the opportunity. If trading was halted when the team became aware of this problem, the price would be much higher, and everyone involved would be winning.  I appreciate the work they are doing to make things secure, but this is by no means fair trading at this point—when miners continue to milk the token for profits while investors helplessly sit back and watch the price continue to fall.

It will mean nothing to the Electronium developers, their only concern is the technology they are working on not the profit we could make.  There will be a dump, it's normal after an ICO but Electroneum is doing much better than most ICOs I have seen enter the exchanges. The volume for one single small/medium sized exchange was insane and it was obviously in great demand. Let them dump, it's a great opportunity to get some coins for cheap. The price will hopefully naturally rise in due course and make us all a good profit later down the line.  Once we have more exchanges, the product is out and the Bitcoin fork is over with we should see good times ahead. Hopefully 2018 will be a good year for Electroneum.",False

Github: https://github.com/monero-project/monero/compare/master...electroneum:master If you know github you can see the project was forked on the 31st of October and then 5 commits later, released. Commits on Oct 31, 2017   Electroneum * Forked Monero  …  electroneumRepo -Updated Seed Servers -Delete CONTRIBUTING.md -Delete icon.png -Add files via upload -Update README.md  These are the exact changes from the actual Monero github. Now you don't actually have to know any blockchain technology to do what was done here. It blows the mind that it was done 31st of Oct, a day before release.  Mobile app: Does not mine, cannot mine, or will not mine.  It is possible to mine on an android. As they will allow app which mine on a cellular phone on their app store, technically its possible. You do not want to mine on your cell phone as it will be almost unresponsive and your battery wont last very long. As for iOS. You will never get a miner on the iOS App Store. In fact if you somehow did, it would be shutdown the moment the app is in the background. As for only navigation and VoIP have background rights.  Next thing that was brought up. The app does not actually mine, it just gives the illusion that its mining. Ok.. cool yeah The mobile miners bring the utility of viral marketing to Electroneum and are awarded with a number (smaller) of Electroneum coins for doing so. So if its my understanding, the 'mobile miners' arent miners. They are marketeers which are rewarded Electroneum coins for doing so? This is the ""we call it the Mobile Mining Experience.""?  The mobile mining experience does not download a copy of the blockchain or carry out intensive CPU operations to provide egalitarian proof of work, it is intended to give entry level access to a cryptocurrency by allowing the experience of mining (i.e. being issued a hash rate reflective of the CPU processing power of the device and being awarded coins for participating in the experience). The Mobile mining experience does not directly add blocks to the blockchain and thus it does not overheat the mobile device or use precious bandwidth. The CPU of the device is periodically queried to ensure the simulated hashrate is correctly balanced with the other running processes and it gives the user a very realistic mining experience, including accurately issuing Electroneum coin rewards  So lets break this Electroneum down.  1. There is no mobile mining. 2. This is just a direct monero fork with lack of technical background of doing any actual improvements or anything to support mobile miners. 3. They have technical problems which are now turning into scam problems. 4. They are holding up the price by purchasing ETN tokens themselves on Cryptopia. 5. The team is comprised of Retortal (retortal.com) white label Social Media Management service Reviews, Ratings, Public Info, and Contact Info.

I didn't even take the time to go this far because like I said, I am not gonna be part of that scamming game.  Now suddenly even if the app still doesn't work, they found a way to make (new)users register with a payment method before letting you access the app. That's the new game Big Brother has come up with, we'll take 1eu to verify your ID, and if you don't like their services you will not get your money back, it's only 1 who's gonna complain??  All those people downloading the app and getting ""a few cent's from their accounts in order to ""verify"" their ID for an app that's not even online is not the way to go if you ask me, they have others problems to solve.  Instead of updating the logging methods for potential new users in order to sit in their pockets, they should be trying to give access to the tokens of those who invested in their project. But what are doing instead?? Collecting more!  And IMHO, that's the reason why not only cryptos have such a name or that our monetary system is broken. The rich are running to lose weight while the poor is running for food... And people like you and me, thinking that we are too little to make a difference, we see this game in front of our eyes and instead of fighting it, we prefer to participate. Or  we choose to eat the forbidden fruit and sell our soul to the dark for ""money"", which in fact is only a piece of a paper, and in the best case scenario, we look the other way around...  I am not gonna play those games, this is link to another topic ""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1565038.new#new"", where I'm having a chat with Litebit.eu after they kidnapped my money 4 days ago in order to make verify my bank account...",False

I would agree that Electroneum needs to do a bit of cleaning in their code/app in the following days. Nonetheless, I am kinda happy that the app is not 100% live before the FORK. If around fork times (block-wise for BTC) they announce good stuuf and clean their shit, it could be a perfect storm for an ETN pump.  In the end, I do not really look at the daily evolution and all the fud. I put a bit in ETN, not enough to become rich even if the coin reaches $50 (lol... NE-VER), bt I'll play long with them, because their project is about mass adoption, and that takes time. All the miner-tech-app shit is short term adjustments and noob/fomo discussions.

For some, it is needed to recreate the wallet as a non-deterministic wallet to see their balance .  You can do direct mining with 'start_mining' but my guess is that it is not viable with the current network hashrate and a pool is better  If you are interested in the safe option, use the offline wallet instead (https://downloads.electroneum.com/)  I think they will release the ICO coins in the next couple of days.",False

But... As for the NUMBERS, they speak by themselves, and here's my vision:  A- SUPPLY 1- XRP has 38 BILLION coins circulating and a max supply of 100 Billion (will be mined/released over time) 2- ETN has 5 Billion circulating and a max supply of 21 Billion (5x less than XRP). As for XRP, the max supply will be mined overtime.  B- VALUE Let's speak about marketcap. XRP is a $7.8Billion juggernaut. Overpriced imho, and most of the experts I know do not consider it as a good investment as it may keep is value at best. My take: XRP tries to sell something to their own worst enemy: banks. At best they manage to do something and the coin goes x2... at worst Banks try to kill them (no wonder they went from banking solutions to interbank payments solutions and now deal with the country feds) That said... let's speak about ETN.  When ALL the coins will be mined, ETN may be a juggernaut weighting $20Billion, maybe 5x more as we speak about something that may happen in 3-5 or even 10 years. We could see $1 per token, but it's gonna be in a long time (and $1 may not be worth a lot LOL)... It's not interesting talking about that now.  What matters is the market valuation TODAY... or in a few months at least:  My take: I hear that ETN could be the new NEO for Europe. It's a different coin, NEO does spart contracts and is very specific generating GAS etc...  Imho, ETN is to be compared to OMG Existing company, crypto-for-the-masses. OMG is in SE Asia and ETN in the UK/Europe. Comparable economies in size and diversity (albeit EU has more stable and simple regulations) As a result, as I believe OMG can reach $1.2 Billion again (post BTC shitforks), I also do believe that ETN can reach $1.2 Billion in market cap. I even believe that ETN may reach a slightly higher figure, probably $2Billion, and sooner than OMG. Simply because the EU market is more open than SE Asia, and has less competition from China and Japan. ETN is on a green field. Moreover, their pseudo-mobile mining system, even if not 100% real mobile mining, is a great way to general mass acceptance. And this is very smart.  C- Price per TOKEN  Let's table on 6Billion coins for the calculations (a crazy round up to the current 5 Billion to talk into account some mining... it kills sterile discussions in the egg regarding the number of coins that can be generated in months...) Let's imagine $1.2 Billion market cap for ETN, post fork, after a couple announcements and some partnerships to some  --> $0.2 per coin is the right figure imho. It's the support number for me.  Optimistically, I do believe that, with some hype, and especially a lower circ. supply than 6Bill, ETN can be traded for around $0.25 to $0.30 in the future.   That's for figures guys. Happy to talk, but bring solid figures please.",False

In my opinion, this project should be rejected by the community. It's unacceptable what they have done, locking people out of their account while ""miners"" are crashing the price.  I think it's just them cashing out some millions and filling up their pockets. Why would they mine 100% more than what they said they would, block users from their account, sell the coins before investors can access their coins, not deliver the mined coins, and afterward coming up with ""We got hacked""...  When it's not ""The fork"" fault, it's the fault of ""The Chinese"", or the, ""We got hacked"" crap that those people are selling us. If you ask me, this community needs to take action against those type of scams, China already banned it, it will be no time before others start to so as well which will eventually scare away lots of potential future investors...  I prefer to lose some money than to keep helping scammers reach their goal. It's not our fault that we all got raped, but as a decent human being, it's our task to prevent others to live the same experience as we did and find a solution against all those crappy ICO's.

NEO has significant new interesting block chain/smart contract technology. ETN has none.

However, this coin seems to be entirely focused on marketing and getting a large number of users.

Reposting what he deleted...  Contraband: I wont delete your response to hide the post you responded to because I deleted, as my intention is not to ""hide"" posts.  Contraband:The post is just so ridiculous. I didnt want to go through one at a time and respond to the barrage of questions that were just pure FUD in my opinion. The devs are not scammers. So for transparency I leave it here so you can read it if you really want to, but believe me, dont waste your time and just move along.  Me: Is it though? First of all I mentioned I was speculating, and given the fact 10,000+ miners haven't received a single ETN token from the official mining pools in over 48 hours is bloody odd and should be addressed ASAP.  Also given the fact people spent money on this ICO and are stuck unable to withdraw their funds is unacceptable, as miners who don't have any ties to this project are mining it and making the most profit. Whether or not the dev team has been dealing with a hack, or more likely scenario, they don't have the ETN to send to the ICO holders yet, or even worse they lost their pre-mine somehow, might sound crazy but I have every right to speak my mind and speculate especially after such a shady and unprofessional launch.  What's ridiculous is you censoring this thread, my post and others who are just airing their thoughts and ideas. I'm not trying to spread fud, but it's hard NOT to speculate when a 40million ICO disappears from the world then pretends to be in talks with ""Amazon"" which is bullshit and add to the madness has mining pools that are stuck and not working.

It's a temporary problem, a couple of days of delay is nothing compared to the long term plan. However there are two concerns about the price of Electroneum for both the short and long term:  1-Short term: currently, the supply and demand put the price between 5 cents and 10 cents, while this is the total demand at the moment, meaning ANYONE who wants to by Electroneum can do so right now, but this is not the total supply, this is just a small percentage from mining that is on offer, Once the ICO tokens are released the supply will increase by at least 100 fold, while the demand is still the same, and the rules of supply and demand simply mean that the price will crash hard.  2-Long term: You might say, it's ok if it crashes now, it will recover long term. But think about this, the exact moment of token release will be followed by the mining app, while it's a great marketing strategy, it will greatly increase the supply even further, on daily basis, and the more people are using the app (which they would of course, it's free money), the more ETN will enter the market on daily basis. Those tokens are even more than the ones sold during the ICO. So a downward spiral is possible still!",False

I hope I am reading that wrong  10.26 billion premined!!!! this is far more than what they said is 6 billion! cheers!  That was before when they expected around 10k users. Not over 300k. There is not enough coins for the mining app pool. Those coins will be necessary! So many noobs and FUD in here lol. Leaving until you all find something else to move on to. Wow.  Good luck with the project devs, I will be supporting and holding my coins for the future. Hope all the teething problems are sorted out soon.     This is correct.  Its 12.6 billion coins  4.4 Billion to investors  That leaves 8.2 Billion for mobile miners, which is perfectly fine.  Wow, you guys just dont stop, lol. This was the plan all along. How did you expect the mobile miners to get coins??  show me the new announcement from dev-team then idoit!!! this alone is enought for a very big red flag!!    I am the Community Manager for Electroneum. There is no announcement necessary. This was what they said would happen all along.   If you are confused, I will help you, but my guess is you are just trying to spread confusion, as you have been doing for months on this thread.  You can raise your Red Flag, but other than a few other trolls, I dont think anyone will fall for your FUD  people who are investing on this ico were invest under the terms of 6 billion coins will be premined,dev team don't have the right to change the original terms bc it will invade the right of the investers!i forseen this coin will be flag as a very very big red flag and will be deny to be listed on many well known exchange,the most worse case scenario would be  public law suit and these ico will treating as a scam project by the regulation agents!!  and you contraband as the ETN manager you will also a criminal due to the role as a colaborator with this scam...cheers!  btw..where is your lovely dev-team who is/are qualify to speak here and backed you up?

Quote from: electroneum on September 11, 2017, 04:01:13 PM Quote from: vanillagalaxy on September 11, 2017, 02:45:05 PM @dev: 1. how many coins would your team going to premine despite of 6.3 billion ICO? 2. how many coins will left to miners(cellphone,cpu,gpu etc) to mine? 3. how long the mining could proceed(years)?   the questions above only valid to dev team to answer.  DO NOT QUOTE MY POST AND ANSWER FOR THESE QUESTIONS IF YOU ARE NOT DEV OF ELECTRONEUM.  Thanks!  Hi!  1. Actually the ICO is only a max of 5.98 billion as the 6 billion pre-mine for the ICO AND bounty campaign (20 million ETN). 2. There will be 15 BILLION coins left for miners [EDIT - OOOPS! I entered million instead of billion - just to keep you on your toes!] 3. It's a similar emission algorithm to bitcoin, in that the emission slows over time, with ours slowing with each block. It will be 10 years+ before needing a fork or algo change.  I'm sorry I've not been very active here - as a few others have posted I'm on Telegram nearly all the times, so it's a better place to get an answer.  Please read the Technical Whitepaper for more details on emission and mobile emission. You'll find it here: http://electroneum.com/technical-white-paper.pdf   have a great day!

As for alt coins, you ask 1000 different people which is the best to invest in an you will get 1000 different answers, aside from personal bias towards a project you have varying levels of risk and potential reward, you really just need to do your homework and decide for yourself.  But before you enter into the space make sure you are intimately fimiliar with the terms ""FUD"" and ""pump and dump"", you will encounter them alot  IMO this project has a lot of potential, a lot of the s*** slinging is from people who just wanted to turn a quick profit by dumping their ICO as soon as they could but one of the other ones I would suggest looking at (on top of Bitcoin of course) would be Zencash. The are tons of others out there with potential but make sure you do your own homework before investing and dont just take someone elses recommendation on face value.  The markets still young and there is a lot of volitility so if you are just looking to get your toes wet I would start with Bitcoin and go from there.",False

Someone told me about bitcoin way back when they first came out and ignored it. Few days ago read a forum where passive income was discussed and many people were talking about mining and trading altcoin. I had no idea what the altcoin was. Anyway, I started reading about it and realized that there are over 1000s altcoins now. WOW!  Been reading a lot lately in past week and came to conclusion that the bitcoin train has passed, and I should invest in some new coin that is in market recently and hope for the best.  Question from noob here. Is this a good coin to purchase? from reading this forum, it seemed like it is but at the same time getting the feeling in last few pages that it is not.  Also, should I be mining this coin or it is too hard now. I have a old gaming PC with AMD R9 280x. Most of the coins that I investigated suggests it is not profitable on that card and I should instead mine on nicehash. Tried Nicehash for two days and got about $2 worth of shares and need to keep it running for over a week to get the lowest payout threshold.   ",False

After that we will be able to sell our ETN as investors.

One day you go to get your fix, and they are sold out. You come back when the delivery guy is there, and you see them stocking more of the other flavor which has only a couple bottles missing but they aren't stocking the product that sold out. This goes on for a few months of the fast selling product being stocked every few shipments while the non selling flavor begins to build a backstock, and then one day the fast selling flavor no longer has a shelf spot and is no longer being stocked.  For the record this is a true story...I talked to the owners of the gas station, I consulted with the delivery guy, and I reached out to Snapple, and no one had an answer as to why that product wasn't being stocked or why it had been removed from the shelf.

Totally unfair to those who really believed in the concept and invested a lot of money.  Has nothing to do with miners and everything to do with the company that chose to handle it in such a fashion. I mine as well although I didn't mine ETN since I bought a shit ton of it.  I never would have guessed in a million years this would happen.  I'm in it for the long run.  That being said I would have liked to have had the option to sell a small portion if I wanted to.  Having the investors take a back seat was a really bad decision on the developers part. I am sure most investors that put 40 MILLION DOLLARS into their pockets feel a little or a lot betrayed.  Me personally I can afford to lose every penny I put in. Doesn't mean it isn't totally unfair and pisses me off.,False

To those curious or new to the game: - Yes, the price of ETN will drop significantly on wallet release. That's what happens when ICO buyers are able to sell at more than what they paid. A profit can be realised instantly by short-term investors (and miners). The price will dip below ICO level. Expect this to occur. - Once the price has dipped, and is listed on more exchanges, buy orders for the coin will increase significantly. Long-term players looking to hold for the future will buy then. I (personally) have faith the coin will prosper due to its current popularity and large userbase. I will be purchasing more coin at this stage. - What happens after this point is a mystery to all of us.

The results is the big drop from the starting price (It's understandable) 2 - Let's consider the price going down to 0.005 - We would get a LOT of buyers at this price, which will make the chart rise again, right? Because most of the buyers and ICO investors bought at 0.01... I doub't there will be a big sell orders in less than this ICO price. 3 - If the price went down to 0.01 or 0.005, there will be not a worth price for miners nor ICO investors to open a lot of sell orders due the low price.  So... Let's wait for all the miners sell their coins, make their profits, wait for the big dump after people sell all their bonuses coins and we will get the real market value. Plus, there are a big number of investors waiting for this dump, so they can buy at low prices.  If I am wrong, correct me with valid arguments.  Thank you",False

And to everyone I just want to say there is no way this coin is a scam if so there was no reason for the team to continue forward. If anything, there are a bit inexperienced which is being shown by the launch. But that shouldnt be a surprise to any of us since we all knew what we were getting into. None of our perspectives towarda the company or the coin should change because of the launch. And also, people who have been crying about missing out on .11/coin, the only reason the coin is .11 right now is because of the delayed wallet. If the wallet launched at the right time, it wont even get to .11 to begin with. So it makes no difference. Nothing so far has changed my views or plans about the coin.

Once the coin is on the market, and the team is working on it, and the project is interesting, ONLY then you may invest big money. Example personally i would not invest in electroneum ico 20.000$....cause is new and fragile but i would for sure invest that money in a more robust project like ethereum bitcoin litecoin and so on... So the more strong is the coin and the project, the more money attracts.... Also listing on the exchanges is not only a matter of trade, but also visibility. The more exchanges, the more people see it, and the more are willing to invest. Example... I dont use Kraken. If an ico that i missed is lunching on kraken, i might miss the initial phase....But when it comes to poloniex(a exchange that i use) i then see it, read about it, and invest....

Things got out of hand in this thread , and i ""blame"" the community management team. Dont get me wrong guys. I blame you because you were too soft with the trolls, too polite. Too civil to 3-4 only people that made an orchestrated attempt to harm the coin and the community itself.  This is the one and only ""fault"" , which is not entirelly theirs if we want to be fair since everything regarding social media/community management is approved by the management and follow specific guidelines AFAIK.  But some things should have been avoided , in order to keep all things in order and prevent mass hysteria and FUD adoption.   I am watching the thread from the very beginning , the professional trolls were using their unethical ways preparing the ground and started delivering mild hits a couple of hours prior to the official blockchain going live.  For example , if you go back few dozen pages on 31/10/2017 minutes before midnight the Fracas-whatshisname troll was ""Accusing"" the company of being deliberately one hour late to the launch... ( which even if was true , SO WHAT?!? It was the blockchain going live NOT the listings!! )  The truth is that there was never a delay in the launch , but the troll was - or wanted us to believe that he was - in another TIME ZONE , FOR CHRIST SHAKE!! I live in eastern Europe and the Blockchain was live at UK time 00:00' 05'' , my time 02:00' 05"" !! So someone must be really stupid , ignorant or just a paid troll  to even imply of such a thing.  Later on, the same troll , along most probably with his  fellow colleagues ( numerous new registered accounts and other known scammers ) started an orchestrated attack , using false accusations and FUD methods aiming primarilly to the new crypto users, those who just entered the market,  who dont know for example how mining is working in relation to the algorithm difficulty nor how a simple command prompt in a wallet application is written in order to make a transfer or start to mine etc. They are not tech savvy, so they were proven to be a  rather easy ""target"" once all these issues arouse.  The official site was down a few times, due to the number of requests to the server. This happens all the time even in major news sites guys , even Facebook goes down sometimes! It is not somebodys fault , it just happens due to high traffic and limited bandwidth. Pools too , same thing.  Every single thing that went wrong had nothing to do with the Electroneum team. Even the mobile wallet's delay was caused because it of the hacking for christs sake. These things happen, we live in dangerous times and that is the risk we all take by being part of the Crypto market. You can win and lose everything in a fraction of a second.   Other users were just blaming the miners of grabbing their money, for crying out loud!!  But this is how mining works. This is how bitcoin became so huge. This is how the market was created and strengthened and this is the reason that cryptos are gaining mass attention and starting to gain ground in the last 2 years. Early miners were always taking the biggest piece of the pie , simply because this is how the thing works. It is innevitable. The algorithm's difficulty is low , so more blocks are solved. People are professional miners , having invested tens of thousands for this purpose , some are making a living out of it others dont , but this is the reality people. Whether we like it or not.  Consider also that anyone can rent hashing power in order to mine and gain 100x profits , without really owning a ""MINING PC"". So the accusation of ETN team favoring the miners is NOT VALID. I mined with my GAMING PC for hobby , and got X profit in the 1st 2 hours. But when i rented hash power i got 10x profit with less than 30$ !! So , again , if someone didnt make profit the 1st 6 hrs it is solely his fault.  Next time try to be more prepared! Do your homework and profits will come 100%. With OR without the ICO coins. Consider this a free of charge advise. We are all in the same page here.   This had nothing to do with the chance to have major early profiting from day 1 and was used by the trolls in order to manipulate you. My ICO coins for example are a fraction of the coins i mined with my PC and the renting hashing power. And i am gonna keep em because i believe in ETN!!! So Simple.   Nobody can judge or accuse someone who is profiting from his work / strategy / ideas , it is unfair - unethical but mostly hypocritical since you would do the same.  But this is nowhere close to implying that miners are stealing others' money. Or that the Electroneum CEO and team was behind this.Behind what? The 20.000 miners that participated and still participate and will continue to participate in ETN mining??!?!? This is crazy guys.  They are just creating money.This is what mining is. Creating money.  I will not also forget the epic delirium of another user , whom i ""met"" again few posts above , who was acting like a lunatic simply because Richard Ells crisis management team decided to protect its user base with a 2FA ( 2 factor authentication ) for our OWN ASSETS DAMN SAFETY. I remember him saying that "" I DONT WANT THE PROTECTION , I LOST THE PASS , I FORGOT MY 2ND PASSWORD , NO EMAIL WAS SENT AFTER 15 HOURS"" , and i really guys wouldn't decide if this behavior was the outcome of a plain stupid individual and/or illiterate person or this was simply another staged performance from a paid troll/fudster. One could simply check the spam folder , and voila there is the email. Checking the spam folder was also hinted in the users' profile in RED BOLD LETTERS , it is not nuclear physics!!!  During the last 24 hours i bared witness of almost every single logical and senseless behavioralistic pattern from the majority of users , fortunately most of whom have an above average mentality and have acquired in their lifetime the precious ability to judge whether one is full of sh*t or not.  But there were also a lot of panicked people , behaving irrational  , confused people who believed everything the trolls were implying  , thus creating more chaos and confusion. That might again have been avoided if the trolls were blocked in the first place.  Unfortunately though , the trolls' attack continues and will most probably continue, harming all of us who are involved with our money to this really interesting , well marketed and solid ( unlike most alts and ICOs ) project.  I really hope that whoever reads my post now and in the days to come will understand what i am saying i tried not to be more technical and wrote in a rather plain and simple way , and i am reffering to the new users/owners/ICO investors , and that he/she wil be clever enough to identify the fake posts,fudsters,trolls and ignore and report them.  The crypto planet is not inhabited by angels, unfortunately trolls and fudsters are here too, being the equivalent to what the majority of us label as "" common thieves"". They just want to steal you.By inducing fear-doubt-uncertainty (FUD).You sell low , they buy low and sell high.  Thats all.  Invest to the coin, sell it later if you like and make some profit but always keep at least 80% to your portfolio because common sense dictates that this coin and the electroneum platform in general , will succeed in the not-so distant future.   This post ended up longer that i originally had in mind , sorry for that , but consider it something like a voice of reason among the ridiculousness crescendo we witnessed the past 24 hrs.  Good Luck to everybody on Friday , remember not to sell everything. It is for your own benefit. We own the coin , we are responsible now for any loss or profit we make , remember that for a transaction to evolve one is selling and another is buying.   Before selling , take a break and think , "" Why Is This Person Buying My Fear? "".  Dont sell out of fear. Sell some when you are OK with it.",False

The Mobile mining experience does not directly add blocks to the blockchain and thus it does not overheat the mobile device or use precious bandwidth. The CPU of the device is periodically queried to ensure the simulated hashrate is correctly balanced with the other running processes and it gives the user a very realistic mining experience...  The mobile mining experience has been designed to yield rapid user growth. These users will be encouraged and likely to take advantage of the significant mining speed and coin emission improvements of mining with the Windows, Mac or Linux GUI miner, which will enable Electroneum to grow to huge user numbers via the app, whilst still retaining a significant mining community running the transactional blockchain by running the intuitive Windows, Mac or Linux application.",False

Personally, I'm tired of all this needless FUD. Yes, I'd feel much safer if any ETN I may or may not have paid for was in a paper wallet so I could leave it alone until deciding whether or not to sell at some point in the future. Yes, the launch could have been handled better - of course it could - but I don't think there's much point in reiterating that fact or ramming some kind of agenda-fuelled point home. I'm sure there was a lot on their collective plates - the release itself, hacker issues, and so on, and I also know that there are always teething troubles in new software launches. I voiced my concern a few pages ago, contraband replied and I thanked him.  What's done is done, and nothing positive can come out of whining about it.

Electroneum has not been directly affected by these incidents but we've detected that quite a number of our users accounts are at risk as they may have been using the same email addresses and passwords in more than one place.  To secure your Electroneum account, we are going to be requiring everyone to reset their password in the next day or so (we will inform you when) before we make the wallet system live.  To re-iterate our system has NOT been compromised.  In advance of this, everybody should ensure that the email address that they have used to register an Electroneum account with is SECURE. This means you should really change your email address password (Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail etc.) to something VERY secure. Please use the links below for some password generator sites that will make you a secure password.  Your Email account password SHOULD NOT be used anywhere else.  The safety of your ETN coins is entirely reliant on ensuring your primary email account is secure before we ask you to change your Electroneum password.  We are aware that people are experiencing login problems with their PIN number, this issue will be resolved when we ask everyone to reset their primary password.  Please ensure your email account password is highly secure. Use one of the following websites to generate a very secure password.  https://www.strongpasswordgenerator.com/  https://identitysafe.norton.com/password-generator/  https://lastpass.com/generatepassword.php  Again, we are very sorry for the delay in activating our service, we feel it is important to make every effort to ensure our users are protected from the inevitable attempts to compromise their accounts.      Please Note!!  Another Record!!  In the first 10 hours we hadd 15,000 miners up and running. Thanks again to all our dedicated loyal users!!!     Fan Art!!        Attention!!

But the mobile mining app failed and it sounds like most pools failed. - So professional miners gobbled up all early blocks and then sold on cryptopia before any of the ICO investors were able to access wallets. - Apparently some ICO investors are now able to access their coins (when the website is up), BUT no official word because all the telegram admins have stopped responding to questions on the 25,000 member telegram channel.

Firstly - PLEASE do not reply to this email address - it won't get a response - my inbox has over 10,000 unread messages.  We are asking EVERY Electroneum holder to ensure that their EMAIL ADRESS PASSWORD is very secure. We know that hundreds of Electroneum holders EMAIL ACCOUNTS have been compromised by a sophisticated hacking team.  There have been a number of security incidents on other websites in the past, unrelated to Electroneum (including, but not limited to, DropBox, Yahoo, Adobe, Last.FM, Tumbler, LinkedIN, Ebay etc.).  Electroneum has NOT been directly affected by these incidents but we've detected that quite a number of our users accounts are at risk as they may have been using the same email addresses and passwords in more than one place.  To secure your Electroneum account, we are going to be requiring everyone to reset their password before we make the wallet system live. DO NOT RESET YOUR ELECTRONEUM PASSWORD NOW - we are going to reset it. We are asking you to reset and secure your EMAIL ADDRESS PASSWORD.  To re-iterate our system has NOT been compromised.  Please ensure that the EMAIL ADDRESS that you have used to register your Electroneum account  is SECURE. This means you should really change your email address password (Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail etc.) to something VERY secure. Please use the links below for some password generator sites that will make you a secure password.  Your Email account password SHOULD NOT be used anywhere else.  The safety of your ETN coins is entirely reliant on ensuring your primary email account is secure before we ask you to change your Electroneum password.  We are aware that people are experiencing login problems with their PIN number, this issue will be resolved when we ask everyone to reset their primary password.  Please ensure your email account password is highly secure. Use one of the following websites to generate a very secure password.  https://www.strongpasswordgenerator.com/ https://identitysafe.norton.com/password-generator/ https://lastpass.com/generatepassword.php  We will post an update later today and send another email - please keep an eye on our social media posts.  Again, we are very sorry for the delay in activating our service, we feel it is important to make every effort to try and ensure our users are protected from the inevitable attempts to compromise their accounts.

I am ok with forking Monero late in the day if that was what was required. I would have been ok waiting another 2 weeks but now we have a coin targeting newbie’s with a command line wallet and no access to ICO funds while miners who made large amounts by getting in early are selling off and adding to the negative vibe around this problems creating sell pressure rather than the other way around.  If people have had their accounts hacked because they used the same credentials they used on other sites that were hacked then there are limited options for you to help and no options if their actual email account is not under their control. So just send out reset email and let people have their ICO funds. I presume you have a gui wallet ready?  The do what your good at and market it and make it work and the market will stabilise.,False

First off, if your loyal investors that resulted in you reaching your $40million hardcap cannot access their coins, then all coins should be frozen for the time being as to prevent dumping. We put our trust in you, and funded the campaign to an early close. I remember first researching this coin, and it was stated that $5million would move the project forward, but $40 million was never expected to be reached. Well guess what, you appealed to this community and many people new to cryptos. You created the most successful ICO to date breaking the previous registered users by over 6x at the close of ICO, a number that continued to grow after sellout. Some amazing accomplishments by the dev team with a huge let down to your investors.  I was gladly going to purchase more coins on the market, but at this time watching the devs put off their investors by not allowing access to their coins while more coins are added to the market, and sold at an undervalued price by your precious miners (the ones trying to turn a quick buck) quickly dumping from a great launch, into shitcoin territory (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gfntBEI3Aw).  No this is not FUD this is an investors honest opinion as to the way this is playing out right now. I really hope the dev team realizes this mistake, and makes things right with those of us that supported and made this project as successful as it was. Give us a reason to continue supporting this project in full force. Allow us access to our coins, and compensate us for the mistake that was made. I was going to download the miner and place electroneum in my top 5 holdings between stocks and crypto, but I am not sure if I want to now.",False

YOU HAVE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SO WHATEVER THE FREAKIN PROBLEM IS SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE FIXED LIKE WITHIN 1 DAY PROBABLY EVEN LESS! All you would have to do is spend some of the money which was given to you by people who worked hard to earn that money and then put their trust in you and your project by giving you their MONEY instead of investing it into a different project which would most likely be RIGHT ON SCHEDULE unlike how your project is turning out... seriously any security issues that there might be in the wallets or WHATEVER it is that has these security issues could be fixed in less than a day when you have the amount of money that was entrusted to your project which is supposed to be being used for exactly these kinds of issues. If I had that amount of money right now and if I were in charge of this project I would have had any and all security, and even any other types of issues, repaired and quadruple+ checked wayyyy before the day that this project had promised to launch all these new feautures.... There should really be no excuses AT ALL that you guys could use to explain this ridiculous irresponsible nonsense that could justify you not being on time and releasing the wallets and mobile miner at the EXACT SECOND which you had promised you would be doing so.  I did not invest into this project but I did invest a lil bit of time and energy into helping you promote this product which definitely gives me a valid reason for complaining about this bullsh*t right now, cause now I am starting to think that I got people to invest into a project that is either not organized at all and cannot follow through with their promises and release dates, OR that I unknowingly got people to invest in a SCAM project... EITHER WAY I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT AT ALL, I believed in this project and now all my hopes and trust in this project have faded due to this one significant irresponsible f*cking issue.  Good job Electroneum team. You have now let everyone down and have probably lost wayyyy more peoples faith than just my own.  Not a very good start to this project after an extremely successful ICO.  Knew that the referral program seemed too good to be true. Shoulda known that no legit project which isn't going to end up being a scam would have such a good referral program like this project had. So I guess I can only blame myself for not seeing this sooner.  Shame on you....  Later.  P.S. - This is the first time I have ever ranted to/at any ICO or project on this forum, normally I am a very chill dude but this is very unnecessary and has made a lot of people lose their faith in this project all because this project wasn't responsible nor organized well enough to be able to put the money which has been entrusted to you to proper use to fix any and all issues before a promised release date. Again if I had all that money this sh*t woulda been solved and long out of the way long before the date which a promised wallet and mobile miner or anything for that matter was set to be launched.

Please make sure daemon is running or restart the wallet with the correct daemon address..............would appreciate if any of you smarter dudes can help, thanks..... You need to run the daemon in another terminal window.. so you need to open another terminal/cmd/commandline/whatever and then navigate to the folder where your direct miner and cli is. then type the following: Code: sudo ./electroneumd - for linux Code: start electroneumd.exe - for windows",False

And they should have also fixed any of said ""problems"" immediately, with as much money as this project has raised they should have every single deadline and release dates end up being on time and very successful with all problems and issues long out of the way. Money can def buy people who could predict and fix any and all issues such as the ones they are claiming to have run across...

Wether there is 1 or 3billion users has nothing to do with the fact that they didn't release the wallet first, and didn't give the tokens to investors first, and made mining available to gpus first. Mining with gpus is the exact opposite of the point of this coin. THE EXACT OPPOSITE why investors invested in this coin. We're just seeing that they are doing something totally different than planned. It's like as if you invest in a car company and you get a bicycle two days after the launch when they are done distributing free cars to people passing by. It is pure madness what is happening.  ""Give them time"": Time is everything in crypto world. You'll understand that very clearly when you'll finally access your coins and see their ""value"".  Their is nothing to be ""figured out"", not distributing the tokens is just THE move to screw us over.  Enough said, I've been in cryptos long enough to know what's going on...",False

I know it's hard, but the best thing to do is to IGNORE both of them cause a lot will be popping up.  #2 Misplaced Expectations - If you are feeling stress because you feel like you are being cheated or are not getting what you are promised than you are the one to blame for not properly researching the project and keeping up with announcements direct from the source (not random bitcointalk posts).  The whole mobile mining thing was NEVER mobile mining, but simulated mining, that is what the entry point to crypto is supposed to be for those who know nothing of crypto.  There were never any promises or claims that the real mining would be ""easy"" at all.  Mining is very technical, this sound stupid, but I know this because I have done quite a bit of research on it and I still don't understand it well.  Yes, I'm a technical idiot. But I am still able to understand the relationship between the real miners and the mobile mining, so I don't feel like ETN didn't meet my expectations because my expectations were REAL.  #3 Coins from ICO still unavailable - Yes, this totally sucks.  And you can conspiracy theory all you want but it won't change the fact that we can't access them now.  You can choose to believe that it is an elaborate scam for devs to manipulate the market, run away with our money, or whatever.  Or you can choose to believe that the release is delayed because a couple thousand idiots had horrible passwords and were susceptible to lose their ETN if we could move it to the mobile wallet right now.  I choose to believe that the devs are ensuring a secure release of the ICO coins because, quite frankly, I just don't see how such a high profile ICO and company as this can run away with our money without serious criminal repercussions.  Only the world's dumbest criminal would ever try to pull off a scam after receiving so much publicity.  So, just be patient.  #4 Cryptopia - I spent a lot of time figuring out how to get my 52 ETN (52! wao! lol) that I mined from my paper wallet to cryptopia and still haven't been able to do it.  I just gave up.  Some miners will make a lot of profit but I won't because I just didn't know enough, fast enough.  That is on me.  If you feel it is unfair that miners get ""first dibs"" then get smarter rather than complaining about how electroneum screwed everything up.  More than anything, isn't it crazy how some people are actually buying ETN for $5 or more?  The ETN market will be ENTIRELY different once ICO coins can be moved around.  Base your speculations on that rather than what is going on now.   Well, carry on everyone.  Stay calm, don't panic sell or panic buy, don't get stressed, do a bit of yoga, and you will make it through the next couple of days of crypto craziness.  Then just read a book through the next couple months of waiting, and when ETN does become viral (there is absolutely no indication that it will not become viral) watch the company, and your investment soar in all the ways you wanted it to.  (...just not $100 = 1 ETN, that's just crazy)",False

Went for sleep a couple of hours ago. Its soo salty in here.    Just a lil hint: ETN software is XMR software. ALL monero guides should work with ETN.  To actually check your wallet balance do the following as stated in the XMR guide ( https://getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/restore_from_keys.html )  Be sure to have your paperwallet available with all 3 adresses (public, private view, private share!)  STEP 1  Goto https://downloads.electroneum.com/ Download the Windows Direct Miner (ZIP) Unzip it!  STEP 2 Press win_button + R A lil window will appear, type CMD and press ENTER  STEP 3 Browse to the root directory of the unzipped windows miner you just loaded. Example starting in C:\Users\Username> Type: cd Downloads\win-x64-0.11.0.0  (Going the wrong path? cd.. takes you back a step.)  STEP 4 Check with ""dir"" command that files are present.  Now we are going to restore the wallet. Type the following: electroneum-wallet-cli --generate-from-keys New_Wallet_Name.abc Choose whatever name you want for New_Wallet_Name.abc.  If typed correctly it'll ask for Standard address. Copy&paste yourpublic view key. After that your private spend and view key aswell. Make sure to copy them to notepad before and delete every SPACE you might find. Otherwise it'll prompt you with an error. Last step is to secure it with a strong password. Dont miss out on this!  STEP 5 View your wallet.  Navigate into your unzipped folder, its important to have the deamon running. Start electroneumd.exe. Keep it open, unblock it if firewall promp comes up. Now start the electroneum-wallet-cli.exe Its gonna ask for the wallet file name. The name you have choosen in Step 4. Type it. In this case: New_Wallet_Name.abc It'll ask for the password you've choosen before. Type it in.  If done correctly it'll synch with the blockchain. Might take a few. Once thats done it'll show you all your transactions aswell as your balance. You are now free to update it whenever you want. Just type the following: refresh.    Thats it. You now have one less reason to complain.    You dont feel comfi having your full access wallet running? Follow this guide afterwards: https://getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/view_only.html       credit to ZineX",False

Also, everyone who wants to transfer to the exchange: only the miners can sell at the moment since all the ICO money is still stuck on the Electroneum website.  If you are a miner and you want to transfer to Cryptopia, download the ""Direct Miner"" for your OS from https://downloads.electroneum.com/ and then create a wallet file from the paper wallet you've been mining to using the method above.  Once you have a wallet file, close the cli.  Now you need to start the daemon by running the ""electroneumd"" file. This will sync the blockchain. Wait for it to complete and do NOT close it before you do the next step.  Next, relaunch the cli without the flags (in a new terminal window). Then enter the name of the wallet file you created.  Once you have done this it will sync with the daemon and your funds should show up.

Electroneum has not been directly affected by these incidents but we've detected that quite a number of our users accounts are at risk as they may have been using the same email addresses and passwords in more than one place.  To secure your Electroneum account, we are going to be requiring everyone to reset their password in the next day or so (we will inform you when) before we make the wallet system live.  To re-iterate our system has NOT been compromised.  In advance of this, everybody should ensure that the email address that they have used to register an Electroneum account with is SECURE. This means you should really change your email address password (Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail etc.) to something VERY secure. Please use the links below for some password generator sites that will make you a secure password.  Your Email account password SHOULD NOT be used anywhere else.  The safety of your ETN coins is entirely reliant on ensuring your primary email account is secure before we ask you to change your Electroneum password.  We are aware that people are experiencing login problems with their PIN number, this issue will be resolved when we ask everyone to reset their primary password.  Please ensure your email account password is highly secure. Use one of the following websites to generate a very secure password.  https://www.strongpasswordgenerator.com/  https://identitysafe.norton.com/password-generator/  https://lastpass.com/generatepassword.php  Again, we are very sorry for the delay in activating our service, we feel it is important to make every effort to ensure our users are protected from the inevitable attempts to compromise their accounts.      Please Note!!  Another Record!!  In the first 10 hours we hadd 15,000 miners up and running. Thanks again to all our dedicated loyal users!!!     Fan Art!!        Attention!!

Code: transfer             transfer [<priority>] [<ring_size>] <address> <amount> [<payment_id>] - Transfer <amount> to <address>. <priority> is the priority of the transaction. The higher the priority, the higher the fee of the transaction. Valid values in priority order (from lowest to highest) are: unimportant, normal, elevated, priority. If omitted, the default value (see the command ""set priority"") is used. <ring_size> is the number of inputs to include for untraceability.

Good grief.  Quote from: thelonecrouton on November 01, 2017, 10:03:02 PM For anyone wanting to know their balance if their pool is on the fritz, just run the daemon.  https://downloads.electroneum.com/ - scroll down a bit to 'Direct Miners' which is what they're calling the daemon and cli executables.  Download according to your OS and decompress. The linux one didn't work for me, so I compiled it myself, it doesn't have many dependencies, I already had all the non-optional ones anyway.  Destructions: 1. Fire up electroneumd and wait for it to sync 2. Fire up electroneum-wallet-cli like so to get it to give you details of your paper wallet:        ""electroneum-wallet-cli --generate-from-keys WALLET""   (On Win it's probably ""electroneum-wallet-cli.exe..."")        - without the quotes, where WALLET is the wallet name you want, can be anything        ...when prompted enter your public address and private key and view key from your paper wallet        ...set a password        ...wait while it syncs that address 3. Bugger about with it - type ""help"" at the prompt for available commands - ""balance"" and ""show_transfers in"" (without the quotes!) are what most of you are looking for 4.

Electroneum has not been directly affected by these incidents but we've detected that quite a number of our users accounts are at risk as they may have been using the same email addresses and passwords in more than one place.  To secure your Electroneum account, we are going to be requiring everyone to reset their password in the next day or so (we will inform you when) before we make the wallet system live.  To re-iterate our system has NOT been compromised.  In advance of this, everybody should ensure that the email address that they have used to register an Electroneum account with is SECURE. This means you should really change your email address password (Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail etc.) to something VERY secure. Please use the links below for some password generator sites that will make you a secure password.  Your Email account password SHOULD NOT be used anywhere else.  The safety of your ETN coins is entirely reliant on ensuring your primary email account is secure before we ask you to change your Electroneum password.  We are aware that people are experiencing login problems with their PIN number, this issue will be resolved when we ask everyone to reset their primary password.  Please ensure your email account password is highly secure. Use one of the following websites to generate a very secure password.  https://www.strongpasswordgenerator.com/  https://identitysafe.norton.com/password-generator/  https://lastpass.com/generatepassword.php  Again, we are very sorry for the delay in activating our service, we feel it is important to make every effort to ensure our users are protected from the inevitable attempts to compromise their accounts.      Please Note!!  Another Record!!  In the first 10 hours we hadd 15,000 miners up and running. Thanks again to all our dedicated loyal users!!!     Fan Art!!        Attention!!

Went for sleep a couple of hours ago. Its soo salty in here.    Just a lil hint: ETN software is XMR software. ALL monero guides should work with ETN.  To actually check your wallet balance do the following as stated in the XMR guide ( https://getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/restore_from_keys.html )  Be sure to have your paperwallet available with all 3 adresses (public, private view, private share!)  STEP 1  Goto https://downloads.electroneum.com/ Download the Windows Direct Miner (ZIP) Unzip it!  STEP 2 Press win_button + R A lil window will appear, type CMD and press ENTER  STEP 3 Browse to the root directory of the unzipped windows miner you just loaded. Example starting in C:\Users\Username> Type: cd Downloads\win-x64-0.11.0.0  (Going the wrong path? cd.. takes you back a step.)  STEP 4 Check with ""dir"" command that files are present.  Now we are going to restore the wallet. Type the following: electroneum-wallet-cli --generate-from-keys New_Wallet_Name.abc Choose whatever name you want for New_Wallet_Name.abc.  If typed correctly it'll ask for Standard address. Copy&paste yourpublic view key. After that your private spend and view key aswell. Make sure to copy them to notepad before and delete every SPACE you might find. Otherwise it'll prompt you with an error. Last step is to secure it with a strong password. Dont miss out on this!  STEP 5 View your wallet.  Navigate into your unzipped folder, its important to have the deamon running. Start electroneumd.exe. Keep it open, unblock it if firewall promp comes up. Now start the electroneum-wallet-cli.exe Its gonna ask for the wallet file name. The name you have choosen in Step 4. Type it. In this case: New_Wallet_Name.abc It'll ask for the password you've choosen before. Type it in.  If done correctly it'll synch with the blockchain. Might take a few. Once thats done it'll show you all your transactions aswell as your balance. You are now free to update it whenever you want. Just type the following: refresh.    Thats it. You now have one less reason to complain.    You dont feel comfi having your full access wallet running?

Still, understand, that if you somehow have a attracted the attention of a hacker, it is very hard to defend against them.  Although 2FA is an extra layer of security, the only way to have your ETN stored in an unhackable location is to transfer them to the paper wallet option while following all the directions word for word.

I am too far away to be an expert on crypto coins. I have just started trading it recently (Used to trade on Forex for years). All the markets are based on supply VS demand. After days reading and re-reading posts, infos and as much as I can of important infos about ETN, I have concluded that:  1 - If ETN was a SCAM, I am pretty sure they would have not stopped the ICO at 40m and would have raised more and more money and disappear after that. 2 - Instead of disappear, they are trying to get better systems for us (Monero news) and they keep in touch with everyone via email, social media, groups, etc. 3 - NONE can predict a price. That's impossible. It's up, as I said above, to the demand. 4 - It's a real fact that crypto world is still very young and a small number of people know how to walk into it. Ok, a few people knows about the existence of crypto, but most of them don't have a clue how to buy, how to use, for what does it serves, etc. ETN is looking to the masses, if they get sucess on this, the demand will be definitely HUGE. 5 - It doesn't really MATTER if it will dump at the first days, months or years, If they get success introducing the masses to it, it will grow up organically. So HODL! 6 - I have seen a LOT of people crying around groups for not buying enough coins, they are really sorry for it. 7 - About dumping it: If I bought at 0.01, WHY THE HELL I would sell for less than that? Dont make sense! If people sell their bonusses for 0.01.. I am sorry for them... it will grow later and they will cry again.  I believe in the ETN purpose, I see their vision for the future.

They have hundreds of thousands of companies using the social media product, and also do marketing for Avon, Herbalife, Mary Kay, etc. Household names!!  Now, because they are a TOP TIER marketing firm, they were able to generate 120,000 investors into the Electroneum Token Sale, which is 6 times the world record of 22,000. ETNs Telegram Chat room has over 20,000 active members, another world record.  This will only continue , as now they have at least 50,000 investors at a lowball figure, waiting to buy the minute this hits exchanges because we hit the 40 Million Hardcap 11 days early.  Also, keep in mind that the CPA for a Mobile App download is WAY less than $1, and they have $40 million, when 5 million App downloads would largely surpass the total number of users that Bitcoin has, which will give us mainstream free worldwide press as this occurs.  Will it pass Bitcoin in Value? Not anytime soon, if ever, but even if our MC is around 5% of Bitcoins MC, that puts ETN as a TOP FIVE coin, which will generate even more press!  My point here is not to speculate about the price, but to point out the steps ETN will make during price discovery, and outlining the penetration we will have into the general public that are not currently involved in crypto.  Its also important to remember that when we have millions of users in our network, all the mobile games and gambling sites will be coming to us.  These other companies network of users will join ours, only adding even more to the avalanche of Mass Adoption.  Buckle up guys, lift off is in 41.5 hours!!  ",False

Its a shame those people got scammed, but 21 cents in HOURS is impressive, especially considering that the majority of buyers would have known that ETN doesnt go live until Nov 1st.

Remember, the blockchain doesnt even go live until Nov 1st, so anyone saying they can send you the coins before then are not telling the truth.  If you insist, please at least use escrow. Still, although this protects your investment money, it doesnt protect your investment because the seller can back out of the deal if the value goes up, and go through with the deal if the value goes down.

It's harder to have a steady hand when you are new to something and the fuddsters have great influence over their mentality.

Its been awhile since I have Agreed and Disagreed with someone at the same time so strongly.  I really dont think your quoted silly comments above are made to troll or to cause damage to ETN on purpose, Im just chalking it up to innocent inexperience.  The above ""3 to 5 whales"" comment? Who told you that? There is zero indication of that. Be careful who you believe around here. That will be my first piece of advice.  There is NOTHING that would indicate that the chances of a ""price crash being REALLY high"" other than 90%++ of ICO projects fail completly. Keep in mind we are no regular ICO.  We have the biggest Telegram group on earth, and just had an ICO with the most investors in HISTORY.  A scam exchange called etherdelta, allowed over 4 million fake Electroneum to be sold yesterday, within 5 hours the price was 21 cents! Surprized? Great news for price speculators, but I feel horrible for those that got scammed.    What I AGREE with you on is what you did here. It was well put together.

I was attracted to the idea of pushing for broad mobile adoption and a distinctly consumer non-investor marketing / social approach.  It feels more akin to a consumer product but with half decent team building it out, which in most industries would be a decent starting point.  Interested to understand what is 'live' with electroneum when they publicly start trading and mining start on November 1st, most importantly what features, tabs etc will be accessible from the electroneum mobile app.   Clearly Available at Launch Miner - will result in small amounts of coin being generated for everyone with the app loaded and it can run in the background Wallet - store of  What is not clear if it will be available on day one Ability to transfer electroneum to others directly from app Ability to transfer electroneum to others without a wallet addresss? Phone # , contactless on phone , generated link to email address Links to exchanges where electroneum is traded Direct links to exchanges where fiat currency can be deposited to directly acquire electroneum from the exchange (and ideally instantly transferred back to the electroneum wallet) Youtube videos - one consumer focused and second slightly more technical Retailer who will accept, with the heavy london marketing if even 2-3 say top 100 high street retails would accept payment in electroneum at launch would be a game changer  Two recommendations i think would be critical for pushing adoption  One is the fiat currency links mentioned above where after linking a credit card or bank account on the exchange, in 2-3 steps you can acquire electroneum from the open market but without it feeling like you have entered a trading pit.  The second is a 5 or 10 step gamification of the startup process, with small bonuses for multiple activities: linking to facebook, twitter etc, invitation to x friends, doing 1 electroneum transfer, doing 5 electroneum transfer, mining x of electroneum, mining x of electroneum for three consecutive months, setup a pre-authorized regular transfer (100 electroneum sent weekly to your mother/kid wallet).  The thresholds should be low, seeing those various steps immediately occur and working through them over the first day or two and a few longer goals to ensure stickyness  Look forward to seeing how electroneum launches, the closer it can be to a complete consumer product on November 1st the greater likely hood of  getting the mass adoption, because if not 300,000 of the 330,000 who registered will quickly drift away.",False

It's a fork of Monero, to keep transactions private. They have their own blockchain. Mobile ""mining"" is just a term used by them to market towards people who don't know much about cryptocurrency. For the most part, people only really know about Bitcoin and that there's mining involved, whatever that means to them. It's just a simulation where coins are airdropped to the user based on the hashing power of the CPU on their phone.

Electroneum will have zero problems getting into the Top 5 cryptos with more users than Bitcoin.  Granted, I dont believe that simply having more users than Bitcoin will cause it to surpass Bitcoin, but it will put Electroneum in the Top 5. Which is $1.00 a coin / 4,000,000,000 MC.  This is entirely realistic considering all the free press ETN will receiving when they surpass Bitcoins estimated users of 3 million.

This is a Bytecoin base cryptonote coin as I understand it and I'm not sure what can be done to prevent other people from using GPUs to mine it.  I think it's possible the Electroneum project isn't saying you'll get rich from mining it on your cell phone, but rather that it is possible if you would like to, for small profits and to help the decentralization of the coin.  They have a nice idea here though and utilizing many unconventional mining hardware they can achieve a potentially higher level of decentralization and although I missed the ICO I'll be paying attention to see how this develops.

Hi Everyone!  We've nearly reached the $40m US dollars that we aimed to reach. We have raised $38m as of 16:00 BST. We have had over a quarter of a million users join the Electroneum Token Sale! It must be one of the largest tokens sales by user number in history - if not THE biggest. Bancor raised 140m+ on just 10,000 contributors. Tezos raised $240m on 22,000 contributors. We have more than 110,000 contributors who've made over 160,000 transactions from over 250,000 users who have registered on the token sale manager.  The Electroneum team have reconfirmed that there is going to be a hard cap at $40m US dollars.   Therefore the token sale will almost certainly be closing early, as soon as the value of the Bitcoin and Ethereum raised by the sale of Electroneum exceeds $40m US Dollars.  The rationale behind this decision is as follows   1.    To prevent early access to Electroneum purchases.  Electroneum has built an incredible momentum in the market. Clearly it is important this continues past the token sale, and into the exchanges upon listing. The management team believe this will pivot into further excitement for the app and for mass user adoption of Electroneum.  2.    The exchanges are likely to list Electroneum quickly, due to pent up demand, which will equate to transactions and new users for the exchange(s) that list Electroneum.  3.    It gives a clear signal to the market that the team are focused on the long term goals and success of Electroneum and not the proceeds of the token sale.   As soon as the $40m US goal is reached we will close the ability to make purchases via the Electroneum token sale manager and make an announcement on Telegram,  Facebook, Twitter and the Electroneum website.   We will, of course, follow up with interviews and press releases to the financial and disruptive press.  We’d like to thank everybody who has contributed to the Electroneum Crowd Sale (token sale) and we look forward to moving on to phase 2 and the launch of the full app on November 1st 2017.   If you still want a chance to buy some Electroneum you have a very limited time left. Visit https://my.electroneum.com to make your purchase.  Remember that once we get Electroneum listed on Exchanges, you will be able to make purchases there. Electroneum Ltd will never sell Electroneum coins again once we reach our hard cap goal. The entire market will consist of trading with existing Electroneum owners.  Our Telegram group is now over 14800 members, again one of the biggest (if not the biggest) in token sale history! If you are not already our Telegram group chat - install the free Telegram app on your phone and join the Electroneum group - you'll find a likeminded audience of literally thousands of friendly, helpful, Electroneum fans, eager to help and chat about cryptocurrencies, life, the universe and EVERYTHING!  Have great day everyone!  Richard Ells Founder of Electroneum richard.ells@electroneum.com  PS - Please remember buying into a cryptocurrency is not a guarantee of returns. My own opinions of where we can take Electroneum could be wrong. You should not purchase more than you could afford to lose. We have a working product and are raising money to market this to a huge audience. Please ensure you do your due diligence, check out me and the team, what we've done before and who's behind the project, and only purchase ETN if you are comfortable with the risk.     -----------------------------------------------------------------",False

With no hard cap there is more of a risk of people mass dumping the coin once it hits the exchanges but itnwould allow more money for the dev team to put into the coin.

Lemme guess, you'll say that's why ETN will never take off, because large scale mineries won't be applicable, in which I kindly remind you of the 2.2 billion mobile user market.

The mobile part is using left over coins from the 6billion they assigned to the ico. You can earn coins but only a few as the app is to teach you about mining and how crypto works.

The people on this forum seem to believe that what goes on here is the ""end all and be all"" of cryptos.  What Electroneum is doing is INTRODUCING cryptos to a NEW audience.  Their website is very user-friendly.  Their white paper shows they have vision for the future, by offering a mobile ""game"" whereby people can virtually ""mine"" cryptos and gain real coins through ""achievements"" (coins will be centrally dispersed to users).  THIS is what the crypto world needed.  Their background is in marketing, and so far, it shows, because they know what they are doing. I don't know the technical aspects of the coin itself, except I believe it is using  Ethereum technology? I could be wrong.  That is secondary.  The real goal here is to get this mobile app on millions of phones, and get people playing the game and familiarizing themselves with cryptos.  The CEO, Richard Ells, seems to understand what needs to be done here to reach the larger audience, as I've seen some of his interviews and he is pretty impressive.  They've raised enough money to do something special with this.  I also do not think the 225,000 ""investors"" is really an inflated number. I would expect 70% have invested, and the other 30% signed up through Facebook and they are learning right now for the first time how to use Bitcoin to buy tokens.  We will see, but I expect ETN will far exceed its 200 satoshi price soon enough.  Roy  https://twitter.com/RoyScamWatchdog",False

Would really appreciate if you can go to the link and participate in the discussion. Link below(also hyperlinked in this reply): https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2277987.0  Links are not working...  Gany  Link was deleted, probably due to posting in wrong forum. But anyways, here's what I wrote about my take on investing in Electroneum.  I've been following Electroneum for quite some time and have invested a good amount of my part-time earning in it (currently a student).  Electroneum Statistics: So, let's take a look at the current statistics of Electroneum (at the time of writing):  Number of users: 143,042 ETN Sold: 2,487,687,993  3 days ago, there was around 1.7Billion sold and I told my friend, ""They will probably sell 2.4 Billion by the end of the ICO"". I was so wrong. They are literally getting around 10000 new users everyday with an average of 100000 ETN being sold every 5 minutes(probably less).  With the current stats, I am really seeing most of the coins being sold by the end of the ICO.  At 10000 users a day, we are looking at 150000 more users by 31st Oct, totaling 290K+ users. This value does not  seem far fetched anymore. So, we are looking at 144,000,000 ETN being sold per day and with 15 days left, I'm guessing around 2 Billion ETNs will be sold, maybe 1.6 Billion to be conservative.  So, the Electroneum ICO is probably ending with around 300K users, and around 4 Billion ETNs sold.  What can we see based on those data? Electroneum has already gone viral before it even launches and I must admit that Ells and his team have proved that they really know what they are doing. Such is expected from such a team!  What makes Electroneum great?  The ease of access to Electroneum will make more and more people want it. With so many people having access to smartphones, Electroneum could set out to become a currency used by people daily as it already is providing a mobile app. Just imagine being able to accept and pay ETNs directly from an app just the way you can do it with the Paypal app? I can't wait for that honestly. The good part about this is it's Electroneum team itself who will build and hand out the app and it won't be a third-party app. I think that this has the potential of making ETN the Paypal of cryptocurrencies. They managed to make what was already available much much simpler for the average person and this is what will make it great. They have room for constant innovation and the funds will help them achieve those goals.  Moreover, by targeting the gaming industry, Electroneum opens many doors for Indie Game Developers who might be able to use their API, and make some revenue with their games. This seems very promising. As a developer myself, I am looking at the possibility of taking ETNs as payment as from November 1st. Although I'm still a student, with no investing knowledge except for some economics 101, I see a bright future for Electroneum.  Electroneum price speculation With that said, given the recent investments from high profile individuals making the news, the future of Electroneum looks bright. If they manage to reach the 4 Billion ETN sold and if the ICO brings around $25 Million, we are looking at around $0.006 per ETN which is lower than the ICO price. But given the hype and the high profile people investing in it, Electroneum might be actually trading for more than $0.01 on November 1st. We might be looking at atleast a 2x increase by the end of December and I highly believe that Electroneum will be the cryptocurrency making the waves in 2018. In a year, it would not be a surprise if Electroneum reach $0.5+.  Final thoughts  If you're looking at getting into the cryptocurrency game, either for fun or to really make a long-term investment, I highly suggest investing in Electroneum. The team is solid, the product is great and the future looks bright. As a student of Mathematics and Computer Science, Electroneum is one company which I would really like to work for, which is my way of saying that they are really innovative and I trust in their product.  Just remember, as with anything which comes with a risk, always invest only what you can afford to lose.

Simple as that You can mine this coin( This means that you have the Electroneum software installed on the pc. The electroneum software runs, and do some complex calculations and produces other virtual electroneum coins) Also there is an Electroneum app for mobile phones. You can leave the app open in the background, and the app will produce coins too. Like the computer software. BUT it will consume very very low energy(not like the pc software). So it will not hurt your cell-battery More o less, in the simplest way i can explain it.      English is not my first language . So   Also there is a game in the app, that you can play and gain Electroneum coins. Then you can use the Electroneum coins, to trade with other coins, to exchange for dollars, use in sites that will accept Electroneum as a payment method.

As an independent music artist (depending on the distributor you use), if you sell a single on iTunes for USD 0.99, you get to keep USD 0.69 and iTunes keeps the rest (the difference covers their network, transaction and operation fees). My guess is that any in-app purchases work in a similar way, and they could do the same with purchases made in ETN (the exchange might be tricky, but they already deal with fiat exchanges by region ...

I saw alot of potential for a big scam and said so. Still something kept me sticking to this coin.

Im still unsure if this coin will fit a proper purpose in near future but does it matter at all? Truth is: No. Nowadays its all about marketing and getting viral. Starting small will not gain you anything in this fast growing market. But opening up a wide market / getting accessable to a big userbase could automatically lead to big success. Atleast there'll be possibilities to fit a purpose and its all on the dev team to spot and use those.  Luckily i did get some at 50 & 30%, even tho my possibilities are very limited. Wish i had spread the word with my ref link. Wish i could get some more now. For sure i would invest a ton more of what i invested already, if i only had some more.

Electroneum is not designed to hit it big quickly (although it might happen). Rather than just focusing on getting the coin out there, the guys behind it want to seize a market, as we already know. The strategy is to try and get it included in several major products and they have the proper networks for that. But that takes years. I think that within 3 years the price will be good. The applications of Electroneum look really promising. Cannot wait for their API to start using it.",False

The mining is a simulation that will give you some coins but not actually add blocks and secure the network. Unlike Nimiq that is able to actually mine on a mobile device without needing an app, browser only.   So Electroneum tries to teach people what mining looks like and what the numbers mean.  I talked to a lot of people calling Electroneum a scam because they thought the mobile mining was unclear just to gain attention and make people buy coins.

Maybe you will post it later in a more beautiful post    This very exciting email, sent to the community,  that we just got from Richard  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Most Exciting Electroneum Week!  Hi Everyone!  Firstly, please avoid replying to this if you have a problem - I'm sending out over 130,000 emails from my account and it's clogged up with support requests - I'm trying to deal with them - but if you have a query, please open a support ticket or email support@electroneum.com for an automatic ticket. Thank you!  It's been less than a week since I last emailed, but WHAT a week!  We've gone from 60,000 contributors a week ago to a whopping 130,000+ and we are getting an additional 1000 per hour as I type!  Electroneum has really struck a chord with the public and the excitement is overwhelming!  Electroneum was tweeted about by Harry Redknapp (a famous, English, former football manager) towards the end of last week - and I'd just like to point out that we did not pay him to do that, but we VERY much appreciate him doing it (thanks Harry!)! He has joined in with the excitement that Electroneum is creating, and it has lead to some great publicity for us with both Bloomberg and the Telegraph picking up the story (see links below):  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/10/13/bitcoin-price-soars-record-high-harry-redknapp-joins-digital/  https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-10-13/icos-marxism-and-credit-reports  That kind of exposure has been really good for Electroneum and we've had a number of high profile people approach us. We will be asking them to help promote Electroneum AFTER the token sale, when we will want maximum exposure and momentum.  I can't tell you how excited we are to launch the app after the token sale! Remember that study by Cambridge University that suggests there were 3m Bitcoin users in May 2017? (http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/study-highlights-growing-significance-of-cryptocurrencies) we have already got 3 or 4% of that - and Electroneum isn't even launched!! Imagine if Electroneum grows to be the worlds most popular cryptocurrency by user number! How exciting would that be? That's what we are going to be working FLAT OUT FOR!  As always (for those that have just joined Electroneum), I'll include a link to this article, which links to a great interview that covers Electroneum quite nicely: https://www.financemagnates.com/thought-leadership/industry-poised-welcome-newest-cryptocurrency-electroneum/  If you should decide to buy some Electroneum in the next couple of days you'll still have a chance to take advantage of that 10% bonus, simply visit https://my.electroneum.com to make your purchase.  None of this could have happened without all of YOU! You are AMAZING. We are at the cutting edge of technology and you're involved in the most exciting thing I've ever seen in my life! Please limber up, have a stretch and give yourselves a giant pat on the back for giving the Electroneum team the opportunity to really make a go of creating the first cryptocurrency ""of the people"".  Thank you all SO much for getting involved in making Electroneum a success!  Our Telegram group is now over 8500 members! If you are not already our Telegram group chat - install the free Telegram app on your phone and join the Electroneum group - you'll find a likeminded audience of literally thousands of friendly, helpful, Electroneum fans, eager to help and chat about cryptocurrencies, life, the universe and EVERYTHING!  Have great day everyone!  Richard Ells Founder of Electroneum richard.ells@electroneum.com  PS - Please remember buying into a cryptocurrency is not a guarantee of returns. My own opinions of where we can take Electroneum could be wrong. You should not purchase more than you could afford to lose. We have a working product and are raising money to market this to a huge audience. Please ensure you do your due diligence, check out me and the team, what we've done before and who's behind the project, and only purchase ETN if you are comfortable with the risk.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Electroneum has got an amazing support by the community   Thank you very much team for your hard work",False

Now if it was a coin created buy a single anonimous dev, with just a announcement post and nothing more...then i would abosolutely agree with you , that this coin would have worth 1 satoshi at best...BUT IS IT ABSOLUTELY NOT THAT KIND OF COIN. This coin have a strong team, a good vision , and will target a large part of people who don't know the crypto world I would suggest to read the whitepaper , there are a lot of advantages that this coin have.. i would go too long if i post it here. Moreover this things are posted a lot of times in the previous posts     Why so much ? 21billion? this number is the total number of bitcoin, multiplied for 1000 ( 21million x 1000 = 21 billion) The reason for that is to remove 6 zeros after the digit.... Bitcoin is like  0.00324023....Electroneum will be like 0.23  ....it is easier for the average people  to say a pizza costs ""20 electroneum"" or a biscuit costs "" 21 electroneum cent"" in price.... than 21832 satoshi  or 0.000625313 BTC.... it is more like fiat, and people love, and are used to fiat. With only 2 digits after the dot.  Have a look at the whitepaper and then decide if you want to invest or not, make your own decision...   I personally have invested, and i think this project will be very good, and also will give good profit to those that are here only for profit... But that is my personal opinon , not an investing advice   Also about 100.000 people are registed on their website, and this is only the ico with a beta app that does nothing at the moment.

It's more like a simulation making it look like you are actually mining. Also a mobile processor is so weak it would take such a long time to actually mine something.

It's just going to analyze your processing power of your phone and then airdrop you coins every so often. It's in the FAQs section and have been answered a ton of times. It's meant for viral marketing and to encourage users to join. It uses as much power and data as loading a Wikipedia page. Yes, the main component and appeal of Electroneum is ease of use and the gateway for cryptos for beginners. It's not targeted towards the technically inclined. Mass adoption on a coin with general user appeal is very important, so I'm glad that they're doing it this way. If it's easy to use and can generate crypto, it will create hype and more people will join. Based on their website and beta app so far, I can see this going pretty well. The UI is as clean as it gets and understanding it is what's going to attract people. Whether it be a few ETN here and there or hundreds (based on ICO leftovers), people who want to get into cryptocurrency will have a chance. They won't have to go through a daunting task of sending information to an exchange. They won't have to abide by so many numbers and private keys. They don't have to pay the exuberant fees that Coinbase charges for their ease of use and beginner friendly site. The transactions that are done through the ETN blockchain will require no fees, so the ETN they earn from using the app will be theirs. P2P Transactions is standard with apps such as PayPal, Venmo, Square, Google Wallet, etc., but with the fees and banking that follows, ETN eliminates all of that. No bank is needed and that is why it's targeted towards those  without banks. Imagine the third-world countries where not a lot of people use the banking systems there. They can earn, trade, and sell their ETN for tangible goods. They can make transactions 24/7 a day without the need for fiat currency. The potential in this endeavor is astronomical. If they pull off the marketing aspect, which I'm confident they will, and get the app to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people, the growth and value of each coin will be insane.",False

That's true. The app will simulate a ""mining"" process . So the people that use the app , will have the sensation that they are mining a coin...This was written in the whitepaper just from the beginning as i personaly remember... So this is ""like a mining experience"" not real mining. This app and coin, wants to target persons that are not in the crypto world.. This persons have no idea how crypto works.. So to introduce them in this world, they need a very simple app, with a very simple concept, and a simple to use coin. That is what electroneum is about. Targeting millions of smartphones that have no connection with this ""magical crypto world"". The idea of mining will somehow get an introducion to crypto to the people, and how blockchain works...Their phone will be perfectly safe, not consume much, and they will gain coins....Not bad right? for someone new to this world...After using Electroneum, they will get involved and will inform more on crypto ,,, and so on. This is how i see Electroneum. I am an investor on this project , not an admin , nor a dev...... I know that some people think that they might have ""cheated"" us on this ""mining"" thing..... But remember that this coin is targeting the masses, not the high-end technical mining programmers.......Masses like it simple.....And i think it is a very easy and good way to introduce crypto to the people....At the end, people will just install the app and get free coins, that can worth very much in the future. And they dont have to pay nothing. Doesn't sound like cheating to me",False

Thanks  Also I dont know why anyone isn't really talking about the fact that it uses the cryptonote. I think since this coin is targeting people not in the crypto world, It makes more sense to them to be able to not let everyone see their balance like bitcoin.

Just ranted a bit at my team! The public github repo hasn't been updated in months - we are not a scam - I assure you that we are using 2 decimal places and have 21b coins - and are using the latest bytecoin code. We are completely under it here, and have struggled to cope with the enormous demand - we have 400+ support tickets and emails a day as well as tons of admin. We weren't expecting the incredible response we've had.  This is not a scam, I assure you. Just look me up! I've been around running businesses in Maidstone for 20 years!! In the UK we have companies house (which maintains records of public companies) - :  SiteWizard Ltd - a Digital agency I set up in 1997: https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/03454062  Retortal.com Ltd - a social media management software company set up in 2013: https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/08515141/officers  Electroneum Ltd - our cryptocurrency project https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10845797/officers  We are guilty of not updating our PUBLIC github repo (we only created it early as some of the listings required it - but we don't use that repo to develop the software) - but we are NOT guilty of running a scam! I am going to deliver this project and spend an enormous sum on gaining viral traction for our Electroneum app. Just as I've run these other businesses for years.  Have a good day, thanks for the interest, my apologies that we've left that in the public domain - it was confusing, they are updating the decimal places thing, but you'll see the full software before launch  All the best, Richard. PS - our github repo does state at the bottom of the page: ""The Repo  This repository does not in anyway represent the final source code for Electroneum. This is an early development version.  Our source is still under active development and will be made publicly available at the end of the Token Sale""",False

And i like the fact that richard was complitely honest and said , yes he haven't updated that( i have also appreciate his honest answers in the interviews where he also says""we would not give you a ferrari"" ""i also adivce to diversify , not to go full in one crypto, even if that crypto is electroneum"",   fair answers that i really appreciated) But this Murzibia guys is great , with files and photos , beter that CIA  .... i love this guys Thanx for your research man , really appreciate and thank you. We need people like you who do some good reseach. This ico is not a scam, but your time dedication to find ""weak points"" is admirable..... i will offer this guys a beer/pizza by sending him 1000 Electroneum once we can move them... I really apprecitate your research work. Good Job  ",False

The Mobile mining experience does not directly add blocks to the blockchain and thus it does not overheat the mobile device or use precious bandwidth. The CPU of the device is periodically queried to ensure the simulated hashrate is correctly balanced with the other running processes and it gives the user a very realistic mining experience, including accurately issuing Electroneum coin rewards. The issued Electroneum coins are true Electroneum coins, the same as issued by the Windows, Mac and Linux full miner. The Windows, Mac and Linux full miner does download the full blockchain and operate in a fully decentralized manner. The mobile mining experience has been designed to yield rapid user growth. These users will be encouraged and likely to take advantage of the significant mining speed and coin emission improvements of mining with the Windows, Mac or Linux GUI miner, which will enable Electroneum to grow to huge user numbers via the app, whilst still retaining a significant mining community running the transactional blockchain by running the intuitive Windows, Mac or Linux application. The centralized nature of the mobile app will also allow Electroneum to perform transfers of Electroneum via the contact list in the device, rather than using lengthy public keys which are currently required by all decentralized blockchains. Those public keys still exist and can be used but a simpler, more intuitive way of using cryptocurrency is envisaged.",False

Code: The mobile mining experience does not download a copy of the blockchain or carry out intensive CPU operations to provide egalitarian proof of work, it is intended to give entry level access to a cryptocurrency by allowing the experience of mining (i.e. being issued a hash rate reflective of the CPU processing power of the device and being awarded coins for participating in the experience). The Mobile mining experience does not directly add blocks to the blockchain and thus it does not overheat the mobile device or use precious bandwidth. The CPU of the device is periodically queried to ensure the simulated hashrate is correctly balanced with the other running processes and it gives the user a very realistic mining experience, including accurately issuing Electroneum coin rewards. The issued Electroneum coins are true Electroneum coins, the same as issued by the Windows, Mac and Linux full miner. The Windows, Mac and Linux full miner does download the full blockchain and operate in a fully decentralized manner. The mobile mining experience has been designed to yield rapid user growth. These users will be encouraged and likely to take advantage of the significant mining speed and coin emission improvements of mining with the Windows, Mac or Linux GUI miner, which will enable Electroneum to grow to huge user numbers via the app, whilst still retaining a significant mining community running the transactional blockchain by running the intuitive Windows, Mac or Linux application.

ETN isn't going to be ""mining,"" but simulating what mining feels like. It's going to calculate the computational power of your phone and allocate coins appropriately. In essence, you will not be actually mining on your phone. Your phone won't be handling the same load as a desktop miner. Your battery won't get depleted fast. It won't burn up. It won't degrade your phone. It puts as much strain on your device as loading a Wikipedia page is. The main miners will be on the PC. The return with ""mining"" on your phone will be dependent on the amount of people utilizing the app. There will be a significant increase in the pool because of the leftover tokens from the ICO will be distributed accordingly. This is to promote viral growth and get people into it earlier, rather than later. If a million people start using the app and mining, it's not going to return the same amount of coins forever. The 21B cap of ETN won't be mined for YEARS. From what I have read and understood (but I might be wrong, so please correct me), the desktop miners' coins will have some allocated for the phone miners to distribute among them. The coins won't be appearing from thin air, since the phone isn't actually doing any mining.  Also, people complain about the amount of tokens overall, which is 21B. Now, that may seem like a lot, comparatively speaking, but it's not. Most coins use multiple decimal places. For instance, Bitcoin uses 8. However, ETN will only be using 2, in order to feel like a real world currency. So the amount available to purchase is significantly less than Bitcoin, from what I'm aware.",False

IMO ""very Enthusiastic Confidence"" would be a mistake, as it can set an unreasonable expectation.  ETN being alittle over 1 cent, or at 1 cent, at lauch and after the lauch, is not unreasonable.  The large majority of projects that are funded by ICOs fail. Most new coins fail, so sure most do go down when they hit an exchange.  The opposite is also important to remember:  $200 gets you 20,000 ETN coins on the last day of the Electroneum crowdsale.  If if hits an exchange and does well and lets say hit 7 cents in a month or so, then $200 would only buy you a little over 3000 ETN coins.  Nobody knows for sure what will happen, because no one can see the future. So, its up to each potential investor to research and choose for themselves, what outcome will be mosy likely.",False

I have dove some modifications to give you my personal answer  You wrote about half page , and you only talked about marketing. Marketing is nothing, the product should be the holding column of it's value. Marketing is letting people know abou it. But if they know ,and don't like it, even billions in marketing will not save you .  The problem that Electroneum(and all the crypto world) HAVE TO solve First problem is that people don't even know cryptos Another problem is that people have difficulty in understanding cryptos, and also the process is difficult and long for a normal person... And that's true. Moreover there is not very good info in native language...All the sites are in english , and lot's of people that i know don't know english(and this is the first barrier that i have seen). Also the  volatility scares the hell out of the people....I buy 1BTC today at 4000, and tomorrow is 3500.... When you have 5$ in your pocket and you lose them you get mad. Imagine 500$(and you have to wait or sell low)... This is why people don't want to use it.........they can trade it, hold it, but it's not for daily use.......Absolutely not.. I will stop here , or i will go longer than you    Can electroneum actually solve this problem? Absolutely not. Electroneum is not even close to solve this problem from what i have read, and informed. The only thing Electroneum will do, is putting some coins in every smartphone, so people get used to crypto(GET USED, NOT USE). THAT'S ALL.   So people will try to send and recieve, and talk about that. Nothing more. Why it's not solving it? Well people still have to BUY electroneum if they want to use it...AND TO BUY ELECTRONEUM they are forced to go to the same process like buying Bitcoins. You have to put fiat. So you have to go to Coinbase and so on, and so on ... So the buying problem is not solved... Probably they will get 10$ a month for mining on cell. in westen countries is nothing. In poor countries? Well as someone said: if 10$ are high, how the hell do they have a cell with internet connection(that you have to pay). So the mining impact in personal economy is very small. Electroneum will ofer you about 2-3 cups of coffiee . Which is not bad for doing nothing(however you still have to pay internet, for getting those coffies )  The power of viral adoption The worst that can happen to a long period project. Pokemon was great for a couple of months, now people talk about it as history..All people that i know have unistalled it, or don't even open it. We want electroneum to be used and continue for years  Price forecast Only God  knows it.  Conclusions Electroneum is just a way to introduce crypto to the masses, to the people. That's all at the moment I personally have invested in this project, and i think is a great project But it's not the next Bitcoin(as his CEO said,very fairly, i appreciated that),  and AT THE ACTUAL STAGE it will not solve problems that the crypto world is trying to solve for years without success. The problem will be solved when i can use crypto easily like fiat. Not gonna happen for at least 5-10 years or even more in my opinon.",False

Great post.  In this case, they are actually getting a crypto in their possession first, and then they are left with options, and its usually the opposite.  For some that will be it. It wont be enough to really grab their attention once they do the math. Some.  I also believe that many will see that they are getting real coins, and then see how one of their old phones stuffed in the back of a kitchen drawer stack up compared to just using the one cell phone.  Some will take it a step farther, and use the point and click GUI miner on their home computer and start taking things to the next level.  Some will see the reaction of their circle of friends, and will come to the conclusion that this is going to be the next big thing, and then follow the steps to get some Bitcoin so they can invest and be an early adopter as well.   The Main DIFFERENCE is that they have already downloaded the app, they are already mining some coin. Although its a small amount THEY ALREADY HAVE ELECTRONEUM.  Its a big difference because they are already in the sales funnel.  @maxicripto  I quoted your post because some of it we share the same opinions, and some we dont. But that is FINE. We both are supporters of ETN, investors of the coin, and expect to see it have great success.  Your observations about the logistics of some people being able to mine are realistic, although I believe most will find a way.  I agree on the marketing points in the sense that, if you have a bad product, or a bad message, sometimes marketing can only help so much.  We have seen great ideas that no one ever heard about, and weve seen projects that have legs, but send an ineffective message.  In other industries we see sub-par products, with top notch marketing, destroy their competition even though their product actually has less VALUE than their competition.  What makes me so excited is this IS a first, with the mobile mining experience. You get REAL crypto coins using your cellphone. It measures what available power the phone would have to mine, then takes that number and uses it allocate how many coins your phone gets. Yes, the mobile mining is centralized, but the regular miners on their home computers is decentralized.  The moblie mining experience is ABSOLUTELY GENIUS!!!  It can be mining in the background, or you can play the mining game and get bonus coins.  All this is such a big DIFFERENCE from just telling someone that its going to be the best new thing since sliced bread.  Imagine if GO was able to make the game better as more people started playing it, because thats what will happen with ETN.  In LONG TERM projections, it is realistic to estimate that Electroneum can end up with more users than Bitcoin, BUT at the same time it also may have only have a quarter of its marketcap or even 10% is possible. In this Long Term estimate I think it also important to note that Bitcoin, IMO, will continue to see dramatic growth. It seems Bitcoin only does BETTER as smaller projects show shockingly high ROI from the crowdsales (but thats with the large majority of new projects failing in the ROI category. Also, Ethereum sees some of this effect as well.  For so long, so many thought it would be Bitcoin or another coin would take its place. What a lot of people didnt expect is to see these ""smaller"" projects, years down the road to blow past what Bitcoins marketcap was when they launched, only to see Bitcoins marketcap only contine to GAIN overall dominance when comparing Bitcoin to all other cryptos combined. Coinmarketcap.com  Nevertheless, ETN passing Bitcoin just in number of users, is realistic IMO, and will get ETN ton of press in MAINSTREAM NEWS when that happens.  So people like us, who understand marketcap and what the difference is, can do the math. So they dont hear us screaming MOON/$100 per coin/ lambo!!!-confirmed!!! LOL  But we do have REAL WORLD MARKETERS, whos international clients are household names in their ""day job"", and they have the know-how and experience to get a clear and effective message that will move them into the sales funnel.  Im thinking 2 to 3 years for crypto in general to take off, instead of 5 to 10, but who am I to say, this is just my opinion of the market in general, and I could be as wrong.  I just think crypto is at turning point right now, over the the next 2 to 3 years and possibly even sooner, there will be a world wide awakening!!  I see it starting already. I guess we will see.  Its great to see you @MaxiCripto and all the others with meaningful posts. @CryptoMido as well. Lets keep our referral code in just the signature, as this exact review you should post on all othe social linked on my next post.

You dont have to be #1 to still have fun promoting ETN and get rewarded for doing so.",False

I will explain the reasons why I have went all in on Electroneum, and why I see this as the ultimate crypto currency to invest in for the long run. I have read alot of misinformation, alot of misconceptions and misunderstanding about this project, so I have decided to tackle all of that and explain why I believe this crypto will be in the top 50 cryptos in the 6-12 months.  The problem that Electroneum will solve  So as you all know, for a successfull cryptocurrency to prosper, there must first be a problem that is being solved by the cryptocurrency. What electroneum solves in an elegant way is that it makes the access of cryptos accessible to the masses without any additional unnecessary hassles. You dont have to send your passport, make all the shenanigans to simply buy and hold a token. It appeals to the people that wants to get into the action right at the moment, and it does that with class. My background is in computer engineering and I am currently a software developer at a company. When I got into cryptos 4 months ago in June, my coworkers started to advice me not enter as they saw it as a bubble and it would burst etc etc. So the months went an, and I managed to turn a %350 return on my investment in 2 months. When my coworker that sat next behind me knew that, he was surprised and i saw the excitment in his eyes, he wanted to get in as well! So he asked me ""How do I get hold of those Bitcoins?"" I told him well, you need to first register to an exchange, send your details... etc (many steps). At that point he was more reluctant to invest - it was simply alot to do to get in the game. Fast forward 1 month, and I manage to make a %500 return on my investment. When he knew that, he said to me ""Ok i dont give a crap how much it will take to get hold of those bitcoins, i just want to get in"". So i showed him all the steps, and he finally after some days of administrative work managed to get hold of 1 bitcoin, and is still holding it.  So, just imagine now - if the accessibility of cryptos gets much easier, how many will invest? I believe millions!!!!. We are naturally lazy, and we want to get into the action but with no effort, that is what electroneum will achieve. The massive viral widespread usage of electroneum will give the company legitimacy and it will give it a great amount of leverage to actually get in touch with the gambling/gaming companies for them to accept electronuem as a token for their services. Once the electronuem app has achieved hundreds of thousands of users, or millions, the gaming/gambling companies will pour them selves into electroneum because the gambling gaming communities actually do want for a way to monetize the people that have access to a smartphone but not a bank account. This way, the gaming/gambling communities will actually find a way to profit from that abundantly large group of people. This will increase the demand of electroneum ultimately in the long run. The need for micropayments to allow these groups of people to game/gamble is HUGE and once the electroneum app has gone viral, I believe it will be widely adopted by the top gambling/gaming companies out there because there is already a widespread usage of electroneum.  Can electroneum actually solve this problem?  Now that we know what problem electroneum is set to solve, the natural followup question is: Do they have what it takes to solve it?. Now that is a good and valid question to ask, and my answer to that question is simply - YES. So, why do I think they have the ability to solve that problem? First, once must ask, to get the viral adoption of an app/product, what is actually needed? Well, you need to have good marketing strategy, and more importantly, a team that has people that has a track-record of knowing how to do marketing, a team that sees marketing as a vital component in the total longevity of the product. These are all something that electroneum has and exceeds with! First, the CEO of electroneum Richard Ells has another company ""Retortal"" that has over 20 years of experience in doing marketing for companies that are in the top fortune 500 companies. This man lives and breathes marketing, his company is today worth 50 million dollars, so he knows his stuff. This is a very good first sign that the company is set to tackle the goal of getting the app virally adopted in the future. Furthermore, in the team of electroneum, there are 4 other members that have a long trackrecord of marketing, all ranging from social media marketing, to viral marketing strategists, PR marketing, promoting awareness and brand recognition and exposure. The members have over 15+ of experience in these domains of marketing, and most of them have already been working with Richard Ells in Retortal to levarage marketing solutions to many famous companies today. This is a very good sign that the team actually has what it takes to achieve their goals. They actually, legitimately have the knowledge, skillset and the manpower needed to put this app to viral use. They have the team that have been doing this successfully for so long, so they do have what it takes.  This is in my opinion enormous. I have been invested in multiple cryptos that wish to make their crypto product adopted by the masses, but they never really had the marketing know-how to achieve their goals. Take a look at SIA for instance, In essence, I think that SIA solves a very pertinent problem; namely, decentralized storage. This is a good usecase that has demand. But here is the problem with SIA, they dont invest in marketing! They simply dont think its important, they think it should grow organically. In june when I first began to invest, I went in with a enormous investment in SIA, and it actually went up to almost $600 million in market cap. But then it began to decline, and delcline, and decline, so I had to pull out with a loss. Today, it has gone down 84.25% from the top that it reached in June. The reason? Bad marketing/PR strategy. They simply did not invest in PR/Marketing! That was their nail in the coffin - for now.  But with electroneum, they have the equivalent of the NBA All-star team of marketing strategists that will tackle every aspect of marketing that is needed to make this product viral. These guys actually have a track-record, so we know they can deliver. Furthermore, they think that marketing is actually a vital thing to have in a crypto - something that many cryptos dont care about! Overall, I think that they are currently in a much more superior state than many of the existing cryptos today, and more importantly, I think that they are more than capable of solving their proposed problem.  The power of viral adoption  So viral marketing, how is it good? It is important to understand that viral marketing is the utilization of marketing strategies to make an app/product reach exponential growth rather than linear growth. This has been done before for other apps such as ""Pokemon GO"". I think that almost anyone reading this will know what I am talking about. There was a period last year in which you would see people walking around like zombies trying to catch some random pokemon! Sometimes these people would gather in one spot because some popular pokemon showed up, looked hilarious. But anyways, Pokemon GO is  a prime example of how viral marketing can have an impact on a product. In the period of only 6 months, the pokemon GO app increased from only 225 thousand to 100+ millions! This is simply incredible! But that is the power of viral marketing, and the power of exponential growth on an app. It just went crazy on the downloads. So what does it really takes for an app to go viral? In essence, it requires a simple plot, a simple task that is easy to understand by the average simple man, and that will provide satisfaction once completed. In the case of Pokemon GO, the simple task was to catch pokemons. It was simple, and easy to understand by anyone. The satisfaction it provided was the gamification rewards that the person achieved the more pokemons that was catched. This kept the player in the game and more eager to catch more.  In the case of electroneum, the exact same concept is applied. Their game app that is to be launched on 1 Nov is a very simple game that can be understood by the average simple man. The game allows the user to ""mine"" in return of rewards of real electroneum tokens. So here we are at the gamification concepts, that in essence incentivize the user to keep on playing and getting more rewards. This is what will drive the app to go viral, people will just not get enough of this as ""free money"" appeals to everybody.  So one of the misconceptions that many people have about this is that since everybody will mine for the coin, they will directly exchange it to fiat and dump it and thus decreasing the value of the coin. This is simply not the case. The cryptonote algorithm works in a way such that the more that is mined, the more harder it will be to get more tokens - just like with any other cryptos. So no, there simply will not be a mass dumpage of coins. Again, what is important to note here that the purpose of this game is to hook the players to electroneum. This way, once electronuem has gathered a massive amount of users, electroneum can easily go gaming/gambling industries and show them that they have a large user-base. This will entice the gaming/gambling industries to use electroneum as a means of getting payments, and thus monetizing the hundreds of millions of people around the world that does have access to a smartphone but not a bank account.  Price forecast  I have an educated guess on the future price of electronuem, and I think it is very like that we achieve that goal. First, we need to understand that we are currently in a huge crypto market boom. According to the veteran trader ""Francis Hunt"" - a guy that has traded FX for 30+ years and have recently joined the cryptospace and smashed in hoardes of profit, he has stated that the marketcap will reach around 1 trillion dollars by the end of 2018. This is based on the variety of asset managers that he is working with, and he knows his stuff. So simply by virtue of a 5-7 expanding market in the cryptospace, we can assume that the volume will on average increase with 5-7 times for the top cryptocurrencies. With that in mind, if the viral adoption of electroneum will be a fact (which I think is extremely likely) I think that this will increase the value of the coin with atleast x20 times within the first 12 months of its launch.  So if we assume a conservative hypothesis of a 1 trillion marketcap by the end of 2018, and the success of the viral adoption of electroneum and the ongoing collabs with gaming/gambling companies, I can easily see a x50 - x70 on this coin within the first 12 months of its launch, meaning a coin valuation of $0.5 or around $0.7. This is very achievable. We need to understand that we are in an expanding market. just look at what monero for instance was valued at dec 2015, it was ~$2 million dollars. Today, $1350 million dollars, which is an increase of 270 times! This trend will most likely continue.  Conclusions  So to conclude my statements, I think that across all ICO's that exist, this is definately the most promising one out there, electroneum simply seem to have everything that needs to make this project a home run! They have the problem to be solved, which is clearly stated, the perfect dreamteam to solve it, the skillset the manpower and the experience to achieve it! Unlike 90% of all cryptos out there, they know the power of marketing, they know how important it is for the longevity of the crypto product and the need for it to be mass adopted out there. They have their minds on the right track. I have never really invested in an ICO before because 99% of them are scams. I have neither went all in a crypto before, let alone an ICO - this serves as a token of my uncompromising commitment to electroneum and my evangelical enthusiasm to get its benefits to the masses that are on the edge of investing in it but have some questions or doubts! This project will be a homerun - mark my words.

I'll check out the app - this is the app mining game that's the focus for getting viral correct? Is it available on the istore?  Regarding point number 2 - It's not that I'm looking at it from a short term lens, I'm just deciding whether I should invest in the ICO now or buy it from an exchange later. If there is an upside to buying into the ICO I would like to know - because with the current developments it looks like I would get more value when this hits exchanges. Either way as of now I intend to contribute.  Regarding point number 3 - unless a coin possesses inherent use value - for example people buy ethers to invest in ICOs; this is a use value for ethers, and this drives the price of ethers up.  In the case of electroneum, there seems to be a lot of focus into viral marketing and mining, which means lot of coins being out there with probably only speculative value, and no inherent use value. In the white paper there are mentions of intent of targeting gaming and gambling sectors as use cases but no further details, and it seems to me it will take a long time for inherent use value to be built up.  My personal analysis is that this is a good project, with a good team, but with a long way to go so I believe I would get more value investing later on rather than the ICO, unless the devs can elaborate otherwise.  And most white papers / ico websites have comparisons of similar concepts and competitors, I was wondering if there is a differentiation between electroneum and aeon; I have no investment in aeon but it seems to be similar. I certainly hope mentioning another coin is not shilling.",False

I like the idea of marketing through an app and making it viral to bring it to the masses - I don't know how likely it'll be successful and wish the app would have been available to investors to try out because that seems to be electroneum's USP.  The reason I haven't invested in this is -  (1) I haven't seen the app  (2) If the idea is to make this viral a lot of people are going to get cheap/almost free coins and there's going to be a huge dump in the market bringing the value of investors in the ICO down.  (3) Most of the initial budget seems to be geared towards app marketing and development - hardly anything for customer acquisition (I mean 'use case' customers, not app customers) - which will give electroneum ultimately its value  If this is marketed virally and people start to dump people will start to lose faith in it. I hope I'm mistaken and there is an immediate use case solution to drive up the value which will in it's own way encourage viral marketing further since it will drive up value of the coin.  Also, is there any difference between the coin itself seems to be very similar to aeon.cash, I would be interested in knowing the differences. Aeon also markets itself as a mobile friendly cryptocurrency and it is also based on the Cryptonote algorithm.",False

Why did I invest in electroneum?  1) I think the CEO Richard is a marketing genius:  By using ""Duncan Logan as a backup for electroneum"" on the website he increased the trust of the potential investors. They also set the number of total coins to 21 billion instead of bitcoins 21 million. The concept that the unsold coins are added to a pool for the mobile mining is short-term diluting the number of coins in circulation, but in the long run, it helps to increase the user base. The fact, that ETN coins are normal numbers instead of bitcoins decimal numbers. And at last, the ICO itself is very very easy!  2) 3 different groups who will be attracted to mine the coin  The concept of mining coins via a mobile is totally new and will attract a lot of new people to electroneum. A lot of people who heard from tech savvy friends about bitcoins are going to be very curious and try it out. Furthermore, I can see the youth (10-18 years old) mining their pocket money (and maybe their parents are getting curious too lol). People who live in developed countries will mine via mobile and try to make a side job with it (3-5$ is in some countries a lot of money). The last group will be investors who believe that longterm the coin will be worth much more than the 1 cent (The first people who mined bitcoin did pretty well). All this will give electroneum publicity in magazines and news.  3) The fact that you can transfer your electroneum easy with the help of your phone number similar to WhatsApp is awesome! People who can´t sell their coins via an exchange can transfer it easily to someone who can do it for them (or sell it to someone cheaper than the rate of the exchanges, transfer it to that person and that person can make money via himself selling it at the exchanges)  4) Plenty of usability for electroneum The company will start in the gaming industry (You can cash out your virtual currency in a game by exchanging it to electroneum, afterward you can buy with the electroneum new virtual currency in another game). Once a couple of gaming companies using electroneum and the people like the concept, the other companies have no choice but to integrate the coin also. After the gaming industry, the company will target the gambling industry (people who don´t have a bank account can use electroneum to use gambling platforms and if they win transfer it to someone who has a bank account and get cash for it).  Conclusion: I think this ICO will NOT make huge gains straight after the 1 of November, because of the high supply of the coins. But it has huge long-term potential due to the ability to get to the average Joe. My gut feeling tells me that electroneum is going to be listed right after Bitcoin and Ethereum with a price target of 1$ to 3$ by the end of 2018!

I am posting because I want to give my perspective on Electroneum. I believe it to be a fantastic innovation and here is why.  About me  I work for a consulting company in Melbourne, Australia. We are involved in investigating and consulting on the future application of both cryptocurrency and blockchain technology in wide arrange of industry sectors, most notably financial services. I am also a qualified accountant. The views in this post are my own, not that of the company.  What is different about Electroneum?  Electroneum offers something no other cryptocurrency has - the ability to mine with a mobile phone (without it blowing up), and, potentially in the future, the ability to mine with an Xbox or Playstation. This gives Electroneum an amazing advantage over competitors - it is a cryptocurrency that is accessible to everyday mums, dads, and kids for the first time ever. The ability for individuals to easily mine and store a cryptocurrency is a huge step forward in technology and should not be sniffed at. In particular, I think that the ability to mine with gaming consoles is particularly exciting because consoles are constantly connected to a secure Wifi and are more powerful than phones. The latest Xbox to be produced will be very powerful indeed: https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/store/d/xbox-one-x-1tb-console-project-scorpio-edition/8zjh508rnql0  Why being accessible to the mass market is important for investors in Electroneum  Put simply, if the mass consumer market is able to hold Electroneum via simple mining (which, given customers will be able to mine from their phone and maybe gaming consoles which for the consumer is essentially free money...), this creates a demand for vendors to offer Electroneum as a payment method. This is particularly applicable to gaming companies and gambling companies, both markets worth tens of billions in annual revenue. This is something that could gain traction very quickly. There is a huge incentive for anyone who owns a gaming console or a Smartphone to download the app and start mining immediately - it is free cash after all and people would be stupid not to.  Why people may demand this currency  Developers will want to gain access to this huge potential marketplace of new currency. Part of the reason they will do this is because if people can buy things (e.g. gambling money or gaming cash) directly from their Electroneum wallets, they will not need to involve themselves in cold storage or other technical areas of cryptocurrency ownership and this is attractive to both the consumer and the developer. For example, in Australia if William Hill opened up their gambling site to accepting Electroneum, I would always deposit any mining amounts earned straight into my William Hill account as this, for me, turns it into cash. William Hill can then choose to pay customers in Electroneum when they withdraw or sell it to other consumers of Electroneum. Additionally, online/mobile gamers will be potentially able to use Electroneum across multiple games, allowing them to pay for virtual currency across multiple games rather than put it all into 1 for a single purchase. It will also allow them to transfer currency between games, with developers incentivised to allow this with spread commissions. As a mobile gamer, I know I would be much more likely to purchase gaming currency if I could move it later if I got sick of the game.  The marketing  The marketing for Electroneum has been second to none. Paired with a simple to use app, there could potentially be hundreds of thousands of users very quickly. This means hundreds of thousands of potential sellers and buyers. Raising awareness of Electroneum not just in consumer circles but corporate circles is essential to the success of this currency and they have made a fantastic start. The intention from the funds raised (it is already in the $5m-$10m range) is to translate it into over 30 languages - this is unprecedented and will tap into many markets that other currencies just cannot get involved with. Additionally, this will only help in their pursuit of getting corporates to accept Electroneum. When they are able to get a few signed up (which will take time initially as corporates begin to see the value due to the mass-consumer mining interest in the currency), it will quickly gain traction with others who wish to keep up.  Gaming strategy  The strategy to integrate with online gaming virtual currency purchases will take time. However, once some companies are on board, the idea of being able to transfer game currency between games is unique and innovative and is the future of online gaming. This is particularly attractive for game suppliers who make multiple games - allowing players to transfer virtual currency in the form of electroneum between games and earning commission on the spreads will encourage them to be content with players switching games that they play etc and encourage multiple purchases. Cross-marketing will become even more important. This also works extremely well for the consumer who will feel like they are paying less for virtual currency if they are able to take it to another game, and with integration between gaming apps and the exchange it will assist with encouraging people to actually purchase in-game products. Electroneum state that only 1.9% of mobile gamers purchase products in-game - if this was even doubled to 3.8% there is a huge gain to be made for developers.  Gambling Strategy  Mobile mining opens up the ability for many people to easily obtain Electroneum which could be transferred into a gambling account. This is particularly exciting for countries where bank accounts are limited - i.e. developing nations. Also, for gambling companies, the ability to identify an extremely convenient and risk-free method of getting more money into people's gambling accounts is exciting. People are basically mining Electroneum and getting it for free, and if they can put that 'free' money into a gambling account, bookmakers will be very happy indeed. The focus here is of course on the success of simple mobile and desktop mining.  Conclusion  As I stated at the top, my company is very interested in future applications of crypto technology. This is one of those futuristic ideas that is here right now and that is why I have invested my money into Electroneum.  If you appreciated my thoughts, my referral link is in my signature. By using a referral code you get an extra 1% on your purchase.  Thanks for your time reading.",False

Any one that has been involved in network or telecommunications technology knows that the basic ""value"" of any network grows proportional to 2^n. This is also known as Metcalfe's law. (Look it up). This is a rule that has been understood well since the early era of telecommunications. Believe it or not, people used to scoff at the idea that the telephone would ever be that useful because in the early days, there weren't that many of them around and they were very expensive to implement. So, when people and organizations looked at buying into the technology, the cost to value ratio seemed so high. Of course, we see this dilemma with every network ever built. For example, if one is to look at the value of Facebook on February 4, 2004 when Mark Zuckerberg released it to the public, at one point, there were only 2 people using it. At that point it was not worth very much but impregnated in the source code DNA (which even Zuckerberg admitted he didn't know the power of at the time), was the inherent tendency for the system to go viral. The key ingredients for Facebook viral effect were the ""relationship status"" and the fact that you initially had to have a @harvard.edu email address to be allowed on the system. Turns out that the whole world wanted to be on a network where they could discover the relationship status of the ""high value"" Harvard grads. When that caught on, in a very short period of time, every Harvard student had signed up and Mark Zuckerberg needed to find more fresh meat. They naturally expanded exclusively to one ivy league school after another and then on to more public universities. Eventually it was published for worldwide use, but this caused a ""crystalline-like"" growth structure which is also known as the largest social network in the world. It currently has a market value of over 500 billion USD. If you really think about it, Facebook is just a network comprised of 1s and 0s and each and every participant in the network, added together, create its overall value. The primary value of that network is in its DNA. Facebook is uniquely comprised of people using their real names and seems to be an overlay of the real world interactions we all have. That was its secret to success.  Every network has to be evaluated for its inherent ability to go viral. But what about cryptocurrency? All crypto assets are networks but they are not always necessarily viral in nature. They all improve in value as the number of participants increases. We have seen bitcoin grow at a slow viral pace for several years. Network viral spread can grow rapidly at first and then flame out as we have seen in many fad-like systems (e.g. hotornot.com). It can take many years to increase in popularity, but still be viral in nature (the internet itself), and then develop rapid adoption. All of us are familiar with these growth patterns.  So all of us have high hopes in electroneum and believe it can go viral. We have seen numerous systems go viral as piggy-backs to known viral systems such as tinder or pinterest. In the case of electroneum, the developers have sensed that a system needed to be built to piggy-back on the smartphone sensation. Nobody has done this before. When I told my son (in passing) about this new electroneum idea, he was instantly excited about it and I later learned that he had recruited 7 of his buddies to get in on it. They went out and bought small fractions of bitcoin or ethereum, and then bought into the ICO. They are very excited to play the game itself and have assembled all the android devices that they can find to download the mining app once it is available. I suspect several of those 7 friends of his have told their respective friends. This all came about from me telling him about this almost accidentally! When I saw this effect myself, I had to double down on my investment in electroneum. In addition, I have personally referred 5 other people to invest with very little effort. They all have stakes in the ICO now.  We have been informed that during the last 2 hours of the 40% bonus phase, over 100,000 visitors went to the site and the servers went down because of it. One of the hallmarks of some of the greatest viral systems ever to be invented ---> ...at some point, servers are overloading or crashing. Happened to Facebook. Happened in the early days to Google.  Bitcoin is hovering between 70 and 100 billion in market value. It is the most trusted and widely used cryptocurrency. There are millions of users and the value of that system will only grow over time as we have seen. But as has been correctly pointed out, cryptocurrency has remained in reach primarily for the technologically elite among us. There has never been a coin invented for the masses. I personally believe that the general tendency of cryptocurrency enthusiasts is inherently anarchist. Most of them don't want to play ball with the real world. For Richard and the gang to take this leap into legitimacy represents a counter-intuitive movement which I believe is a step in the right direction. We will see crypto assets be a multi-trillion dollar market cap eventually. Right now, gold has a market cap of over 8 trillion. We are still in the infancy phase of this technology ecosystem and anyone investing now will be considered the pioneers of the movement and ultimately very wealthy.  When people suggest that electroneum could hit 5-10 dollars each, I suspect we would need to see a network effect of at least 2 million people on the system for that to happen. Should this become ""the Facebook of cryptocurrency"", where we see mass downloads, adoption, and we see it used in real world commerce, this thing could see its market cap go into the trillions itself. I have said for years that the system that goes viral and mainstream will be a multi-trillion dollar network. If it isn't electroneum, it will be something that closely resembles it.   ABOUT ME: I am enthusiastically invested in electroneum. My background is mathematics. I am currently a physician. I love the concept and am very excited for November 1st. I have to say I think the value of the electroneum ecosystem has the potential to go up substantially since it is going to be so easy to get into it! I have already told at least a dozen people about this that plan to download the app on November 1st and start mining. Most of these people have been way too intimidated over the years as I have told them about other cryptocurrencies. Even though they have marveled at the value of bitcoin rising over the years, this concept is the first time I have been able to get traction with these people. For example, my best friend that has wanted to get involved in bitcoin for years, has now decided that he is investing $200,000 in this ICO. This will be his first step into the world of crypto. This is a guy that I told to buy bitcoin when they were a few dollars each and he didn't. I have been involved in cryptocurrency early enough that I originally mined bitcoin on my laptop. I have seen the evolution of crypto assets with a front row seat. I believe that cryptocurrency will supplant sovereign currency in time. It is more viable for world-wide asset securing than any technology we have seen before and fiat will simply not be able to compete with it over time. I have been very selective in my investments. All of them so far have paid out handsomely. My investments to date have been bitcoin (2009), NXT (2013), Litecoin (2012), Ardor/Ignis (2016), and now electroneum (2017).

In those distant days before twerking went mainstream, Hanyecz estimated that each Bitcoin his computer had earned through basically crunching numbers was worth a fraction of a cent, like the cash value of a coupon you might receive in the mail, only much less. ----------------------------  The source article is  https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2013/12/23/the-bitcoin-pizza-purchase-thats-worth-7-million-today/#3495c8022509",False

I will very likely continue to buy more coins.  Also, I would like to point out one stark distinction about this ICO in that they are not giving themselves any coins (correct if I am wrong- as I didn't see anything in the whitepaper regarding this point).   One aspect of current ICOs that is extremely pissing me off is that many are not only collecting funds from the coin/token sales, but they are also allocating close to 50% of the coins to themselves as well which translates into extreme greed and the centralization of the coins - which allows for massive dumps by them.

Hard constants and magic numbers in the code deter the system’s evolution and therefore should be eliminated (or at least be cut down to the minimum). Every crucial limit (like max block size or min fee amount) should be re-calculated based on the system’s previous state. Therefore, it always changes adaptively and independently, allowing the network to develop on it’s own. Electroneum’s CryptoNote has the following parameters which adjust automatically for each new block: 1. Difficulty. The general idea of our algorithm is to sum all the work that nodes have performed during the last 720 blocks and divide it by the time they have spent to accomplish it. The measure of the work is the corresponding difficulty value for each of the blocks. The time is calculated as follows: sort all the 720 timestamps and cut-off 20% of the outliers. The range of the rest 600 values is the time which was spent for 80% of the corresponding blocks. 2. Max block size. Let MN be the median value of the last N blocks sizes. Then the “hard-limit” for the size of accepting blocks is 2*MN. It averts blockchain bloating but still allows the limit to slowly grow with the time if necessary. Transaction size does not need to be limited explicitly. It is bounded by the size of the block.    Smooth emission  The upper bound for the overall amount of all digital coins is also digital: MSupply = 264 − 1 atomic units This is a natural restriction based only on the implementation limits, not on intuition like “N coins ought to be enough for everybody”. To make the emission process smoother electroneum’s CryptoNote uses the following formula for block rewards: BaseReward = (MSupply − A) >> 18 Where A is amount of previously generated coins. It gives a predictable growth of the money supply without any breakpoints.",False

However, you bring up many good points/questions and ones that I mulled over myself before entering the ICO.  Regarding the payment for 'mining' (or rewarding/staking from what it sounds like per Richard's interview?) I think that if this coin becomes valuable enough to raise the value of mining, then it will become a bit of a snowball effect wouldn't it?  We can try to predict how much the price per coin will be but it really is based on the volume of people using the currency and if millions of people are actively using and mining the system will become self sustaining and quite powerful.   However, I believe your skepticism is in the 'how' aspect and that is what ultimately will make or break this project.  How exactly will the Electroneum team convince millions upon millions of everyday humans to go to their app store, download Electroneum and mine away until their eyes bleed?  I guess that is what we will have to find out and I'm betting that these guys will figure it out...",False

You are NOT ""getting it""  Networks of millions of people are powerful and have VALUE.  The whole idea is for them to change the ETN for fiat, to get the free money. OR to hold and wait for the value to go up even more which it will.  All of your arguments were made against Bitcoin, and what happened? You are making arguements the have been reahashed and proven wrong since the very beginning.  And you say if you have an app that gave out free money you would have millions of downloads too.

And colluder (with friends). Especially with friends. Thinks mighty of himself but is POS and a loser basicly.  He has publicly admitted this and that he is a shill, and I say so what. True he and his friends might get in at a 20% discount or so, but if the coin is going to go up 10x I don't mind. He has done the research and truly believes in the project and is sharing his ideas. He has generally been spot on, so ignore his ideas at your own lost opportunity.  A # of coins he brought to light I was already in, so I know he is giving quality advice. I wish I was following him when he recommended DCR at like 40 cents , that was like a 100x recommendation.  Those were calls made at the beginning of the year.  Anybody could have said any shitcoin was going to spike, and guess what?, it would have.  Those calls prove nothing.   Nothing he's called recently has made any real movement like that.  Maybe he's using his previous ""success"" and legendary status to get all the noobs to buy in to spike a coin while he sells?  How is that not plausible?  See below.   Do you actually think somebody is really worried about making sure a bunch of random people on the internet know what the good coins are so they can make money?  Occam's Razor.     Quote from: dadonn on September 17, 2017, 02:44:51 AM  Is OP able to stop people from buying and selling? Do you know how to spell the word basically? Why do you not believe in pronouns and insist upon incomplete sentences? Can you bring forth any evidence that can substantiate the legally slanderous claims in a public forum that someone is a ""fraud,"" and a ""piece of shit"" and a ""loser?"" Do you think one individual is wielding enough influence to manipulate entire markets by sharing his perspective on a forum that represents a tiny percentage of potential buyers? Or perhaps you falsely believe that the promotion of a coin in 140 characters or less is doing that job via Twitter?  Can you answer any of these questions? Can you please think twice before making libelous/defamatory comments that you could be held responsible for?   Held responsible for libelous comments?? LOLLLLLLLLLLLL.  Give me a fucking break.    As for one individual holding enough influence to manipulate a single coin, YES, it's possible.  Go look at some of the coins he has posted about and compare the rises in the coins compared with the timestamps of the start of the threads.  It's no coincidence, they just happen to start rising at the same time.  When people think they are going to get rich because he made some ""good"" calls in the past and they see he is legendary they are going to all pile in like stupid noobs.  Look at the people buying after he posts, like most of this forum, it's full of brain dead idiots.  People post in his threads all the time, it's been 2 days, why hasn't this gone up a lot yet?  When is it going to moon?  Should I sell?  Like they buy shit and just expect it to go 10x instantly because they are dumb noobs with a get rich quick attitude who can't think for themselves.    It's not hard to find coins where almost all the volume takes place on bittrex and/or polo and shill those.  I've seen some coins spike 10-20% after he posts about them.  You'll say, that's not a big deal, why would he care about that?  But when you're playing with big money that 10-20% is a lot of money.  He could be accumulating a coin for weeks at a low price and then post about it and dump it for an almost guaranteed profit.  You could dump 10-20k into a coin and make thousands of dollars in a couple days (or hours) from making ONE post but most of the plebs don't have that kind of money to play with so they don't think about it like that.

I've been invested in Crypto for over a year, but nothing makes me more mad than knowing I could have sold and bought back in to accumulate more.  Bought 5000 Sys @ .00003447, sold today at .00006630.  Hoping to see it drop to 6400 to buy back in. Prayers to the crypto gods  you do great job with the basic of trading strategies. you can buy in lower price at 3447 satoshi and you sell at 6630 satoshi. yes I am sure soon the price will drop but I don't think the price will be down into 34xx satoshi, maybe its about 4xxx satoshi and you can buy back again and make a good profit like before. but you need to be careful because sometimes if the price is down, the price is down for more but you don't have to worried because the price is always increase as long as there is nothing bad happen in the market.  So far, so good. It's currently at 6300 sats on Bittrex. I still have not bought in, but I am watching the price like a hawk. Anything I do from this point on will just maximize my profits. I do believe in Syscoin which is why I'll be buying back in.  Why don't you just put in a conditional buy order and let bittrex do it for you instead of wasting your time checking it every 10 minutes?

It's been largely unaffected by the panic.  There are better coins to invest in right now that actually dropped 20-30%.    Yeah and I bet their all expensive as shit. And oh, they don't have a timeline for releases. Tell us a coin you think everyone should buy then. Anyways, people will see the value soar in a few hours.  Depends on what you call expensive.  Look at the 7 day chart, it's been all over the place.  It can fall just as easily as it spiked in the last few hours.  What reason are you giving for it to spike right now?     Quote from: Olishka on September 05, 2017, 06:04:02 AM Actually you better invest on coins like Verge which resist crackdown than the big loosers because their price is halved in few days.. It means people don't believe those coins are actually good enough for the future but just bought them for speculation.  Verge is still dirt cheap  and will keep rising   Not really the best comparison.  It's hard to say how much it was affected exactly because it hasn't been stable for the last week or so.  I'd asssume it wouldn't be affected as much anyways because it's 115 sat coin.  How much lower in price can it really go?

I like your enthusiasm and I think we should be friends.    Maybe I should have put a smiley on the waves post because it was sarcasm.   I thought that was clear since I said a price that was like 3x what the current price was at the time and the timeline was only a couple weeks ago.  I was mocking all the people who post similar tripe.  I don't even currently hold any waves although I did some months ago.  Edit - Actually looking at what I posted (105k sats) and going back to look at the price when I posted that, I said a price that was almost the exact price (104k sats) at the time.  I meant to post something that was clearly outrageous, obviously I failed in my sarcastic reply.    I know you won't care but this is indeed my one and only account, not a troll account.  Just because I've educated myself doesn't mean I can't be a ""newbie"".  I read about crypto for years before finally getting involved.  I post the things I do because it's frustrating seeing people get taken advantage of or be stupid with their money.  (I'm not saying investing in Electroneum is stupid)  Everyone is so concerned with just making a quick buck that nobody takes the time to understand projects and why they should be supported.  As long as it'll go 10x who cares, right?  I'm in crypto for the long haul.  I don't care about short pumps that'll net me some quick money.  That's why I try to figure things out.    If you would compare the things I've posted here and the things I've posted elsewhere you will see my posting style isn't the same.  I'm not being sarcastic or an asshole in this thread.  I haven't posted in a single Electroneum thread besides this one even though there are tons of threads in the Altcoin section if all I wanted to do was bash the coin.  I'm asking legitimate questions I would like real answers for and if I get good ones then I will invest.  Responses like the one MrPuffnStuff posted are far more likely to get me involved than trying to call me out as something I'm not.    I guess I shouldn't expect (most) people who already invested and that get paid to post about electroneum to try and give me any rational arguments though.    Edit 2 - I PM'd someone just yesterday in this thread asking for a referral code before I invested but I guess I was just trolling in private.",False

I read your diary.  No backpedaling now.  You were outed with your own words.  Understand. I have been doing this a long long long long long time.  @iwouldntknow  Yeah, you most certianly wouldnt know   We know electroeum needs to be accessible to people mining on mobile phones. We all know the result so far, its horrible. They have figured out a way to do this by having a specialized algo and a processor. The people mining with their computers  cpu on the main algo will be powering the blockchain. This means it is still decentrailzed.  Some people may complain that it has a centralized componet to the mobile miners, but it doesnt bother me. Im here with what I see as cryptos first chance to really be taken to the masses. We see they have the tech innovation necessary to come thru on their claims to take mining a cryptocurrency to 2 billion users of mobile devices.  It also cant be cloned as easily, or the innovation stolen with it needing a central processor as well.  They are powerhouse marketers, and now that these guys have added gaming to it as well, they will easily penetrate the market with this.  You can say its not decentralized enough for you, but I think someone would be hard pressed to say this is going to lose you money buying in at $.007  With the app downloads reaching just 5 million users, which is low in that industry, it would have far above the amount of users as Bitcoin. This you bought for $.0067 and Bitcoin is valued at $3950. There will be many LEVELS of those buying and selling as the price establishes itself, which call me crazy, but with:  A. An innovativation in cryptocurrency by being first to sucessfully take effectiive mining mobile.  B. Have the product finished at the time of crowdsale  C.

Once people realize that the coins they are getting have no real value to them unless they go through the hassle of opening up an account in an exchange and figuring out how to transfer funds (for the whole $5 they made after 3 months) which is already one of the major hurdles keeping people out of crypto they'll probably just move on.  Electroneum claims to be the easy way but the road leads there anyways.    The whole widespread usage great  but the app seems nothing more than a marketing ploy when they state their target group is the gaming industry.  That is a relatively small segment of society, not something that will garner widespread adoption of the masses.

They will download the app to get free money, which will be $5 to $8 a month, and not the $1.66 suggested.  You agree we will bring onboard users at a rate crypto has never seen, yes?  You sound like someone from out of the crypto world and these are legit concerns, dont get me wrong, but many cryptos have produced 100x gains +++  that have done much less.  You dont agree that millions of users of an App will bring IMMENSE value to a crypto. I get that for now.  Thats fine that you dont see it that way and all, but there are those that do, which will make it skyrocket in price right there. That value added just by perception, and that happens a lot of times in cryptoland.  But then everyone eventually dumps, right? I do truly understand where you are coming from, as I used to feel the same way.  The difference is this crypto will gain a ton of users just because of the initial buzz. Everyone will want to get free money.  What I would point out here is that on top of that viral effect, marketing Apps in mainstream markets comes down to cost per acquisition, the advertising cost paid per download. It is way way way less than a dollar.  These guys have already paid their own money to design everything ahead of time.  They have first mover advantage as the first crypto mined successfully and safely on a cellphone.  They are in the top on their field (marketing) and they know how to get downloads.  They have already raised 3 million and will end up with 10-15 million.  But you dont argue that, they are gonna get millions of downloads, what you seem to question is what effect that will have on the markets.  They will easily pass Bitcoin in total users, which has never been done. This will generate a ton of press, which will only move the growing snowball down the hill faster.  Will the news that Electroneum passed Bitcoin in amount of users cause ETN to pass Bitcoin in marketcap? No. That will not be enough.  What it will do is reach $1 or so a coin and be worth 10-15% of the marketcap Bitcoin has now.  Why?  Because a network with millions of people has value. The news of having the most crypto users has value. Investors will see it as the next big thing and buyers will flock to the markets.  This will only get it more attention, and the snowball continues to pick up speed and only increase in size.  Bitcoin has 3 million users. ETN will have more. It wont cost $4000 a piece, but those that got in for a penny or less will make absolutely insane ROI that lands ETN on the Top Ten highest ROIs from a tokensale in crypto history.",False

I am tempted to buy Electroneum but only on two conditions. Will mobile mining be available the moment this coin sale ends (within 24 hours.)? When mobile mining begins it absolutely must be phone hardware dependant. What I mean by condition 2 is that if some pleb in his windowless mud hut is mining with a galaxy s2 or Trac phone and I'm mining on a galaxy s8+ I'm hashing at a faster rate than said pleb is.

The team is working through the night of the 31st of October to launch the mobile mining app at midnight. The first minute of the first day of Novemeber (I assume UK timezone) all funds will be available for transfer and mining will commence.  Mobile mining is indeed hardware dependent.

What you are calling mining is just adding blocks to the blockchain and getting rewards from handling the algorithm. Here you handle a twin-algorithm that rewards you coin from running the app. That is the only difference. Likewise it calculates the amount of power your phone could potentially allocate to the app, and calculates the return based on that. So less apps running = the more payout.  Don't you have better things to do, than run around spreading fud and false information in this project?

The other 15 Billion will be mined over years. Any unsold coins are going back in to be mined as well.  The amount of coins is large on purpose and the price in the tokensale reflects that, so all the large suppy is doing, is moving the decimal point over two spots, as compared to Bitcoins 21 million. This was done so that ETN has more of a real world feel to it. So a pizza would be 12.99 ETN as opposed to .00332 BTC.  Its just a more human number.  The tokens are are still less than a cent with the 40% bonus, so 140 ETN for $1.  This is a steal when you look at who the dev is, the App already made, ""First mover"" advantage to successful, safe (for your phone) mining, and the plan they have.

Crypto is in ""competition"" with Applepay, which isnt a cryptocurrency, so they do make coins jump through a lot of hoops to get the App approved.  The dev team has already made the iOS App and have already had talks with Apple.

The mobile mining App, whether it be iOS or Android (which is already on the Playstore but doesnt do much until launch) is centralized and measures the specs and available processing power of your phone, but then doesnt use that ""available power"" but uses it just as a benchmark to calculate the rate and amount of ETN coins you will be rewarded for mining.  They are also putting the fininshing touches on the mining game that users can choose to play to get themselves a few more coins than they would get than if they had just set their miner to mine in the background.   Huge innovation here that cant be stolen because of the App portion not being opensource. However, the blockchain is opensource which is a modified Cryptonote algo used by Monero as you know. So the transactions will be anonymous because of the ring signatures used in Cryptonote.  For a even more detailed description from the dev himself, watch the video below of Richard Ells explaining how it works and why it will quickly gain millions of App downloads which will generate huge press when Electroneum passes Bitcoin in total users of 3 million, which for an App with the powerful marketers behind this coin, would be a small amount of downloads in the App industry.  https://youtu.be/JZ8UfHG5vVw",False

In other words, yes hackers do this, on a mass scale to millions of home computers everyday, to people that have nothing to do with cryptocurrency. You deciding to become a miner yourself will have nothing to do with it.  Its not like, now that you have a miner on your computer, so now they will see you as a better target. Thats not how it works.  Actually, becoming a miner might actually help you detect someone else using your machine to mine because you will be more familar with it.  For instance, pull up your task manager, and see what programs are running. Is one of them a mining program a hacker installed?  Can you tell?  An experienced miner could.  So, actually becoming a miner yourself would most likey reduce the risk of your computer mining for some hacker without your knowledge due to you increased knowledge.  Or, you could join some other coin that is a scam and they could take some of your mining power for themselves.  So, no becoming a miner yourself doesnt incentivize a hacker.  You should always use 15 character random passwords that have upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Also, educate yourself on proper security to employ when using public wifi.  Electeoneum is as safe and secure as you are going to get. Mining ETN does not put you in ANY increased risk.",False

Now i don't know if it's confirmed but i'll ask.  Please can you confirm manually? In the Requested Transactions section there is not even a button to confirm that myself.  P.S. The only thing that comes to my mind is... we have purchased the ETH from Bitstamp and sent them from there directly to your ETH addresses. Was that bad ? Is that the reason why your system did not detect the transaction ?  Actually in Bitstamp there was a warning that suggests it's better not to send coins to ICO addresses. But without an explanation why. I wonder how an ""ICO"" address is different than any normal address after all ??",False

So its two competing forces that drive the value up ,and the other drives the value down. Thoughts anyone?  LOGO:  As Electroneum plans to be as close as possible to fiat currency ( being readable and accessible etc) , I was thinking its logo should make it look like how other currencies' logos are like. Bitcoin and only a few other coins have a similar concept. This came to mind when looking at the logo of the mobile app on my phone. Perhaps the logo for the coin itself should be different and look like traditional currency logos and the app's logo can be another.  PS: Not a professional graphics designer, just enough to get the job done. I realised the ""e"" made it look like IEs logo hahaha, also took some inspiration from the euro icon hahaha. Just made some random drafts. Just for fun, little bit off here and there.  *Cant get the img tags to work, must be new member limit D:  https://i.imgur.com/IEdvCWZ.png  https://ibb.co/irYLm5",False

The value is hidden in the fact that many people will likely be using this to gain free coins, and be introduced to the crypto-world. That means they can either go further into mining, use it for gaming or gambling or even trade with it to other cryptocurrencies and potentially invest in new ICOs and cryptos, growing the entire market. Likewise the mass adoptation is the key to market this coin to companies that would want to use it. The more that uses a coin the more interesting it becomes to everyone else, and on the other hand increases the potential market for all cryptos in regards to audience. It might seem as two opposing forces, but one drives another.",False

Keep in mind this is the best case scenario.  Once Electroneum is launched on Nov 1st, all that changes and now 2.2 BILLON smartphone users can now mine crypto with a profit without ANY undue stress on the phone because all the stress has already been handled by the home computers powering the blockchain.  With Electroneum the people mining it on their home computers will be powering the blockchain, leaving the mobile phones to mine on the twin side of the new and innovative algo with a central processor.

The devs keep 20 million coins, NOT the unsold coins from the ICO. They go into a pool to increase the incentive for people doing the mobile mining experience, and so that the devs can keep the flow going for those people choosing to use that experience.  So no, the devs are NOT greedy, and they have answered your questions. The hard cap of $40 million dollars was introduced after it was needed; it wasn't in place when they wrote the whitepaper, but was decided later on. Can you tell me the difference between a plan to $40 million+ vs. a plan to $40 million tops? The plan is still the same, and they can with $40 million tops do the exact same they can with $40 million+, instead of just setting a no limit boundary, they actually set one.

First of all it's not a unique idea. It has been tried before and phones broke down because of the overheating. With Electroneum the phones won't overheat. And that is because no true mining will take place. It is just a marketing strategy where people will keep the Electroneum app online and are rewarded for it with a few ETN's. Electroneum with this marketing strategy only introduces the idea of mining to those being still ignorant about the possibility. Allthough Electroneum has an interesting content also, the mobile mining is only a marketing concept.",False

Obviously, there will be some variance as it adjusts to massive spikes in hashing power, but we can assume it will approximate it over the long run, which gives us a rate of 150 per hour, or 360 per day, give or take.  I would like to know what the total global daily reward for all miners is planned to be, in terms of the coin itself. Obviously the value of those coins will depend on how much demand there is for them, and that is unknowable, and I understand that I must accept that risk. But, what could should be known now is what the total mining reward is planned to be. I also understand that the rate will be variable, because it will be augmented at low points by the unsold coins from the ICO. However, there is still a planned minimum amount that will be created, right? With Bitcoin, it's 360, and in a hypothetical world if they were subsidizing low value mining at troughs also, it would grow above 360. But 360 is known as a minimum, in that hypothetical example. What is the equivalent of 360 coins per day for the real-world example of Electroneum? How many coins will be mined per day, at a minimum?  It makes a big difference in the investment potential if we are talking about mining out 200 million per year or if we are talking about mining out 2 billion per year for the first year or two and then halving, or whatever. I would like to know what the inflation rate of the currency itself is going to be, irrespective of its value compared with other currencies (which cannot be known), and then I will be able to make my bets based on how well I believe demand for it will outpace currency growth. The lower the rate of inflation, the more I'll be comfortable investing and telling my friends to invest. Obviously, if it's a higher inflation rate, they will be able to attract more users, and that could potentially raise the value exponentially faster than inflation lowers it, but that is harder to predict, and does offset potential growth. I need all the information if I'm going to recommend this to anyone or bet big on it. I'll be buying a little before the drop to 140, but I can't advise anyone else to participate or even participate fully myself without all the pertinent information.  I think this team has an incredible business plan and revolutionary insight, and that there is great potential in this project -- much greater than in most I've heard of. Yet, this is a crucial piece of information that is being withheld, and it makes me uneasy.

Not to feel good or build the blockchain, but to earn coins. That's why miners mine. The UTILITY that they bring to the blockchain is great - it enables the blockchain to exist and transactions to take place.  The mobile mining experience emits REAL Electroneum coins at a rate based on CPU power and it looks feels and acts like a miner (hence mining experience). What UTILITY does it bring? Access to 2 billion smart phone users around the world - it brings a very valuable utility to Electroneum - adoption. MASS adoption.  The mobile mining app encourages users that would otherwise have NEVER found or used a cryptocurrency to enter our world. It encourages them to use a desktop or laptop with our easy GUI miner to become part of the FULL mining experience, the blockchain WILL be downloaded and they will become an Electroneum node.  We have a very clear, very well structured marketing model to take a cryptocurrency to a mass audience through a viral app that emits Electroneum coins - people will share it, people will learn a bit about cryptocurrencies and have a few coins they can use for micropayments.  This will be good for ALL cryptocurrencies - not just Electroneum, as it takes cryptocurrency to a wide audience.  I'm sorry you feel it's fake - it's not fake - it's just different.

So - so answer your question - the mobile mining is a mobile mining EXPERIENCE - a great article to read is this interview : https://www.financemagnates.com/thought-leadership/industry-poised-welcome-newest-cryptocurrency-electroneum/  It is covered in the technical whitepaper too, but it's a bit heavier in that! The idea basically is that the desktop (GUI) miner is a FULL miner (and a node) and handles the utility of managing the blockchain - adding blocks to the blockchain and gets awarded coins based on smooth emission algo. Desktop miners earn more and keep blockchain running. They are also fully decentralized.  Mobile miners are NOT downloading the blockchain or doing anything intensive. It's a mining experience. That means it looks like a miner, feels like a miner and pays out a small number of coins like a miner - but actually it's not bringing the utility of the blockchain to the project. We leave that to the full miners (which the mobile miner encourages by the way). What the mobile miner brings to the table is viral growth of the brand. This is still a utility, so we still pay out coins, but instead of the utility being to keep transactions flowing, this utility is designed to encourage mass adoption of the Electroneum cryptocurrency. Each and every app user will have a few coins in their wallet - which will encourage them to start looking for ways to use them. If we can get millions of users (we're also building quite an addictive tap mining game that will ALSO encourage viral spread) then we will very quickly become one of the more recognized cryptocurrencies - which will be good for ALL cryptocurrencies - as you all know, once you are into the land of crypto, you don't just hold one coin, you branch out.  It's something new, it's never been done, and I have a good feeling about it.  Thanks for your interest!  Richard.",False

Watch for updates at the link below       http://electroneumtalk.proboards.com/thread/8/electroneum-faq   « Electroneum Talk Electroneum FAQ     GLOBAL MODERATOR    ""Hi guys.  So i've decided to create a FAQ over all the frequently asked questions we get on Telegram. We're more than happy to answer every question posted there, as it means somebody new every single time has decided to get involved. That is amazing!  However, many of the answers could be found in the whitepapers, which is why i will compile the answers here and then i hope you all, as a community, will direct new people here to get their answers for their, hopefully, many legit questions. I've found that one question nearly almost every time leads to another, or a thousand, which is amazing in its self. Perhaps because this really IS an interesting project, especially for new people to the crypto-world.  It is my hope that everybody will participate in letting me maintain, and keep this updated throughout the ICO, and beyond, by either correcting information as we get them, or adding new questions to this section, which will be answered.   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Frequently Asked Questions:  What is the purpose with this coin / what is so special about it? - It targets the masses, the people without knowledge of Cryptocurrency, now finally have a shot at obtaining one, without having to worry about wallets, mining rigs or setting up your computer with technical know-how just to mine, and keep the coins. While you're mining on your app, which can be done from the background, you gain currency to your wallet which is set up for you inside the app. If you choose to play the game incorporated in the app, you get additional coins, and you learn a good amount of stuff about Cryptocurrency, how it works on a basic level, and gives you the knowledge and skills to mine on your computer with the dedicated program thats in development. The program allows people to easily mine without much hassle or technical knowledge. In the future of the coin, gaming and gambling markets will be targeted, used as a form of currency where you can ""sell"" the hours you've spend on your, lets say character in World of Warcraft, while the entry and exit fees you pay, to legally get in or out, get allocated to the company behind. This is a win-win for both parts. Likewise the coin is targeting the massive amount of people without a bank account, but with smartphone and/or internet access. There are tens of millions of such people, who could use cryptocurrency for storage of value or payments. Everyone wants to see mass adoptation for a cryptocoin, and then they will probably jump on the wagon for a lot of proposals. Likewise Bitcoin only have 3 million users; Electroneum wants more than that, which will give the team behind a lot of possibilities for usage of the coin around on the markets.   How many coins is there in total? - 21 billion coins.  How many coins is there in the ICO? - 6 billion coins.  Isn't that a too many coins? - The supply of coins is not an issue; the amount of coins has been chosen to reflect a real life currency; so instead of paying 0,000135 Bitcoin for a can of coke, you can pay 15,10 Electroneum (this is NOT the real exchangerate!) for the same can. This is a clear advantage, the study group suggested. Especially when you think about the fact that Bitcoin has 16 decimal digits and Electroneum has 13 decimal digits. So you're effectively just moving the decimal-point around.   What is the price of the coin? - $0.01 pr coin WITHOUT bonus.  When will the ICO end? - 31st of October at 23.59  What will happen to the coins that is not sold during the ICO? - Normally they would get destroyed, but it is not 100% certain that all the coins would be destroyed for ever, so it was decided to be allocated to the mobile miningpool to increase the likelyhood of people finding the mobile mining experience fun, and worth running.  Is there a bonus-system for early investors? - Yes there is. See this picture for clarification:  Table of Bonus - Electroneum  When do i get my coins? - When you invest, your coins should be allocated to your wallet, on your app, and on my.electroneum.com within minutes of your transfer being confirmed. Coins from the referralprogram and bountysystem will be allocated on the 1st. of November  Would the fee for a transfer from, lets say, Coinbase be absorbed like it is for Kraken? - Yes it will be.  Who are the devs? - The devs are listed on the website: Electroneum - Team. The most active on the Telegram-group, is Richard Ells the teamleader.  Can i talk to them? - Yes! Richard is VERY active on telegram, and will gladly answer all the questions his busy day allows him.  What is mobile mining? - Mobile mining is regular mining done on a phone, which includes getting the phone to solve algorithms from a blockchain and as a reward allocate some coins.  When will it be possible to mine? - Both the mobile mining experience, and the desktop version of mining will be available on the 1st. of November  What differentiates Electroneums kind of mobile mining from the ""normal"" kind? And how does the mobile mining experience work? - The mobile experience of Electroneum doesn't solve algorithms on a blockchain, but instead allocates coins to your wallet, based on a calulation of how powerful your phone is. All this can be done from the background of your phone. The rate of allocating of coins will depend on the amount of users, the amount of coins mined/in the pool and so on. See the technical paper at the bottom of this post for a further explanation.  Will it cause my phone to heat up, drain the battery or just damage it in any way? - NO! And this is a huge difference from all the other attempts at creating a mobile miner. This does NOT overheat or drain your battery so the life expectancy drops fast.  Will it eat all my data? - Nope! With the apps special way of functioning, it doesn't require much data to run. See the technical whitepaper for a more detailed explanation.  What is the app used for? - The app is used for mobile mining, as a wallet for your currency, to make transactions with your currency and to learn about cryptocurrencies through a game!  What is the genre of game is it going to be? - Something like Idle Miner, this is what the devs took their inspiration from. A kind of tycoon-game.  Where can i get it? - Google Play at the moment.  Has it released for IOS yet? - Not yet. Apple wants to see a listing on an exchange first.  Is the app hard to use? - Not at all! A very clean and easy experience; had a few bugs, but they should be fixed now. A 5 star review on Google Play would help a lot since it's primarily been reviewed in the beginning of the project, where it had a few bugs.  Is this a 100% mobile currency? - No you can mine it from your computer as well.  Will you be able to mine the currency on computer? - See above.  Why is mining it on computer important? - Because you solve blockchains which in return takes a bit for the pool of mobile users allocated coins and distributes it so that more and more people can get into crypto, and in the long run create value for the brand and the monetary value of the coin as well. Everything serves the purpose of mass adoptation, which enables a lot of more cool features and stuff.  How do you mine it on your computer? - With an easy to use computer program, currently developed but kind of in a Quasimodo-state of being very ugly but functioning.  How many coins will i be able to mine on my phone/computer/tablet/playstation/x-box/Commedore 64/AMIGA - That cannot, at the time being, be answered as it depends on the ICOs result, because of the coins being allocated to the mining pool, and number of users mining on their computers and so on.  Will you need a wallet to mine? - Yes, but luckily your app provides you with one, but it is recommended that you move your coins from your mobile app to your offlinewallet, BEFORE they launch the blockchain.  What is an offline-wallet? - An offline wallet is a piece of paper that has, at least, a spend and deposit key and perhaps even a QR-code, which is your private key, where you can allocate funds to and from. It is the only way of getting into your offlinewallet, so losing that, means that you've lost your currency.  Can the offline wallet be hacked? - It is literally unhackable. There is a pretty cool comparison on how hard it would be to hack it: Imagine that every grain of sand on earth is a lottery. The odds of hacking it is roughly the same as winning EVERY SINGLE LOTTERY AT THE SAME TIME.  Can't the Chinese just mine this industrially? - No it has whaling-protection, and even though i do not quite understand the technical-details about this, it prevents ASIC-mining and tries to diminish the difference between GPU and CPU mining. More of this stuff in the technical whitepaper, at the bottom of this post.  Will it have whale-protection? - Yes, see above.  How many units can i mine with pr. IP? - A couple of units should be fine, but there is a restriction on how many you can farm per. IP.  What will the mobile miner allocate coins from? - A pool of coins from the ICO and blockchain mining from the computer. See ""Why computer mining is important"".  What is the hard-cap of the ICO? - $40 million USD.  What is the soft-cap of the ICO? - There is none.  Can i pay with fiat / bank transfer? - You can put your fiat into an exchange and pay with Etherum or Bitcoin. That is the only way around it, even though there was talks about being able to do a bank transfer, this was adviced against by their lawyers, and was decided not to be implemented, due to security reasons with regards to following KYC-legislation, for the sake of the security of all involved in this.  What exchanges will you be listed at? - Yobit and Cryptopia at least. Talks are still going on.  Help! My coins have disappeared from the wallet on my app! - Keep checking back, and make sure your coins are still on my.electroneum.com, if they are, then there is no need to panic.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Electroneum Whitepaper Overview   Electroneum Technical Whitepaper  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Any comments are appreciated a lot. I hope you will use this as a reference point as it contains a lot of information. This will be updates as we go further into the ICO and hopefully sees a lot more people. If you ever need an argument, this is a good place to start. ""    2 hours ago",False

It is not, at the moment, an official FAQ, and is not created by the devs, but a collection of answers, we, the community, got from the devs. It is rather a forum run by enthusiastic investors from the community who wanted to collect all the questions and answers to them.  Which is why everybody can join in, on what should be in the FAQ, if they have noticed an unanswered question.

I am excited about the opportunity to invest in this coin, however the reason I haven't yet is that I'm unclear on what the mining rate is going to be.

That said, I want to see the range of what you expect the rate of coin creation will be.  Assuming all 6 billion coins are sold in the ICO, what would the rate of coin creation be in the first year? In the first 5 years?  What if only 1 billion coins are sold? What would you expect the rate of coin creation to be in the first year? in the first 5 years?  Also, are the pre-mined coins going to still be counted as part of the money supply while nobody owns them, or will they be counted as unmined, to bring the rate of ""creation"" up higher until they've been awarded to miners?

The answer to your second question is that the coins were already mined. They are in the crowdsale, but they are going back in for mining, so Im not sure what coinmarketcap.com will do.  When thinking about the growth of this coin, and what we can expect, I look at the ease of which you can get involved with this coin. There is no other coin out there that you can just download the App and you are mining by playing the game or letting it run in the background.  The devs understand the difficulty of explaining the idea of cryptocurrencies to someone who has never heard of them before. The way Electroneum is set up, you could be mining coins for a year and sending them to friends, etc. without ever knowing.  These days people are just used to ""download the app"". They, unlike us, who have been involved in cryptos for years, dont understand cryptos like we do. In this case they dont have to know what we know.  The dev has come up with a way to get those outside of the crypto community involved. This is the secret sauce.  The dev also is a big player in the marketing industry. He knows how to market an App.  I have faith that he has the expertise to get the App downloaded.  People will tell their friends as well. A lot of people will want to be a part of this when they find out from their friends that they downloaded an app that is mining coins that are worth a little money.  The game will only help adoption even more.",False

Coinmarketcap, crypto youtube keywords, coindesk and the likes. Those sort of target audiences are likely better for mining, which is where this project finds its strength. Frankly, I'm happy if the ICO doesn't sell even half of the maximum allotted token issuance because this means there is a lower coin supply to spread the marketcap across thus increasing the potential price.  It's funny, game sites aren't what they used to be. IGN.com and especially GameFAQs(founded in 1995) used to be mainstays but with the advent of youtube they've fallen off in popularity. There is still likely significant enough traffic to make investing there worthwhile. If you can manage to get an ad in circulation on Twitch.tv this would also be great. Popular video game youtube channels could prove to be beneficial.  Google Adsense targeted at phrases in the vein of ""ways to earn money online"" would be a good idea. I watched several videos in the past of people (mostly teens) showing 5 or 6 different apps where they do a survey each day or something to earn a small amount of money. A seven year old should be able to understand this and operate it. Imagine kids mining while they are in school.   In my opinion the success of this project hinges on being able to let the phone operate as normal with mining in the background, shutting off mining as necessary to prevent overheating. Retention rates will be as important as mobile mining adoption rates. The user has to trust the app isn't malware and that it won't harm the device. Optimization for the hundreds of different chipsets will be crucial. ",False

They are not asking for $40-$60 million before stuff can happen; they are asking UP TO $40-$60 million. The money raised will determine how fast they reach their goal. Just because they raise, lets say, $5 million, doesn't mean this will die out. Stuff will still happen. It is a cap; the goal to work towards; as unrealistic people might think it is, but that is not the point.  There hasn't been released a demo, but a beta has been made and tried on a focusgroup, which you can read in the whitepapers...  The money crownfunded will go to the team marketing the coin; they have a dedicated team sitting in a real office for this, of course the money is going to stay within the business; how exactly, is not interesting.  Yes every single coin has a plan of doing mass adoptation. But what is their solution to the huge entry barrier to make people mine on their computers? Teaching them about wallets or anything like that at all? People can research all they want, but they have to be dedicated and willing to use quite some time before they understand it. And the everyday person can't mine Bitcoin which is the most hyped, anyway. So what is the point here? You make the entry barrier ridiculously small, and get people hooked on owning crypto very easily and THEN educate them to be able to mine on their computer, store it on a wallet, mine and so on. You really just throwing tokens in their head and then giving them an incentive to further increase their funds and secure them meanwhile. I can't see the ""It's not really a big thing at all"", here. It is a pretty big thing, but it requires patience and dedicated hard work to succeed in getting this out to the masses, if the cryptocurrency hype-wave can be tamed and is still existing.",False

I understand that the rate will be variable, as it depends both on how many coins are leftover from the ICO to boost mining as well as the price of the coin (and thus how much is needed to subsidize mining to $1 per day... and thus it also depends on the number of users that need to be subsidized up to $1), and I also understand that the mining rate will decrease seamlessly in proportion with the existing supply of coins.  That said, I want to see the range of what you expect the rate of coin creation will be.  Assuming all 6 billion coins are sold in the ICO, what would the rate of coin creation be in the first year? In the first 5 years?  What if only 1 billion coins are sold? What would you expect the rate of coin creation to be in the first year? in the first 5 years?  Also, are the pre-mined coins going to still be counted as part of the money supply while nobody owns them, or will they be counted as unmined, to bring the rate of ""creation"" up higher until they've been awarded to miners?

As far as I can read in the technical whitepapers and information from the telegram group, it does not drain your battery, heat up your phone to the extremes or use a ton of data. They have tested it on a focus group. How much is a wild guess, because it depends on the ICO, where the remaining coins, instead of being destroyed, will be put into increasing the rate of getting coins in the app.  The basic idea is to make cryptocurrency very easy obtainable and spend for non-technical users, with a lot of ideas and development from that basic idea, like to educate people on crypto, so they can mine it on the blockchain on their computers, with a simple program, and make them proficient in tech know-how about how crypto works, how to trade, store and use it while planting an idea of further research.",False

Overvalued would mean you believe that it wont be worth more on exchanges than $.01 after launch Nov 1st. Considering some of the misinformation out there I can see why.  The team doesnt keep any for themselves. They have to buy into this themselves. Zero premine for the devs. Unsold coins are added back in to be mined. None stays out and that is in the whitepaper.  But that is not what people who are purposefully fudding Electroneum have to say. Rarely will someone actually research and come back and make an accusation that any coins are being held by devs, or whatever else they dream up, unless they are part of a competing coin. If you check their recent post history, youll see they are part of another ICO. Many times you dont even have to check, as they have the coin in their signature lol.  There are 20 million put aside for bounties, and that happens either way no matter how many coins are sold. This represents .0095 % of total coins.  Its funny that there is still a notion that the Electroneum mobile mining app will drain the battery.  That is simply not true. The innovation here is the fact that Electroneum doesnt overly drain the battery or damage the phone.  Why Electroneum? What makes you different? Why buy?  This is the reason. You have a phone that mines and it doesnt put stress on your phone like the miners out now.  The innovation gives us first mover advantage. We are the first and the only coin that can be sucessfully mined on a mobile phone.  Notice I said ""successfully mined"".  Plenty of apps have tried it. The most popular one is minergate.com. They try to have the users of their app mine regular coins. The problem is the people trying to mine are trying to power the blockchain. That takes a TON of power to do. Doing this would destroy a phone no problem. You cant mine any crypto right this minute successfully without putting your phone in serious risk or frying it. You definately cant make money at it.  Electroneum took the cryptonote algo and modified it into a twin algo with a special processor that allows those who are mining the chain on their home computers to power the blockchain.  The cryptonote basis used for this coin was already designed with the intention of stopping people from using specialized mining computers called ASICs. Cryptonote doesnt use miners like Bitcoin and is specifically made to have a regular computers mining it. Electroneum will have those people powering the blockchain with their home computers just like all cryptonote based coins, but only Electroneum can be successfully mined on a cell phone, in the background, or you can play the game to mine slightly more.  Those mining with a cellphone will not have the load of keeping the blockchain alive and can mine coins without the stress.  Yes, the team is made up of good marketers. That one even the trolls have a hard time trying to gloss over. Its smart you checked and didnt take their word for it.  Is the idea unpolished? Doesnt sound like it does it?  Thanks again for coming and voicing your concerns, as this thread is the place to do so. I hope you go give the whitepapers a read. There are two. One overview and the other a technical whitepaper.",False

Asking for $40-60mln+ in a general crowfunding session is waaaay to high, unless you have something VERY unique. Which is a ""must have"" if you want to reach that high amount.. And i dont need to think of it in any other way than the my way.. The way i see  you put it. Those 2 companies require an income for promoting ads(marketing).. So what you are telling me, is that he is paying his own companies for promoting(marketing) his new company?!? And the money used for ""Marketing/promoting"" Eletroneum, comes from the crowfund, am i right?  All in all. You are a simple ""crypto-coin"" that promoted the possibility to mine on our phones without overheating or bricking them, which you still only ""said"" was made possible. But. No released beta/demo or anything out yet.  Also. Every crypto product has plans for ""MASS ADOPTION"". Basicly 90%+ of every product on earth has that plan..  And how does 1 specific investor-friend have anything to do with this? To me it looks as if this ""superstar"" investor-friend, who helped a whole lot of other companies reach a market cap above 1 billion dollars. Isnt really investing a whole lot, as he should be since he is worth putting on your frontpage. Usually the key-investors decides to invest a huge chunk of the total goal compared to the crowd, in bright futured companies, with funding expectations like this one. And i can see that you have yet to reach 1 million dollar funding with 5700+ token sale users. So its not really a bit thing at all..  Although, i did already decide to put a small 0.2 BTC into your little project here. Because i can afford to lose it and i think that you have a fine concept, which in the long run (with alot of hard work!) will prevail and become a big thing in the future. But after more dig-in and speculation, i somehow became pretty confused if this was a good investment or not.. I think that it would comfort alot of contributers to see something else than a terrible game background showing in photoshop. Instead, maybe having something to work with. A demo, beta, just something else to put our minds to. Because the thought of us paying for basicly nothing else than marketing, already equals a doomed coin in my opinion.",False

Think of it under the light where you have a dev that handles the marketing in his own company for Herbalife, Avon etc.  There are already Electroneum ads out on the internet, right this minute, on mainstream news websites for just one example.  This project is much, much bigger than bitcointalk.org.  This is what everyone has been screaming for all along. Marketing, marketing marketing!! That's what we are getting this time.  And NO, Im not saying that anyone needs 40 million for marketing. My point in mentioning that, is IF we make the goal of  40 million, and have a marketcap when the coins are still $.067 a piece, that will be the optimal situation.  This is the plan for 40 million      And if we raise even half that, many of these things WILL occur.  The dev deals with large multi-national corporations already. One of his friends that has tweeted hes on board is Duncan Logan, the CEO of RocketSpace (Spotify, Uber, etc).  These guys know how to deal with these big players because they already do.  20 to 40 million may seem like a lot, but not when you are setting up a system that can actually do the things they say.  This is a project that has actual plans to make MASS ADOPTION really happen.  Like I said, you go out on the internet and youre going to run into Electroneum. They are not on every site, but they arent joking around either. Keep in mind the token sale isnt even close to these numbers yet, but its going well.

No, he is under no obligation to tell me or you anything at this time.

After getting through the two white papers I read the entire thread. I have found some other threads about electroneum. This is the exactly what I have been preaching about since we had 13 coins. We need experts in marketing, not to be all hung up on tech all the time.  But its not a clone. There is not another coin like this tech wise. Ill admit you know Im alittle worried about the centralized part of this. Usually its a deal breaker, but if the centralized side for the mobile miners were ripped off, the coin would still carry on because the blockchain is powered by the desktop miners. Genius actually, you get the mobile miners to have extra power that is pseudo power really but nonetheless it is affecting their coin count results without drawing from the power of the phone. Put simply the twin algo tweaks it if youre mobile. Thats pretty sweet.  So they are not only going to have a phone mining app, but a game as well. Then once they get all these gamers mining, down the road long term you have millions of users on the app. Is anyone thinking about the kind of power a community of this size will have?  The long term plan is then to leverage that community to pressure game apps to become involved in an exchange where their in game items can be sold on the market that would be intregrated in the electroneum app.  It helps the miners, because they have coins from mining to use for purchases inside games, they have electroneum from sales of items bought or earned in other app games, and it helps the game app companies because it gives them a link to other games out there and will also gain more exposure by having their in game items listed on the exchange and therefore being part of the network.  I see what you are doing here guys, and all the supporters need to expect pushback from the very technical people, which there are a lot of here. They want a completely new system or your a ""copy"". In the end I feel even they will be won over because there is tech innovation here. Mobiles can mine electroneum. Try doing that with your phone and some other app and any other coin out there. Its not working in any fashion what-so-ever. Minergate.com. and that gets you no coins and burns up your phone. This actually works. So you also have first mover advantage because electroneum actually figured it out.  Im impressed. Let me know how I can help. I will definately be investing heavy in this one. The ROI will be amazing, barring the devs doing something really dumb or something being a lie, which I dont antisipate because they have real world reputations and multi-national corporations as clients in their day jobs as CEOs.",False

From an investor standpoint, it doesnt really matter how many coins their are. This point was most obvious when back in 2013-14 when a coin named ""42"" came out. There were only 42 coins. So obviously most people didnt even have 1 coin.  But to investors, it is the % of the marketcap you are getting, and the price you paid for it, and the price you sell it for.  In reverse, it there were 20%, or even 5% of the total coins in circulation that were being plucked off the top for the dev team, then investors would worry about ""all those coins"" the dev team may ""dump"" and crash the market.  In this case, the dev team is getting ZERO, and they are buying in like everyone else.  This case, all investors like to see, because that means the devs believe that they will be successful, and are putting their money up like everyone else.  The devs tried to think about what amount would ""look the best"" for a regualr user, the person who is mining on their mobile phone.  Do we want them to see .00034 coins in their wallet, or would 34 coins look better?  Then they actually ran an experiment, with a test group of subjects to see their reaction to different things.  One of the biggest things that people in the test group cared about was how many coins they had.  Like I said % of coins matters to us as investors, not coin totals. We want to know how much it costs, what stake my investment will get me in the coin, and what the price projections in the future are if every goes according to the plan, and what it can sell for at a later time.  If we like the devs and the plan we buy, if not we dont we pass.  In the case of the end user of Electroneum, the person mobile mining, billions makes sense because the end user will get full coins.",False

I saw a video with him, and he seemed like a trustworthy, cool guy tho.  I saw some other ICOs lately and they had like $300 invested on average each, so this one might get about 3800*300 if all registered users buy.. probably not all will buy tho. So thats likely 1,1m$. Of course there could be way more (or less, like if the registered user number isnt real), its just a personal estimate from one ICO i saw.  Why is there no articles in british press, if its the first british ico and they are all from uk?  I am sorry if this is overcritical but thats how I am.

Could it destroy the phone over time? Or is the load the phone has to cope with reasonable?   The mobile app is centralized and runs off a twin algorithm that emits coins from the blockchain at approximately the same rate as the full miners based on a CPU benchmark of the phone. This allows the phone to run without getting hot and without using tons of power and bandwidth that previous attempts at phone mining have needed. But remember, they are not bringing blockchain utility, they are bringing a different utility - they are bringing on users at a ridiculously low CPA, and allowing Electroneum to have viral growth.  We’ve combined a decentralized blockchain with a centralized viral marketing app, that encourages the adoption and accumulation of cryptocurrency through “gamifying” the experience. We call it the Mobile Mining Experience. Our blockchain emits coins to our mobile app users for bring a different utility to the blockchain. Electroneum full miners earn the most coins and that runs on Windows, Linux and Mac computers. They bring the utility of blockchain administration and are rewarded with Electroneum coins. The mobile miners bring the utility of viral marketing to Electroneum and are awarded with a number (smaller) of Electroneum coins for doing so. It's done in a way that encourages app usage. We've essentially gamified the mining experience, making it appeal to mobile computer gamers (there are over 2 billion of them!).      We know electroeum needs to be accessible to people mining on mobile phones. We all know the result so far, its horrible. They have figured out a way to do this by having a specialized algo and a processor. The people mining with their computers  cpu on the main algo will be powering the blockchain. This means it is still decentrailzed.  Some people may complain that it has a centralized componet to the mobile miners, but it doesnt bother me. Im here with what I see as cryptos first chance to really be taken to the masses. We see they have the tech innovation necessary to come thru on their claims to take mining a cryptocurrency to 2 billion users of mobile devices.  It also cant be cloned as easily, or the innovation stolen with it needing a central processor as well.  They are powerhouse marketers, and now that these guys have added gaming to it as well, they will easily penetrate the market with this.  You can say its not decentralized enough for you, but I think someone would be hard pressed to say this is going to lose you money buying in at $.0067.  With the app downloads reaching just 5 million users, which is low in that industry, it would have far above the amount of users as Bitcoin. This you bought for $.0067 and Bitcoin is valued at $4000++. There will be many LEVELS of those buying and selling as the price establishes itself, which call me crazy, but with:  A. An innovativation in cryptocurrency by being first to sucessfully take effectiive mining mobile.  B. Have the product finished at the time of crowdsale  C. Have top of the line, ultra rich, real world marketers behind it.  these things make it pretty hard NOT to go up.  Ive seen much, much more, done with way, way less here.

But I have a few criticisms / suggestions:   1) I am worried about the potential for the ""smartphone mining"" to be a very short flash in the pan. Yes, those that are mining on day one will get a few coins and we could see some cool growth among teenagers and newbies that simply want to say they are involved with the cool math-based currencies. But give this a few weeks even, then the hype amps the value of coins, then the professional mining organizations start taking over and then the casual smartphone app user is getting a fraction of a coin a day if any at all. We need them to keep coming back for a while. They will not come back if nothing is happening.  The Windows, Mac, and Linux based miners will hog it all and I see that potentially stunting the viral growth. Hot-or-Not was a great flash in the pan for a while and was insanely viral, and everyone used it for a month, then nobody looked back at it anymore. We need the casual smartphone user to actually see something happening for at least the next year or so. You won't get this to ubiquity if you get 200,000 users then the mining is fruitless. Nobody will join after that because at that point it doesn't do anything that scores of apps already do, and it won't be a large enough network to be valuable in its own right. We need something that engages them continually....  SUGGESTION: Continue to reward the casual smartphone-based user by rewarding them for recruitment or evangelizing. Have a pool of coins available (since the mining is basically centralized to any degree you want) and reward people based on the number of unique users they recruit directly to the system. Shoot, reward them for the recruits their recruits recruit! Give them a larger cut for their efforts. Make an incentive for each user to become a seller. It will keep a steady crew of people jumping in. Do that for the first year or so then allow the remaining coins to be mined when the network size is so large it is valuable in its own right as a value transfer system. In addition, you show them on the app how many people ""downline"" have joined based on their individual recruitment efforts so they can always at least come back to see the impact they have had. (e.g. 2,657,888 have joined electronium based on your referrals!) Anything to keep them logging back into the device.  2) You need to publish the specific timeline for coin emission over time. I saw that the coins will be mined over ten years? So how many per day or per block? How front loaded will it be?  SUGGESTION: Publish this information so we know how much we can mine.  3) I applaud the idea that you want to take bitcoin mining to mainstream. This has been needed for so long. I would love to see this succeed! I want my mother on crypto but unless something like this exists, not way that's happening. But for it to succeed there needs to be a roadmap for eventually showing how a system like this can be in compliance with AML/KYC. If any currency is to be ubiquitously used throughout the world, it will be a lightning rod in terms of governmental control and oversight. So I ask, why was the cryptonote tech chosen? Do you really want these transactions to not have a public ledger? I mean I love coins like Monero and they are sooooo vital in the blockchain ecosystem, but eventually you guys will have to answer to government if you get too big. I am looked at as a crazy person in this community when it comes to compliance but I am also a certified AML/KYC expert and the govts of the world will eventually need some kind of oversight on a system like this. You could see govts attack this hard especially if it is a widely-used and strong currency and your team personally could feel some serious heat. You are quite out there and centralized in that the app is the main driver of use. That can be shut down over night with a court order to Apple and Google. I think the govt will be fine with this if you can somehow provide a mechanism to trace transactions on a public ledger at least. The killer-app currency that takes over the world, which will eventually happen, will need to somehow make the enormous financial powers of this world play ball with it. Anonymous transactions + ubiquitously-used global cryptocurrency is a bit of an oxymoron in my opinion. It might have to stay niche like its cousin Monero in other words.  SUGGESTION: Consider allowing only Facebook users to sign up to start. Yes it's a little cheesy. Yes some will not sign up because they don't want the man to know they own this stuff. But, this provides you, as a central organization, at least some ammo when the feds come demanding you help them find criminals that are using YOUR system, assuming they don't co-implicate you guys in helping said criminals execute financial transactions. Facebook is not fool proof as there are plenty of dummy accounts, but the feds LOOOOVE it because it is a treasure trove of investigative information when trying to find a user. Other apps have used this method to great success. You guys are going to automatically be money transmitters by having the level of centralized control over this app that you have. Be prepared to pay a ton of dough to get licensed in all the jurisdictions you allow this app to be downloaded. This heat will come very, very fast if you are growing rapidly. You will need to have some way to know who your users are. If you are truly marketing to the average casual smartphone user, this will be a non-issue for them because most of them are law abiding citizens that have no intention of breaking the law. They will be happy to dish out their personal info too.  They are not the usual crypto-anarchists like all of us right?    Secondly, in regard to AML/KYC, I would seriously have considered using a more transparent blockchain model. The feds are actually not minding bitcoin so much because the public ledger does give them the ability to follow transactions to a degree. When bitcoin ends up at the usual exchanges that are AML/KYC compliant, govts have ways of gathering information at that point that helps them find criminals when needed. I realize this is something that is probably too late to consider at all which is understandable, but I do want to voice this as a notable criticism in that there are people starting to hope this could be the next big thing in crypto. Real money will go down on this. If anyone believes this could be THE internet currency, these could be real roadblocks. Will it be used by a devoted fan base? I don't doubt it. But taking over the world will take some very careful planning on how to get past the BIG boys. They will NOT go down easy.   ...I have to say this project is one of the most exciting developments I have seen in a long time. I have been waiting for shit like this to start happening.  Maybe electronium can pull off a facebook-sized effect on the world and make this into one of the most widely used tokens to date. If not, I suspect the above discussion points could end up limiting its success.  So, if electronium eventually has only mediocre success? Well, if you are reading this and you are one of the legendary blokes that could build this kind of smartphone system that has the above qualities as well, please tell me about it so my wealthy partners and I can be some of the first to invest and sign up, or hell, we can pay you to build it! I will join any team that is advancing this kind of tech.  Please, electronium, let me know if there is anything more I can do to be of assistance to you in all of this. With respect...

We all know the result so far, its horrible. They have figured out a way to do this by having a specialized algo and a processor. The people mining with their computers  cpu on the main algo will be powering the blockchain. This means it is still decentrailzed.  Some people may complain that it has a centralized componet to the mobile miners, but it doesnt bother me. Im here with what I see as cryptos first chance to really be taken to the masses. We see they have the tech innovation necessary to come thru on their claims to take mining a cryptocurrency to 2 billion users of mobile devices.  It also cant be cloned as easily, or the innovation stolen with it needing a central processor as well.  They are powerhouse marketers, and now that these guys have added gaming to it as well, they will easily penetrate the market with this.  You can say its not decentralized enough for you, but I think someone would be hard pressed to say this is going to lose you money buying in at $.0067.  With the app downloads reaching just 5 million users, which is low in that industry, it would have far above the amount of users as Bitcoin. This you bought for $.0067 and Bitcoin is valued at $4000++. There will be many LEVELS of those buying and selling as the price establishes itself, which call me crazy, but with:  A. An innovativation in cryptocurrency by being first to sucessfully take effectiive mining mobile.  B. Have the product finished at the time of crowdsale  C. Have top of the line, ultra rich, real world marketers behind it.  these things make it pretty hard NOT to go up.  Ive seen much, much more, done with way, way less here.",False

That makes no sense whatsoever.  Now, only 6.3 billion are being sold at the ICO that starts next week, they cant raise 200 million in this round anyway.  The rest of the coins will be mined by the community, from their cell phones.  You might want to READ the whitepaper before you say investors will have a problem. Because barring some super amazing shit coming out, this will most likely be the most profitable ICO of 2017.  Do the math. At $.01 cent a coin, when the coins can easily reach $10 to $20 dollars. This is easy to see when you compare this to similar projects, look at their marketcap, and the do the math.  Maybe you have no investment experience?  I ask myself this question for two reasons because I can't see you having any investments here because you bash every coin thread you go to.  So why would you bash something you invested in?  And if you are bashing coins you are investing in, that would point toward lack of experience as well.  So either way, it's no wonder you are going down a street that all the signs point one way, and everyone else is headed in said direction, and you look like a deer in headlights because you are facing the wrong way.  The only logical thing I can figure is you are padding your post count for that signature campaign trying to scrape up a few crumbs.

Instead of getting frustrated I decided to wait and clear my head and let other people talk on the thread.

Let me tell you why   You are assuming that the ICO raises 210 million dollars.  You just might be right on this assumption, but it doesnt have to either.  But lets say it did.  Where you seem to get lost, is in the fact that this would be a bad thing for investors.  A sold out ICO, raising 210 MILLION DOLLARS, would be a grand slam, out of the park, home run for investors.  You give the leadership and advisors that kind of capital to work with, and you would see real world marketing of a crypto 100 fold of any seen before.  This would be done by leadership that have created billion dollar companies with much much less. You would see their message EVERYWHERE, a message created to move those in its earshot into the ""sales funnel"" with users downloading the app, just to watch free money show up on their cellphone, then with multiple directions a user can go from there, with all of them being introduced to crypto in ways they understand. This is how users are created in the real world.  We are not after people in the crypto scene per se, more so those that are new to it.  In the process, those that are here in the crypto scene that are ""in the know"" ahead of the mass marketing, that are involved in the ICO before that happens, will make extremely hefty profits.  Their message will be all over social media, and pretty much everywhere else. A message designed by people that have been doing this in the real world for over a decade. The combined total brainpower and specific marketing industry experience is in the hundreds of years in this project.  210 million hurting investors, quite the opposite.   This is HOW you got lost. And its OK. Many have. And its not your fault.  This space has had 100 disappointments+ to every success.  Back in 2013-2014 every coin promised ""mass adoption"" and not one delivered.  Not one had a team and a plan like this.  Seeing that you only came back saying that I was basically nuts, and didnt specify why, I would guess you still havent read up on everything yet like I asked, so we could talk about your concerns regarding the plan.  So go do that. I think once you do, you will see the opportunity that seems to escape you at the moment.  This gets people involved in crypto at a scale never seen before, not even with bitcoin.  This kind of movement would affect the price in a very posititive way.  I would hate all the bad experiences suffered by many of you, to cause you to miss out on such an exciting and profitable investment.  Research",False

We have a GUI windows Mac and Linux miner in production which will be ready by launch (1st Nov) and the mobile app will allow multiple devices.  It does have virtual environment, whale, and various other protections to prevent unfair use by people attempting to ""game"" the system, but it will work on the normal devices a family might have, for instance.  Mass adoption & USP:  There are over 2 billion active android devices and 700 million ios devices. Most of the world’s market have no other form of computer and cannot get access to cryptocurrency. We are looking for mass adoption.  Cambridge University suggests there are only 3 million Bitcoin users http://www.newsbtc.com/2017/05/07/three-million-cryptocurrency-users/  We are aiming for a much higher number by allowing really, truly, easy access to cryptocurrency. Something your grandma could use   Our mobile mining experience does not significantly slow the device, nor does it make it run too hot, or use too much bandwidth. This is all unique.  When we started some UI feedback groups with our app in Beta we ran it past a number of users from teenage kids through to adults, and the kids are the ones who immediately started the gamification of Electroneum.  To be honest, we hadn’t really thought if it at that time!  Mining a few coins, trading a few coins with friends, and suddenly you are in the “lead”. They had a totally different view of it to adult users.  Remember the speed of adoption of Pokemon? Over 30 million users in the first month of release. Users told users. 65 million monthly players within 9 months. Pokemon was free – our app pays you to run it!  Imagine in the first year we could get 3 million users who would like to mine coins and trade them with friends. Electroneum would have as many users as bitcoin does today after nearly 10 years of existence.  Mining Experience  Our Mobile mining experience is never going to make users wealthy, but it does give people their first access to cryptocurrency. It might allow them to make a $5 or $10 USD per month, and that covers the cost of the phone in many cases. That will be enough to cause enormous viral growth. Interestingly, even before it had any real world value, that 14 – 23 year old demographic (male) wanted to do it just to own some cryptocurrency.  In effect, our mobile miner is a marketing system for Electroneum built into the blockchain. We have lots of levels of protection from whale protection, virtual environment protection, packet spoof protection and countless others to ensure mobile mining is fair.  Our mobile mining algorithm is based on smooth emission just like our windows miner, but we also have the ability to add any additional coins left over from the ICO into the system to make the viral growth even more explosive.  If we can pick up just a million app users we will be the second most widely recognized cryptocurrency in the world. It only takes 5 million to be the world’s most widely USED cryptocurrency!  We are translating the app into 25 languages.  As soon as we start getting market penetration we will have plenty of offers to integrate with services, games, etc.  We have written an API that allows any easy integration of Electroneum payments into games, apps etc.  It's getting very exciting! We have some really interesting people coming on board - I'll try to get them to tweet about Electroneum the way Duncan Logan (CEO of Rocketspace) has done. https://twitter.com/duncanlogan/status/899754013574311936",False

Also there are quite a few community ports of Sailfish OS for originally Android devices so they've been converted to the new OS but do not have the Alien Dalvik license so they can't run your Android app, they would need a native app. https://wiki.merproject.org/wiki/Adaptations/libhybris_reboot  Also there is the Youyota tablet which will be shipped late September. http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=99214 ^Those forums would be pleased to know that you were making a native electroneum app for Sailfish OS.

Value is established based on the dev team in place, which are top notch, real world marketers, and also the power of their message matters.

The idea, as I understand it, is that the mobile mining will be more of an entry point for non-crypto users to mine coins.  Once they see real coins coming into their wallet from the mobile mining, and see how the concept works, many will then take the next step further into the crypto world by then learning how to mine with their computer and/or buying coins on an exchange.  Remember, we are not talking about people who are already a part of the crypto community.  We are talking about people that come into contact with Electroneum through more traditional marketing methods.

We've chosen and modified Bytecoin for a few reasons.  1. Bytecoin is a top 25 coin by market cap so the blockchain stands up to huge demand and transaction levels 2. The cryptonight algorithm that underlies the blockchain is CPU friendly and ANTI - ASIC. This gives windows and small CPU miners a chance, where Bitcoin is dominated with ASIC miners and Ethereum is dominated with GPU miners. Take a look at the section ""Egalitarian proof of work"" in our technical white paper for details - http://electroneum.com/technical-white-paper.pdf 3. It makes it easy for exchanges to list us after the ICO. Four relatively small changes to the Bytecoin code they already have enables them to list Electroneum on their exchange.  Exchange listing - 100% confident  Speaking of exchange listing, I should let everyone know - we've been in touch with all the exchanges from major to minor and will be pursuing all during the ICO campaign to get Electroneum listed wherever we can, as soon as we can, but we have one confirmation back - so we are now 100% confident that soon after the ICO closes Electroneum will be able to be able to be purchased by retail customers or exchanged by owners for other currencies, real or crypto.  Viral Growth update  We are extremely confident we will see an enormous viral growth in mobile users as people share their mobile mining experience with their friends. There is no other cryptocurrency around that I know of that is as easy to start using (and obtaining) than Electroneum. It is the cryptocurrency of the common, everyday, person.  There are over 2 billion android devices live today (figure from Google : https://www.blog.google/products/android/2bn-milestone/) and over 700m iOS devices ( http://fortune.com/2017/03/06/apple-iphone-use-worldwide/)  We have our Android app already in the Play store (search ""Electroneum"" and install!) and we are working hard to get the Apple iOS App live before the end of the ICO.  Have a great day everyone!  Richard.",False

Mobile Mining for Electroneum  Step 1 People can get involved and purchase Electroneum with substantial bonus during ICO (14th Sept > 31st Oct)  Step 2 1st Nov onwards - Electroneum app will go VIRAL due to the mobile mining experience and our social media marketing / PR  Step 3 Users with taste for cryptocurrency will try our desktop mining software which mines more Electroneum  Step 4 A huge takeup of Electroneum would drive up the price on exchanges leading to a profit for those who sought to invest for a return  Step 5 We use the ICO raised funds to make the Electroneum App the ""PayPal"" of cryptocurrency, with the easiest payment system that any cryptocurrency has ever had! Driving price even higher.

They are the only other people I've seen attempt this. They don't have their own blockchain or cryptocurrency though and it runs your phone quite HOT! Our mining experience is super easy to do, no technical knowledge required. I'm also pretty sure that Minergate doesn't have any wallet facilities, so people need to be reasonably technical to use it. I don't want to take anything from them though - they were the first mobile miner - we've just made the whole thing slicker, easier and all wrapped up with our own blockchain.  Our miner is the only bit of Electroneum that is not decentralized I'm afraid! We've open sourced our Blockchain and Mining Pool to encourage peer to peer decentralization, but we are keeping the app's intellectual property to ourselves. The app will also only work with our pool I'm afraid.... BUT! It IS awesome.  We are going to get TONS of viral takeup of the app, just for the mining experience, and we all know on this forum what happens to people who start on the cryptocurrency journey.... they are hooked!  People who have never had access to cryptocurrency before will have some in their mobile wallet within a couple of hours of downloading a free app!  It's going to be GREAT for Electroneum, but it will also be GREAT for cryptocurrencies in general, as each new user of cryptocurrency will have to open an exchange account if they want to swap ETN for BTC or ETH (or USD!) Once they have an exchange account, they are far more likely to get involved in other currencies and be part of the community.  I have a really good feeling about the whole project! I had a GREAT meeting today with a major player in the tech world who is super connected, globally, and has nurtured more than 15 unicorns of the tech world (most of which you'd have heard of)! I don't want to name him without his permission, but if he does put his weight behind Electroneum it will be AWESOME! I'll keep everyone posted!  Have a great day everyone!   Richard.

What a great week!  INCREDIBLE ICO Social Referral Progam system launched  Log in with your ICO username and password (or create a free account) https://my.electroneum.com  Visit the Social Rewards page and you'll see a personalized referral code and image, and a personalized referral link (like https://my.electroneum.com/join/7BECEF)  Those links are optimized for Twitter and Facebook. Just paste in your referral link and you'll see a great looking image all ready to go. It's SUPER clever - give it a try!  Now, everyone who joins the ICO site (even if they don't buy any ETN themselves) can refer people with a unique code (or publish it on their blog etc.).  Each code entitles the person entering it to get an EXTRA 1% on top of their purchase of Electroneum Coins - but it gives YOU 5% of their ETN purchase value in ETN coins.  It's a generous rewards scheme that means people can get hold of some ETN by promoting the Electroneum ICO! (you can even use in in conjunction with our bounty scheme!!!!)  Take a look at it now - we had been asked to code it by one of the ICO launching sites to allow them to promote it, but decided to make it public for everyone to benefit from.  Windows GUI Miner  We've got our windows mining software running today - which is the easiest mining software (outside of our app of course!!!) in any currency, anywhere.  You run it, it downloads the Electroneum blockchain, asks if you have a wallet or want to create one, and then you click start mining, and it's off. The whole thing is a graphical user interface - it's SO awesome. No more complicated command line stuff. Easy peezy!  Offline Wallet  Our offline wallet went offline (pun intended!) for a while! It's BACK. We added a MONSTER amount of randomness to the generator, which has made it even more secure!  How secure is the Electroneum offline wallet?  Offline wallets (also called paper wallets or cold storage) are the most secure way to store cryptocurrency, yet curiously very few cryptocurrencies have them.  Electroneum has one that is (of course!) easier to use than most, if not all of the others.  There are 255 characters per byte and we use 32 bytes of REALLY random data to make the key. That means there are 255^32 (to the power of). That is a LARGE number. Really large. You are probably thinking large is something like your last credit card bill, but this is even larger. In fact, the number is larger than the number of hydrogen atoms in the known universe! Tt might be more ATOMS than there are in the known universe, we haven't counted them, and be honest, neither have you  If someone were to take every single computer on earth and try and brute force your spend key, they would still have to wait more than 50 trillion trillion trillion trillion years to get a result.  Now THAT is secure!  Try it now! https://my.electroneum.com/offline_paper_electroneum_walletV1.1.html  Been a great week everyone, thanks for your support, lots more exciting stuff to come over the following weeks!

We are a real team of really dedicated coders!  We (the cryptocurrency community) will never become widely adopted with the level of technical skills that are currently required to use an ASIC or GPU miners. Plus the cost for entry for those platforms is HUGE.  Our blockchain was only being developed for FUN initially!! This idea has developed out of a bunch of quite geeky guys, developing something in their spare time.  Half my Retortal team (I own a large digital agency called SiteWizard and a very large social media management platform called Retortal) started to get involved tinkering around.  Once we realised we could actually launch our own cryptocurrency we put the brakes on and said ""hang on, how are we DIFFERENT"". There are PLENTY of forks of monero or bytecoin. What makes ours FANTASTICALLY different is the app we've developed that allows mobile mining. We now have a CLEAN, UNMINED blockchain being launched (i.e. we haven't mined the heck out of it for personal gain). That's an exciting oppotunity for mobile, cpu and gpu miners on the day it goes fully live (1st November 2017)!  You (people on this forum) might think of mining, GPU mining, and ASIC mining as trivial - but it really isn't - we are all VERY technical people. Even the people on here that are really un-technical are 1000s of times MORE technical than the average person on the street.  What we have developed is a super simple app that allows people to download (free) and start a mining experience with ZERO technical knowledge.  Sure, they are not going to earn the same number of coins that desktop CPU miners earn, and they won't earn as many coins as the GPU miners (even though we are trying to limit GPU mining via our blockchain - please see Smooth Emission in the Technical White Paper - http://electroneum.com/technical-white-paper.pdf).  People who experience MOBILE mining are quite probably taking their first steps into cryptocurrency. This is GREAT for cryptocurrencies in general.  Electroneum will introduce millions of new cryptocurrency users because of it's simplicity. Some of them will go on to mine with CPU and GPU rigs. ALL of them will have their eyes opened to the world of cryptocurrency that WE all take a little bit for granted!  It's an exciting time - and we have plans to gain millions (or hopefully tens and hundreds of millions) of new users of cryptocurrency from around the world.  If you have any concerns, it's best to voice them - but we are anything but ""shady"".  Have a great day! Richard.",False

The Electroneum App is going to go viral - Imagine you mobile phone paying for itself while you use it! (or, depending on number of miners and price of ETN, offsetting the cost of use - or even making a profit).  It's SO easy to use it's crazy, so I know we'll make a monster success of getting Electroneum users - and that means more press exposure and more retail sales once we get listed on the exchanges at the end of the ICO.  I would like to take your advice, but we've given that information out to too many people, and I don't want to take anything away from what we've promised.  We are ADDING an additional layer of bonus, which will mean more viral growth, as we are going to have a REFER A FRIEND system, which will enable all participants to share an ICO link and if someone uses that link and comes on board during the ICO, the original user will be awarded some additional ETN to say ""thank you!"".  Thanks again for the suggestion, please keep them coming, I'm sorry I'm not able to act on this one - but the next idea might be crucial!  Enjoy what's left of the weekend, all the best,  Richard.",False

A phone can't mine much, it's true - however it's ridiculously EASY to do it, and that's the key. We hope to hook in millions of ordinary people into cryptocurrency, where they felt excluded before.  Once they've mined a little on their phone they are far more likely to use our Linux or Windows CPU / Mining software to mine a lot more - still very little technical knowledge required.  Sure, some people are going to use GPUs as they are very fast, we have, however, tried to make the blockchain as ""anti"" GPU and ASIC as possible (please see our technical white paper below - search for GPU).  http://electroneum.com/technical-white-paper.pdf  I hope that helps a little. Feel free to ask anything at any time.  Have a great day! Richard.",False

Mobile mining experience allows people with just a smart phone to get hold of some cryptocurrency - it won't be a lot, but it will get them in to crypto - and open up a new world of possibilities.  Imagine someone saying ""oooh, what's that doing?"" and they reply ""I have a crypto currency called Electroneum, and I'm mining for it on my phone - you can too with a free app""  Everyone we show the app to is hooked on cryptocurrency within a few minutes. It's difficult to introduce people to Ethereum or Bitcoin, because they need to GET some. That is not as easy to do as it sounds.  People on this forum are used to crypto, but when you speak to someone who has barely even heard of bitcoin, the barriers to crypto are HUGE.
