Own your data,"Hello Algebraix community! Here's an update for our airdrop directly from our Telegram group (https://t.me/Algebraix_Data):  Here is how to become a beta tester and how to get your ALX: Complete the form at https://algebraix.io/beta. You will receive an email within 24 hours with instructions to install ALX.  Users will be required to follow us on Telegram or Twitter and complete all in-app surveys to earn airdrop tokens. Phase 1: Users who sign up for the beta test airdrop between day 1 and day 30 of the beta test period and complete the requirements listed, will earn a flat 15,000 ALX tokens AND will continue to earn ALX tokens as described in Phase 2. Note that the ALX token totals show in the application during Phase 1 are test information and do not reflect the amount of ALX that will be deposited in your wallet at the end of the beta testing period. At the end of Phase 1, the total ALX tokens shown in the application will be reset to 15,000 ALX in preparation for Phase 2.  Phase 2: Users who continue to participate in the beta test after Phase 1 and new users who sign up for the airdrop between day 31 and the end of the beta test period will earn the ALX tokens payouts indicated for each in-app activity they complete, until Phase 2 of the beta ends.  When will you get your ALX tokens? ALX token totals displayed in the app during Phase 2 of the beta test have exactly the same value as real ALX tokens, but have not been delivered to your wallet. Within 30 days of the end of the beta test period, the ALX token you accumulated in Phase 2 will be delivered to the public ERC20 wallet address to be provided upon request.  Once you have installed ALX and completed the ALX Beta Survey, you will be on your way to earning ALX, helping us bring cryptocurrency mainstream and putting an end to annoying, intrusive and exploitative marketing practices!",False
