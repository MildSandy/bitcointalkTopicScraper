This started in January, that's 7 months ago. There was a very inconvenient swap of tokens or whatever that occurred, to the point that I didn't know which one is valid in my Ethereum wallet.  I myself work in a similar environment and I can understand stress, deadlines, and hard work. However, the thing that bothers me is the amount of time you had (7 months) during which you did absolutely nothing except sending emails to registered users with the good ol' cliche ""The team is working hard"", ""We applied for 4 major exchanges"", ""More news coming soon"", ""Cards are ready for beta testing"" etc.  Now, it's clear to me that this might satisfy a broader audience that doesn't much care about this project in the first place. However, I would like to see some results, soon.  The fact that this coin has been ninja traded on a couple of exchanges is the biggest red flag for me as an investor. The coin was listed on TWO exchanges and you didn't find the time to push emails towards your users and notify them about the exchange listings? You personally said in one of those emails that you are going to issue an ""official"" mail as soon as the coin gets listed. Well, ladies and gentlemen, you failed miserably with that task.  So, after the shitstorm with coin swaps coupled with two ninja exchanges and the major standdown for SIM cards, thing are not looking too good after 7 long months.

Do you realize how unethical and unprofessional that looks?  Hundreds and thousands of people came in with their money to go through ICO and most of them paid $0.1/per coin (depending on the round and all that stuff), but let's say the average price of your coin during ICO was around 10 cents.  Now tell me, who would in their right mind push a coin to an exchange WITHOUT demand because you STILL don't have a working product, even though you uploaded several videos of SIM cards ""in action"", and on top of that you didn't let your INVESTORS know ""Hey, there's a new exchange, you might want to check it out"". Feel free to check those two exchanges, and compare selling with buying books and you'll see the results of your incompetence. You cannot list a coin with absolutely zero offerings to the ecosystem, because NO ONE IS GOING TO BUY IT, as you can see on those two shitty exchanges.  I was slapping myself constantly for weeks for being an idiot and putting a lot of money in something that looked somewhat legitimate.

What I see is that you guys are at a massive halt and are running around like beheaded chickens because you don't know how to solve the issue you have stumbled upon.

Then you moved to mobilink.io domain and when i pointed on twitter you guys fucked around with me and sent me threats.. I will f*** u guys up if you don't stop this ico.  I've lost 70K USD with your fucking ROB Solidium who was 1st pretending to be Daniel Lee. I know the story behind you guys.  You hired your SO called Rob Scammer as a CEO so your name doesn't involve in it and then you put him on website and videos. You guys are all so messed up. I have connections in the government in the Philippines and have filed all the documents and proof to the authorities. Every one of you guys will be busted really soon.   CHECK OUT their fucking new invention.They deto copied everything from BLOCKSIMS.IO Website Even the FAQ.  These people are crazy and funny.

You apparently don't have a clue about web design and purchased templates. See Shehar is such a scumbag he hired people off Fiverr to do web design for him. Those people he hired bout a template and left it on the staging site. So if it was you that took screen shots, congrats you are apparently the dumbest person on the planet and don't know that templates come with PLACE HOLDER information so you can see what it could look like. I've personally invested over $200,000 and I'm really tired of seeing your lies being posted like you have 1 purpose in life and thats is to attack Mobilink.   If Rob is associated with UAHPAY please show us who is Daniel Li besides place holder text?  The name Daniel Li or Rob Soliduim is not associated in anyway with the Ukrainian based ICO.  Where is your connection? Because they interviewed Ray Reddington? How much Koolaid do you drink?  Your Logic chain is broken. CNN might hire you though.... so there is still hope.   ",False

Firstly, I am member of the team so I will clarify and answer. (1) Our hard cap goal seems high compared to other ICOs because what we are offering is different. Our objective is to gain 1 million SIM card clients through the whole ICO period from all around the world. The market is over 6 Billion smartphones, getting such a tiny percentage of people who would want to get unlimited voice and data plus earn revenue monthly is achievable if we can get the message out there.  (2) Our total amount of Tokens is 9 Billion starting at $0.10 USD.... we believe that there is a lot of room to grow. Just is transactions alone within our network will be like nothing else on the market today (mobilink to sim card users, sim card users to fiat / other currencies, advertisers to mobilink, mobilink to telecom)  (3) ""40% on Interconnection development"" -- This does not refer to develop the technology, our technology already exist. We are not re-inventing the wheel, we are re-directing Advertising revenues to the users instead of large centralized companies like google & facebook keeping it all. The fund will go towards developing the customer support presence we need to have in all the countries and regions, for eg. locations  (4) ""Existing operator called mobilink"", we are aware of that small operator in Pakistan, our company name on our telecom agreements is Mobilink-Network and does not conflict. We are a global company, that will be owned by the people, for the people and powered by them. That small company will not affect us.",False

MOBILINK-COIN will eliminate all mobile monthly fees to users, by replacing your current mobile SIM card with a MOBILINK-SIM Card. The revenue that’s currently generated from user’s monthly voice/data service fee will be replaced by revenue from digital advertising. In fact, revenues generated from digital mobile ads per user are forecasted to be more than 235% of mobile monthly fee revenues by 2021. This will allow MOBILINK-Network and its COIN holders to earn more in MOBILINK-COINS than what they would currently pay in monthly mobile service fees.    Example: If your monthly mobile phone bill was $60/month, instead of it charging you that amount monthly, you will earn $40 or more in value of MOBILINK-COINS. In addition, MOBILINK-COIN market cap value will increase based on its massive activity of COIN transfers, remittances and usage amount, therefore allowing the MOBILINK-COIN market cap value to increase exponentially. Unlike centralized telecom carriers, that charge you a monthly fee for local voice and data usage, in addition to international roaming rates and overage fees, MOBILINK will charge no monthly fees, and there are no roaming fees or hidden fees, because there are no fees PERIOD!  Integrated with our MOBILINK-Network is our MOBILINK-WALLET platform which will allow users to buy, sell, hold and manage cryptocurrencies and cryptonized assets in a secure manner. Additionally, the MOBILINK-COIN MasterCard will allow consumers to engage in e-commerce and walk-in purchases within the mercantile sector. All while the consumer is in full control of his finances at all times.  MOBILINK-COIN ICO is designed to facilitate the development of this platform with full details available on the website. The MOBILINK-COIN Private ICO sale will begin on December 15, 2017, while the Pre-ICO will be launched on February 20th, 2018 and the ICO is launching on March 16th, 2018 by Mobilink Network.    MOBILINK NETWORK is also offering premium rewards for early adopters. Visit www.Mobilink.io for more information.  Distribution plan includes Operation Overhead, Interconnection Development, Advertisement, Marketing, and Development.  The first months of 2018, MOBILINK-COINS will be released on exchanges. The team has not yet listed the coin to open trades since it initially decided to list coins only after the work is completed and the project is launched.  MOBILINK-Network and MOBILINK-COIN aim to build a mobile service provider digital ecosystem of the future. The Mobilink-coin will lay a foundation and ecosystem, where we foresee massive growth and potential not just for 1 or 2 years from now, but for decades into the future. MOBILINK-Network is leading the way in innovation and will be changing the economic social landscape of digital media and communications worldwide.  ICO Dates: 20 February – 15 April, 2018  Purchase: MOBILINKCOIN  ICO Structure: A total of 3.1 billion Mobilink-Coins (3,100, 000,000) will be available during the ICO sale.
