On the other side of the spectrum, if an investor takes part in an ICO, you own a digital asset coin, that is issued by the company. Usually, the currency is some sort of utility token with its own specific role in the company's ecosystem trading between i.e a consumer, a content-maker and an advertiser.  The increasing demand rises the intrinsic value of the currency sometimes by tousands of percentage. To put this into perspective, the highest performing stock in the S&P 500 rose only 132% in 2017.
