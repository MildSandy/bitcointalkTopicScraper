They simply define a certain number of coins that  they assign to every address they wish BEFORE the coin goes out to the public. They have this way a coin pile without mining and its extremely easy to get rich by simply selling their coins with the first chance (usually after a pump which THEY cause by spreading a bullish rumor for the coin!) and lefting the coin to dump afterwards!  3) Another one is having dev tax (some coins even 20%) so the team behind the coin is continuously gaining more money sanctioning the transactions which blockchain technology was supposed to free from the centralized crows like banks !!  4) The most tricky of all : Hardfork ! Like with the ZCL scandal , some coins may seem fair , without the 3 first flaws of unfairness, but the devs are just making a new coin out of an older (by making a hard fork) which means that they make a new ''updated"" blockchain after certain blocks of the old one ! Those who meet some requirements (like having certain old coins) , take  the new one and this way the rich are becoming richer and the guys who have critical information , know very well if the old coin is going to be abandoned and which time is the right to sell them off .  There are VERY FEW coins which are really FAIR without the 1-2-3 characteristics and EVEN LESS with honest dev teams which have desgned them EXCLUDING ANY hard fork possibility (characteristic 4).  Please be CAREFUL , trust ONLY cryptos without ALL of the 4 characteristics above ! BTCZ is the one I know. No ico, no airdrops, no premine, no taxes , NO HARD FORKS. It's time for all of us to adopt a PURE COMMUNITY DIGITAL COIN , to free the transactions worldwide like Satoshi had dreamed , but without the flaws of the BTC (like its low speed, its hard forks ,its centralized mining by sharks , its poor privacy options and its low max supply inflicting long non integer numbers 0.0000023 etc ) Btcz is called ""BTC2"" because it is perfectly designed in order to fullfill the vision of SATOSHI , delivering everything btc was meant to offer to the world in a completely FAIR WAY.  It has a strong community , ultra fast and safe android ewallet and zk snarks privacy options among the countless features which is offering. And it is really  new and cheap right now.

Stay away! October 30, 2017, 05:44:24 PM  #1 So some of you may have come across 'Bitair' with their initial coin offering still ongoing (may I add, with a 45% bonus still available, despite the fact their whitepaper contradicts that this bonus should still be as high right now). Their fake website can be found at bitair.io  They claim they are going to revolutionise the aviation industry with the invention of this new cryptocurrency, which is apparently already in use by 'Asia Pacific Travel' in multiple offices in the middle east. On further investigation, I have concluded that Bitair and everything related to them is completely fake and it is a scam - stay away!  Here's why:  1. All of the linkedin profiles created for their 'team' that you can access through their website appear to be fabricated. When you research the team further, you will discover that they never held the previous positions claimed in their profiles  2. All the twitter profiles are suspiciously created around the same date in September and there is a complete lack of activity in October, contrasting with the previous spam that was posted in September. See their CEO's Twitter example here: https://twitter.com/TommBarron. Further, look at the people that the CEO is following - they are completely random individuals from foreign countries - highly unlikely a 'UK Graduate from Oxford University' setting up such a company would be following even a fraction of these people  3. There are multiple fake facebook profiles that have reviewed their main page (https://www.facebook.com/bitair.io/) Apparently this is the CEO: https://www.facebook.com/barr.tommy.104?hc_ref=ARS9d7eQReYBzJBI5HxPVVy8-yhdsgVfRWRMFLfmGjX-9vwTXZvVk2WAIH7sv3TjozY who left a review. Conveniently in his atrocious profile picture too, his back is facing us - who is the mystery man? Another example here: https://www.facebook.com/liam.gigg.7965?hc_ref=ARSt-HgwfrccelsmVl51rAGUY5cEyLPh9AMTf6tAiT5wH-zKe3euKxSQgXILI3w46Ag (Oliver Baines who is supposedly the co-founder). Half of their pictures are random models and there is no congruency at all  4. The main youtube video on their website appears fake for many reasons. First, the actors (two of which featured make up the apparent 'team') are just repeating stuff that is in their professional looking whitepaper. They don't add anything to what is already on their website, and in all honesty they do not appear to be Entrepreneurs creating such a company when you simply listen to them. The setup is a completely fake and cheap looking office. They have a few props like a big sign in the background, and there are people 'working' away in the background on laptops and phones, which looks completely fake. One of them looks particularly bored as if he cannot wait for the video to end so he can take his money from this elaborate scam and leave.  5. The company has spent much effort in advertising their initial coin offering all over the internet. For example, it features as a 'platinum' initial coin offering on coin schedule to attract attention, however they have simply paid for this to attract more traffic to their site.  6. If you research the addresses for their supposed companies, they seem completely fake and cease to exist in conjunction with the proposed company names.  7. The initial coin offering is still offering a 45% bonus, which contradicts completely with their whitepaper, in which it states that in the 'remaining 38 days' of the initial coin offering (which we are currently in), the bonus would be 15% if you contributed over a certain amount specifically (see whitepaper here https://bitair.io/bitair-whitepaper.pdf)  8. The rate for exchange remains constant throughout the initial coin offering. Is this not unusual considering that the value of ETH and BTC are changing constantly? What do they even value their coin at? Nothing obviously as it is fake. This point in conjunction with point 7 goes to show that they don't care and simply want your BTC/ETH, in exchange for some Bitair which will be worth virtually nothing immediately. It's all a scam.  There are probably more points I could come up with but I'll stop here as the evidence is big enough already!  DO NOT exchange BTC or ETH from Bitair as it is all a very elaborate scam and they will steal your money!  Please let me know your thoughts  ===========================",False

In 2016 the industry grew by 3.1% while supporting 6 million  additional jobs in numerous related sectors. In total, travel and tourism generated US$7.6 trillion (10.2% of global GDP) and 292 million jobs in 2016, equivalent to 1 in 10 jobs in the global economy. The sector accounted for 6.6% of total global exports and almost 30% of total global service exports.  The outlook for the travel and tourism sector in 2017 remains robust and will continue to be at the forefront of wealth and employment creation in the global economy. The role of travel and tourism becomes even more significant, as an engine of economic development and as a vehicle for sharing cultures, creating peace, and building mutual understanding.  Aviation Market with High Demand Growth of Passengers  IATA1 forecasts passenger demand to double over 20 Years and expects 7.2 billion passengers to travel in 2035, a near doubling of the 3.8 billion air travellers in 2016. The prediction is based on a 3.7% annual CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate) noted in the release of the latest update to the association’s 20-year air routes to, from and within Asia-Pacific. They will see an extra 1.8 billion annual passengers by 2035, with an overall market size of 3.1 billion.

It is secure, has lower fees than traditional payment methods, faster access with no limitation of the amount used to buy any travel & tourism services.  ▄▄▄ ICO SCHEDULE  ▶ Token Allocation  o   15% to Investor Presale o   55% to Investor Public ICO (15% to bonus fund and 40% to purchase) o   20% to Bitair Foundation o   10% to Bitair Team  ▶ Butget distribution  25% kept as reserve 10% for Marketing, promotion purposes 25% for expenditure  related to platform development and business expansion 40% be stored to control technological development.  ▄▄▄ Team: The team behind the project is a combination of experienced managers, blockchain developers and cryptocurrency experts.
