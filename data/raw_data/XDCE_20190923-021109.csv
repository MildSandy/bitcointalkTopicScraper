Since the very beginning, XinFin Network has been growing rapidly and exponentially. XinFin has launched a Consensus, TestNet — Apothem, XDC Utilities and a completely renovated website — all of which are running optimally.  The XinFin team has given some extra attention to project development in the past few months, a little more than normal. Being an open source public Blockchain project, XinFin has secured many approvals and achievements so far from various institutions and development communities, thanks to the community contributors who extended appreciable support during the journey.  Keeping the extensive support and contribution in mind, XinFin has decided to introduce several new bounty programs and incentives for community members and contributors. It firmly believes that an open source project is only strong and successful if it has a loyal community. Thus, community contributors should always be incentivized to create an open source project which is developed by the community and for the community.  Take a look at the Bounty Programs below and their corresponding incentives. They are specific to certain skill sets:  Content Creation There are 3 opportunities for content creation: 100K XDC will be awarded to those who create content related to XinFin’s Existing Platforms or Utilities for Medium/YouTube/Blog/Twitter/GitHub/LinkedIn and share it on social media networks. Content should be a Help File, like a “How To” around XinFin Network. 4.5 million XDC will be awarded to those who write and publish a content piece related to XinFin for online or offline media. For example, TechRadar, Bloomberg, CNBC, Forbes, Reuters. 1.5 million XDC will be awarded to those who mention XinFin in a leading digital media.

XinFin today announced the new address prefix starting with XDC. With this implementation, XinFin Network will become distinguishable from other platforms which are also based on go-ethereum codebase. Developer team at XinFin performed a major change in Ethereum Virtual Machine to achieve the unique XDC address prefix. Developer team also changed the various libraries used for dApp.  Based on Delegated Proof of State Consensus algorithm and go-ethereum codebase, XinFin XDC Wallet address will now start with ‘XDC’ in place of ‘0x’. The unique address prefix will help users recognize XDC Wallet address instantly without even mentioning it.  Here is the address creation method used by XinFin. It begins with the private key, which uses ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm is the cryptographic algorithm in the core of addresses) to create a public key. The public key is then hashed using Keccak-256, which gives us a 32-byte string. XinFin drops the first 12 bytes, and the remaining 20 bytes yield a 40 character hexadecimal address, to which is added an XDC prefix. There’s no transformation to Base58, which means XinFin addresses remain hexadecimal.  “Replacing the ‘0x’ prefix with XDC will make our XDC Wallet addresses easily recognizable for users who often tend to misinterpret wallet addresses for another blockchain due to their ignorance and lack of technical knowledge. With XDC prefix implementation, users can easily perform transactions without losing their tokens. This XDC address prefix implementation was important to eliminate the challenges; a user faces while performing transactions and I am glad, our developer team achieved it”, said Atul Khekade, Ecosystem Development Head, XinFin.  XinFin TestNet is already live at http://xinfin.network/ and LiveNet will be live within a few weeks after thorough testing.

And XDCE (ERC-20).  They are 1:1 swap able anytime at alphaex.net. They are different tokens with the same price. XDC is the the underlying token for major use on the Tradefinex platform that will be adopted mainly by Financiers, Suppliers, etc to foster industrial and governmental projects.  XDCE will be the liquidity gateway for XDC, that's its main use. Since inevitably speculation and trading on many exchanges factors liquidity, XDCE will be the ERC-20 token for that. The supply of XDCE is derived from XDC so XDCE liquidity equals liquidity for XDC. I recommend that you go for XDCE if you do not plan on using TradeFinex, likely best you hold XDCE.  However, the ewallet is only for XDC! So in order to send it to an ETH adress you need to swap it to XDCE first at Alphaex.net",False

IBM and big banks on WallStreet have the same technology and doing the same thing as XinFin and they have the big money to implement and chew up and overthrow the little XinFin project (it will be very hard for them to win against these big company competitors like IBM/banks/Wallstreet firms that have a big financial war chest to overthrow them).  Also with 100 billion XinFin tokens and low number of token holders and no social media coverage, many red flags on this token.  Not attacking, but don't get caught up in all the xinfin to win hype, when its the billion dollar backed companies that will win in this space, as they have the financial power.  Would take profits to at least get your ICO money back with some profit to at least eliminate all risk in the leftover tokens going forward, as highly likely the competitors with billions of dollars will win, not xinfin in the end, as it doesn't have the financial power to beat their financially stronger competitors.  Lastly, some mistakenly compare XinFin to Ripple which is laughable, as Ripple has billions of dollars and connected with rich banks, unlike XinFin with mere millions and non-profit.  These are all the main reasons WHY the vast market has vastly rejected XinFin (truth will hurt some).",False

Let’s discuss here! Also, feel free to provide your feedback, comments or how you can contribute to XinFin at info@xinfin.org     Beta Version of TradeFinex Is Already Launched  The primary objective of XinFin is to minimize global infrastructure deficit by enabling peer to peer financing between Governments, corporations, buyers, and suppliers to make efficient use of capital and deploy projects. TradeFinex platform will help buyers secure capital at globally competitive rates, give suppliers visibility on global tenders & customer base and gives financiers real-time visibility on their investments using digitization and IoT integration of their assets. Using TradeFinex platform governments can undertake critical public infrastructure projects for the economic well being of the citizens without burdening the treasury. XinFin has rolled out Beta version of TradeFinex platform at the 2nd Global Summit on P2P Digital Asset System Summit held in India. As a part of this association, XinFin will extend its TradeFinex platform to Assocham's network of 300+ trade associations and 450,000 members to minimize inefficiencies in trade and finance. Started with the World's fastest growing economy, TradeFinex platform will be rolled out globally to all leading trade associations in coming weeks. XinFin has already expanded its client base across Singapore, India, USA, Europe and currently working on 10+ pilot projects across aviation, travel, banking, supply chain management among others.    ● XDC Specifications  XinFin (XDC) has derived a fork out of Ethereum blockchain to enable the following features :  Specifications Hashing Algorithm: same as in Ethereum, keccak-256 Dev Language : Go, Java, NodeJs Block time: 2 seconds Type: XDPoS Difficulty re-targets each block ERC 20 compliant token to evolve into it’s own XDC01 standard with security and scalability Fully Auditable One coin is divisible down to 5 decimal places (divisible up to 10-5) Total coins: 100,000,000,000 XDC Pre-mine : 100% (80% in Escrow)  Features Gerant Nodes/Master nodes for quick processing Lite Nodes/Wallet Multi-Sig Contracts API connectivity to IoT devices Lowest latency times upto a few seconds Hybrid Public/Private architecture with connectivity to Ethereum and Bitcoin public blockchains  Website: https://www.xinfin.org/ XDC Explorer: http://www.xinfin.info   ● What is XDCE?  XinFin moved 15 Billion XDC tokens (out of 100 Billion Max supply of XDC tokens) to a swappable token under the ticker, XDCE, which stands for XinFin ERC20. This 15 Billion XDCE token supply will allow 1:1 swap for all existing 15 Billion XDC tokens out in the circulation. All existing holders of XDC tokens will have an option to exercise 1:1 swap between XDC and XDCE at any point in time. As part of this swap, the user will have to surrender XDC tokens and XDCE tokens, received in lieu of the swap, will be transferred in Ethereum Wallet by the user. Vice a versa, a user can swap XDCE tokens purchased from other listed exchanges against XDC tokens using same 1:1 swap.  So, what's the difference between XDC and XDCE?  XDC has its own token standard called XDC01. XDC is the underlying token for major use on the Tradefinex platform that will be adopted mainly by Financiers, Suppliers, etc to foster industrial and governmental projects.  XDCE will be the liquidity gateway for XDC, that's its main use. Since inevitably speculation and trading on many exchanges factors liquidity, XDCE will be the ERC-20 token for that. The supply of XDCE is derived from XDC so XDCE liquidity equals liquidity for XDC. And they are swappable 1:1.  For further information please have a look at our FAQ: https://www.xinfin.org/faq.php   We have sold 3B XDC Tokens during our Pre-ICO in mid-2017. (Hardcap hit) We also sold 3B XDCE Tokens during our ICO (ended March 2018, Hardcap hit). We raised around 15$ Mil USD.    ● XDCE ERC20 Specifications: Circulating Supply: 6,000,000,000 XDC/E Total XDCE coins: 15,000,000,000 XDCE Max Supply: 100,000,000,000 XDC/E  ● Contract address XDCE: 0x41ab1b6fcbb2fa9dced81acbdec13ea6315f2bf2 ; Etherscan  ● Business White Paper : https://www.xinfin.org/resources.php  ● Technical Summary and Architecture Overview : https://www.xinfin.org/resources.php  ● Visit our Team: https://www.xinfin.org/about.php  ● Our Advisors: https://www.xinfin.org/about.php    Roadmap:      XDC Ecosystem:     Exchanges:  The full list of Exchanges can be found here: https://www.xinfin.io       And many more coming...    XDC to XDCE and XDCE to XDC Swap able here:      Wallets Supporting XDCE    ● Token Allocation:    Founders Pool (25%) - Locked for 1 year and 1% only can be released every year. This ensures that the founders are committed to the project for the long term  Ecosystem Development Pool (15%) - Locked and not more than 2.5% can be released every year  Pre-Placement and Follow on token Offerings (10%) - Locked and Milestone based release  Ecosystem Participation Incentives for masternodes (32.5%) - The payout for masternodes and institutions running their applications on the network. Not more than 3% to be released every year.  Hedge Pool (10%) - This supply absorbs the liquidity back in the pool or releases it effectively keeping it constant as a measure against price volatility.  Philanthropic and Social causes (5%) - Not more than 3% can be released every year. If not required to be released, it is locked.  Contingency Supply (2.5%)   ●What will be total combine open supply in the market for XDC and XDCE every year? Not more than 2.5% each year in reducing balance from ecosystem Development pool of 15% and not more than 3% each year in reducing balance from 32.5% of masternodes rewards pool which comes around to not more than 1.25B per year added every year.  ●Why does XinFin have a huge combined supply of 100 Billion coins for XDC/XDCE? Proof of Work driven public networks to consume a huge amount of electricity, have high transaction costs and has huge latency times. This makes them unsuitable for any real-world mission critical applications. In the long term, more practical consensus mechanisms will be built on Stake driven consensus. XinFin network is currently designed on PBFT+stake driven consensus which means participating entities such as masternodes and institutions have to stake their tokens. This simply means that in spite of having 100 Billion tokens, most will be staked and locked for running masternodes, private subnetworks, and various financial applications. Also, the tokens have a release schedule.  ●For further information, please visit our FAQ section https://www.xinfin.org/faq.php",False

We will be releasing 7 Billion tokens in phasewise manner to evolve the XDC protocol for decentralised peer to peer financing.

Validator nodes also need to hold certain amount of XDC in escrow.  10 percent tokens are in hedge pool that provides intrinsic mechanism for price stability in trades in volatile markets.  Here is token distribution:  25% for core team - in escrow 10% for phasewise ICO of which 3% have been sold to pre ICO. 7% to be released in phasewise manner for evolving Blockchain. 15% for Long term organisational hires 5% for humanitarian 10% for hedge pool for intrinsic guarantee on trades 35% for master nodes allocated using smartcontracts.
