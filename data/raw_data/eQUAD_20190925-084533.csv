Today the team is on fire! They are all over the news, check out the interview released by Mike Davie - Founder and CEO - for DataStorageAsean. Here's a little extract for you :    “The global Data Economy is made up of layer upon layer of middlemen who buy and sell data which eventually makes its way to the end user with many of these middlemen hiding their source, it is currently impossible to know where that data came from, whether it was falsified, exaggerated or duplicated. This complete lack of transparency has real-world consequences; companies will make multi-million-dollar decisions, Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms will come to certain judgments, and governments will decide major public policy based on data that could potentially be wrong. Quadrant Protocol will help put an end to this by establishing a method by which users of data know exactly where that data comes from, who produced it and whether it has been changed. This will result in more accountability, and more trust with significant knock-on benefits.”  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Or maybe you'll be more pleased to read about the LAUNCH OF MAINNET AND THE SIX-MONTH TESTING PHASE INCLUDING PROJECTS WITH IMDA     Let us know if you have any comments and don't forget to join the conversation over Telegram as well!",False

To properly get back on it, we first must understand which are Quadrant main competitors -- you can point projects like Ocean Protocol, Streamr, IOTA, Repux & Synapse.Ai for that.  A lot of companies in the space claim they will use users' data to create revenue, or value, for them.  Here's what Quadrant Protocol aims to achieve and we believe none of the competiting projects are working on anything similar:  👉Quadrant aims to build the data economy around the silos that large data-hoarding companies like Google and Facebook create, in turn diminishing their power.  👉Quadrant also aims to address the non-transparency issues in the data industry, which lead to a lot of fraud where companies are hiding their sources. With the transparency promoted within Quadrant, companies will be able to trace the data sources for compliance purposes, as well as ensure that they get the data they paid for and that it is what they want for their application.  👉As well, Quadrant ensures that all the data providers within the value chain receive proper and fair compensation, as the original creators, dubbed as the nurseries, are often left out when it comes to the profits generated by the data they provide aggregators or companies.  As for what the team will do to support the coin in the future, you should visit the Medium Blog and see the developments there, believe they speak for themselves.

Then, eQUAD will be converted to Quadrant’s native token, QUAD. (For the purposes of this analysis, we will discuss Quadrant’s token economics using QUAD, which will eventually take the place of eQUAD). Here are QUAD’s uses:     Medium of exchange for data transactions (e.g. buying, selling, staking to access datasets)     Stamping data and having it verified by Guardian Nodes (maintain and secure Quadrant’s blockchain), who are then paid for their verification services The total supply of QUAD tokens is 1,000,000,000 QUAD. 40% of the tokens will be sold in the token sale, 20% will be held by the company (foundation), 20% will be for stakeholders (advisors, operations, and security), 10% will be held in reserve (network, community, and partner development), and 10% will be for the team. Team tokens will be initially locked and then vested over 5 years in monthly increments. The token sale has a soft cap of $7m and a hard cap of $20m. If the sale raises more than the soft cap, which it has as of writing, contributions will be initially locked and released over 4 years, with 40% becoming available after the end of the token sale and the remaining 60% being released yearly at an annual rate of 15%. Token sale proceeds will be used as follows.     35% Business and Network Development     30% R&D     25% Operations and Security     5% Legal, Accounting, and Compliance     5% Treasury (ensure smooth operation of the ecosystem and that people can use the protocol even if tokens are unavailable to volatility in QUAD supply and demand) Unsold eQUAD will be held in a reserve for a future token sale to be held within 2 years after the conclusion of the public token sale.  Team Founder and CEO Mike Davie – Quadrant is led by Founder and CEO Mike Davie. Davie has a lot of experience in data and is also the Founder and CEO of DataStreamX, an online marketplace for real-time data created by big data, machine to machine (M2M), and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. DataStreamX was named one of Singapore’s 20 Hottest Startups of 2017 by Singapore Business Review. Davie’s experiences at DataStreamX led him to create the blockchain-based Quadrant Protocol solution. Before DataStreamX, Davie worked at renowned companies like Samsung, where he held roles in business development, marketing, and product strategy. Davie has also been a speaker at Big Data conferences, such as Monetizing Big Data in Telecoms World Summit 2017, 2nd Asia Conference on Big Data and Analytics for Insurance, and Echelon 2015. Advisors Advisors for Quadrant Protocol include the following:     Benedict Chan, CTO at BitGo, a blockchain security company that is one of the earliest blockchain-based companies and pioneers of the multisignature Bitcoin wallet (requires multiple sign-offs for transactions to be made, heightening security). BitGo was also the first blockchain service to offer insurance against theft from its Bitcoin-based wallets. Chan brings his technical expertise to the Quadrant Protocol project.     Hari Krishnan, CEO at PropertyGuru, Asia’s leading property portal and one of the most prominent tech companies in Southeast Asia. Krishnan advises Quadrant on growth strategies.     Pavel Bains, CEO at Bluezelle, a company that had its own successful ICO and builds blockchain solutions for the finance industry. Bluezelle was named a World Economic Forum Tech Pioneer in 2017. Bains brings his technical knowledge to Quadrant.  Verdict A breakdown of the risks and growth potential is provided below.  Risks     Private sale mentioned but no details given (allocation amounts, contribution limits, vesting, etc.). (-0.5)     Community hype could be higher (“only” 16k Telegram group members, 4.6k Twitter followers – as of writing; and generally not as hyped as other ICOs). (-0.5)     No partnerships detailed (how will they get people to use Quadrant Protocol). (-0.5)  Growth Potential     Strong team with data industry experience. (+3)     Strong advisory board. (+2)     Financial discipline – token sale proceeds are being vested to ensure that initial spending doesn’t get out of hand. Airbnb was started by two guys racking up $20k in credit card debt. Makes you question some ICO raises. (+2)  Disposition There seems to be tons of ICOs trying to tackle the need for a quality data marketplace. Quadrant Protocol stands out due to its team, advisors, and financial discipline. However, lack of details on private contributions, lack of relative community hype, and no details on partnerships makes one wonder if it will get off the ground.

Pretty exciting, isn't it? So, as you can see from the article, here is how the partnership will work: Quadrant will supply satellite images of Singapore to Effect.AI.  These will then be annotated via a micro-tasking methodology carried out by a crowdsourced workforce selected on a reliability scoring system, and distributed into smaller files classified on Effect.AI’s Effect Force platform. These files will be rendered as pixel polygons, returned to Quadrant, and finally converted into GPS polygons.  Adding data will be an assembly of all the micro-tasks carried out by ""workforce"" so this means that per each micro-task, the user will be micro-rewarded.  More details will follow up as the project progresses, but if you need even more clarity I can always ask the team and see if they can share some number projection for the micro-tasks  I hope this is what you were after!",False

This is no different in the data economy. Data is easy to fake, copy and misrepresent. This makes it difficult for Data Consumers to properly vet data when purchasing it from third parties. When purchasing data, Data Consumers want to follow applicable laws and regulations. They do not want to be unethical in their business practices. There is too much at stake if they should be found engaging in unethical practices. Hence from a business perspective, they do not want to pay for data that is not authentic. From a regulatory perspective, they need to know where their data comes from. Data Vendors are not always so scrupulous. Some are happy as long as they make their money. Data Consumers, therefore, are not always getting the authentic data that their systems depend on. Unauthentic data input equals a poor resulting output. It is the case for data-driven business decisions, algorithmic trading, AI/ Machine Learning applications and oracles for smart contracts. If the data is false, the consequences can be dire.",False

Say if a small company is making sports articles, thus creating data. In the current system, once it is on the internet, that company can't control it anymore.

On Quadrant network, not only company will be rewarded for the first time they publish the article, but each time when that data is being used.

The authors of the Quadrant protocol intend to solve a number of actual problems by creating a mapping plan for disparate data sources.  Quadrant Protocol uses Proof of Authentication and Provenance — this is exactly where the blockchain technology will be integrated most. Confidence in the data will be built, and recording historical data will help in the distribution of the level of confidence.  The new platform sets itself the following tasks: • provides high-quality and efficient data processing; • provides data control, so all information on the unit is reliable and truthful; • processes a large number of transactions for a short period of time; • ensures transparent interactions of all participants.

The data exists but is often scattered throughout various industries and made up of different types. This makes it difficult for small companies to procure the volumes of diverse data that they need. Large companies are far more immune to this problem because they have the resources to collect and store the volumes of data necessary for their AI activities. Google,Amazon etc for example, has access to vast amounts of data via their own products: conversation and purchase history from Gmail, location history from Google Maps, and mobile/ shopping history activities from the Android OS. They are able to take a much more holistic view as a result of having so many users. Companies like these are able to produce AI innovation at a much larger scale, solving bigger problems and producing better products.

Thank you for your interest in Quadrant Protocol.  Quadrant Protocol network will consist of: 1. Nurseries — the Atomic Data Producers (ADPs) that create the original data records. They create Stars (raw data), which can then be grouped into Constellations. 2. Pioneers — the Data Vendors that create data products with the smart contracts on Quadrant. 3. Elons — the visionaries that utilize the created data products and with them, build new and unique products and services. They rely on Constellations and Constellation blueprints to make sense of the data space, which they will travel through. 4. Guardians — the master nodes that protect the integrity of the chain, ensuring that it is not compromised. The Guardians ensure that the Constellations created by the Pioneers are not compromised and provide the services of stamping, authenticating and verifying data. The Guardian Node hosts and builds transactions into the Quadrant network (creates blocks on the Quadrant Network chain), anchors to a public blockchain like Ethereum, executes Constellations and handles data provisioning and delivery.

Thanks for your interest. You are right, this is the new level of transparency but also data authenticity since all records of data production will be stored on the blockchain. As for the possible leak, all modifications of data will be easily discovered on the Quadrant Network. Please note that Guardians will be the master nodes that protect the integrity of the chain, ensuring that it is not compromised. The Guardians ensure that the Constellations created by the Pioneers are not compromised and provide the services of stamping, authenticating and verifying data.

Only some of it are:  1. Gap between the companies that pose a huge amount of data and the ones which don’t have the ability to store data, smaller companies. 2. Fake and unauthentic data, one of the biggest problems for data consumers is that they don’t have the option to check data authenticity. 3. Unsustainable data feeds, all data producers should be rewarded for their work, otherwise, when they are not incentivized, they lose will to produce new data 4. Unfair revenue distribution for the original data producers, also big problem since data resellers are the ones getting to the biggest piece of a cake when it comes to distribution of rewards for data that users are consuming.

Quadrant is a protocol to access, create and distribute data services. The protocol itself bridges and enables solution providers to link all the siloed data, enabling it to be traced back and forth, end to end, to be included on AI, BI and anything else that required a large volumes of data, this enables DaaS and AI service firms to build new products and services on top of the infrastructure and network.  There are 5 participants in Quadrant Protocol:  Nurseries: the atomic data providers that create the original data records. They create stars, which can then be grouped into constellations.  Constellations: the smart contracts that map multiple data sources into a single data product. These data products are then transacted between parties.  Pioneers: the entities that create data products with Quadrant’s smart contracts.  Elons: the entities that utilize the created data products and with them, build new and unique products and services. They rely on constellations and constellation blueprints to make sense of the data space, which they will travel through.  Guardians: the master nodes that protect the integrity of the chain, ensuring that it is not compromised. The Guardians ensure that the constellations created by the Pioneers are not compromised and provide the services of stamping data into the system.
