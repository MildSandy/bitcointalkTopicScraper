See, for example, this:    Did you take care to meet all those regulations, for your jurisdictions at least?  Being a security token, also means having a hard time listing on exchanges. Most exchanges I know, do not accept security tokens, others have de-listed the ones they had, to comply with regulations. There are some accepting them, but they are very rare and hard to get on (see this for reference: https://blog.neufund.org/token-up-2-your-complete-guide-to-security-token-exchanges-fab49baed8fc).

Environmental ICOs are on the rise and are contributing positively to the environment. We believe (and hope) that the Silent ICO will open the eyes of other companies to the opportunity of carbon-neutral Methanol production and inspire competition. There is currently plenty of room for many companies to profit and grow in this space.  Increased output will lead to increased adoption of Methanol as a fuel, which in turn will increase the opportunity for everyone. Furthermore, an increase in carbon neutral Methanol will put more pressure on governments to implement taxes and restrictions on traditional methanol suppliers in order for them to switch to carbon neutral production. They will be looking for technology and production partners such as us.   As a side note, we believe that competition is more likely to be triggered as a result of the increase in Carbon emission regulations than as a result of our ICO. In either situation, we will be one step ahead with a distinct first mover advantage.",False

The plant has a cost of approximately (150k).  The key data of ECONIMO (series 1) : - A capacity of 30kW electricity, 80kW heat or 32kW cold. - A heat pump backup system of about 54kW heat - Consumption about 18 liters/h at full power - variants for 60-70 kW cold only in hot region ( absorption chiller) - fits for a 15 flat building in central Europe or for about 8-10 houses in common. - Tank capacity around 20 to 50 tons methanol (1 ton = 1100 liters) - Exhaust gas analysis: some CO gas but wide under the limits.

We believe (and hope) that the Silent ICO will open the eyes of other companies to the opportunity of carbon neutral Methanol production and inspire competition. There is currently plenty of room for many companies to profit and grow in this space.  Increased output will lead to increased adoption of Methanol as a fuel, which in turn will increase the opportunity for everyone. Furthermore, an increase in carbon neutral Methanol will put more pressure on governments to implement taxes and restrictions on traditional methanol suppliers in order for them to switch to carbon neutral production. They will be looking for technology and production partners such as us.   As a side note we believe that competition is more likely to be triggered as a result of increase in Carbon emission regulations than as a result of our ICO. In either situation we will be one step ahead with a distinct first mover advantage. """,False
