Xriba is the first protocol to add transparency to corporate cash flows, making them available on the public Blockchain.  Pillars of accountability and transparency.  TOKENCHECK FOUNDATION The TokenCheck Foundation is a group of organizations dedicated to establishing accountability and transparency in the Blockchain sector. Xriba powers the financial transparency of TokenCheck Foundation clients and provides smart contracts for accountability. The foundation performs financial audits to check whether released funds have been used appropriately, and technical audits of code and other products to check whether milestones have been reached.  MILESTONE BASED FUNDS RELEASE To foster accountability funds collected during token sales are distributed to the company in tranches and linked to the achievement of milestones. A schedule detailing the milestones in question and the amount of funds to be released will be proposed by the fundraising company and detailed in their whitepaper. The funds release schedule is reviewed by the community, which is similar to the current token distribution model, and written into the smart contract for token sales . When the company indicates a milestone has been reached, a technical and financial audit is performed before the next tranche of funding to use in working towards the next milestone is released.  AUDIT REPORTS & TRUST RATINGS Financial and technical audits will be performed before further tranches of token sale funds are distributed to the company, and published for full transparency. reports purchased will be scored on a scale of 0 to 100. Achieving a score of eighty or higher will unlock the next tranche. Scoring 70-79 will unlock 1/3 of the next tranche to allow for unprecedented success. Many users complain that there are not enough objective company metrics available in the Blockchain sector, by using audit reports we aim to provide an independent source of information about companies and their progress.  CORPORATE CASHFLOW DASHBOARD Once funds have been sent for a token sale contract, there is little transparency, contributors have no view into how the company uses the funds. The Funds Transparency Dashboard is a solution which allows the community real-time visibility into the company's bookkeeping. Several methods are applied: - Blockchain; - Artificial Intelligence - OCR (Optical Character Recognition) - Mechanical Turk - Decentralized wallet.  AI Technology Accountants, auditors and lawyers dedicate a great deal of time classifying documents and carrying out administrative tasks. Artificial Intelligence will support companies and their teams to reduce the time and cost of these tasks.  Blockchain for companies Xriba will hugely reduce the time required to transfer financial resources between companies, and above all make accounts management simple, swift and secure. Our ambition is to modernize company banking services by automating bookkeeping Xriba is the new decentralized payment system in the blockchain.  OCR - Optical Character Recognition Accounts automation. Thanks to our optical scanning software, which automatically reads and processes invoices and other documents, the time used for payments will be slashed by 72% over the year.  Mechanical Turk Human Intelligence through API. The OCR system is supported by a team who monitors the process, therefore automating the entire bookkeeping procedure whilst maintaining integrity.  Decentralized wallet Only the account holder will be able to process payments directly through cryptocurrency, avoiding payments via a centralized account. This will help creating a safe and secure company deposit account.
