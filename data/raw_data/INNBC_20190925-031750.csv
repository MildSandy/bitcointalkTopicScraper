With a potential target of 36.7million HIV infected individuals globally, our AIDS cure solution could generate 9billion/year in revenue by successfully targeting 20% of the global HIV infected population, which if our therapy will prove to be safe and effective as an HIV cure we believe is a realistic goal. We will accept the INNBC Token as a means of payment for all our medical products and treatments, which means the price of the Token will backed by the value of our pharmaceutical products.  This is the long term goal of our project, while there are more immediate utilities that will support the price of the Token earlier, such as the JDM online garage and the ""You're not alone"" app.  ‚Ä¢At the first stage (right after the end of the Token Sale) we will launch our INNBC JDM ONLINE GARAGE, were INNBC tokens can be spent to buy cars from a selection of high quality JDM classic cars. Selection of cars will mostly concentrate on classic iconic JDM cars such as Skylines, Supras, Subaru, and EVOs. Wonderfully, when it comes to JDM cars, our founder, Jonathan Fior, has a great expertise as he is personally involved in the business of importing them and over the years he has therefore established a solid network of professional contacts, which makes us confident about providing a quality service.  ‚Ä¢At the second stage (3-6 months after Token sale) we will launch the first version of our ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not alone‚Äù app, were INNBC tokens can be spent to access a number of privileged features in the app ecosystem such as becoming moderator in the social communities. The 1% of the revenue generated by in-app ads will go to community moderators as a compensation for their work. In addition, Token economy will be integral part of the rep reward point system of the social community. Users who will make particularly useful contributions will earn Tokens.  The application will be our official media channel for documenting the progress of our AIDS cure research project, featuring periodic updates such as articles, vlogs. This will create a community where HIV seropositive people can stay up to the date, comment, share, interact with us working on the cure, and with each others. Something that creates a bridge between HIV seropositive people and us research scientists working on the cure. Something that allows the HIV seropositive community and anyone interested to be part of this journey. Something that can send the message that they are not alone in their battle. That we are fighting for them. That we care about them. A message of hope. Our vision and intention is therefore to create an application that will also act as a social app for HIV seropositive people to participate and create new topics and discussions to support each others and stand together in the fight against AIDS.  Notably, the ""You're not alone"" application will provide the platform through which patients will be able to access our HIV therapy by providing information about all the ongoing clinical trials, how to participate, and once our HIV treatment is approved, it will provide information about the clinics and hospitals offering the treatment, and how to book appointments with legit clinicians that are officially collaborating with us, to offer the best services and rates.  I would therefore invite you to read the white paper, section ""business model"", to find very detailed answers to your question.

However, we believe there may be interest in using our application by other research organizations. After all, this would be an application designed by a research scientist for research scientists. Our database will be open to any company or institution interested in using our app for storing their clinical data. Moreover, we will encourage them to do so as we believe that scientific data should be shared publicly.",True

This is a huge news.  We are very excited to announce our official partnership with the French multinational electronics company ARCHOS (https://www.archos.com).   ARCHOS partners with INNOVATIVE BIORESEARCH to promote its ARCHOS Safe-T mini towards crypto-enthusiasts while taking part to the development of medicinal research through the blockchain   Paris / London ‚Äì Monday, July 9th 2018 ‚Äì ARCHOS, the French pioneer of consumer electronics, announces today a partnership with INNOVATIVE BIORESEARCH, a biotech company bringing innovation to the field of cancer, HIV and regeneration research.  INNOVATIVE BIORESEARCH is building up an application based upon the blockchain technology. It consists in a decentralized database for clinical data and in a social platform for the HIV seropositive community. It allows clinicians and patients from all over the world to share and access consolidated clinical information in order to start direct trials and treatments faster.  To finance the needed development of this revolutionary platform, INNOVATIVE BIORESEARCH successfully ended the pre-sale of their INNBC Tokens, with INNBC valued 1‚Ç¨, and a very successful airdrop.  ‚ÄúWith our Safe T mini, we offer a superior level of security to all ICOs investors We are very proud to partner with Jonathan Fior and the INNOVATIVE BIORESEARCH‚Äô team. We are fully confident the blockchain technology is a key contributor in the healthcare industry‚Äù, declares Lo√Øc Poirier, CEO of ARCHOS.  Under the terms of their agreement, ARCHOS is pursuing the promotion of the Safe Mini T, its cold storage hardware wallet delivering the highest security level to keep crypto assets safe offline. INNOVATIVE BIORESEARCH will organize a selling event via its 99,000 Telegram groups where users will be able to register and get a voucher to buy the ARCHOS Safe-T mini. For each sale, 3‚Ç¨ will be devoted by ARCHOS to INNOVATIVE BIORESEARCH‚Äô ICO.  ‚ÄúOur test of the ARCHOS Safe-T mini has been very positive. We are happy to offer a special bonus to our community: the first 10,000 people purchasing their ARCHOS Safe-T mini with our voucher will receive 39 INNBC tokens, valued 39‚Ç¨, from INNOVATIVE BIORESEARCH‚Äù, adds Jonathan Fior, Founder and CEO of INNOVATIVE BIORESEARCH.  About ARCHOS ARCHOS, a pioneer in consumer electronics, continues to innovate and revolutionize the consumer electronics market. Among others, the French manufacturer was first with an HDD MP3 player in 2000, a multimedia player in 2003, Google Android powered tablets in 2009, a connected Smart Home in 2014 and PicoWAN, the first collaborative network dedicated to the IoT, in 2016.

In 2012, Jonathan Fior conceived SupT1 cell infusion therapy, a novel cell-based therapy for HIV using SupT1 cells as a ‚Äúdecoy target‚Äù for the HIV virus to prevent CD4+ T cell depletion as well as to render the virus less cytopathic. Using a standardized T cell line such as the SupT1 cell line should significantly reduce the treatment costs, allowing access to the therapy where access to traditional HIV therapies is restricted by economic and social limitations. In addition, Innovative Bioresearch is studying salamander regeneration as a model for developing novel regenerative and anti-cancer therapies.

Unfortunately, many projects are simply bad ideas from the start.  In the context of fundraising through ICO, we may see an increasing amount of fresh capital influx to crypto market capitalization as cryptocurrency gaining more exposure In the mainstream media and considering that regulation initiative by G20 countries will soon come to provide legal certainty for cryptocurrencies and protections from the prevalent ICO-related frauds.  Up until now, many investors perceive the facts that investing in ICOs is a hard thing to do. Although many are interested in contributing to ICOs, they are unable to do so because they perceive the process of getting their first crypto and its wallet as a mode of payment for ICOs are way too complicated for them.  Gift cards provided by Fixy Network will give an opportunity to people to get into the cryptocurrency-world without going through lengthy verification process since it provides a convenient shortcut. ICO‚Äôs Gift cards will be sold like online credit cards on a website, providing an easy access for everyone around the globe. After purchase, they can be claimed by mail or post.  By using Gift cards provided by Fixy Network, potential investors can invest to any ICO that uses erc20 tokens with their FIAT money and directly receive a gift card that loaded with the ICO‚Äôs token. This method gives an extremely competitive advantage for any ICO to obtain new investors since it eliminates the pain point to invest in any ICOs such as the need for buying cryptocurrency through exchanges with its fees and setting up crypto wallets which seem still perceived as complicated steps by many new investors.  New Partnerships Announcement In this opportunity, FIxy Network is also pleased to announce 3 new partnerships after successfully secured multiple partnerships in the past :  Agentmile (agentmile.com). The world‚Äôs first decentralized CRE leasing platform powered by Al. Agentmile enables brokers and landlords to list their commercial properties on our blockchain powered MLS and offer enhanced leasing capabilities, management and reporting.  Innovative Bioresearch (innovativebioresearch.com). Innovative Bioresearch Ltd is a privately held biotech company, with the goal of bringing innovation to the field of HIV, cancer and regeneration research. In addition, the INNBC Token will be spendable to buy classic iconic JDM cars from our JDM online garage and is therefore backed by the value of actual physical goods.  More partnerships announcement is already in the pipeline and will be announced soon, stay tuned!  Fixy Exchange Listing Opportunity Last but not least, Fixy network is looking to build an altcoin exchange and all partnership ICOs will be listed on the exchange. Altcoins exchange feature on Fixy smartphone app will provide users with ease of access and convenience, ensuring a steady growth of user numbers. Should a startup wants to list its coin on the exchange, the fee will be paid in FXY Token.  Fixy Token will be listed 8 June 2018 on popular exchanges and 25 June is token burn of 85% total supply scheduled. FXY Token price is with 2$ fixed for B2B deals. Actually it can be traded dit for 0.1$ on forkdelta.",True

This is why ICOs can be, without any doubt, a necessary and novel tool for funding potentially vital research that would have otherwise been left to die by the academic world.  Because governments can easily dictate what researches should be funded and developed, and because this process can also be influenced by possible conflicts of interests (e.g., pharmaceutical corporations selling HIV drugs not willing to lose their marketshare if an AIDS cure is developed), ICOs can be a necessary tool for our society to decentralize the funding power from government agencies/pharmaceutical corporations to the collectivity.

Our approach is unique as no other therapy tried to use a permissive T cell-line as a decoy target for the HIV virus. Furthermore, this is a cell-based approach, which is something completely different than traditional drug based approaches that failed to produce an AIDS cure. So we are not in need of inventing a new solution, we just need to further develop the HIV therapy we have already conceived, completing preclinical animal research and move to human trials. I'll post some information from our website regarding our novel AIDS therapy solution.   An Overview of SupT1 Cell Infusion Therapy, our Novel Cell-Based Therapy Solution for HIV   HIV infection usually leads to a progressive decline in number and functionality of CD4+ T lymphocytes, resulting in AIDS development. As explained in Jonathan Fior‚Äôs papers [1‚Äì3], the HIV virus has a higher tropism for SupT1 cells than for primary CD4+ T cells. Several hypotheses have been proposed as an explanation, most notably the higher surface expression of CD4 and CXCR4 receptors in SupT1 cells. In addition, in vitro studies of HIV evolution show that persistent growth in the SupT1 cell line results in a less cytopathic virus with a reduced capacity for syncytium formation, a higher sensitivity to neutralization, improved replication in SupT1 cells and impaired infection of primary CD4+ T cells [4‚Äì6]. Accordingly, Jonathan Fior proposed the infusion of irradiated SupT1 cells as a cell-based HIV therapy to exploit the therapeutic potential of these phenomena [1‚Äì3]. The rationale behind this approach is that moving infection toward the inoculated cells should prevent infection and depletion of the patient‚Äôs own CD4+ T cells and, therefore, AIDS. In such a strategy, SupT1 cells would act as a ‚Äúdecoy target‚Äù for the HIV virus to prevent CD4+ T cell depletion as well as to render the virus less cytopathic. As previously mentioned, in vitro studies of HIV evolution show that prolonged replication in SupT1 cells renders the virus less cytopathic and more sensitive to neutralization. Accordingly, replication of the virus in the inoculated SupT1 cells should also have a vaccination effect; that is, the therapy should also induce the virus to become progressively less aggressive and harmful for the patient. The use of SupT1 cells as a decoy target for HIV has been investigated in vitro and in vivo, with interesting results [1,3]. In vitro data showed that, when primary CD4+ T cells are infected with HIV in the presence of SupT1 cells, the preferential infection of SupT1 cells can spare primary CD4+ T cells from infection and depletion. In vivo data in humanized mice showed that significantly lower viral replication (~10-fold) and potentially preserved CD4+ T cell frequency at Week 1 was scored in animals treated with SupT1 cell infusion. Of note, one animal exhibited a sustained decrease in HIV replication and CD4+ T cell depletion (no virus detected anymore at Weeks 3 and 4), a result that may hold the key to future HIV treatments. Given the urgent and global need for a cost effective cure for HIV, we believe that the millions of people infected by this terrible disease deserve highly innovative HIV cure research strategies, such as SupT1 cell infusion therapy.  In summary, these are some of the potential therapeutic benefits of this cell-based treatment that go beyond what can be achievable with traditional antiretroviral therapy (cART):  1)The vaccination effect. As previously mentioned, SupT1 cells have been shown to have a very powerful vaccination effect in vitro [4‚Äì6]. In this regard, in vitro studies of HIV evolution showed that upon prolonged replication in SupT1 cells, the X4 HIV-1 LAI virus evolves toward a less virulent phenotype with a reduced capacity for syncytium formation, thus losing the main cytopathic feature characterizing X4 strains, and most notably the virus adaptation to replicate in SupT1 cells results in gradually losing the ability to replicate in primary CD4+ T cells [4]. In addition, the variation to neutralization sensitivity after viral growth in tumor T cell lines has also been examined. Interestingly, one study reported that primary isolates that were initially resistant to neutralization acquired sensitivity to neutralization after continuous growth in tumor T cell lines, and that the sensitivity to neutralization progressively increased during the days of culturing [5]. Specifically, it was shown that after 14 days in continuous culture, 100 micrograms/mL of rsCD4 (recombinant soluble CD4) were needed to neutralize 1 TCID of primary isolate, while only 0.3 micrograms/mL of rsCD4 were needed to neutralize 1 TCID of the virus after 75 days in continuous culture. This means that there was a 300 fold increase in virus sensitivity to neutralization after prolonged replication in a tumor T cell line, which is really something remarkable. All these phenomena could therefore harbor a significant therapeutic potential that could be exploited with SupT1 cell infusion therapy to induce HIV infection to evolve into a more tractable state for therapy.  2)Potentially no organ toxicity; cART is a drug based treatment and as such is associated with organ toxicity because the drugs are metabolized by various organs. By contrast, SupT1 cell infusion is a cell-based treatment and there is no chemical substance injected into the body that needs to be metabolized, which could significantly improve the quality of the patient's life.  3)Be effective in patients in a terminal state of disease that developed drug resistant and very aggressive HIV strains. When a patient is treated with cART, the virus fights back because it strives to survive, which can result in the development of very aggressive and drug resistant HIV strains, especially in the terminal stage of the disease and in such cases cART becomes ineffective. By contrast, SupT1 cell infusion therapy provides the virus with a permissive cell-line in which it can preferentially replicate, so that a peaceful coexistence between virus and host becomes possible, which could dramatically improve the patient's health as the virus infection progressively moves toward the inoculated SupT1 cells and the virus becomes increasingly less pathogenic for its host.  4)Possible association of the treatment with novel molecular compounds such as a Vif-inhibitor to act on HIV reservoirs. The HIV-1 Vif protein is essential for viral replication in primary CD4+ T cells but not in SupT1 cells [1]. Accordingly, pharmacologic inhibition of Vif could be combined with SupT1 cell infusion to further restrict viral replication to the inoculated SupT1 cells. Considering that APOBEC3G is expressed by different cell types, such as neuronal cells, astrocytes, and macrophages [2], pharmacologic inhibition of Vif may also have the benefit of acting on HIV reservoirs in the brain and other body areas. There are several molecules with promising anti-Vif activity currently being tested [2]. Similarly, other HIV-1 accessory proteins that are not essential for replication in SupT1 cells (e.g., Vpr, Vpu, and Nef [3]) may also be the target of pharmacologic inhibition. It is important to point out that these drugs would not affect virus replication in the inoculated SupT1 cells, and therefore in combination with SupT1 cell infusion therapy, there should not be development of drug resistance normally associated with drug based treatments.  5)A cost effective AIDS cure solution. Our mission is to provide a cost effective cure solution for AIDS. In contrast with traditional cell-based and gene-based therapies that make use of modified autologous cells and are therefore very expensive and often unpractical for a large scale application, using a standardized T cell line such as the SupT1 cell line should significantly reduce the treatment costs associated with SupT1 cell infusion therapy, allowing access to the therapy where access to traditional HIV therapies is restricted by economic and social limitations. The social and economical impacts of a low cost HIV cure solution would be enormous.  Below some considerations with regard to potential issues:  1)Safety. We take this issue very seriously and are committed to performing very rigorous preclinical research to ensure there is enough data on safety to obtain approval from regulatory agencies for human experimentation. In this regard, injection of irradiated tumor cells as a therapy is already performed in cancer vaccination. In such cases, irradiating the cells prior to inoculation has been shown to ensure treatment safety both in animal and clinical studies [7]. We used the same protocol used in cancer vaccination studies (i.e., 30 Gy of radiation dose for the cells), which resulted in safe in vivo inoculation in our animal study as well [3]. Specifically, all animals successfully survived the treatment and presence of SupT1 cells was almost undetectable at late time points, which means that irradiating the cells prior to inoculation efficiently prevented SupT1 cell replication. Furthermore, we infused high doses of cells (40 million SupT1 cells were infused weekly), which in a highly immunodeficient mouse strain would rapidly lead to animal death in case of tumor development. Therefore, based on the clinical data we already have from cancer vaccination studies, and from the results of our first animal study, we believe that meeting the safety standards required for human trials is something feasible.  2)Rejection issues. Tumors can develop because tumor cells are able to evade immune recognition. For example, SupT1 cells do not express HLA-DR, which is an antigen highly associated with immune recognition [8]. Accordingly, given the tumoral nature of SupT1 cells, they should be significantly less immunogenic than normal cells and as such should survive in the patient long enough to provide a therapeutic effect. However, it is possible that the HIV virus will eradicate the cells faster and more efficiently than the immune system itself in any case.  References  1. Fior J.

However, there is also an economic explanation why there is such an extreme lack of innovation in this field.  There is the huge business of the pharmaceutical corporations selling expensive HIV drug, which aim to make as much profit as possible off of AIDS. These companies would never support the development of a low cost AIDS cure because it would put an end to their huge profits. This is precisely why we need a project such as this one in our society.  There were 36.7million people infected by HIV globally in 2016, 17.5million of which were left untreated, according to UNAIDS.

The reason is simple. There are no modern studies exploring such amazing natural ability to cure cancer in salamanders, which could lead us to develop a cure for cancer. Research in this area was basically interrupted around the 1948, with the study of Rose SM being the last of its kind (Rose SM, Wallingford HM. Transformation of renal tumors of frogs to normal tissues in regenerating limbs of salamanders. Science. 1948;107:457).

This is the difference between our ICO and other ICOs. Our project is based on a real business and we have been doing this for years; it's not a collection of fancy presentations.  HOW WE OPERATE For research projects, Jonathan Fior works as PI (principal investigator), conceiving the experiments and writing the experiment protocol. The work is then commissioned to a Contract Research Organization (CRO), which physically performs the experiments. Jonathan Fior then supervises all aspects related to the research communicating closely with the CRO. Once the experiments are completed, he analyzes the results and writes a scientific paper, which is published in a peer reviewed scientific journal. This means that although our team is not a large team, we actually have companies with 100+ people working for us. This way we can keep a small, yet strong and great, team.   Because we perform the core work internally, and then outsource the rest to big companies with 100+ people (e.g., Axenis, Bertin Pharma), we can operate with a small team.  Now, let me ask you something. Would you rather have the application developed by some junior programmers working on a garage over beers (as it happnes for many ICOs), or have a professional software developer such as WillowTree working on it?  Having said that, our business is expanding and it's surely possible we will increase our team and/or add advisors.

So you know that you hold something that has some actual real world value. The reason is that we wanted our Token to also succeed as crypto used as a means of payment for goods and services. Yes, we were that ambitious.  ‚Ä¢At the first stage (right after the end of the Token Sale) we will launch our INNBC JDM ONLINE GARAGE, were INNBC tokens can be spent to buy cars from a selection of high quality JDM classic cars. Selection of cars will mostly concentrate on classic iconic JDM cars such as Skylines, Supras, Subaru, and EVOs. Wonderfully, when it comes to JDM cars, our founder, Jonathan Fior, has a great expertise as he is personally involved in the business of importing them and over the years he has therefore established a solid network of professional contacts, which makes us confident about providing a quality service.  We also did this because we wanted to protect INNBC Token holders from the highly speculative nature of trading prices on crypto exchanges by having our Token backed by the value of actual physical goods; these classic JDM cars are true collector items and as such they are only going up in value.  Now, to specifically answer your question, let's talk about the Token utility within our platform.  ‚Ä¢At the second stage (3-6 months after Token sale) we will launch the first version of our ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not alone‚Äù app, were INNBC tokens can be spent to access a number of privileged features in the app ecosystem such as becoming moderator in the social communities. The 1% of the revenue generated by in-app ads will go to community moderators as a compensation for their work. So you will be able to use our Token to become moderator, and once you have such a position, you will earn actual money from in-app ads as a compensation for your work.  In addition, Token economy will be integral part of the rep reward point system of the social community. Users who will make particularly useful contributions will earn Tokens. As an incentive to make the community grow, which in turn means more revenue from in app-ads, and thus more earings for moderators.    Now, what is the main factor that will drive the user adoption of our app, which in turn will make the community grow, meaning more revenue from in app-ads? Our AIDS cure research. HIV seropositive people (and anyone who is just interested about AIDS research) will join the community to be updated about the state of our research, to open topics discussing the research, and for receiving information and support by our staff that will manage the platform. In conclusion, our AIDS research will be integral to the utilty and therefore value of INNBC Tokens.  In addition, we plan to accept INNBC Tokens as a means of payment for all our future medical treatments and products.  The ""you're not alone"" app will also feature a decentralized database for processing clinical data. We will start using the app for our own research, which means any user will be able to download the app and have a representation of all the data on the fly. Something that current ancient databases cannot provide. And it is likely that our app will also be used by other research institutions as we believe that it will help speed up clinical research development tremendously.",True

Scientific data need to be immutable. Once a study is peer reviewed and published, its data must be permanently stored and never altered. In the blockchain, all data is stored in every single node, never ceasing to exist, and always staying on the blockchain. It is immutability that gives the blockchain its openness and BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance).  ‚Ä¢Decentralization. The blockchain is designed to be distributed and synchronized across networks, making data freely available to anyone. We believe that scientific data should be shared and not being hidden behind a firewall.  ‚Ä¢Security. The kind of transactions that can be performed are strictly defined in advance and stored in the blockchain as ‚Äúsmart contracts‚Äù; this prevents fraudulent data from being added to the blockchain thus ensuring integrity of the database. By contrast, it would be much easier to compromise a centralized database.  In conclusion, although it is true that such an application could be implemented with a centralized system, decentralization is the only way to ensure the data is not manipulated, and all information is pubblicly available in a platform that can't be influenced by the will of any particular entity or government. Decentralization is essential to hand over administrative authority from central institutions managing the data, such as governments and private entities, to the collectivity. In fact, if the database is controlled by one single entity, being it a private entity or government, it means that such entity has total control over the database, and such control can be influenced by personal conflicts of interests. Therefore, decentralization is the only way to ensure that scientific data become public property. In addition, in terms of costs, creating an infrastructure ensuring the same level of data integrity protection of a smart contract deployed on the Etherum blockchain, which is basically impossible to compromise, and most importantly, maintaining such a platform up and running, would simply not be feasible.",True

INNBC Tokens will be automatically distributed to investors immediately after purchase. However, they will be transferable out of your wallet only upon crowdsale completion. The InnovativeBioresearchCoin (INNBC) is an ERC20 Token released on the Etherum blockchain (official ERC20 Token address: 0x85558055812f19eB084B8bA327470e84Ad795b11). There will be one initial limited supply and only Tokens sold are actually minted upon purchase. Therefore, total supply will be sold Tokens (with a hard cap of 20,000,000INNBC for the pre sale and 30,000,000INNBC for the sale) plus Tokens reserved by Innovative Bioresearch. Tokens reserved by Innovative Bioresearch will be used for Token economy and are not available for sale. Pre sale starts 1 May 2018 and ends 15 June 2018, while main sale starts 16 June 2018 and ends 1 August 2018. INNBC Token emission price is 1EUR (1,23USD) per 1INNBC, corresponding to 0,0024ETH (415INNBC per 1ETH), with respect to the ETH/EUR exchange rate on 16 April 2018, when the pricing was set.   During INNBC Token sale, we will offer the following discounts  ‚óè20% discount for pre-sale (1 May 2018- 15 June 2018): 1INNBC= 0,002ETH (498INNBC per 1ETH). ‚óè10% discount for the successive sale (16 June 2018 - 1 Aug 2018): 1INNBC= 0,0022ETH (456INNBC per 1ETH).",True

The target of our medical treatment is the HIV seropositive population. However, the target of our ""You're not alone"" app will not be just the HIV seropositive population, but anyone who is interested in the research itself and want to be part of the community and contribute to make it grow. There will be incentivations to do so. First, members who make particuparly useful posts to help other memebers will be rewarded with INNBC Tokens. Second, and most importantly, INNBC Tokens will be be spendable to access moderation roles in the forum community, and moderators will earn the 1% of the revenue generated by in app ads. So the target market is anyone who is interested in being a member of the community and earn INNBC Tokens, or being a forum moderator and earn from in app ads.  Also, INNBC Tokens will be spendable to buy classic iconic JDM cars. So anyone who is interested about cars can join the community, can earn INNBC Tokens, and then spend them on the INNBC JDM ONLINE GARAGE.  https://i.imgur.com/NGuLguR.jpg  As you can see, the target audience of our project is very broad and not limited to HIV seropositive people.",True

When you buy INNBC Tokens from the crowdsale page, they get immediately transferred to your ETH wallet, and in the transactions we did the gas used was 104459. The Tokens are not transferable out of your wallet until crowdsale completion and smart contract finalization, however. To fransfer INNBC Tokens to another ETH wallet, I expect the transaction cost to be about the same, so something around 100k.  2) what else except JDM cars can I buy for the tokens?  At the first stage (right after the end of the Token Sale) we will launch our INNBC JDM ONLINE GARAGE, were INNBC tokens can be spent to buy cars from a selection of high quality JDM classic cars.   At the second stage (3-6 months after ICO) we will launch the first version of our ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not alone‚Äù app, were INNBC Tokens can be spent to access a number of privileged features in the app ecosystem such as becoming moderator in the the social communities. The 1% of the revenue generated by in-app ads will go to community moderators as a compensation for their work.  3)when will exchange prices be available?  The thing about having the Token backed by the value of actual physical goods is that we don't expect the Token to drop much below its emission price, which is 0.0024ETH, without considering the discount at pre ICO (20%) and ICO (10%). The reason is simple. Let's say that the INNBC Token drops 50% in price. This would mean people could buy our cars for half of their real value; therefore, investors would immediately start buying Tokens to get cars for cheap, making the price of INNBC Tokens raise again.",True

That is, all Nissan Skyline GTR series, so R32, 33, and 34. The R34 GTR in particular almost doubled in price during recent years. In 2014 it was possible to find mint examples for around 39K Pounds, while now you have to spend at least 60-70k pounds for an example in the same conditions. That is why these cars are such a solid investment. It's becoming increasingly difficult to source them, so they are going up in value considerably each year. And as our stock of JDM cars will appreciate, I expect INNBC Tokens to appreciate as well, as they are directly backed by the value of these cars.

Let's focus today on the social aspect of the application.  First, we will start explaining the name, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not alone‚Äù, of our app. The application will be our official media channel for documenting the progress of our AIDS cure research project, featuring periodic updates such as articles, vlogs. This will create a community where HIV seropositive people can stay up to the date, comment, share, interact with us working on the cure, and with each others. Something that creates a bridge between HIV seropositive people and us research scientists working on the cure. Something that allows the HIV seropositive community and anyone interested to be part of this journey. Something that can send the message that they are not alone in their battle. That we are fighting for them. That we care about them. A message of hope. Our vision and intention is therefore to create an application that will also act as a social app for HIV seropositive people to participate and create new topics and discussions to support each others and stand together in the fight against AIDS.  In addition, the application will be our official platform for all our future services. A first service that we will provide for the HIV seropositive community is to have professional physicians on the forum staff to provide free expert medical advice for the users.  The application will provide the official channel through which patients will be able to access our HIV therapy by providing information about all the ongoing clinical trials, how to participate, and once our HIV treatment is approved, it will provide information about the clinics and hospitals offering the treatment, and how to book appointments with legit clinicians that are officially collaborating with us, to offer the best services and rates.  http://spiderman22.altervista.org/low1.jpg http://spiderman22.altervista.org/low2.jpg",True

INNBC Token sale starts 1 May 2018. 20% discount at pre sale. https://www.innovativebioresearch.com/pre-ico  Along with developing novel AIDS cure research and a Token (INNBC) backed by physical goods, with our ICO we are also developing the ""You're not alone"" app, which will act as a platform for all our products and services, as well as providing a decentralized database for clinical data. Let's focus today on the revolutionary blockchain implementation of our app.  The Limitations of Current Centralized Databases for Clinical Data  Traditionally, all data generated by scientific research is collected in the form of a scientific article, which is published in a peer reviewed scientific journal, and it is usually made available on a public database such as the NIH‚Äôs pubmed database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed). When a novel therapeutic strategy, such as our novel cell-based therapy for HIV, SupT1 cell infusion therapy, goes through the several stages of clinical research, different research teams all over the world may perform the research. And once the therapy is finally approved for human treatment, different clinicians all over the world may administer the treatment to patients. This means that when a research team wants to perform clinical research, they have to go through the tedious and time consuming process of searching for all the published data from previous trials, read all the papers, select the useful data, and make the best possible interpretation of the data to create a protocol for their trial, personalizing it for their typology of patients. In fact, every patient may have different individual characteristics (e.g., age, ethnicity, HIV tropism) and thus may require personalized treatment protocols. And the same issue is present when clinicians begin to administer an approved treatment to patients; they have to go through all the papers and make a best guess on what treatment protocol should be used. As mentioned, this process of accessing clinical data can be quite tedious and time consuming, but it can also introduce human error.  A Possible Solution: A Decentralized Database Using the Blockchain to Store and Access Clinical Data  A possible solution to the challenge posed by having to access clinical data from the current ancient system could be provided by the creation of a decentralized database for clinical data using the blockchain technology. The ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not alone‚Äù app will feature a user-friendly interface allowing any clinician running a clinical investigation to enter the data produced by their trials. The application will allow the input of a broad range of individual parameters for each treated patient, such as age, ethnicity, disease progression stage, viral tropism of HIV virus carried, along with the clinical protocol used (e.g., dosage of SupT1 cells infused each week) and the outcome of the treatment (e.g., viral load, CD4+ T cell count). The app will then access and elaborate the data on the fly; statistical analysis (means, standard deviations, correlations, power) and even the elaboration of suggested treatment profiles that could work best for each type of patient could be performed. This would take away the burden of having to manually search and process all the data as in the current centralized databases. And such an application would have an infinite potential for growing. For instance, an amazing feature could be to store in the database the genotypic information of the HIV virus carried by each patient, allowing to keep track of all mutations and genetic modifications caused by the treatment as well as the resulting viral phenotypic changes. Therefore, such a database would be constantly growing and evolving as new parameters are added to it, and it would be always available, anytime, anywhere, and to anyone connected. Such an app would help speed up tremendously the clinical development stages of our AIDS cure research; it could be a game changer.  In summary, these are some of the specific advantages of using the blockchain technology for creating a decentralized database for clinical data  ‚Ä¢Immutability. Scientific data need to be immutable. Once a study is peer reviewed and published, its data must be permanently stored and never altered. In the blockchain, all data is stored in every single node, never ceasing to exist, and always staying on the blockchain. It is immutability that gives the blockchain its openness and BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance).  ‚Ä¢Decentralization. The blockchain is designed to be distributed and synchronized across networks, making data freely available to anyone. We believe that scientific data should be shared and not being hidden behind a firewall. Decentralization is essential to hand over administrative authority from central institutions managing the data, such as governments and private entities, to the collectivity. In fact, if a database is controlled by one single entity, being it a private entity or government, it means that such entity has total control over the database, and such control can be influenced by personal conflicts of interests. Therefore, decentralization is the only way to ensure that scientific data become public property.  ‚Ä¢Security. The kind of transactions that can be performed are strictly defined in advance and stored in the blockchain as ‚Äúsmart contracts‚Äù; this prevents fraudulent data from being added to the blockchain thus ensuring integrity of the database. By contrast, it would be much easier to compromise a centralized database. In addition, in terms of costs, creating an infrastructure ensuring the same level of data integrity protection of a smart contract deployed on the Etherum blockchain, which is basically impossible to compromise, and most importantly, maintaining such a platform up and running, would simply not be feasible.  http://spiderman22.altervista.org/fig2l.JPG http://spiderman22.altervista.org/blockchain.JPG",True

Token Sale Campaign FAQ   Token Sale Campaign FAQ    All ICOs are scam. What can you say about it?    ICOs are a very valuable tool for our society, but you have to carefully check that the project is legit before investing. We can tell you this about our project. We are a biotech company performing novel biomedical research, and scientific research is something serious. One of the things that sets our ICO apart from the other ICO offerings is that it is based on our AIDS cure research. Behind our project there are therefore many years of hard work and investments to perform and publish our research. Investors with us know that they are investing into something real and concrete, and not in one of those bubble soap projects that disappear the day after the ICO because they are not solving any real issue and are just a collection of fancy presentations. With us, investors can easily verify that our project is something real and legit by checking the publications on the NIH database pubmed.    Fior J.

Vaccines. 2016;4(2):13. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/27128948     Moreover, we are working on solving a real global issue such as developing a low cost cure solution for AIDS. There were 36.7million people infected by HIV globally in 2016, 17.5million of which were left untreated, according to UNAIDS. Our mission is to develop a low cost cell-based therapy solution for HIV to allow access to the treatment for those individuals who are normally left untreated due to social and/or economic limitations.     JDM cars?     The term JDM stands for ""Japanese domestic market"" and refers to Japan's home market for vehicles. Why JDM cars for a biomedical research related project, other than because they are simply awesome? It isn‚Äôt just about the access we have at providing this service for customers thanks to our founder, it‚Äôs also about the community. The car enthusiast community is one of the most welcoming and sensitive community when it comes to supporting social issues such as fighting AIDS. Therefore, we believe that having classic iconic JDM cars backing the value of INNBC Tokens is true to the spirit of this project, which is to solve a serious global health problem. In addition, the automotive industry is something very responsive and therefore we believe in possible future productive partnerships for further expanding our Token economy, making it constantly growing and successful. We also believe that providing such a straightforward utility (i.e., you can directly use our Token to buy physical goods as you would with a fiat currency) can seriously help reaching those customers who are not normally into the crypto world.     Do you have a bounty program?    Yes, we have partnered with the amazing people at Tokensuite, which manage our bounty campaign and other marketing related aspects. Therefore, our official ANN thread on the bitcointalk forum was made by legendary bitcointalk member olcaytu2005, and you can check here for the bounty thread.    Do you have a referral program?    Yes, we launched our INNBC exclusive referral program, with generous payments in ETH.  All details in this bitcointalk thread.    How can I buy your Tokens?    Participating in our Token sale is very easy. Step 1. You need to register with us. To register, just send an email to administrator@innovativebioresearch.com with the following information: your name, email address, the ETH address where you want to receive your INNBC Tokens, and the ETH/BTC address from which you will be sending funds. We only accept funds in ETH and BTC. Please provide this data before sending funds, otherwise if you pay in BTC we will have no idea what is the associated ETH wallet. Please also wait for an email confirmation after you register before sending funds. Step 2. Send funds to purchase your INNBC Tokens. We only accept payments in ETH/BTC. This is our ETH address: 0xB8EB02A17a3eB5cE4F8249553d8C17B406036AaD and this is our BTC address: 1HLMcK1MomKtkumcmzELx5eLR3qt1k4jAo. You will receive your INNBC Tokens shortly after purchasing. Step 3. To add your Tokens to Myetherwallet, select ""add custom Token"" and insert the following paramethers: Token Contract Address: 0x85558055812f19eB084B8bA327470e84Ad795b11, Token Symbol: INNBC, Decimals: 8. Token price is set as 0.0022ETH/0.000169BTC per INNBC Token, during the ICO. A minimum purchase of 10 INNBC Tokens, corresponding roughly to 12USD is required to participate in the Token sale.    Who distributes Tokens, and how quickly will I receive them after the end of the initial offer (Token Launch)?    We distribute INNBC Tokens to investors shortly after purchase.    I'm afraid of a hackers attack, how secure is your system?     Our website uses a very secure SSL connection. However, please check that you are sending funds to the correct addresses. These are the only official addresses to send funds for purchasing INNBC Tokens during our Token sale: ETH address: 0xB8EB02A17a3eB5cE4F8249553d8C17B406036AaD, BTC address: 1HLMcK1MomKtkumcmzELx5eLR3qt1k4jAo.    What is the minimum entry limit? And the maximum limit?     Minimum entry limit is 10 INNBC Tokens, corresponding roughly to 12USD. There is no maximum entry, provided that once the hard cap is reached, no more INNBC Tokens are available for purchase.   What exactly will I own after Token purchase? A company‚Äôs share?    You will own our INNBC Token, which is a utility Token and not an equity Token, so it does not represent a company‚Äôs share. Nonetheless, it will be tradable on exchanges. It will also be spendable for byuing physical goods such as classic iconic JDM cars from our JDM ONLINE GARAGE we will launch upon ICO completion.     Do the Tokens comply with ERC20 standard? Can I transfer them to a third-party ETH wallet?     Yes.     When will the Tokens begin to trade on the exchanges? On which ones?    The INNBC Token is an ERC20 Token so it should be tradable on exchanges such as Etherdelta sortly after issuance. In addition to Etherdelta/Forkdelta, we have plans to have it listed on other exchanges. Thanks to our partnership with the FIxy Netowork, the INNBC Token will be listed on their exchange, once it will be launched.    What value your tokens will bring for me as an investor?    First, in contrast with other Tokens, you will be able to directly use the INNBC Token to buy physical goods such as classic iconic JDM cars from our JDM ONLINE GARAGE that will be launched shortly after Token sale completion. Now, the JDM cars from our online garage are from a selection of very high quality examples in mint conditions, and these cars are only going up in value, as they are true collector items. So they are also an investment. These are not common cars you can buy from a dealer; it is very hard to find them as you have to go hunting for good examples and source them from Japan. Second, 3-6 months after the Token sale we anticipate to release our ""You're not alone"" app where INNBC Tokens can be spent to access moderation roles and earn from in app ads.    I‚Äôm a speculative trader, what is an expected growth rate? What are the chances that your Token will grow in price in 12 months?    It is always hard to make such preditions. However, we expect to be able to produce new results from our research within 6-12months after the ICO. This should significantly drive user adoption of our application, which in turn should drive the price of our Tokens. We assume a 50-100% growing rate. In addition, this would be the only Token on the market backed by the value of actual physical goods, with the exception of the Venezuela Petro (PTR) coin, which should help it to hold its value. However, if you can use our INNBC Token to buy actual physical goods such as classic iconic JDM cars, maybe you should keep it and use it for its intended purpose.  Remember, when you buy JDM cars you aren't just buying cars, you are actually buying happines.    Have you set the minimum level of raised funds? What if you will not raise them?    We set a funding goal of 20million INNBC. If we do not reach our goal, we will still try our best to develop the project with the funds we collected.    Do you have a funding cap?    We have a hard cap of 50million INNBC. A 20million cap for the pre-sale, and a 30million cap for the sale.    What will happen if you raise more money than you need?    We will use the addditional funds to perform further clinical research (phase 4 trials) and we will also create a fund to provide our HIV treatment free of charge for patients who can't affoard it.     Will you organize pre-sell of the Tokens? Any bonuses or discounts?   Yes. We will organize a pre-ICO first. We will offer a 20% discount in the pre-sale (498INNBC per 1ETH), and a 10% discount in the succesive sale (456INNBC per 1ETH). Regular emission price was set as 1EUR (1,23USD) per 1INNBC, corresponding to 415INNBC per 1ETH, with respect to the ETH/EUR exchange rate on the day of smart contract creation (16 April 2018).    I've never heard about your company. Who are you? Are there any references to you in media?   We are a privately held biotech company based in Italy. Owned and founded by research scientist Jonathan Fior with the goal of bringing innovation to the field, with a focus on HIV, cancer and regeneration research. Given the importance and novelty of our AIDS cure research, the news of the publication of our latest study exploring SupT1 cell infusion therapy for HIV in humanized mice has been reported by more than 230 international news outlets such as Yahoo! Finance, Reuters, Bloomberg, MarketWatch, Boston Globe, Seeking Alpha, Wichita Business Journal, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, News9.com, Wall Street Online Germany, and Medical News Today among many others, resulting in the study ranking among the top 5% of all research outputs tracked by Altmetric.    The press release announcing our ICO was also widely mentioned by the media. Being mentioned on PRnewswire and Yahoo Finance is a badge of trust for a company, which is crucial during a token sale to distinguish legit projects from scamcoins.    In what jurisdiction is your business located?     United Kingdom.    Do you have analogues or competitors?    Actually, we have no competitors working with a similar blockchain project related to AIDS cure research, and offering a Token backed by the value of actual physical goods is also something very distinctive.    What will happen if your project will close?    Hopefully, it won't. We are very committed at making this project a success as we devoted our lives to the mission of developing a cure for AIDS. In addition, we hope that being able to use our INNBC Token to buy actual physical goods such as wonderful JDM cars will also help making it successful.    Why exactly do you need blockchain technology for the purpose of storing clinical data?  Couldn't you just build a well secured database that is fast to search in using a traditional centralized platform?    There are several good reasons actually.     ‚Ä¢Immutability. Scientific data need to be immutable. Once a study is peer reviewed and published, its data must be permanently stored and never altered. In the blockchain, all data is stored in every single node, never ceasing to exist, and always staying on the blockchain. It is immutability that gives the blockchain its openness and BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance).    ‚Ä¢Decentralization. The blockchain is designed to be distributed and synchronized across networks, making data freely available to anyone. We believe that scientific data should be shared and not being hidden behind a firewall.    ‚Ä¢Security. The kind of transactions that can be performed are strictly defined in advance and stored in the blockchain as ‚Äúsmart contracts‚Äù; this prevents fraudulent data from being added to the blockchain thus ensuring integrity of the database. By contrast, it would be much easier to compromise a centralized database.    In conclusion, although it is true that such an application could be implemented with a centralized system, decentralization is the only way to ensure the data is not manipulated, and all information is pubblicly available in a platform that can't be influenced by the will of any particular entity or government. Decentralization is essential to hand over administrative authority from central institutions managing the data, such as governments and private entities, to the collectivity. In fact, if the database is controlled by one single entity, being it a private entity or government, it means that such entity has total control over the database, and such control can be influenced by personal conflicts of interests. Therefore, decentralization is the only way to ensure that scientific data become public property. In addition, in terms of costs, creating an infrastructure ensuring the same level of data integrity protection of a smart contract deployed on the Etherum blockchain, which is basically impossible to compromise, and most importantly, maintaining such a platform up and running, would simply not be feasible.

There is an expected return for investors. However, please consider that this is not equity so we can't provide something like dividens. What we can provide though is a return that is related to the Token utility.    Long answer.  First, you should really pay attention to the fact that in contrast with basically any other Token on the market, with the exception of Venezuela's Petro Token, the INNBC Token will be backed the value of actual, real physical goods. At the first stage (right after the end of the Token Sale), we will launch our INNBC JDM ONLINE GARAGE, were INNBC tokens can be spent to buy cars from a selection of high quality JDM classic cars. Selection of cars will mostly concentrate on classic iconic JDM cars such as Skylines, Supras, Subaru, and EVOs. Now, the JDM cars from our online garage are from a selection of very high quality examples in mint conditions, and these cars are only going up in value, as they are true collector items. So they are also an investment. These are not common cars you can buy from a dealer; it is very hard to find them as you have to go hunting for good examples and source them from Japan. Wonderfully, when it comes to JDM cars, our founder, Jonathan Fior, has a great expertise as he is personally involved in the business of importing them and over the years he has therefore established a solid network of professional contacts, which makes us confident about providing a quality service, with great deals, and worldwide shipping with cars delivered right at our doorstep .  Now, let me ask you something. What is the intrinsic value of a Token? Can you convert Tokens into physical goods? Tokens are not usually backed by the value of actual, real, physical goods, which means there is nothing stopping them from falling in value other than trust in the platform. However, we wanted to provide something more for our Token holders. We wanted our Token to be backed by the value of a physical good.  Having said that, let's talk about how our research can contribute to the value of INNBC Tokens. At the second stage (3-6 months after Token sale) we will launch the first version of our ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not alone‚Äù app, were INNBC tokens can be spent to access a number of privileged features in the app ecosystem such as becoming moderator in the social communities. The 1% of the revenue generated by in-app ads will go to community moderators as a compensation for their work. In addition, Token economy will be integral part of the rep reward point system of the social community. Users who will make particularly useful contributions will earn Tokens. Now, what is the main factor that will drive the user adoption of our app? Our AIDS cure research. HIV seropositive people (and anyone who is just interested about AIDS research) will join the community to be updated about the state of our research, to open topics discussing the research, and for receiving information and support by our staff that will manage the platform. In conclusion, our AIDS research will be integral to the utilty and therefore value of INNBC Tokens.",True

A first implication is that we are not going to do things such as Airdrops for example. The reason is simple. Let's say you own 50K INNBC. It means you could actually buy a car such as this 600hp monster spec Skyline R33 GTR from our JDM ONLINE GARAGE.  http://spiderman22.altervista.org/r33gtr.JPG   If we were giving away 200k INNBC Tokens with an Airdrop, it would mean people could actually get cars for free and we would be out of business shortly. So this provides an insurance to INNBC Token holders that we are not just going to dump INNBC Tokens on the market.   Now, let's talk about another possible interesting implication. How this could regulate INNBC price on exchanges. Let's say that INNBC drops 50% in price. This would mean that people could actually buy cars for half of their real value from our garage; therefore, investors would immediately start buying Tokens to get cars for cheap, making the price of INNBC Tokens raise again. So this also provides an insurance to Token holders that INNBC Tokens should hold their value.  These are some of the reasons we wanted our Token to be backed by the value of actual physical goods, unlike any other Token on the market with the exception of the Venezuela's Petro.",True

This is a new way of funding AIDS research. In fact, it can be said that with this project we are also decentralizing the way AIDS research is funded. This project is supported by the collectivity with the aim of solving a global issue for the collectivity. Accordingly, it is possible to support the development of a low cost AIDS cure solution, that would otherwise never see the light of day as it would hurt badly the business of all pharmaceutical corporations selling expensive HIV drugs, which aim to make as much profit as possible off of AIDS.  http://spiderman22.altervista.org/costcomp.JPG   *1)Source; Gebo KA, Fleishman JA, et al.

SupT1 Cell Infusion as a Possible Cell-Based Therapy for HIV: Results from a Pilot Study in Hu-PBMC BRGS Mice. Vaccines. 2016, 4:13.   As you can see our competitors in the industry aim to develop incredibly expensive HIV gene based treatments that will only be affordable by the richest part of the global population. By contrast, we belive that a real cure is something that should be affordable even in low income countries. Because although we are a for profit company, we also have a coscience. And thanks to your support and our work, developing a low cost AIDS cure solution could finally be something possible.",True
