Built from the bottom up to integrate fun and fairness, the CasinoFair brand will represent a new generation of casinos on the road to revolutionising the traditional igaming space. Using FunFair’s unique Fate Channels and dispute resolution technology, each and every game will be 100% provably fair, allowing users to verify every roll of the dice, turn of a card and spin of the wheel.  CasinoFair users will be able to play straight from their crypto wallet, removing the need to deposit any funds into the custody of the house and ensuring their funds are always safe and held in escrow throughout their gaming sessions. Not only that, but FunFair’s unique smart contract technology means any winnings are paid out instantly as soon as the session ends. Meaning no more waiting around to receive payouts.  CasinoFair will be the first of a new breed of casino to offer industry leading casino games that blaze the way in speed and entertainment whilst also guaranteeing fair casino gaming, funded by instant transactions and winnings in FUN tokens.    At launch  CasinoFair will initially permit players from five territories: Canada, Switzerland, Norway, Finland and Thailand, with more to follow in the future as CasinoFair evolves and ensures the world of truly fair casino gaming continues to expand.  The first iteration of CasinoFair will see ten original FunFair-produced game titles at launch, including blockchain-firsts in Tales from the Crypto and Fate of Thrones, as well as FunDice and casino classics like European Roulette and Blackjack. Don’t get too excited though, as if you visit the site before launch, you won’t be able to see anything just yet!  We can also confirm the bankroll for the casino has already been acquired on the open market.    What now?   Users in the five approved jurisdictions can sign up for their own FunPass in advance, and doing so will see them receive an exclusive bonus once CasinoFair goes live later this month. This one-time registration will give users a lifetime of seamless casino gaming across any FunFair-powered casino, without the need to ‘sign in’ every time they visit.  To create a FunPass you will need to be using one of three compatible browsers: Chrome, Brave or Opera, and also be signed in to your MetaMask account through your chosen browser’s extension. Find out more information on how to create a MetaMask account here.  As we near launch, we will continue to share further information on the release, and those wishing to become part of the CasinoFair family, wherever you may be, can check out its Twitter, Telegram and Facebook page to get all the news first.",False

The game itself remains simple. The player chooses from a range of target numbers between 0 and 1,000,000 and then bets whether the random roll of six dice will land higher or lower than the target. Players can adopt various strategies, staking on higher or lower numbers depending on if they’re feeling lucky, with the odds reflecting each likelihood. Users can also choose the autoplay option to set the number of dice rolls and sit back and watch the results come in.  This latest game release follows hot on the heels of the launch of our two slot titles, Tales from the Crypto and Fate of Thrones. Our ever-expanding portfolio of fast, fun and fair games is only made possible through our proprietary market-leading technology, Fate Channels, which lowers prohibitive transaction costs by taking game sessions off the blockchain.  Jez San, Founder and CEO at FunFair Technologies, said: “The popularity of dice games in the crypto space continues to be high but we felt the quality of those on offer could be improved upon significantly so we’ve done just that.  “Our new game gives dice game fans the opportunity to enjoy traditional gameplay but with much-improved 3D graphics and a seamless user experience. As with all FunFair games, players enjoy instant results and lightning fast gameplay all thanks to our unique Fate Channels solution.”",False

Along with showcasing our platform, we will be providing a first look at the next generation of blockchain games that we have in development, games which will feature richer, more immersive 3D graphics, and significantly improved sound tracks and effects. These will be demoed alongside our suite of blockchain-powered casino games ranging from slots and blackjack to baccarat.  Our presence at ICE gives us the very real opportunity to engage directly with some of the world’s largest operators and game developers to share our vision.

Kicking off 2018  With the New Year behind us we arrived back at our Camden Office on the 2nd January and you could sense the excitement and energy in the air.  Three very busy weeks into 2018 and the buzz continues with new starters coming on-board in what feels like a daily event.  We’ve scoured the earth and found some amazing talent to join the FunFair Team, bringing lots of fresh ideas, enthusiasm, knowledge and plenty of laughter to our Camden Hub.  3 weeks and 9 new starters filling the ranks in Game Design, Product Development x 2, HR, Office Management, Project Management, Strategy & Finance. Yep, we’ve been busy – and there is plenty more to come!  FunFair’s talented team is now 38 people, and rising fast!  Zuz, our new HR manager, can’t wait to share our profiles so watch this space..  2.  Product  Enhancement of existing games to support the Fate Channel scaling technology continues.  We’re still learning a lot about writing game logic in smart contracts and we continue to refine the Fate Channels tech and add features as we go. We’ve also been doing a lot of work on packaging which will enable individual games and other platform components to be updated independently. Work is also underway on the casino configuration and admin tool, where we’re making good progress.  Our build processes continues to mature, particularly for contract code. We’ve got automated builds running for these, with a comprehensive suite of unit tests covering all our game contracts.  If you didn’t already catch CTO Jeremy Longley’s Part 1 explanation of the Turing Complete state channel tech that we’ve built, read it here: https://funfair.io/approach-turing-complete-state-channels-part-1/ – Jeremy promises that Part 2 should be along soon.  Look out for a showcase update in time for ICE.  3. Regulation  We’re in the final throws of preparing our application for a UK Gambling Commission remote software development licence and this will be submitted in the next few days. We’re often asked about the time scales for determination of the application which sadly we can’t definitely answer however the Gambling Commission gives a blanket commitment to 16 weeks for all applications. (This does not have a bearing on launch.)  With regards to other jurisdictions: we’re meeting the Malta Gaming Authority (the MGA) at ICE to discuss the details of our participation in their DLT/Cryptocurrency regulatory sandbox project and we’re continuing to pursue DLT licensure in Gibraltar.  Having attended the Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange event here in London last week, and seen the territory’s plans to embrace blockchain technologies in their legislative framework, we remain convinced that our strategy to lodge licence applications with tier 1 regulators, including Gibraltar, will put us on a robust legal footing to offer our services to operators from around the globe.  4. Marketing  We are also in the latter stages of preparing our presence at ICE, the world’s largest gambling industry convention that is being held in London between the 6th and 8th of February.  We will be exhibiting alongside some of the world’s largest gaming suppliers covering all aspects of both the digital and land-based industry.  We’re not aware of any other blockchain gaming companies having made the significant investment to have a presence on the show floor at ICE.  We believe that ICE presents a unique opportunity for us to engage directly with the gaming industry while focussing on the education of the benefits of blockchain gaming technology.  Most importantly our presence will enable us to introduce the FunFair brand to the industry, position ourselves as thought leaders in the blockchain space as well of course as showcasing the FunFair demo and generating lots of leads.  Jez will also be talking on a panel alongside other blockchain gaming execs at the IceVox blockchain seminar taking place in the same venue and at the same time as ICE. We will share more info as we get closer to the date and also from the event itself.  If you are planning on being there we are on stand N7-212 – come say hi!  https://funfair.io/january-update/",False

I'd be ecstatic if it was .20. It's at a low point for sure and people looking for quick 5-10% hits drop like flies when things slide. They invest like gamblers ironically so I suspect many will be back when the casino opens. At that point the coins are tokens for the first (100% honest) games and I see quite a strong upside. I don't see 1.00, it has to remain competitive with other online casinos. I do see ~.25 as the actual price next year.

Provable fairness beyond initial Random Number Generation play by play. Transparent, auditable and complaint (regulators will be happy) Low low overheads (massive reduction for operators compared to traditional online gaming) Inflationary economic model, casinos must acquire all funds required to wager prior to bets taking place to give a fair chance player can win amount claimed. Tokens are burned as network fee for the first two years reducing supply. Scarcity + need for liquidity increases value. Future privacy with ZK Snarks when Metropolis offers Eliptic Curve Crypto.  Performance (Speed): No other gaming company (ICO or otherwise) has solved off-chain scaling. Without this games are very slow as you have to wait for confirmations throughout the public blockchain turn by turn for true decentralised gaming with provable fairness.  Take a look at VDice and Etheroll, play them they are unbearably slow, worse due to the ice age hitting block propagation is now more than 20 seconds and some need more than one confirmation.  By using oraclise or another third party for RNG they have further time to waist (often 3-5 blocks, at best 1-2 minutes).  Blocks will only get slower as the network gets more congested and Ethereum has a problem scaling. Without Fate Channels other competing companies cannot offer casino games at speed.  Since we launched some like Dao.Casino say they have a solution that is similar, but this is currently hypothesized with no evidence of reality.  Funfair is the ONLY casino gaming platform with a WORKING SOLUTION TODAY for fast and provably fair off chain scaling for instantaneous play.  Without this players get bored and leave. We want them to have fun and play safely.  Performance (Gas Cost): Ethereum price rising means more expense in gas costs, all other casinos (none have off chain scaling or are centralised playing hands without the use of blockchain transparency and thus aren't provably fair) have to factor in gas costs making microtransactions unfeasible, read:  https://proofofsteak.com/can-ethereum-casino-games-disrupt-the-online-gaming-industry-ff36fa2bfa47  and watch the videos you will see how slow and costly they are:  ""Etheroll & vDice decided to opt for a very high minimum bet size to ensure their gas cost doesn’t overwhelm the bet size. The min in Etheroll is 0.1 Eth (today its $24) and vDice was 0.22 Eth. And even then, the gas cost is over a $1 for most of those games.""  Funfair has no gas costs to concern themselves with aside the opening and closing of a fate channel at the beginning and the end of a session.  Fairness Never has full transparency of turn by turn play operated at the speed players want to play. Full auditible proof of Random Number Generation creation is tied to each transaction and is view able on the public blockchain at the end of play with all timestamps verifiable.  Fun We are a group of games developers spanning 4 decades and have created a lot of cult games from your youth including Nintendos Satr Fox and the 3D FX chip, the hardware required to run it. We don't only create fun by the tech that makes it possible. Fate channels was a challenge not a problem. Real probably fair peer to peer gaming is coming and we will provide the best games to play alongside the tech.

Important to stress that FunFair is not a casino operator, and never will be.  FunFair's business model is thus completely legal and it licenses to operators who will take liability for operating legally themselves. that's why we can say who we are. doing it this way, we don't have to operate in the shadows.  We have taken the best legal advice, we are not paying dividends. We are strictly a casino network. This means that we can work with affiliate gaming sites that have gaming licenses in place and can offer full transparency of fair play to players and regulators.  We are transparent and safe. Neither we or our affiliates are custodians of players FUN tokens.  Reality Funfair tech exists and is playable, not undelivered promises. Try the competition's games or proof of concepts, then try ours, don't believe anything from anyone that doesn't have evidence of delivery and working proof of concepts that are on blockchain and playable.

They are hitting users on Slack, Telegram, Reddit and many associated social sites.  DO NOT trust alerts from those sites, specifically direct messaging.  Funfair will only communicate through moderator authored Reddit (like this post - bitcoin-o-rama[M]), Bitcointalk and Discord posts or on the official blog, pinned telegram messaging through official group.  We will not contact you directly in a direct message and tell you to change anything to do with your webwallet access.  You should not be using a web wallet for your FUN tokens if you have a considerable amount.  Best practice for ERC20 tokens are Ledger and Trezor.  Ledger is a hardware wallet company Jez invested in some time back and has proven time and time again to take security seriously. All the Funfair team use ledger.  Trezor is the open source hardware wallet developed by Slush who also created the original mining pool; slush's pool. Trezor is my personal favourite, but I've been involved in the space a long time and the hardware wallet is Slush's innovation. He's done a lot for the scene and they've always taken my suggestions on board so I have a lot of respect for the Czech based team. There will be a trezor 2 soon which should allow the use of tokens in even more innovative ways.  Please do not use web wallets for storage.

The Telegram is @FunFairTech - https://www.t.me/FunFairTech - It will be listed amongst the official @Crypto groups. I would only trust groups on that page. They are peer reviewed and heavily moderated to keep out scammers and questionable groups similar to those promoting via some recent reddit and bitcointalk and slack posts.

It uses fate channels and acts a bit like Raiden but more specialized and actually better in some ways (amazing that this technology is quietly tucked in FUN when Raiden isn't even close to being completed).  The speed is crucial for a good game experience.  Created by a legend in video games and online casinos, so the games themselves look wonderful and offer the same user experience as traditional online casinos.   Transaction fee only occurs when you enter and exit, but not during the game, so you can play hundreds of hands of blackjack (hours) for example, and pay the same gas costs as one hand or spin with other company's games.  Your money stays with YOU. It does not go to the casino or anywhere else. You start with the money, you end with your money.  The platform allows for private label casinos, and also for people to develop their own games on top of FUN... so it is not limited to what the developers of FUN create.  I could go on and on and on.  Edit: I actually will go on a little bit more  Quote from the developer:  We have significant advantages over our peers.  1.  we're experienced at both games development and online gaming.  2.  we know the casino games industry having worked in it for a decade.  3.  we have superior tech to anyone else, and a lot more tech coming thats quite groundbreaking.  no one else, as yet, can deliver games at low cost except FF, a big deal and not to be underplayed!  4.  we know how to make games.  few others seem to know.   5.  we're building an entire suite of games for launch (no one else seems to have more than one or at most two games, and theyre low quality).  6.  We have a developer and licensed operator model which is infinitely more scalable than the other guys, who are trying to market themselves.    Quote from: Apollo777 on July 05, 2017, 08:21:02 PM FunFair current total valuation is currently priced shy of half a Billion Dollars Total Supply will be 17 Billion Tokens.  I understand FunFair will burn tokens in the future but is this valuation insane or what?   They may burn tokens or they may give those tokens to Phase I token holders to increase value. But yes, tokens will be burned from transactional fees.  Jez Sans the developer does not believe it will reach 17 billion tokens anyways.  At the moment 3 billion in circulation is what should be used for estimation, but that should be considered with the value increasing plans.   Quote from: Anhtatsu on July 06, 2017, 05:35:55 AM Total supply is very large, it is difficult to bring prices up  Will be easier than you think, albeit gradual and controlled (healthy). You may want to do more research into the Reverse Dutch auction, burning of the tokens and giving back tokens from Phase 2 to the Phase 1 token holders. I suggest you join the FUN slack channel, then search for keywords.   Quote from: dodgrad on July 06, 2017, 10:07:32 AM Why is the price is so hard falling? Someone will tell me what's going on, after all, it looks like a total scam. Sad look at what's going on ...    Quite normal actually for an ICO or when added to an exchange. In fact I would be concerned if it not behave in this exact way. Quite healthy.  Quote from: MtRev on July 06, 2017, 10:14:38 AM Any plans on making a Baccarat game for this?  Yes, they plan to release at least two games per month. Their goal was to aim for the most popular games in actual casinos, then work their way down. In western casinos, slots account for 70%, followed by Baccarat, and so forth.  In the East, Baccarat is #1... so the plan is to address them in a ""most demanded"" fashion.  Quote from: blackhawk101 on July 06, 2017, 12:38:53 PM PEOPLE MAKE FIRST ICO THEN PRODUCT (MAYBE)  CART IN FRONT HORSE...  HORSE PUSH WITH HEAD, GET HEADACHE, LEAVE CART     What is refreshing about FUN, is that it is one of the only projects that actually has the horse before the cart. Games have already been developed and is the first real use case for ETH smart contracts. I think it is great that the developer can show actual games and how it works right now (not theoretical or in the future, but now).  A quote from Jez that shows just one example of the horse before the cart:  We stayed in stealth mode while we were developing the advanced technology that has set us ahead of everyone else.  we didnt intend to be so quiet, but we also didnt want to reveal the cool technology we had, too much ahead of our pre-sale, because we wanted to ensure we had a huge head start over the competition.  no one else seems to have, as yet, this high performance, low gas tech.. though they all covet it.   Quote from: Tienquyendahn on July 06, 2017, 03:58:23 PM This Project is being Developed by one of the best teams I've ever seen.  Agreed. People should read a bit more about Jez San.  The story of how he reverse engineered a Nintendo Gameboy without Nintendo's help, then impressed them so much that he met Hiroshi Yamauchi (the President of Nintendo), then worked for him on 3D games... is pretty amazing I think.  If anyone wants to read that story, it is half way down this article: https://calvinayre.com/2014/07/30/business/jez-san-gaming-industry-profiles-bl-video/  Also here is a wikipedia on him: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jez_San",False

I imagine short term gains is an all-consuming concept in many minds.  I would like to note that I only discovered FUN one day ago, but I read everything on Reddit, ETHtrader interviews with Jez San, and went through as much of the Slack chat as possible (he posts actively there) where I copied most of his messages in order to have a strong understanding.  I found that the research didn't take long and it allowed me to reduce anxiety and increase confidence (a priceless endeavor)... and also to learn some hidden/quiet information that isn't publicly mentioned.  For example, players in games can be shown their local currencies and not crypto... but they will actually be playing with FUN, it will just show up as fiat.  A quote from Jez discussing what Phase 2 will contain:  Phase 2 (of the games, not of the token sale)... is just a UI change.   there's nothing to stop anyone who's not in crypto from playing this too.   any payment processor (hundreds of them) can offer players to bridge the credit card to crypto chasm.   they can take the player's credit card, buy FUN for them, and let them play the games.   We can show the player their local currency in the games, and not crypto.   they will actually be playing in FUN, but they will be seeing it in FIAT.   Their Payment processor not only buys and sells FUN for them with credit cards... and returns it to the card afterwards... but also looks after their wallet, and uses derivative smart contracts to protect the currency hedge.  A quote regarding token dilution during Phase 2:  Yes, any unsold tokens in phase 2, which is likely if the price has risen from now til that date, will be returned to phase 1 holders.  making it sortof an anti dilution effect",False

Big ups to you.    Given the nascent nature of crypto in general, we can all expect massive perturbations in the market. It's a given. In terms of numbers, there have been three ""crashes"" in the last six weeks or so that, in stock markets terms, would have engendered two recessions and one depression. Overall, the market is up since then.  Volatility is enormously relative. To someone who uses traditional stocks as a comparison, it's unfathomably unstable. To someone in Venezuela or Greece, cryptos may not seem unstable despite their rises and falls. Why? Because their currencies drop and don't come back. Cryptos vacillate wildly but experience overall growth. Unstable currencies don't realize growth; they fall and don't come back.  This is a hugely welcome change of pace I'd imagine.  As for Funfare, it's not perfect and it shouldn't be. Given the surprising amount of volume, traders will hinder growth in the short term as will early investors taking the short term profits. Personally, I like a company that focused on the product and less on the investment side. They have plenty of money raised and pocketed some as well. I don't mind that because we're dealing with professionals who didn't walk into the space broke. They're in no rush to see these numbers go up in a trader's market. Let the product find its legs and the money will follow. As for their building on ethereum, that's debatable. Ether is still considered by the professional investment community as the platform of choice and I'm sure their choice hinged on this. We all know that Windows is not exactly the best OS but it's done pretty well. I wouldn't want to trade funfare right now but it didn't stop me from buying some. My average cost was around 700 and it's under 600 at the moment. I could care less.",False

Not sure lisk would offer us much benefit. Ethereum is a rapidly innovating and well supported network.  The ecosystem is very rich and there's a lot of assets on the blockchain which gives us access to customers who have funds.  And since all tokens are erc-20 compatible, automated exchanging from one token to another is quite trivial and lots of exchanges will support this, as will protocols like 0x etc.    In short, we get a lot of benefit in being on the ethereum blockchain and although its technically feasible to run on other smart contract enabled blockchains, it still might not be worth doing if the rest of the ecosystem isn't there.  Another quote from him that further elaborates on the benefits of utilizing Eth:  ""Sciguy, other reasons.  Winter is coming!  Sorry, i meant, Metropolis.   it brings new features that we really like as well.   like EC math (lets us and other people do zk-Snarks, for good privacy, but more importantly for us, lets us do BLS random numbers (aka herd randomness, ok, I just made that phrase up).  Also, in Metropolis, the contract is able to pay the gas, which further lowers the barrier to entry of new customers playing with FUN for the first time.  ie, their account only needs FUN in it, and doesn't need any Ether as well.""  To add to it, in this interview, Jez explains how the only time a customer would wait on the ETH network is at the very beginning when entering the game, so it wouldn't be held hostage to a bloated main chain  https://youtu.be/POpedVl04D4  You or anyone reading this can join the Discord channel to learn more and directly ask questions (Slack is not being used anymore due to a lack of control over scammers).  https://discord.gg/rwETqSP",False

The FUN token powers every aspect of FunFair’s Ethereum-based casino platform. Players will bet using FUN, developers and affiliates will be rewarded for their participation in FUN, and operators and licencees will pay players out using FUN. FUN will also power the smart contracts that run the platform, including FunFair’s unique new Random Number Generator.

Buyers will be given the official Fun token contract address (ETH and ERCO20), Bitcoin and Zcash addresses, and more information on how to use these. For fiat currency, buyers can contact fiat@funfair.io before the token event.

Good chance to make a lot of money on this one. Read Arctile 3 of the White Paper for example; they are offering private label or custom casino.
