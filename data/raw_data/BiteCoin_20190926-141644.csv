It helps us to better position ourselves in terms of spotlights.  No, the purpose of blockchain in the ecosystem is not the reward system. While the rewards are an integral part of running the network, it is only an added incentive.  The main value addition to the customer is contracts enforced by smart contracts. If the delivery system fails on their promise (time of delivery, product item compliance etc), the order is immediately cancelled and the money refunded.  According to our market research, this is an operational bottleneck of delivery services, and therefore is the source of complaint for a whole bunch of users. Users normally had to wait a lot of time apart form the already mentioned timeframe in their websites.  This bottleneck can only be relieved by operational optimization, which we are experts at as well. The idea is to find optimal trajectory planning with state-of-the-art tools and predictive controls in finding and diverting the driver to reach in time - which brings us to the second important value addition to the blockchain ecosystem. Failing which, we will have to mitigate the losses (refunded amounts to customers), by optimizing our business models using advanced FTCs to ensure quality.  Introducing machine learning and state-of-the-art optimization algorithm with fault tolerance guarantees on the blockchain is a central premise of our project and is actually our USP - Our team has been doing this for a while and so we know what we are talking about.  I hope you understand the idea behind the work. If you are more interested, you can read our published papers (google+ links on our team profiles on the website) to understand the methodology of how we will be dealing with faults and optimization in general using invariant sets.  Else, you can also refer to our medium article to have brief insights about the value propositions. https://medium.com/@BiteCoinNetwork/bitecoin-network-987d6b0d5092  Thanks and best regards, Expecting your support further.",False

The main focus of the project is to redefine food delivery systems and to come up with a brand new which address all the problems of the current food delivery apps.  1)when customer does not receive the order in time - consumer does not have to call the customer care at to get the money refunded. The money is refunded instantly by smart contract. 2) Customer also get incentives of tokens on each purchase which he/she can collect and later trade/cashout as BiteCoin gets listed in our own exchange platform Bite-X and other exchanges 3) Value propositions for restaurants are also mentioned in the website - do check them out.  As we stated - we are also launching our own exchange platform (as mentioned in the roadmap) which will have many new features and trading instruments.  On top of all these our project also acts as a ""CATALYST"" to increase blockchain audience worldwide since our app serves everyone who and also people who are unaware of the blockchain technology. Through our app, they become part for the ever-growing crypto community. Which is also a big plus for the [Suspicious link removed]munity in general.  Do check out our one pager in the website for more details.

I would post the reply I had given earlier as as an answer to your question however.  You can also refer to our medium article to have brief insights about the value propositions which will give a fairly good idea on how it is different from other projects. https://medium.com/@BiteCoinNetwork/bitecoin-network-987d6b0d5092  While the rewards are an integral part of running the network, it is only an added incentive.  The main value addition to the customer is contracts enforced by smart contracts. If the delivery system fails on their promise (time of delivery, product item compliance etc), the order is immediately cancelled and the money refunded.  According to our market research, this is an operational bottleneck of delivery services, and therefore is the source of complaint for a whole bunch of users. Users normally had to wait a lot of time apart form the already mentioned timeframe in their websites.  This bottleneck can only be relieved by operational optimization, which we are experts at as well. The idea is to find optimal trajectory planning with state-of-the-art tools and predictive controls in finding and diverting the driver to reach in time - which brings us to the second important value addition to the blockchain ecosystem. Failing which, we will have to mitigate the losses (refunded amounts to customers), by optimizing our business models using advanced FTCs to ensure quality.  Introducing machine learning and state-of-the-art optimization algorithm with fault tolerance guarantees on the blockchain is a central premise of our project and is actually our USP - Our team has been doing this for a while and so we know what we are talking about.  I hope you understand the idea behind the work. If you are more interested, you can read our published papers (google+ links on our team profiles on the website) to understand the methodology of how we will be dealing with faults and optimization in general using invariant sets.  Thanks and best regards, Expecting your support further.",False
