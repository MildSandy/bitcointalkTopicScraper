First of all, we would like to thank every contributions.  However, we are sorry to announce that OkeyDokey ICO has not been going as expected and currently we are far away from reaching our soft cap goal. At the currently rate, we do not expect to reach the soft cap before the deadline.  Therefore, due to not being able to reaching our soft cap, we will be refunding all ETH contributions. We have all of the transaction records and will be refunding ETH to the wallets that we have received the ETH from accordingly.  Due to this matter, we will be putting a halt to OkeyDokey cryptocurrency project. Furthermore, due to not having the funds to support our development of OkeyDokey platform, there will be no use for OKEY Tokens. Hence, we would like to convey our sincere apologies to the bounty members that have contributed their efforts to support and promote our project.  Once again thanks to all of the contributors and community members for your interest and support.  We will be starting the ETH refund process for the fund contributors on the 24th of August, 2018.  If there are any questions please send us an email at support@okeydokey.net   UPDATE   Hello OkeyDokey Community. Regarding the refund, we will be refunding your ETH contributions as you register your refund address. So if you have yet to register your wallet address for the refund please do so. This only applies to the contributors.  For those who have contributed ETH during the ICO, please login to your account on our website (https://okeydokey.network) and enter in your refund address on your dashboard. Please make sure to double and triple check the address you have entered in order to make sure you receive the funds back. Once the refunds are released there is no going back.  Once again thanks to all of the contributors and community members for your interest and support.  Thank you,  OkeyDokey Team Keymaker",False
