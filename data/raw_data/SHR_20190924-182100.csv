ShareRing™ has incorporated a number of core elements that together create the smart sharing on-demand service system. These elements are:  A custom-designed distributed blockchain (ShareLedger), which is already in development. ShareLedger will be harvesting one of the most recent developments in blockchain technology, i.e. a dual token mechanism. ShareToken (SHR) will be used as the utility token of the platform, while the second token, SharePay (SHRP), will be used as the currency for sharing services. Aspects of a proven platform and API which are already being used worldwide in the sharing economy. A clever, integrated smartphone app. Ongoing mechanisms for creating a strong and growing network of providers and users Features and Benefits that the ShareLedger blockchain platform will provide over traditional cloud/server hosting sharing platforms:  Quick and easy ‘sharing’ transaction validation. Immutable records of data. Additional attributes may be added to an account, such as ID confirmation, rental history, asset ownership, etc. SharePay (SHRP) is used by customers to pay for the rental of assets. ShareToken (SHR) is used by providers to pay for their access to the ShareLedger blockchain, including the addition of assets, renting out of assets, adding attributes, adding smart contracts, and other features. A provider can earn SharePay by renting out their asset (ie. car), and then use those tokens for example to rent an apartment, thanks to the multi-industry application. Earn additional tokens by hosting a node. Custom ‘rules’ may be added to assets or wallets to allow for various ‘sharing’ scenarios.",False

I have three questions: 1) can someone explain me what the following means: „ShareToken (SHR) – – ShareToken is the digital utility token that drives sharing transactions to be written to the ShareRing ledger that is managed by the ShareRing platform.“ 2) I notice that many projects start building their own Blockchains rather than leveraging on something that has been developed (NEO, Stellar, etc). My worry is that if it is that easy to develop a Blockchain, then all the running projects are worth nothing as they won‘t be used. 3) You are using a dual token system which seems to be very similar to what Steem is doing.

Below is a rundown of the risks and rewards facing the project.  Risks     While I do appreciate the B2C benefits, I can’t really see the Ubers and AirBnB’s of the world looking to take a risk by integrating into a platform like ShareRing. They would essentially be relinquishing control of their own userbase into a platform that could technically turn into an intermediary killer. -2     Lack of immediate partnerships: Partnerships are very necessary for the success of this app. By the looks of it, they only have Keaz (the CEO’s company) as  something to potentially line up. -3     Uphill marketing battle, small marketing team: This is going to be a huge marketing ordeal, as is with any app trying to connect a gigantic pool of service providers and clients. -2     The pre-sale comes with a heft 50% discount, and the main sale comes with none. This is done with the goal of strategically bringing on the right investors (partnering platforms) in the pre-sale in order to add more value for everybody. The min contribution for pre-sale is set at $150,000 to protect against token dumping with a lock-up period of 3 months.     But still, if I were an investor in the main sale I’m not a fan of seeing the bulk of the tokens going to another party for 50% off.  Growth Opportunity     The massive size of the sharing economy: It’s estimated that 66.3 million people will use the sharing economy this year (2018). There are maybe a dozen optimistic sectors for blockchain startups to tackle, and the sharing economy is one of them. +2     The potential growth of the sharing economy: ShareRing presents an interesting value proposition. The Millennial generation has become the biggest driver of both the sharing economy and cryptocurrency industry. It’s very rare for a project to nail down a specific niche user as accurately as ShareRing potentially can. +3     Problems with the sharing economy: While the sharing economy has expanded significantly, it is not without its growing pains. Providers are left segmented within small local markets, the multitude of different sharing platforms can get confusing, some of the sharing platforms might not even be active or legally permitted to operate in the city you are traveling to, and the intermediary sharing platform fees are pretty high. +3     Partnership potential: This is kind of a long-shot, but let’s put our binoculars on. The primary partners that ShareRing would love to have on the platform are big names like AirBnB and Uber. While as it stands (from the whitepaper at least), there isn’t a significant value prop for these unicorns to hop on board. However, if, and this is a big IF, ShareRing is able to get the partnership and endorsement of something like Uber and AirBnB, it will instantly be throttled into not only the upper-tier of cryptocurrency projects, but will have been one of the first to broach the mainstream startup world. +2     30% of the total 24% of tokens going towards setting up “incubators” for entrepreneurs to build into the ShareRing platform. I love this approach to get more people building with blockchain, and it’s a smart way to get more entrepreneurs familiar with ShareRing. +4  Disposition We arrive at a +7 out of 10 for ShareRing. It’s only a matter of time the blockchain startup world comes up with something that can compete in the massive sharing economy sector. Hopefully for ShareRing investors, this will be one of the frontrunners.  Its  a very good score from the hacked.com Proof: https://hacked.com/ico-analysis-sharering/",False

Is there a strategy in place to attract specific countries first? Will Keaz be using the SHR token on launch? Just to clarify, people list their car or whatever on the ShareRing app and people will then share through that? Will users only interact with fiat currency on the app but in the background it would buy the token?  1. We have a multi-prong strategy in place. We will obviously cherry pick a number of existing providers and start-ups where Keaz already has a presence, but we are also planning on utilising some contributor data to see where the 'hot locations' are in terms of people that have contributed to the token sale. This will give us some targetted locations to run events, pitch-fests, etc to bring startups into the ShareRing network.  On top of that, we have done some extensive market research on what sharing services are popular in various locations around the world... we will utilise that too. You'll start seeing the results of these efforts soon, as we announce our pilot partners (large and small partners)  2. Keaz will be using SHR token for a number of their existing clients.  3. Part of our plan is to essentially 'hide' the confusion of cryptocurrency from the end user. As others have said, it's almost like SHRP is a voucher system, where they buy vouchers and use them for services. Or they earn those vouchers for renting out their things.  By taking away the fear of 'crypto', it makes our service far more user friendly (and also quiet seamless in terms of onboarding new users)  4. Your final point is correct... with one correction. The users would be using the ShareRing app, but the transaction would be via a provider on the ShareRing network. So if someone wants to rent out a wedding dress in Las Vegas, there will have to be a 'wedding dress sharing' provider onboard in Vegas. We do this so that the providers can specialise in their particular area (ie marketing, product selection, etc), while we (the ShareRing platform) can generalise across all areas and geographies.  Why is SharePay needed, if it's going to be pegged to fiat anyways? Right now, I see the user interface something like: put in your credit card info, you see the price of everything in SharePay (maybe with equivalent in dollars/other currency for convience), you pay in SharePay, of which the equivalent gets deducted from your credit card. Or smth like this... But yeah, why is SharePay needed? Is there need to be the link between a token and a token, so SharePay and ShareToken?  1. By introducing SHRP,  our users can avoid FX and transaction fees once they're in the network.  2. By having SHRP, we can run promotions that allow us to give away SHRP or discount it for the first xx buyers. That's something that we can't easily do if we use fiat across all currencies.  3. As part of the smart contract, we can lock up/escrow SHRP during a rental. This is something that's difficult to do with credit cards when dealing with them globally.  4. When a provider/user earns SHRP,  it's far easier to credit their account instantly, as opposed to sending to a bank account somewhere in the world (with up to $30 in transfer fees).  5. We can support micro payments. If you try to do that with credit card, the fee will be higher than the payment.  The list goes on.  We will be writing a paper that's dedicated to the economy of SHRP in the near future. We have some exciting things planned in that area.",False
