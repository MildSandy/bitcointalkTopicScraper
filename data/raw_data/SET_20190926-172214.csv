Our token generation event began on June 12th. You can access it here: https://tokensale.swytch.io/signup  Visit our site  Swytch is an ERC20 compliant blockchain project that incentivizes the production of renewable energy.    Swytch leverages the proliferation of smart sensors and IoT devices inside smart homes and smart cities across the world.  Our first target is renewable energy generated by commercial generators - because they already have all the hardware required to run on the Swytch network But eventually, any sustainability action that reduces C02 can be rewarded with Swytch tokens.  This is important because it is true today that adding renewable energy in some locations does little to reduce C02 emissions. But adding renewable energy in Africa does a lot. Likewise, switching from gasoline-powered cars to electric vehicles can greatly reduce C02 emissions.    Swytch's aim is nothing less and nothing more than to get capital to flow to the right places and right sustainability activities, so as to reduce C02 emissions on an accelerated schedule.  The world needs Swytch. The status quo isn't working. Right now we are on pace to see global temperatures increase by 2 degrees Fahrenheit, a result that will be catastrophic for people, wildlife, and whole economies.  How you can help:  Support Swytch - a blockchain-based token - that rewards activity based on how much C02 emissions are reduced.  Based on our unique Open Oracle technology, Swytch is not only changing the world, it's changing the way tokenized economies run on the blockchain. Instead of proof of stake, proof of work, Swytch rewards activity based on an objective function. You can think of this as ""proof of results"".

Swytch has a 1.5 gw pilot program operating in Germany, and has signed MOUs with four cities in Korea. Swytch attaches an IOT device to renewable energy sources that verifies the energy produced and reports it to an oracle that determines how many tokens that energy is worth based on a number of factors, which includes: geography, time of day, source of energy produced. We call this Proof of Production, and for this industry it solves the problems inherent with PoW and PoS.",False

The fact is that in this case an ERC20 could be substituted with the existing Green Certificate that is a tradable asset which proves that electricity has been produced by a renewable energy source. For example one green certificate is issued by 1 MWh of renawable power. So very good team, very good vision of the project but the product could run off-blockchain as well.",False

Also the way that they implemented the token usage is also very fragile and will not create any demand and excitement for investors, if this project is going to be successful, it will take tens of years, no investor would wait such a long time, this is something that is not related to blockchain in anyway, this should be a normal project that should be funded by usual ways not ICOs.  The team is okay, but having a good team does not mean that the project they are offering is suitable for investors and the blockchain system.  I have worked with several eco green energy projects even before the blockchain started, and there is a very rare chance for these projects to succeed, they collect money from investors and in few years it becomes a dead project.  I would never consider investing in this project.",False

The fact is, Swytch has an incredible team and is backed by one of the largest hedge funds on Wall St. And has deals in multiple cities and in Germany. And Toronto boy, can you stop copy pasting negative reviews with the same BS story? I see your comments verbatim on other ICOs as you demolish them without thought. Did you even bother to read the whitepaper here? Let me put it this way, you would not have invested in Ethereum at 30 cents in the presale under your so called conditions for success. Non-profit foundation, protocol level play, open source software, non proprietary... You newcomers to the ICO world appear to have been stained with the residue of old world economics and failure to even grasp what tokenonics is and what the potential is. It's not about profit margins, and shareholder ecstasy, it's not about VC with their boot on the back of the necks of innovators watering them down to one figure equity. It's about building community and finding utility value for the coin. It's about people using it. For the so called expert who thinks that ICOs are no good for humanitarian or environmental projects... well what can I say? Delusional? Stupid? Pick one. Now I know why half my clients could care less about ICObench. Because of drivel like this, posing as analysis. All I can say is the quality of so called experts here is falling.",False

And the reason is simple. Investors donâ€™t care so much about saving the manatees. So not much money will be invested in this project. That will lead to decreased funding which means a low price or even a useless token. Nobody wants a useless token so there are no actual incentives to produce renewable energy using Swytch.",False
