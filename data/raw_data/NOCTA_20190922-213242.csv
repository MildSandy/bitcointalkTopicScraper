It was time to act also in this medium in the sense of trying to change the way people see sexual service.

I, personally, believe that, not infrequently, it is less problematic to pay for someone to satisfy us sexually (the truth is that many times it goes beyond that, because the person who serves us has patience to listen and that also works very well ), instead of blindly looking for someone who, not infrequently, can generate frustration and boredom. great idea, and I am with you.",False

So there is no real project by now, except Nocta. Feel free to read our whitepaper, we tried to explain the mechanics of the platform carefully. Basically there is several main points among the platform technical features: 1. Decentralization (consist of decentralized network); 2. Anonymity and privacy of clients and servers (nodes); 3. Invulnerability to known distributed system weaknesses (sybil attack , byzantine generals problem , etc.); 4. Ability to store and search structured data; 5. Scalability (readiness for rapid growth without access speed loss); 6. Publicity (everybody must be able to download node and become the part of the network). In addition, we are aware that cash now is the most popular payment method in this market and we do not count on rapid replacement of cash by the cryptocurrencies. Thus, the direct relations between the client and the sexworker will occur as it was before; however, the cryptocurrencies will be used to pay for additional platform services and the main services in the future.",False

Here is some questions for Nocta. So your team is going to create your own decentralized storage system, why not use the existing one like Sia? They support the development on their blockchain, and they want other people to implement services on top of their blockchain. I think Sia solution is sufficient for what your project want to achieve.  What if a child is willing to involve in this industry, and enjoying the work, and very aware of the risk, and know how to protect him/herself, and supported by the parents? Will Nocta use the ""pre-moderation"" as described in whitepaper to stop this action and remove his/her right to involve in the industry? In my opinion, I think Nocta should leave moderation to the government and legal law, but decentralize the process and payment, binded with legal law.  How is Nocta going to prevent the issue of ""multi-accounts"", for example, they need at least 3 users verify the photograph to make sure it is real, what is preventing he/she to self verifying and self paying? I don't think there is a way to guarantee the sex activity has been executed in real life. I my opinion, in this scenario, it is entirely possible for a person with criminal mind use Nocta as a method to hunt for his/her target.  Thank you.",False

First of all, Nocta is not aiming to store any data in the blockchain, except ratings, statuses and the payment system, of course. About Sia (and similar projects like Storj). Storage of the files is a paid function for users. Files are static, there is no option to change files and store the dynamic content. So changing profile options is impossible this way. Economic mechanics of th Nocta presume that users will pay only for the functions that give them some additional opportunities. Require payments for the basic functions of the platform is the road to nowhere. About child prostitution. Our team and most of our potential users have moral limitations. The main thing is that we do not want to have any relation to the involvement of children into this market, regardless of their parents opinion. We think that juvenile justice is not working like this. And the reputation of the platform for pedophiles will not work for us in a good way. About verifying and multi-accounts. The verification process is totally random, user cannot choose the sexworkers profile to vote for. About the rating system. Basically, users will have a ""weight"" of their votes. More experienced users (that have activity among several offerers) have a stronger influence on reputation of workers. Nocta is not pretending to be a flawless system, and there is always ""criminal minds"" but concerning to the usual relations between people on this market, it will be easier and safier to use the services.

We have no illusions about fast implementing the NOCTA tokens in sexmarket and building the service around cryptocurrency. Sexservice arguing that building own blockchain and coin is a huge step and proof of project's reliability, but it's not. Simply look at the ann forum section. There are dozens of coins at 3 hundreds of pages. How many of them succeed? Next. Main idea is the same, actually. The name of sexservice speaks for itself. It's not a ""hookup site"", there almost thousands meeting sites on the Internet, and blockchain protected ratings is'nt needed for a regular relationships. Their service is oriented to the sexworkers and their customers, just like ours. The main difference between the SexService and Nocta is the presence in the team of a persons with experience in the sex market and the lack of illusions about the fact that sexworkers around the world themselves are in hurry to register ""women bounty program"". Implementing such a project is not about building a coin and running refferal programs. It's a really hard work with thousands and thousands of living people worldwide. Understanding their needs and giving them solutions. Without understanding psychology, without any experience on this market, and without hundreds conversations with people in fear of jail day by day, project just cannot succeed.

We don't think that sexservice will succeed on this market, we don't think that sexservice is planning to build their platform at all. See the arguments below.  They blaming us in scam. Brilliant. Let's see. They have created their blockchain to perform own preICO and 3 or 4 ICOs. What is the purpose for that? Okay, maybe 3-4 ICOs for 1 project is a normal thing (but we don't think so). But why they perform it on own blockchain, there is several platforms to perform it quite easy and, the main thing, transparently? We've got an answer. To participate in their ICO you need to register your own wallet on SSIO blockchain. Than you need to send some crypto to the address ETH/BTC/LTC/DOGE. This address is generated automatically only for your txn. For example their system gave us this ETH address to send ether: 0x7f3c372B81e6C99c2eAe28Bf6e1dEA5A4f1e9DBB. As you can see, it's a wallet with a zero balance and txn. Feel free to check it out. This way the sum of raised eth/btc/doge/ltc on pre-ico/ico is totally untraceble for investors. And we think that sum of 300k$ that shine at the main page of their site is a fake to deceive people, pretending that project is that popular among investors. Pretty the same was done by Eros and Lust, if you check their Ethereum addresses, you will see. But they had'nt acting as smart as SSIO does, they just winding the counters on their sites. We don't hide anything about our preICO funding. We already verified the smartcontract of NOCTA token in Ethereum blockchain explorer and everybody can see all transactions made with our tokens and the sum of Ether we've collect. About blockchain and selfdestructing of the profiles. Dev of sexservice should read more about how smart contracts work. Maybe he would realize then, that there are a ""suicide()"" function, for example. About servers. Yes, when we build our blockchain, we'll definitelly need an explorer and web-wallets service. And Nocta will be decentralized. They should learn more about how p2p web works. There some that already can be tested: IPFS, ZeroNet, MAIDSAFE. We have nothing to add here. About anonymity and ID. Platform will request only a photograph and a birthday date. As it said previously, Nocta is against child prositution. What about sexservice? By the way, working with Nocta, sexworkers will obviously provide their photographs and even videos to represent themselves to the customers. It is how sexmarket works. What else can be discussed? The last. Sexservice pretending on invent the use of IPFS to create decentralized service and they say we've stole their idea? It's just childish. Summing up the aforesaid, SSIO - is a not a real project. If they already collect 300k$ there must be HUGE progress since their start at June. Four months past, but there is only refferals to collect more on ICOs and pictures of sexy girls and pimps at their thread.  We've already said few posts earlier, and repeat again: we bet they have no sexworkers in their team and they don't realize how this market work. If you won't to loose your funds, avoid them. That's it. No more talks of the sexservice.io in this thread, please, thank you.",False

Yes, concept is in the same field with lust (and eros), but two major differences here. First of all, we are not  faking identities and do not stealing whitepapers. We have done some research among sex workers and realize that most of them and, for sure, most of users prefer to use mobile devices, and the ""zeronet"" technology that eros and lust ""want to employ"", is impossible to use with iOS and Android at all. Neither Apple nor Google will ever add that kind of app in app markets (at least without some of their ""security improvements"", you know). So, the only way to be ensured in safety is the service accessed through a common open source web browser. OP is temporarily without images due to some of forum rules. You can see as it should look like in second post here. OP will be edited later.  Thanks for attention. Stay tuned.",False

We clearly understand that involvement of sexworkers is the basis of the platform. 2) it is an investment tool, so you can simply sell it on exchange after ICO, we presume the price of 0.5-1$ per token/coin after Nocta final release. After that, we will run exchange where token holder will be able to change tokens to our coin with rate 1:1, to use paid features of the platform. Besides, at the mid of 2018 we will deploy a smart contract that would exchange our tokens back to ether with rate of 1 eth per 1500 token. 3) No, but you feel free to spread the word and PM us after. Stay tuned.",False
