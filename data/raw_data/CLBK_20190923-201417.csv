The ICO is set to begin on 1st April ( 10:00 am UTC) with each token going for just $0.10.  Currently, the Token has received great interest from various prison facilities with an expected roll-out of the new platform set for the 3rd quarter of 2018.  Only people who are whitelisted are eligible to participate in token Pre-sale. However, those without a Cellblocks account can register one here. Registered users can check legibility by logging in into their CellBlocks account. At least 75% of the 300,000,000 tokens will be distributed to the community with 9% reserved for founders, and 7% for an inmate bounty. Affiliates and ConCoin will get 3% of the tokens each. The ICO is set to end on June 10, 2018, or upon reaching a $12,000,000 hard cap whichever comes first. All unsold and unallocated tokens after the 71-day ICO window will be destroyed.  The utility is set to rise in price with continued adoption from major prisons. The novel idea comes with a promise to take on a bloated and bureaucratic prison financial system. It is set to give prisoners a taste of financial freedom through a Cryptocurrency that guarantees access, independence and utmost transparency in how prisoners’ money and transactions are handled.  Transactions on the platform will have a burn rate of 0.5% for every transaction which will be calculated according to current exchange rates. The ‘burn’ process is decentrally regulated by smart contracts.  More value will be realized with a Monthly Loyalty program. The program is aimed at encouraging users to hold and buy more tokens as the rewards are solely dependent on the number of tokens a user is in possession of. Users will get rewarded in CLBK tokens on a random day every month.  Accepted forms of purchase will include other secure blockchain-based platforms such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Wire transfers. The minimum transaction value is pegged at 750 CLBK with no maximum limit. Cellblocks is offering an additional 25% bonus in addition to the normal 18–33% in the first 4 hours of the ICO or until the first $2.5 million is raised. This means that early buyers get to enjoy bonuses of up to 58% of their total Cellbocks tokens (CLBK) purchase.  To claim your tokens, users are advised to provide an ERC20 compatible wallet address. This is to enable the transfer of the tokens to your wallet at the end of the ICO. Some of the suggested wallets include Mist, ImToken, Metamask, and MyEtherWallet.

Nowhere is this more apparent — and necessary — than within the prison financial system. Because it has long been rec-ognized as an inefficient and ineffective method of funding inmates’ needs, CellBlocks is undertaking the challenge and transforming the industry.  The prison population just in the United States stood at more than two million people as of 2014 and growing. In an environment that’s already rife with violence, the present financial system not only allows such acts to flourish, it actually encourages them as a means of achieving a coveted status. CellBlocks addresses every weakness the current system perpetuates with solid solutions that are cost-effective, transparent, safe and accurate. For decades, prisoners have been using a barter system. This breeds theft and violence. Implementing CellBlocks eliminates any possibility of theft, helping to reduce the violence that it encourages.

This is a unique thing, with over 1400 tokens out there all in one way or another has a general use for the normal person, this token could corner the market for the prison system.  We are the only token to go after a 2 million person market.  The prison system will not have a need for 3-4 or even 5 tokens, only one is enough.

So you cannot just make 4 plaster walls). and even if that does happen with the Kiosks: - who will pay for the employees maintaining the kiosks? - who will pay for the construction of the kiosk (anti-vandal proof equipment, prison-regulated items are expensive) and how do you plan to convince governments to create a Tender Competition to select a company for its construction? - Are you aware that for the Government to make a decision to create a new tender, allocate a budget, the tender procedure itself, the announcement of the tender results and the implementation of the tender takes a considerable amount of time? so how long after launching this coin do you believe it can actually be implemented? - why would a prisoner want to go to a kiosk to trade coins or buy coins using conventional money when they can just trade their existing cash between them without going through the hustle of a kiosk? Since there is no internet (or limited internet) in a prison then having to go through a kiosk to do a simple transaction just adds hustle! - Prisoners also tend to trade things between them, so why would someone trade a non-physical coin when they can trade a pack of cigaretes for example (or whatever other physical is needed which is far more important and useful than a non-physical digital currency in a prison environment).

Please note, this is only the first step in a long journey.  Surprisingly enough, yesterday I received an in person meeting request to put on a presentation in regards to CellBlocks next Friday the 10th.  Please understand I don't want to give the state's name just yet till after the meeting, but I will be flying there and taking pics with the powers to be and posting it all for you to see.  This is who the meeting is going to be with.  The Director of Prisons for the State Inspector General for the Department of Corrections   Chief of Purchasing & Inmate Services Dept of Corrections Banking Supervisor Committee Manager Senate Judiciary Committee  This is a major meeting for CellBlocks, I originally thought it would be with the Director, but he felt the need to request the other to show up to this meeting.  Now we are busy working on a full presentation for this meeting.  Keep your fingers crossed please!!!!!!",False
