The InterValue project focuses on the core technology of Blockchain infrastructure and platform level. The goal is to build the underlying infrastructure covering all fields at the ecological level, which conquers the key technical problems.  Main Technological Innovation  (1)In the communication layer of the underlying P2P network node:  The original anonymous P2P communication network is realized by combining the existing Tor-based anonymous communication network, the Blockchain-based distributed VPN and the advantages of the Blockchain-based distributed content sharing network. The protocol of node anonymity access is designed, and the private encrypted communication protocol is realized. These two protocols greatly enhance the anonymity of nodes in the underlying communication network and ensure that the communication between nodes is hard to be traced and cracked.  (2)At the underlying data structure Layer  A new data structure with an enhanced directed acyclic graph (HashNet) is adopted, which greatly reduces the storage space required by the nodes and improves the efficiency and security of the underlying data storage.  (3)At the consensus mechanism Layer  We designed three different consensus mechanism: a HashNet based consensus mechanism, BA-VRF consensus mechanism, basic DAG consensus mechanism. A consensus mechanism based on HashNet to enhance the consensus of DAG and BA-VRF consensus mechanism for notary selection is presented. In project version 1.0, due to the fact that HashNet-based DAG consensus is more difficult to implement, we first implement a two-Layer consensus mechanism that combines DAG consensus with BA-VRF. These consensuses all support high transaction concurrency, fast transaction confirmation speed, and building eco-systems for different application scenarios.  (4)At the Layer of anti-quantum attack  New anti-quantum algorithms are adopted, which replaces the existing SHA series algorithm with the Keccak-512 hash algorithm, and replaces the ECDSA signature algorithm with an integer lattice-based NTRUsign signature algorithm. These algorithms reduce the threat which brings from the quantum computing development and gradual popularization of a quantum computer.  (5)At the Layer of anonymous transaction  Combined with the characteristics of cryptocurrency such as Monroe and ZCash, the zero-knowledge proof and ring signature are used to design transaction anonymity and privacy protection method with high effective cost ratio and excellent security to meet privacy requirements of different application scenarios.  (6)At the Layer of smart contracts  We adopt the Turing comprehensive contract with fair distribution mechanism and support the issuance of third-party assets, which can take place in the form of the public Blockchain, permission (private) Blockchain, consortium (hybrid) Blockchain to the actual application scenario.  (7)At the Layer of cross-link communication and multi-chain fusion  The use of relay chain technology to cross-chain communication and multi-chain fusion function module as a single layer overlay to achieve, not only can maintain the independence of cross-chain operation, but also reuse InterValue basis chain Various functions.  (8)At the ecologically motivated Layer  Various Token allocation tools and methods are used in combination and support for double-layer mining for miners' incentives.  (9)At the industry application level  The development of JSON-RPC industry common interfaces, such as circulation payment, data transmission, data search, and contract invocation, supports various applications at the upper level.  Click to review:→InterValue Ecosystem  InterValue supports the building of a variety of applications on the chain including anonymous network communications, power-sharing, storage sharing, bandwidth sharing, reputation sharing (credit guarantee), and an open interface for third-party development of DApp. By combining various practical application scenarios, InterValue can cooperate with various service providers and application providers to support commercial organizations and government agencies to build public chain, consortium chain, and permission chain application system according to their own business characteristics and needs.  InterValue will reshape the existing Internet operation model. It introduced Token mechanism at the incentive level to achieve the flexible consensus mechanism for the public chain, inspired the community to maintain the InterValue public chain and developed the DApp application on the public chain. InterValue can increase value and promote network effects on the public chain, turn the economic incentive system itself into a system that can circulate within the system, and create a completely decentralized ecosystem of Internet value transmission.",False

In early 2009, the Bitcoin network was officially launched. As a virtual currency system, the total amount of bitcoin is defined by the network consensus protocol. No individual or institution can freely modify the supply and transaction records therein. The underlying technology of Bitcoin-the Blockchain is actually an extremely ingenious distributed shared ledger and peer-to-peer value transfer technology that has the potential to affect as much as the financial double entry book Invention.  2)Blockchain 2.0-Smart contracts.  Around 2014, the industry began to recognize the important value of Blockchain technology and create a common technology platform and provide developers with BaaS (Blockchain as service) services, which greatly improve the transaction speed, reduce resource consumption and support multiple consensus algorithms such as PoW, PoS and DPoS and make DApp development easier.  3)Blockchain 3.0-Blockchain application extension.  After 2015, with the rise of Blockchain 3.0 technology based on DAG data structures such as Byteball and IOTA, Blockchain systems are more efficient, scalable, highly interoperable, and have a better user experience than before. The application of Blockchain gradually extends to healthcare, IP rights, education, and materials. Broader applications such as networking, sharing economy, communications, social management, charity and charity, culture and entertainment.  4)Blockchain 4.0- Perfect ecosystem.  Recently, the Blockchain 4.0 technology based on the HashNet data structure has gradually attracted the attention of the industry. The consensus algorithm based on the data structure can achieve a qualitative leap in transaction throughput and scalability. The Blockchain becomes the infrastructure of the industry and forms a perfect ecosystem based on the Blockchain. It will change people’s lifestyles extensively and profoundly.",False
