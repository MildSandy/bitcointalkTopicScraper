You can see the exact amount of funds under management though so that should give you a general idea of the size of the user base.  Quote from: Relictus on August 17, 2019, 01:36:26 PM Would you consider creating a fund that makes money from funding off perpetual futures? Up until recently, holding a short on bitmex for ethereum yielded ~10.5%+ p.a. Which is greater than constant losses MM algo generates. Speaking off, what would happen if the deposit amount eventually runs out? I'm down ~50% in btc since the start already.  Sounds interesting. We will take a look at it, thanks for the suggestion.  Quote from: readyUP on August 19, 2019, 09:34:39 AM I am one of the first users of this platform, I have always been in this cryptocurrency. from the beginning to now I have only lost ... there has been no real profit even when the btc has doubled.  The loss that you are referring to is only in BTC terms and in fairness everything has lost against BTC in 2019. In USD terms though it has been a very good year, currently +60.84% for the last 6 months for our MM algo.

You lost BTC because you chose to diversify it into altcoins (that's what is in those baskets), which lost against BTC, but overall the increase in BTC value in USD terms has more than compensated for what the alts lost.

We offer an innovative product that is different from simple exchanges but the decision how much/if/where to invest is always up to the users themselves and they also carry full responsibility for their decisions since they themselves will reap rewards/loss of those decisions.

While the changes may sound complicated if you haven't followed along as they were happening it's really not that complicated. Here it is in bullet points:  - XRL token (which was a utility token enabling investments on the old platform) is gone and token holders were offered DAP assets (either migrated inside the market making algorithm or withdrawn converted to ETH), premium accounts without profit fees and shares instead (KYC required) - All accounts that were either funded or KYC-ed were migrated and login credentials have remained the same (empty accounts that were not KYC-ed were not migrated over) - New platform now accepts ETH and BTC only to make deposits and withdrawals easier and improve transparency  That's really it in a nutshell. If you have any XRL tokens left follow instructions here to exchange them for ETH and then you can deposit that ETH to the new platform and invest in any of our products or do whatever else you feel like doing with it.  If you missed out on the initial share distribution, there will be a second round, so be sure to complete the KYC and then contact support (link in the footer) asking to be included. If you are from a non eligible country (such as the US) then contact support to get on the notification list for when the KYC solution will be ready for you.

I successfully transferred my 3,233 XRL tokens for ETH but was not impressed with the return which equates to about 25% of eth put in despite trading at the time at a good ratio of XRL to eth.  Then I read the following,  Quote  To implement this change, all XRL token holders (as taken from Ethereum blockchain) on 15th November 2018 at 14:00 CET will have a preferential user account without profit fees (second type of fees). In addition, each such holder will automatically be eligible to receive (for no payment) “preferred equity shares” of the company.  Today, RialtoTrade AG has a total of 50,000 shares issued: 12,500 voting shares (25%) 37,500 non-voting preferred shares with 10% higher annual preferred dividend (75%) unquote   So I am guessing this has some sort of value to make up for the low eth return, yet I cannot see this when I log into realto web site.

However you must realize that the inverse is also true once the Bitcoin bull run ends and altcoins take over or if there is a correction.  You can see the full breakdown of DAP assets at: https://rialtotrade.com/algorithms/mm-algorithm  Our products are designed as a more balanced approach to crypto investment for more conservative investors who want to have exposure to the crypto assets but with less downside risk.  Having said all that, many users are confused by the way we measure performance therefore we have decided to change it to USD, which is what most sites like https://coinmarketcap.com/ for example use by default. At the end of the day it appears that USD is still the most relevant metric for most crypto investors. This update is due out next week.

I made the example of BitMex because with its daily fund can make you pay the fees or can reward you with the fees. For now I'm using it as if it were a fauchet positioning only upward in the BTC perpetual with ""cross"" leverage. as of today I have been losing almost constantly with the position, I have taken profit a few times and despite everything I am positive about the total balance. the position is conservative, if the BTC were to arrive at 707 $ I would lose everything.

In order to withdraw your DAP assets, you must open an account on Rialto.ai, fill in your personal information (you can make it up if you want as KYC won't be required), verify your XRL holding ETH address by depositing the requested amount of ETH to our verification ETH address (small amount of ETH worth 0,00012 USD for example) and then deposit your XRL tokens to our platform deposit address.  As a final step open a support ticket on our Rialto.ai platform and request the withdrawal of your assets.

Hopefully it's only very short term.  In relation to your XRL tokens, you can either sell them on an exchange or deposit them and ask for withdrawal of underlying DAP assets which will also register you for the upcoming free equity participation plan. You do not need to complete the KYC to deposit XRL and withdraw the DAP assets, although you may have to do it for the free equity participation plan, details of which are due to be published shortly.  Which option is best for you is really up to you but in any case you can get some value for your XRL coins, it just depends on the market conditions and your outlook for the project (how much you value the free equity participation plan vs perhaps selling on exchange for a slight profit over DAP value - value of XRL and DAP changes all the time so it's hard to know when to sell to make a profit and liquidity is very low - for the most part due to arbitrage of a some of our users the price on exchange is usually fairly close to the DAP value so there's not much of a difference either way). The value of XRL on exchanges is in the short term unlikely to drop much below it's underlying DAP asset value, however it's unlikely to maintain that value in the long term as we switch to the new Rialto Trade platform.  The best advice given the current situation is to deposit your XRL tokens to our Rialto.ai platform before the 1st of December and ask to withdraw your DAP assets and keep your options open regarding the free equity participation plan. If you sell right now (29.11.18 at 11:47CET) you would be selling below DAP value and you would also lose any chance of taking part in the free equity participation plan. Again to deposit and withdraw DAP assets converted into ETH you do not need to complete KYC. You will need to enter your personal details, but you will not need to submit any documents.",False

How accurate they are is visible on the platform itself as it features a 60 day ROI as well. They don't have to be used exactly as suggested by the algorithm, especially exit points are often too quick. If you monitor your trades manually you could easily let them run a bit longer and create more profit by exiting when you feel is the right time, since you will have a lot more info at your disposal than the algorithm itself. Things like market sentiment are very important and if you feel the market is bullish you won't exit on a 1% drop for example.

The upcoming platform launch for indices looks very promising.  The UI of the website is very good for the function it provides. I really hope rialto can keep the design and easy to use interface up, when they launch their new platform. About the token airdrop (if there will be a new token): It will solve so many problems, like liquidity. If they add a token-burning mechanism and also a market for those new tokens where we can trade them for indices or single cryptos, the token could significantly increase in price.   It will be very interesting how the new token economics will play out.  @Rialto: Don't leave your investors in the dark too long about your thoughts/plans with the new token.

The first quarter of 2018 is coming to an end and at RIALTO.AI we are getting ready for the complete platform launch and the full functionality access for our platform users. As you will from now on be able to control the algorithms and withdraw the profit in a two-week period, we have decided to make a poll to satisfy your preferences.  Storing the profit in crypto assets may have certain advantages, such as:  Lower costs. No additional fees would be charged for converting crypto assets to USD and then back again to ETH. Safer storage. There would less third-party dependency (exchanges) as ETH can be more easily saved in cold wallets. Faster profit payout. Payouts would be executed directly and would not have to go through additional transaction before distribution to users. Storing the profit in USD, on the other hand, would protect the assets from changes in value due to crypto market volatility.  Since we believe in the power of a community vote, we would like to receive your feedback on how you would like the profit to be stored, either in ETH or in USD.  How to vote?  Enter your platform user ID. You can check your user ID on the platform under User Account section in the Personal Information box. If you haven’t registered at the RIALTO.AI Platform yet, we kindly invite you to do so https://platform.rialto.ai/#/createAccount?utm_source=sendinblue&utm_campaign=RIALTOAI_Poll&utm_medium=email. Please note that only the votes with valid user IDs will be considered. Furthermore, any duplicate votes will be disregarded.

Prediction trading is all about determining the right time to either buy or sell a cryptocurrency. We have implemented and backtested several strategies so far, and we continue working on the development of the new ones. Our backtesting process is extremely rigorous, and only the most profitable strategies make it into the production environment.  THE INFRASTRUCTURE The trade bot infrastructure consists of four parts: real-time stream processing engine, historical data service, backtesting environment, and the trade bot.  The real-time stream processing engine is responsible for running the trading strategies. The input for strategies is real-time data obtained from the exchanges and the historical data from our databases. Strategies analyze these inputs and generate signals which are interpreted by the trade bot.  The historical data service is storing trade-related data to the databases. This data is then used for backtesting where it is used to evaluate the profitability of the strategies, and in the real-time stream processing engine where it is fed to strategies which require historical data in addition to the real-time data.  The backtesting environment was developed from scratch since we could not find a solution that would meet our needs. Usually, such environments support only “single-strategy” testing, while our goal was to improve this and have the option to perform testing in a “multi-strategy” backtesting environment. We started with the assumption that by interleaving the strategies we could achieve greater profitability and thanks to our multi-strategy backtesting environment we were able to confirm this.  The last part of our infrastructure is the trade bot which performs the trades on the exchanges according to the signals it receives from the strategies.  THE DEVELOPMENT The process of designing and developing such a complex and advanced infrastructure has been lengthy and time-consuming. However, we have achieved huge improvements in the reliability (in terms of uptime) and scalability (new strategies can be tested and implemented with little effort). Additionally, tradebots are built in a modular way so that they can integrate with the RIALTO.AI platform that enables users to replicate all trades for their own account with a single click. In contrast to many other social trading websites, we are focusing on quality over quantity thus we will deploy only best performing algorithms. We are making a significant step forward with the multi-strategy trading by deploying a “long/short” strategy, which performs well in both, bullish and bearish markets.",False

The extensive data protection regulation does not only affect European businesses but all organizations handling the personal data of EU citizens. And how does the implementation of GDPR look in practice at RIALTO.AI and what does it mean for our platform and website users? Before answering this question, we shall lead you through some main points.  What is GDPR? GDPR is a legal framework that obliges companies and businesses to protect the personal data and privacy of their clients and users that reside in European Union. It covers all companies that collect, store, and process the data of EU citizens, especially banks, insurance companies, and other financial companies for transactions that occur within EU member state.  What is the background of GDPR? In April 2016, the European Parliament adopted the GDPR, replacing the outdated Data Protection Directive enacted in 1995. It is important to note that the GDPR is a regulation, in contrast to the previous legislation, which is a directive. A regulation is a binding legislative act and it must be entirely applied across the EU, while a directive is a legislative act that sets out a goal that all EU countries must achieve, and it is up to the individual countries to decide how. EU member countries had two years to adopt the Regulation which entered into force last Friday, on May 25. The issue with the 1995 Directive is that it became obsolete and therefore no longer relevant to today’s digital age. In other words, its provisions fail to address how data is stored, collected, and transferred today, meaning that it hasn’t been able to keep up with the pace of the levels of modern technological advancement.  What is personal data? Article 4(1) of GDPR defines Personal Data as follows:  Personal Data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.  It’s important to understand that under the GDPR you have the right to the protection of your personal data, and you have the access to data which has been collected about you, furthermore, you have the right to have this data corrected.  Two protective rights under the GDPR First, the right of erasure, or the right to be forgotten. If you don’t want your data out there, then you have the right to request for its removal or erasure. Second, the right of portability empowers you to claim your data provided to us which you can then transmit to another service provider without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data have been provided.  RIALTO.AI and GDPR The steps that we have taken towards the compliance with the GDPR are:  We appointed a Data Protection Officer (DPO) whose role will be:  Informing and advising our team members who carry out the tasks related to the collection, storage, and processing of the data. Monitoring compliance with the GDPR. Cooperation with the supervisory authority.   Also, we updated our Privacy Policy (https://platform.rialto.ai/#/privacyPolicy) where we in a transparent and structured way explain what we use your data for, the reasons why we use it, and how long we store it. Furthermore, we explain the new rights you will be able to exercise and how to exercise those rights. For example, now you can:  request the access to your personal data; request the correction of the Personal Information that we hold about you, request erasure of your Personal Information, object to the processing of your Personal Information; request the restriction of processing of your Personal Information; request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party, and withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.   And what do you have to do now?   Platform In order to enter the platform, you have to re-login and confirm that you have been informed about our new Privacy Policy and that you also consent to it.

RIALTO.AI Platform launch is around the corner, and therefore we have decided to collect questions which have appeared since the last post about the introduction to the platform. In order to shed light on the functionality, we made a selection of the most common ones with the corresponding answers.  1.What happens in case the algorithm used generates loss? Is the loss deducted from the profit of the previous periods? What if the profit of previous periods is 0 and the algorithm generates loss?  By using the algorithm, every user bears the risk of non profitable trading as well as the benefit of the profitable trading. If the cumulative profit within the trading period is positive, the user’s profit is added to his wallet and he is able to withdraw the assets. If the cumulative trading result is negative, the deposited balance of user’s XRL tokens decreases for the amount of the loss produced.  2.It was said that if platform loses funds, 1 XRL will be burned/lost /frozen for $0.13c loss. But what if the token price in the far future is $100 and I make a loss of $10. Will my whole token be burned or 0.1 XRL?  If the cumulative trading result is negative, the balance of user’s XRL tokens is decreased only for the amount of loss. It is always calculated based on the actual value of the token which is tied to the Total Assets value. Total Assets include all the cryptocurrencies that are managed by the users through the platform.  3.What happens with the distribution of the profit generated since the beginning of the trading (October 1st, 2017)? Will the US citizens be eligible for the payout of this profit? When will the distribution of this profit take place?  Profit generated since the beginning of the trading has been made by using the proportional amount of RIALTO.AI assets and has been added to the Total Assets, therefore the profit increased the value of the each user’s wallet, proportionally according to his amount of XRL. The USA is currently outside our area of operation, therefore US citizens are not able to use the platform features which include profit withdrawal.  4.Why did RIALTO.AI decide to build a platform instead of holding on to the initial idea of quarterly profit distribution on the Ethereum blockchain?  RIALTO.AI is following its initially outlined long-term development plan by establishing a platform where users will be able to access all the future products and services offered by the RIALTO.AI. Currently, those represent trading algorithms, while data tools and other features are expected to be introduced later in 2018. RIALTO.AI platform is required to comply with local legislation which does not allow for anonymous periodical profit payouts.  5.What options are there on the platform to choose from: AI trade bot, arbitrage and market-making bot? What will be the others?  With the platform launch, registered users will have an access to the arbitrage and market-making algorithm. AI trading bot will not yet be available at the initial stage as it is still in testing phase that will continue to run until the end of Q1 2018 in order to meet the statistical significance parameters required for the deployment phase. We will be constantly implementing further improvements and introducing additional features in later stages.  6.Will platform have an automatic option? My suggestion is you can get parameters from active users that perform well and average from those parameters. The assumption here is that active users will trade in their best interest.  Initially, users will be able to control only the arbitrage and market making algorithm. Default settings will be set to OFF, and therefore market exposure will be set to 0%. Later on, as new algorithms shall be introduced, platform users will be able to select individual preferences for trading algorithms. Suggested settings will be indicated on the platform which will allow for effortless and efficient usage of the platform for the most passive users.  7.Will the platform have a compounding feature? As in, profit gets converted to XRL, for example profits off every month buy XRL, so no ETH payout would happen.  A compounding feature is not included in the Q1 2018. Nevertheless, we will be implementing further improvements and introducing additional features in later stages.  8.Regarding KYC, will you be publishing any info related to personal information, and/or tax reporting that will be done by RIALTO.AI? Will you be reporting personal information and earnings of registered holders for tax purposes?  RIALTO.AI will not publish or anyhow distribute personal information to third parties. We will not issue tax reports on behalf of the users. Gathered information will be used solely for internal KYC and AML processes. Information is stored by using services of Contego Fraud Solutions Ltd and processed in line with the RIALTO.AI Privacy Policy that will be publicly accessible.  9.The Medium blog post writes about temporary lock-up of the XRL tokens after the withdrawal. Please elaborate, especially in context of the second bullet point question.  Once a user decides to withdraw his cryptocurrencies from the platform, he is required to leave the XRL tokens at the platform. Those tokens are not added to the circulating supply as they would devalue other tokens but will be either burned or made available for purchase on the platform in later platform updates (Q2 2018). This will enable the new user to deposit the same amount of cryptocurrencies per XRL tokens and use the algorithms further without influencing the original supply and token value.  10.How will XRL token holders benefit from other partnerships like they did with Hedge Project, if they’re only eligible to retrieve profits from the bots?  Any potential revenue from other services will prolong the ability to finance the platform maintenance, development, and running costs of business operations without charging any fees. We do not expect for other revenues to exceed 3% of trading return in 2018.  In the events of larger partnerships — like it was the case with Hedge, we will seek similar compensation that includes distribution of the value to all existing token holders.  https://medium.com/@RialtoAI/what-you-have-to-know-about-rialto-ai-platform-17ef9feec0fa",False

In the upcoming weeks prior to the platform launch, we intend to continue working on the website optimisation that will also be supported by significant design modifications.  Q4 2017 Performance Report Release On January 15, 2018, we have released our first performance report where we gave an overview of the RIALTO.AI trading activities and the progress in development of our AI trade bot.  Trading The first update of the RIALTO.AI Trading Dashboard in the new year happened on January 6, 2018, depicting results of a two-week trading period (December 23, 2017 — January 6, 2018), when RIALTO.AI arbitrage and market making bot has executed 1,453 trades earning $58,777. The second update was on January 20, 2018, revealing a profit of $69,788 by 3,983 executed trades in the trading period January 6–20.  Since January, arbitrage and market making bot has been deployed on six exchanges. Until the end of Q1, we expect to add one more exchange out of eight that we are currently analysing. There are three most important conditions that an exchange has to fulfill: reliable software performance, sufficient arbitrage opportunities and its transparent background.  Furthermore, we added four new cryptocurrencies (ZEC, XMR, EOS, BTG) and five new trading pairs (BTC/ZEC, BTC/XMR, BTC/EOS, BTC/BTG, ETH/DASH) which we will start trading fully in February. Consequently, we expect to nearly double the current utilisation of RIALTO.AI Total Assets.

Once live, it will enable the registered users the access to the automated trading algorithms. In this respect, it will also serve as a backbone for all the future products developed by RIALTO.AI among which we would like to stress the single access point for buying or selling of cryptocurrencies from multiple exchanges.   To access the platform, users will have to register on the platform by submitting personal identification. When we conclude the verification of users, full platform access will be enabled. Users will then be able to deposit their XRL tokens and adjust the percentage of the deposited assets they want to use for trading to their personal preference.   At the initial stage of the platform, only arbitrage/market-making bot will be available but will soon be followed by additional products in Q2 2018.  Selected algorithm combination will trade during a 14-days trading period after which users will have an option to withdraw the generated profit or to keep it on the platform. The withdrawal will be executed exclusively upon the user’s request and only after the current period, in which the withdrawal is requested, finishes. RIALTO.AI does not plan to charge any platform fees in the foreseeable future or at least not until the single access point feature is introduced in Q4 2018. However, the transaction fees (e.g. exchange conversion rates, transaction gas etc.) for withdrawals will automatically be deducted from the total amount of requested funds.   REGISTRATION RIALTO.AI aims to expand its area of operations globally and in order to do so, we have to demonstrate robust compliance processes, by which we want to ensure that each international territory has sufficient management oversight and that AML requirements are being adhered to. Yet, the current list of countries outside our area of operations remains unchanged since the RIALTO.AI Platform Introduction.  Personal data gathered through the registration will be used solely for internal KYC and AML processes. However, RIALTO.AI will handle the data with the highest level of discretion and will not disclose any of information to third parties by fully complying with the latest EU General Data Protection Regulation.   The data verification will be performed by Contego Fraud Solutions Limited, a UK based company, that designs and develops identity verification software. With access to over 3 billion records of individuals, stretching across more than 100 markets, Contego has the ability to automate seamlessly International Checks.    PLATFORM SECURITY The platform is comprised of multiple levels of security. For instance, addresses for deposited XRL tokens are protected with a multi-sig wallet and physical access restrictions. Next, profit and asset withdrawals will only be possible from verified addresses that were specified during the registration. Furthermore, any attempt to change addresses or other account information will result in an additional KYC process requested from our support team.   PLATFORM LAUNCH - TIMELINE We plan for RIALTO.AI platform to welcome its first users by commencing the registration in the second week of March. This opening registration phase will provide a time frame during which RIALTO.AI will be able to review received applications and verify accounts. With this pre-registration process, we aim to allow users to access the platform at the same time, once it goes LIVE.  When the verification processes are concluded, we will enable full access and subsequently announce the start of the first official trading period on the platform.",False

""We are currently at 35% utilization regarding the trading time and 40% utilization regarding the suitable trading exchanges out there. We are aiming to double those numbers in 2018. The indication of return is still accurate given the dollar value of BTC at the time and assumed full utilization of the DAP.""   "" Once the platform is launched, there will no longer be dividend payments since every individual user will create profit by using RIALTO.AI algorithms and trading strategies with his proportionate share of DAP. The user or more precisely the XRL holder will manage his own funds that are part of RIALTO.AI DAP.

You are invited to follow the shared updates also through other social media channels. Please use only our official channels and do not use any third party links or share your data through other potentially similar sites.""  the platform will launch soon!!!  ""Given the increase in the USD value of the DAP, we do not see the possibility of exceeding the 75% utilization before Q3 2018. With the platform launch, users will be able to manage allocated funds freely e.g. withdraw or store unused funds.""  sooo when the platform launch 25% of the DAP can be withdraw from the XRL holders.  And if 75% is all they need, the additional value from the DAP gain (and the market making/bot/arbitrage income as well) will be distributed every time.   crunching some numbers:  as of today (05/01/2015) DAP value is more or less $40.000.000  25% of 40mil = $10.000.000  10.000.000 / 75.000.000 XRL = $ 0,133 per XRL can be withdrawed (about 30% of the actual token price)  right now the real market cap is $0.435 x 75.000.000 XRL = $32.686.500  i can say that the token is severely undervalued right now! just take a look @ TAAS !!!!",False

In some of the most developed countries, it will in the very near future be possible to legally raise equity, debt, IP rights etc., via tokenized crowdsale. All start-ups will do it, and as a result, thousands of new cryptocurrencies will appear.  This will bring a new need to the market to evolve towards new dimensions that will require replication of products and instruments from the traditional financial world. New products, new segments, new investment platforms are emerging as a result of the influx of the institutional money. For instance, professional crypto indices have already been introduced and RIALTO.AI was there to provide the service.   RIALTO.AI Position in the New Financial Dimension Primarily, RIALTO.AI is using automated trading for buying cryptocurrencies where they are cheaper and sell them where they are more expensive. We are providing liquidity and increasing market efficiency by narrowing price differences between exchanges. This is a straightforward concept that has been taken from the financial world and projected into the crypto industry by using a different technology — the blockchain technology.  But also, we are collecting data about trades and order books from multiple exchanges as well as all transactions for the top 42 cryptocurrencies on the Ethereum blockchain. We are stocking quantities of transactions, distribution data, data about the holding period of a regular user etc. because we also want to serve as the most reliable data provider.   The Role of RIALTO.AI in Partnership with Hedge Project RIALTO.AI was contacted for the data providing services by another Slovenian based project, the Hedge Project. They required 0,5Tb of monthly data which we were in a position to provide and this is how the partnership between two projects started. Meanwhile, Hedge has also partnered with Buchman Holding AG, a Lichtenstein based company that has been calculating and providing indexes exclusively for the traditional financial world. During our mutual research, we were surprised to realise that by then there were only manually calculated indices without a rulebook or an index committee, otherwise both mandatory in traditional financial industry.  The index introduces index-based products. For instance, when there are thousands of cryptocurrencies in the market, selections of various cryptocurrencies will be assembled inside various index-based baskets like “crypto Asia”, “crypto 30” etc. When these baskets need rebalancing, RIALTO.AI as a designated market maker will sell cryptocurrency that no longer belongs there and buy additional ones.  These are stable and above average margins of the financial world. To illustrate, in the traditional financial world, there are index ETFs in the amount of 8% of the total market capitalization. For the crypto industry, this would mean approximately $40 billion and if it is possible to earn a percentage only by rebalancing the baskets with cryptocurrencies, that is a position where any market maker is eager to be.",False

Q1: Hi Rialto team, as always, really appreciate your work and communication with the community. I hope your marketing trip is and will continue to be a success for both yourselves and the token holders. This question has been asked vaguely before but I'd like to get a definitive and thorough answer. What exchanges are you planning on listing on, if any? More specifically: Has Binance provided you with an ETA as to when XRL may be listed, if at all? Are there other talks with alternate exchanges? Are you considering the liquidity of the token at all as a priority? Can the XRL community assist you in any way to facilitate an exchange listing? Thanks, A long-tine XRL fan.  Thank you for submitting the first placed question in the October’s AMA. We are planning to include one more exchange listing in November. Binance requested 50 BTC for listing, which we think is too high given the additional profit they would receive from trading. HitBTC quoted lower fee but it is hardly justifiable given their trading volumes. There are many community voting initiatives on exchanges (e.g. Binance) where everybody can post a vote which may ease the listing process.   Q2: Question from Investitin.com: Will Rialto token holders benefit from the fees generate by the Rialto Exchange?  The platform to purchase cryptocurrencies through RIALTO.AI access point is planned for Q4 2018. Any fees generated from that source would be considered trading revenue as this would represent a market making between other exchanges and our access point.   Q3: How are you handling American investors who purchased via Live Coin or EtherDelta? Are there any issues with paying dividends to these holders?  Detailed distribution process will be announced in Q1 2018.   Q4: If you sell your business down the line, what happens to the token holders?  Proceeds are distributed proportionately to the token holders.   Q5: I would be interested in what happens to the dividends of the 10% of the tokens that is reserved for future investments/partners. Wouldn’t be the best investment to take the dividends from those 10% in reinvest it in the starting pool. So the pool would grow naturally over time. Or do buybacks?  If the tokens will still be in RIALTO.AI possession, this will be determined in a way that would be most beneficial to the token holders in the given circumstances.  Q6: I am investigating another crowd-funded arbitrage bot that is making considerable profits by trading between Korea and USA. I understand you need to do a lot of vetting before putting Rialto funds onto a new exchange, and we will be adding new exchanges for the bot slowly. My question is, do you hope or plan to be able to capitalize on the larger spreads between international exchanges with different units of fiat currency? sub-question: Where is your white paper? I wanted to make sure my question was not already addressed there, but I can't find anymore. That's a high quality document that convinced me to invest, new XRL buyers will want to read it also!  We are investigating options for cross border arbitrage involving fiat transfer. If money transfers after all costs would enable profitable trading, we would pursue such plan if legal frameworks could be met.   Q7: Smaller coins often have bigger spread, however a lower liquidity. Some smaller coins do get traded on most big exchanges, especially the ones that have been around the longest. When and under which criteria will you consider adding other trading pairs and what steps would you need to take to add another coin? We will be adding new pairs already in November. Major rebalancing of the portfolio will be required in order to be able to tap into those trade opportunities. Q8: I hold Rialto coin, do I need to register it? Or simply hold the coin in an exchange or wallet?  The coin can be safely kept in any wallet although registration will be necessary to receive any distribution of assets.  Q9: Walk us through how a typical 3 step arbitrage trade would work. Does it involve 3 different currencies? For example: [BTC to BCH] then [BCH to ETH] then [ETH back to BTC] ? Does all of this happen within the same exchange or does 1 or 2 of the trades happen on a different exchange?  What is described is a triangular arbitrage that would rarely happen on the same exchange, mostly between 2 exchanges. Trades involving a triangular arbitrage represent a smaller number of trades as cumulative fees are larger and the number of market events that enable sufficient profitability is lower.   Q10: Hi Rialto team! This question has been asked before but it wasn't given a clear response. Once and for all: Will profits from Single Point Access be distributed to XRL token holders?  Answered under the question 2.",False

In return for providing the data services, RIALTO.AI will receive 5% of Hedge (HDG) tokens that will be proportionally distributed to RIALTO (XRL) token holders, identified on a predetermined record date. To receive the HDG share, eligible token holders have to register their ETH addresses where they hold XRL. However, during the registration process, several repetitive questions emerged which we have decided to answer publicly.  1. Is it too late to buy more XRL now that the September 15th deadline has passed? XRL purchased after the record date of the snapshot of XRL holdings from the Ethereum public ledger (September 15, 2017) will not be taken into account in distributing HDG tokens.  2. I purchased XRL and also Hedge tokens in two separate transactions from the same address. Do I have to take any other action with regard to registering the XRLs at this time? No, just saving your address at www.hedge-crypto/participation.  3. Can I change the address of the registration? Can I receive HDG on other address than registered? The change of the address is not possible. You will receive HDG tokens to the address where you had the tokens on 15th of September and that you have registered on www.hedge-crypto.com.  4. Until when do I have to register the address where I hold XRL? Will the registration be possible after that date? You have to register the address until October 15, 2017. Any late registration will not be possible.  5. I hold my XRL tokens in my EtherDelta wallet rather than in MyEtherWallet. Would I still be eligible for a distribution of HDG tokens to XRL holders? If you own the private key to the address where you are holding XRL tokens than you can have them anywhere. Otherwise, you will not be able to access them.  6. When will the share of HDG tokens be distributed among XRL holders? The share of HDG tokens will be distributed on October 16, 2017.  7. Who will execute the distribution of HDG to XRL holders, RIALTO.AI or Hedge Project? The distribution will be executed by Hedge Project. This is why you have to register to the website of the Hedge Project.  8. Does anyone know if the percentage of tokens we receive is based on the total before any are burnt that aren’t sold? The percentage is calculated on the final token supply (after any are burnt).  September AMA Session on Reddit RIALTO.AI September AMA Session will stay unlocked for next six days. We are locking the thread on September 25.

For example, if the pool is $7.5 mil, then how long will it take for the entire $7.5 mil to be utilized in arbitrage?  Of course it could utilize only $500k a day so that would mean it takes 15 days, or 16.8x in a year, assuming 252 trading days per year. This is important to estimate the fair price of XRL.  So if the profit is 0.05% per trade, and the turnover is 16.8, then the profits that can be made in a year would be (1.005^16.8 - 1) x 7.5 mil, assuming profits are retained for 1 year.

I mean, i know its not a problem anywhere else, but here in US it is.  but apart from that minor hurdle, this should fly !

Just go to google and type in ""role of a market maker"" & you shall change your mindset very quickly. A market maker is of utter importance in sound, stable and liquid markets. It will help the crypto market grow and it will provide a more stable eco system. This will on its own turn attracht more high profile investors.  Let me show you a definition from the Financial Times.  Market makers are normally tasked with providing sufficient liquidity in order to reduce volatility in prices and maintain a 'fair and orderly market' for stocks.  For example, they will typically buy a stock when there are few or no other bidders in the market yet many investors wish to sell this security. By doing so, market makers can instill greater investor confidence in the financial markets and encourage these investors to send more orders to these trading centers.  This can create a virtuous cycle where these additional orders result in greater depth and liquidity which, in turn, attract even more investors and orders. Thus, market makers can play an important role in terms of building and maintaining efficient and highly liquid financial markets.  On the London Stock Exchange, market makers are called jobbers whereas on the New York Stock Exchange they are now referred to as designated market makers (formerly known as 'specialists').  To all the non believers; market makers play a very important role in the main financial stock & derivatives markets. Cryptomarkets and its volumes are growing at an exponential rate so market makers who ensure equal prices & enough liquidity on different global exchanges will be necessary. Like it or not, this is needed for the system to grow in a sustainable way.  So.. TL/DR  This is a project with a real life and clear scope. Furthermore, It will have immediate tangible impact on a short term basis whereas other ICO's and projects only show a promise of what they wish do deliver in the far fetched future. The team also consists of high profile individuals with strong academic and proven backgrounds in the scene where they wish to deliver. What's the use of the token? People who owns these will receive part of the made profit.  On a final note; this token actually also gives you a ""property right"" whereas other tokens in a lot of ICO's are considered to be useless and only a donation. Just a small quote from the white paper; XRL tokens represent a Proof of Membership in RIALTO.AI Digital Asset Pool. It grants ownership rights to RIALTO.AI proprietary software, data tools, algorithms, and other intellectual property. However, XRL token does not give a supporter any kind of share or equity in any of RIALTO.AI legal entities. Consequently, XRL does not qualify as a security. Legal nature of XRL token will be further described in “General Terms and Conditions.”  This isn't in any way investment advice, always do your own research and due dilligence (read the white paper). I just wanna say I researched this project and I like it cause the fundamentals are right (clear scope, real life tangible impact, the goal they wish to reach is also needed in common financial markets, no cash grabbing ICO -> only a small cap, high profile team).  Cheers!",False

The opportunities for Rialto.ai and its token holders are big. Market Making and arbitraging these markets, especially due to the inefficiencies across these crypto markets, should prove very profitable. Becoming one of the first &/or largest Market Makers in the crypto mkts is a huge advantage. As the crypto mkt capitalization continues to grow, so too will Rialto.ai.
