I was part of bounty and I receive some token, but now in my waves wallet .All info will be welcome .Thank you  And got info: Thanks for your inquiry. We will soon start be sending to stage 1 investors from the new Ethereum based Webcoin tokens. However, we won't be giving from the new tokens to the bounty participants because the Webcoin Waves tokens will continue to be used and traded in Waves DEX.  However, our recommendation, which we also gave to our community, is to keep the Webcoin Waves based tokens and not sell them for now. The reason why is because as you've probably seen Waves DEX is currently in beta. Even though, Waves DEX is the fastest exchange ever, it offers 0 visibility to assets including Webcoin. So when Waves DEX launches fully their exchange, we believe that more opportunities for increased volumes and higher Webcoin Waves price will arise.  Our newly designed crowdsale site for ICO Stage 2 is almost ready, so stay tuned with the project updates by following our official social media channels. And we look forward to seeing you participating in our upcoming crowdsale as well as the new Webcoin eth tokens will offer much larger exposure by being on many exchanges - this time confirmed as they will be shown on our crowdsale website.   Kind Regards,   Vladimir Ninov, MBA Co-founder & Marketing Director Webcoin  So than project still alive and team working on it. Good luck all",True

This limited offer is valid only until 25 September, 2017 so hurry up!  Video Explainer Crowdsale Website Whitepaper Alpha Version Case Study  ABOUT THE PROJECT  Webcoin creates the synergy between the digital marketing and cryptocurrency world. Webcoin is a new cryptocurrency asset based on the Waves Blockchain. Webcoin is used for peer-to-peer web and social media exchange services within the Webhits.io Ecosystem.  WEBHITS.IO HELPS:  - Social Media Influencers to generate revenue using their profiles. - Affiliate marketers to increase ROI. - Book authors to increase book sales & readership audience. - Small businesses and Digital Marketing agencies to receive more social media engagement on their and their clients websites, social media pages, posts, articles and blogs at the lowest possible price on the market. - Resellers & Freelancers to expand the number of web and social media services they offer.  Webhits.io mission and vision is to provide actual results and increase ROI, but also to lower the cost of service for website and social media engagement services globally.  OUR ECOSYSTEM SUGGESTS 2 COMPLETELY INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS FOR THE:  Digital Marketing world: Interest-based p2p network that guarantees ROI results cheaper than ever before. Cryptocurrency world: Alternative way for Webcoin mining which differs from any other type of cryptocurrency mining and proof of work.   Alpha Version: Try now  See how our full platform version will look like  See how our full Desktop Mining Application will look like  IMPORTANT: We are not presenting a concept! 45% of the development on the platform and the desktop mining application are already done.   Why choose Webcoin and the Webhits.io Ecosystem?  MARKETING VALUE  The experienced digital marketing, engineering and computer science specialists who  have come together to form Webhits.io have created an end-to-end solution to the problem of the high cost of digital marketing and advertising solutions for affiliate marketers, book authors, freelancers, startups, digital media agencies and businesses worldwide.  INCENTIVIZED SYSTEM  Unlike Bitcoin mining where high GPU and CPU are required for the machines to verify a transaction and get awarded for their work, Webcoin mining requires miners to visit advertisers’ websites and social media links submitted on the Webhits.io platform using our desktop application. Every verified visit of an advertiser’s website or completed social media action(eg. like, share, comment) will be awarded with a portion of a Webcoin.  ADVERTISERS  Advertisers won’t be required to mine, but can pay for website and social media services with 70+ altcoins and Stripe. List of supported altcoins is available here. To help advertisers increase ROI and reach wider audience Webhits.io will introduce packages which will unlock various engagement features and actions for over 300 social media platforms.  TRADABLE  Immediately after the completion of the Webcoin ICO round and the distribution of tokens, Webcoin will be listed on at least 1 Digital Cryptocurrency Exchange and available to buy, sell or trade against major cryptocurrency coins and fiat currencies.  AUTO MINING  Our powerful desktop application will allow Webcoin mining. The application will be lite in size. Webcoin mining won’t require any GPU and high CPU power. Watch how Webcoin mining works in our video explainer, the whitepaper and see the prototyping of the desktop mining application above.  WEBCOIN WALLET  Our wallet will allow the platform users to deposit funds, which will be converted into webcoins, using Bitcoin, various altcoins and fiat currencies. Users will also be able to withdraw their remaining webcoin balances.  WEBCOIN PRE-SALE & ICO  The price of 1 Webcoin Token during the Private sale(17 September - 25 September)Pre-sale and ICO rounds is equivalent to $1.
