The latest medium post outlines what has since happened.  https://medium.com/@ETERBASE/introducing-eterbase-a-s-ac749f70782  ""here were many important changes to the ETERBASE project in recent days and weeks. Firstly, due to publicized inquiries regarding the connections between the founders and Jeeves Group we have received an official resignation of all members of Jeeves Group from the board of ETERBASE AG in Liechtenstein.""  ""This unexpected resignation, however caused a major issue with the planned restructuring, administration capacity, official representation, compliance and banking partners to the degree that ETERBASE AG is not able to function as intended in this crucial moment.  ETERBASE a.s.  For this very reason we have decided to establish ETERBASE a.s. in Bratislava (Slovakia), where most of our development team and support staff was based to this point. We perceive Bratislava region as a future cyber-security hub with several high-tech companies already setting up major campuses to retain and hire top talent within the region.""  If eterbase started as a scam, maybe it is now being run with the hope of being legit. If it is...it's got a long road ahead to meet it's original promises.  I cannot see it coming back from this, it was a scam from the start so no work has actually been done other than smoke and mirrors to pull investors in and sell the tokens.

Eliminates the problem of lost tokens which happens during the transfer of ERC20 tokens to a contract (when people mistakenly use the instructions for sending tokens to a wallet). ERC223 allows users to send their tokens to either wallet or contract with the same function transfer, thereby eliminating the potential for confusion and lost tokens.  2. Allows developers to handle incoming token transactions and reject non-supported tokens. In this case, you won’t lose the tokens as it will be refunded back to you minus the Gas, something that is not possible with ERC20.  3. Energy efficiency— the transfer of ERC223 tokens to a contract is a one-step process rather than 2 step process (for ERC20), and this means two times less Gas and no extra blockchain bloating. This, as a result, also lowers the transaction fees one pays for the transfer of tokens.",False

There will be a referral bonus of 25% depending on what the referred party purchases. We figured we’d put together a little guide ahead of time so that everyone knows what to expect when October 10th arrives. The maximum amount of XBASE being issued is 1,000,000,000.  ‍After the end of the XBASE sale, there will be no more XBASE tokens issued, and the anticipated distribution of the token will be as follows:  37% company reserve  6% founders and core-team  5% core developers  2% advisors and partners  30% token sale to the public  2% bounty and airdrops  18% token swaps and pre-listings  Those who purchase the XBASE utility token in exchange for ETH or BTC will be able to do so at a rate of 0.015 USD, and early purchasers will enjoy special discounts. It’s also worth noting that purchasers must have an Ethereum wallet that supports the ERC-20 token standard for them to receive XBASE from ETERBASE.  Our schedule is obviously dependant on various factors, such as the hard cap being reached, or dates being extended due to unforeseen circumstances, but the sale will begin on October 10th and is scheduled to finish on December 11th.  Here at ETERBASE, we are looking to set a new gold standard for how a crypto exchange conducts its business, and in the spirit of this new standard, we aim to be as open and transparent during this process as we possibly can. We also require those who have chosen to work with us to do the same, and for that reason token purchasers will have to go through KYC process in order to be approved to purchase tokens. This will require an official form of ID, such as a passport.  We plan to provide an indicator on our website that will publicly display the total number of XBASE tokens sold at any given time, as well as the distribution of tokens between participating Ethereum accounts.  ETERBASE also plans to display the share of tokens allocated to shareholders of the company, as well as make information available on the Ethereum accounts used to store ETH during the XBASE sale, as well as their balances.  With all of that said, we are now looking forward to October the 10th, and we really hope that you choose to become a part of this process and join Europe’s Premier Digital Asset Exchange!",False

One of the ways they are doing this is through the acquisition of an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license, as well as putting a focus on regulatory compliance. The whitepaper outlines in detail its procedures regarding KYC, GDPR, and AML requirements.  The acquisition of an EMI license will mean that ETERBASE can clear EUR payments directly, without needing to avail of the services of a third party. With the acquisition, ETERBASE can deal in e-money, which is electronic money backed by fiat.  EMI license acquisition means that ETERBASE can operate in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) without banks. And just like a bank, they will be granted the ability to issue international bank account numbers (IBANs) to customers. The EMI license covers thirty European countries. SEPA currently serves over 500 million people and 20 million businesses.  What this means is that the ETERBASE cryptocurrency exchange would be held to the same regulatory standards, and provide the same services, as a bank. Customers would have access to a more integrated range of services on a single platform, and it would be easier to make transactions without worrying about legal, financial, and taxation issues. This is a recurring issue with present exchanges which are not regulated....",False

Though it'd be great if they decide to implement such feature.  Quote from: Manycoinslover on July 22, 2018, 01:47:51 AM What have you done to ensure that users' funds are safe?  A quote from their blog:  Quote Third-party custodian  Our clients' cold storage wallets are all stored with third-party custodians, meaning that there is an extra layer of security added to your funds.  Many investors in traditional markets insist on an unaffiliated third party separate from the exchange or financial advisor holding their funds.  Why should a digital asset exchange be any different?  Here at ETERBASE, we pride ourselves on being the first regulation-compliant European cryptocurrency exchange and providing cold storage with a third-party custodian is simply part of the service that separates us from the rest.  We also run external security audits, meaning that the technology keeping your funds safe is always going to be state of the art, and up to the job.
