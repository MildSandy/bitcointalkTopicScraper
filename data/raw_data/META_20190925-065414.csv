We've been getting a lot of good questions about Metabase both online and face to face - we decided to put together a short FAQ on some of our most frequently asked questions to help people get a quick overview of what Metabase is and what we're building.  What is Metabase?  A High Performance Blockchain and Smart Op-Codes Platform to Build Next Generation Businesses.   Who is Metabase for?  Entrepreneurs and developers who want to build solutions on a high performance and future-ready blockchain platform, that is multidimensional in design, and provides a comprehensive platform to build advanced and innovative businesses. These types of people generally want to build complex dapps, secure smart contract libraries, and monetize them via Smart OpCodes in a manner that is not available on existing blockchain platforms.   What can I do with Metabase, that I can’t already do with Ethereum?  You can get faster confirmation rates for your transactions with scalability features like chain splitting and priority pools. You will pay less to create transactions, even in case of steep increase in price with Monetary Policy changes: Store-of-Value vs Medium-of-Exchange. You will be able to deploy complex software functions as Smart OpCodes on a marketplace similar to Apple AppStore/Google PlayStore and monetise them while also enriching the developer ecosystem.   How is Metabase different from other “ blockchain 3.0” platforms such as EOS, and Cardano?  There are a few examples of blockchain 3.0 platforms that are respectable and worthy of use and experimentation. However, with Metabase we do not look at scalability as simply a linear function, but something that is multidimensional that requires a systems design approach in order to fully realise true scalability.  Metabase features an upgraded Ethereum style virtual machine. The Metabase virtual machine will have an augmented “Smart” OpCode space which will unleash a more vibrant ecosystem of programming on the blockchain, and will provide new ways to develop advanced Dapps and monetisation capabilities for blockchain developers.  We also incorporate a dynamic monetary policy system into our scalability solution to create a platform with stable transaction fees for when the platform adoption skyrockets.   Why does Scalability matter for Blockchain technology?  To be future ready for mass adoption, blockchain platforms need to have the ability to increase ithier transactional throughput as more apps, users, and miners join the network.  Scalability is the capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth. Second generation blockchains have a hard TPS limit which doesn’t increase with adoption. This severely limits the performance and the aspirations of the applications on the blockchain.   What is Chain-splitting?  Chain splitting is a method of horizontally scaling a blockchain to increase its transaction throughput.  As user adoption increases over time, increasing the incoming transactions, the blockchain systematically splits into multiple sub-chains and spreads the increased incoming transactions across these sub-chains. The Metabase chain splitting protocol does this to increase the transaction throughput, while maintaining the tenets of security and decentralisation.  For details refer to https://scalability.metabase.network.   What is a Ray Network?  The purpose of a Ray Network is to enable instant P2P payments off chain.  A Ray Network enables faster off-chain transactions similar to a Lightning Network on top of Bitcoin. The difference is that Lightning Network is built separately on top of the Bitcoin protocol, whereas on Metabase, the introduction of Ray Networks will come as an integrated part of the Metabase protocol with appropriate linkages between the on-chain protocol and the off-chain Ray Network.   What is a Spectrum Network?  The purpose of a Spectrum Network is to enable instant smart contract transactions off chain. Similar to the Ray Network, the Spectrum Network will come as integrated part of the Metabase protocol with appropriate linkages between the on-chain protocol and the off-chain Spectrum Network.   What is a Priority Pool?  A Priority Pool allows a transaction creator to prefer eg. speed-up a transaction confirmation by paying a premium on the transaction fees.  Want your transaction to confirm faster? Set it at a higher priority pool and pay a premium over the base transaction fees. Do you have time to wait for your transaction to confirm over the next few blocks? Set the Priority pool at the lowest priority and simply pay the base transaction fees.  We plan to have 8 priority pools although this can be altered by governance mechanics. Transaction fee per unit of instruction will be “x” in the lowest priority pool and 8x in the highest priority pool.   What is a Smart Op Code?  A Smart Opcode is a custom virtual machine instruction on the platform layer that encapsulates a complex operation. Typically, the number of OpCodes available on the platform layer are finite and all code written on the application layer in say Solidity compiles down to these OpCodes.  SmartOpcodes can be created, showcased, and monetised using the Metabase marketplace. This incentivises developers to build complex operations on the platform layer — simplifying app development on the higher application layer.  This helps evolve and expand the complexity of operations available on the platform layer itself. The enrichment of operations on the platform layer enable easier app development on the higher application layer.  Beyond the finite OpCodes available on a platform, Metabase will allow addition of custom OpCodes onto the platform layer. These are called Smart OpCodes — developers will be incentivised by the monetisation mechanics of Metabase to build and submit their Smart OpCodes for deployment on the platform.   What can I do with a Smart Op Code that I can’t do with a Smart Contract?  Smart OpCodes will enable developers to create and monetise useful programming constructs and make them available directly as encapsulated instruction units on Metabase. Additionally, other developers — instead of foraging GitHub for useful (and hopefully secure) smart contract code snippets — can directly use security vetted Smart OpCodes available on the platform.   Why does a blockchain need a Monetary policy?  Because blockchains are decentralised systems, actors on the system can’t be governed by a central party, instead they are incentivised to act in certain ways by the rules of the system. Typically, the incentive/disincentive rules are captured via tokens. For eg. incentives are rewarded with tokens and disincentives are punished via tokens.  Critical to incentivising the right behaviours are the quantitative metrics of the tokens — like total token count, token supply curve etc. — Hence a monetary policy for the tokens is critical to a blockchain design.   Will I have to learn a new programming language to use Metabase?  We are still working on how the Metabase smart contract programming language will perform— with considerations across functional programming languages & also procedural languages (think Solidity but less terse and more secure).  YES, this would involve learning a new language but our goal is to construct a language syntax similar to one of the popular programming languages so that developers can pick it up fast and build applications with a low learning curve.   What kinds of Dapps can I create with Metabase?  All kinds of Dapps! the limit is your imagination. Anything from sophisticated financial applications to digital asset marketplaces to games can be built on Metabase. Dapp development will benefit greatly from  Scalability & A Dual Currency Monetary Policy Which will enable performant usage of the dapps with sustainable transaction fees  Smart OpCodes Which will help standardise programming constructs across domains as OpCodes on the platform layer enabling easier app development on the application layer. For eg. building an ICO is easy if functions like a) Multi-Sig Wallet b) Transfer Calculation Functions are available directly as security-vetted OpCodes on the platform.   Is Metabase miner friendly?  With Metabase, our goal is to integrate as many users as possible to the mining process. We are aware of people with significant hardware investments and expertise of running a mining operation. On the other hand, we observe the increasing amount of individuals trying to be a part of the mining ecosystem without having any capability of managing hardware resources.  With Metabase, we aim to include both profiles by adopting a hybrid consensus model. PoW and dPoS has their own merits, covering different aspects of blockchain platforms security and inclusiveness. By integrating both, we hope to create a diverse/heterogeneous miner base for Metabase, providing opportunity for both profiles.   What kind of mining setup do I need for Metabase?  No surprises  for PoW GPU’s are the dominant mining equipment and miners software is already present for multiple platforms (Windows, Linux etc.) for dPoS participants will ‘stake’ tokens to elect block Signatories (block signers) and share the reward We hope that this is helpful to everyone curious about our project. Metabase is a project that attempts to overcome the technical, design, and usability barriers that stand in the way of blockchain technology adoption and we’ve design this platform with you: the developer and the entrepreneur in mind.

There are a few examples of blockchain 3.0 platforms that are respectable and worthy of use and experimentation. However, with Metabase we do not look at scalability as simply a linear function, but something that is multidimensional that requires a systems design approach in order to fully realise true scalability.  Metabase features an upgraded Ethereum style virtual machine. The Metabase virtual machine will have an augmented “Smart” OpCode space which will unleash a more vibrant ecosystem of programming on the blockchain, and will provide new ways to develop advanced Dapps and monetisation capabilities for blockchain developers.  We also incorporate a dynamic monetary policy system into our scalability solution to create a platform with stable transaction fees for when the platform adoption skyrockets.

Let me try and answer them in one post.  In order to serve the next generation of blockchain applications, Metabase has re-envisioned and re-designed core aspects of a blockchain platform - especially A new design for the blockchain data structure An innovative dual currency monetary policy A virtual machine featuring Smart OpCodes  The redesigned aspects are so fundamental that it’s structurally (if not logistically) hard to incorporate them into existing blockchain platforms.  Hence, Metabase will be a new blockchain platform designed from the ground-up with these core features to serve the next generation of blockchain applications.  Yes, very smart people have been working on the likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Neo etc. for a long time to solve these issues. The key difference is that they are limited by the initial design and structure of their platforms. We’re using their experiences and learnings to come up with a new platform that overcomes these limitations.  For example, Bitcoin limits the maximum block size, Ethereum limits the total amount of gas in a block. And because the number of users and transactions have skyrocketed, these first-generation platforms are facing major scalability issues.  With Metabase, we feature a new scalable design for the blockchain and a system that makes the necessary changes to increase its transaction throughput automatically when its limits are reached   By splitting the blockchain into multiple sub-chains and facilitating a parallel mining mechanism (i.e. the creation of multiple blocks at the same time), Metabase will adapt and scale its transaction processing capacity as adoption increases.  We will use a hybrid consensus (delegated Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work) in Metabase and we are very excited about the “SmartOpcode” concept that we are introducing for application development.  You can read more technical details about this in the ‘Protocol’ section of our whitepaper here: https://whitepaper.metabase.network/5/  The blockchain ecosystem is in such a nascent stage and the scaling problem so recent that we believe innovative thinking, thought clarity, and understanding the blockchain ecosystem are more relevant than “scaling experience”.  We believe the whitepaper: https://whitepaper.metabase.network/ (and the deep dives coming soon) are a reflection of those skills.

I’m going to outline below why we strongly believe Metabase is a next-generation blockchain that will have a big impact for developers around the world.  Metabase is a scalable and modular blockchain platform for developing decentralised applications and next-generation businesses. It features an advanced virtual machine at its core, expanded blockchain programming capabilities, and is designed with security and usability in mind.  Below are some important aspects that explain what Metabase does differently to other well-known blockchains as well as our reasoning for taking a divergent approach in a number of critical areas.   Scaling Blockchain Technology Bitcoin is fascinating. A completely decentralized system where financial actions that require a high level of trust, can be executed without trusting anybody. However, ‘trustless-ness’ comes with a price: hard limits on the number of transactions that can be processed in a specified time interval. Almost all of the well-known first generation blockchain systems have hard limits on the number of transactions.  Bitcoin limits the maximum block size, Ethereum limits the total amount of gas in a block, as examples. Due to the increased adoption of cryptocurrencies in recent years, the number of users and transactions have skyrocketed, testing the limits of first-generation blockchain systems.  ‘Scaling,’ as it’s called, is the capability to serve the users of the system with similar quality even when the number of users increases. With Metabase, when its limits get reached, we aim to create a system that makes the necessary changes to increase its transaction throughput automatically.  By splitting the blockchain into multiple sub-chains and facilitating a parallel mining mechanism (i.e., the creation of multiple blocks at the same time), Metabase will adapt and scale its transaction processing capacity as adoption increases.   Store-of-Value vs Medium-of-Exchange Tokens The meteoric rise of cryptocurrencies has had some unwanted and unexpected side effects for users such as rising rates and increased transaction fees. Using cryptocurrencies has become expensive as their popularity has grown. What’s more, many individuals buy and HODL cryptocurrencies with the expectation of future financial gains, using it as a store-of-value. However, what makes a currency lucrative as a store-of-value makes it less lucrative as a medium-of-exchange.  Metabase will overcome this problem by having two currencies in the system: a store-of-value coin and medium-of-exchange coin. Store-of-value coins are limited in supply, and mining rewards decrease in time similar to Bitcoin. The total amount of medium-of-exchange coins, however, increase respective to store-of-value coins and are therefore inflationary. This approach will keep the transaction costs low due to the circulation of medium-of-exchange coins.   Evolution of Smart Contracts Ethereum is a widely known cryptocurrency system which advanced blockchains beyond Bitcoin by introducing the concept of ‘smart contracts’ and thus instantly creating the first blockchain-based decentralized application platform. Simply put, smart contracts are programs that run on a blockchain platform. Like all other computer programs, they are made of instructions or ’opcodes,’ waiting to be interpreted by the actual machine.  Nowadays, smart contracts are encountered mostly in the form of a ‘token’ which is about to be sold in an ICO. As expected, smart contracts become the primary target for malicious actors, due to their control over funds.  Exploiting smart contract flaws has become very lucrative financially.  With Metabase, we introduce the concept of Smart OpCodes, the ability to define an extended instruction that encapsulates a complex operation. Smart OpCodes can be used for enhancing security, like introducing a single instruction to validate a cryptographic signature. However, a more critical application of this concept is the creation of a marketplace for developers.  Developers will be able to create libraries or small utility applications, define it as a Smart OpCode and submit it to the Metabase marketplace. By taking this approach, we expect to see the first glimpses of highly sophisticated decentralized applications due to the ability to use packaged and verified Smart OpCodes from the marketplace.   Come change the game with us At Intrepid Ventures, we are determined to build next-generation products and services that are accessible and easy to use.  From the beginning, our team understood that first generation blockchains have several limitations that are preventing their widespread use and adoption. So, instead of only focusing on scalability, like most other projects, Metabase takes a multidimensional approach. It is this multifaceted approach “scalability + real-world inspired monetary policy + smart OpCodes” that makes Metabase a next-generation blockchain platform and sets it apart from other projects.  Metabase introduces a dual-currency model which overcomes the high transaction fee problem and opens up a marketplace for developers, ultimately, by facilitating a financial incentive for developers.  Metabase has the potential to become the go-to platform for creating powerful applications that use multiple building blocks from the marketplace.
