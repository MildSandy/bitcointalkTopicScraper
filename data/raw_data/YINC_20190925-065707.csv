Website | About YINC (Commercial Whitepaper) | Technical Whitepaper | Telegram | Twitter | Facebook | YouTube | Instagram  Choosing between vendors for a job, whether large or small, is never fun.  YINC (which stands for “You’re IN Control”) is creating a patent-pending solution that connects consumers with service providers in a way that makes the process of choosing between them easier, more secure, faster and cheaper than ever before.  YINC’s mission is to revolutionize the way consumers search, choose and pay contractors by leveraging the nascent blockchain technology. We believe that consumer satisfaction with service provider platforms is closely related to rating integrity, financial security, and a historical and significant amount of relevant information.  YINC is building its blockchain powered services platform using the Ethereum blockchain. YINC is creating a YINC utility token designed for the tracking of transactions, interactions, and reviews. It allows for the payment of services as well as offers incentives for review participation while developing a thriving, self-sustaining ecosystem between service providers and consumers.    WHAT IS YINC?  YINC is the most simple, cost-effective and reliable way to hire service providers using cryptocurrency and Blockchain technology.  System Benefits  - Competetive Pricing: Vendors bid against each other, giving the consumer the most competitive pricing.  - Tamper-Proof Reviews: Reviews are tied to completed and paid for jobs, and stored on the blockchain.  - Vendor Meritocracy: Vendor visibility is based on a quality of work, not an ability to manipulate the system.  - YINC Listory: Each completed job is tied to the blockchain, creating a history of work for properties.  Token Benefits  - Pay for Services: YINC Tokens enable peer-to-peer payment between consumers and vendors secured through a Smart Escrow service.  - Discounts on Service: Consumers and vendors can get back 50% or more of YINC's vendor fee on the job by holding and using YINC tokens.    - Downside Protection on Token Price: YINC will guarantee downside protection in the form of a value floor of the token price at the time of ICO.    - Rewards for Reviews: YINC Tokens reward users for providing reviews upon completing a transaction.    - Rewards for References: Tokens reward users for becoming direct Referencers for vendors they previously hired.     ---------------------------------  ADDITIONAL FIELDS AND PARTNERSHIPS  The YINC platform doesn't just handle services for the consumer market, it also handles services for all kinds of properties, including commercial, residential and nursing homes.  The system was strategically designed alongside YINC's partners, who own and manage multi-billion dollar real estate portfolios in the US and abroad. These partners have thousands of tenants and have already committed to using the platform for all of their properties.  Added Features for Commercial Property Management  - For Single or Multi-Property Firms: Strategically designed for firms that use systems like Yardi and Appfolio, as well as those who don't use any system at all.   - In-House & Preferred Vendors: Property owners will have the added ability to use YINC for jobs that their own in-house or preferred vendors can handle.    - Better Tenant Customer Service: Tenants can make their service requests directly to the managers on the system, and managers can bid out the job on the same platform.  YINC has already procured commitments from over a 30 commercial real estate companies (over $10B AUM) to use our platform exclusively when we go live.

How does YINC prevent vendors from posting fake reviews on the Blockchain? A. Unlike most platforms, on YINC, consumers do not have the ability to choose which vendors are invited to bid, and YINC does not offer vendors paid placement, so vendors cannot simply hire themselves or pay third parties to hire them and leave fake reviews. YINC sends out each job lead to a limited amount of vendors based on location, number of leads they’ve received, response time, reviews, etc.  In addition to that, we have many explanatory videos on our webpage, some of them also talk about this exact same issue.",False

They get hyped up for weeks, and then they launch and clog up the Ethereum network for days, Coinbase goes down for a while, and then “investors” see the new tokens lose most of their “value”. This ITO is going to be different. We don't use Ethereum, we use Waves. And we reward The Github Devs. As you know, Microsoft officially announced the deal: it is buying GitHub for $7.5 billion in an all-stock deal. At 28 Millions Developers worldwide, this deal equals to $267.85 per dev. Your data, your repositories, your time. So this is why we believe you deserve this. The IGT ITO transparently offers investors no value, so there will be no expectation of gains. No gains means few investors, few investors means few transactions, and few transactions means no Waves network lag.
