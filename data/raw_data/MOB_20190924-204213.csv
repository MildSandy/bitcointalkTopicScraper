Aren't you excited??"" - Aris Rome  ""ive been excited about Mobiuz for 2 years already, since I first started it, 2 years ago.  ICO happening? With or without the ICO, we're still gonna be a giant global phenomena. I can promise you that.  But am I excited, really? To be honest, I am honestly excited for the Participants of our Mobiuz ICO....... PARTICIPANTS.  Mobiuz will greatly be empowered if we experience a successful ICO, of course, but from day 1, I've engineered the Mobiuz ICO, and Mobitaels, at 51.25% - so that Mobitaels will be a true public crypto, in the hands and control of the public - not Mobiuz.  Mobiuz is excited to grow this as a truly decentralized, parallel economy, where we will be the first group on Earth to bring blockchain and crypto to the public, in the public's full control and influence.  Mobiuz will be the next big thing, because like AirBNB, Uber, etc, it will be about the public EARNING, not SPENDING.  All other blockchain and crypto activities so far has been intra-company, supply-chain, back-end, fintech, and PURELY SPECULATIVE - like bitcoin or ethereum, where you have to SPEND money to buy some coins and hope that the value will rise.  兩obiuz and 兩obitaels is different. It will be about tens, or hundreds of thousands of Cabbies worldwide, earning 兩OBs, and being able to spend it anywhere a credit or debit card is accepted - even paying bills, or for a restaurant, or movie tickets.  And Cabbies is only the first wave of the 兩obitaels critical mass. Don't forget about the 兩obiBassadors, whom will be earning 兩OBs. And the Passengers that will earn 兩OBs for participating.  EVERYONE will be earning 兩OBs in one way or another, and since day 1 we've already planned for everyone to be able to spend 兩OBs in everyday life.  The only currency accepted as payment in the ENTIRE 兩obiuz ecosystem will be purely only 兩obitaels (MOBs).  Am I excited? Yes, I have been since 2 years.  Am I excited for the ICO? Yes, I definitely am, especially for our early adopters.  Am I excited to bring to the world the world's first crypto parallel economy? Abso-fucking-lutely.  Can we do it? Just look at our team roster, and the achievements we've made in barely 6-8 months. We're not biz noobs, and we only have 3 Advisors. 1 of our permstaff stepped down to become an Advisor, while 2 of our Advisors have stepped up to become permstaff.  I literally just typed that all out. But these are my true feelings about the Mobiuz ICO.  Much love.  - Kairos.""",False

Solving a Real, Current, ~$500’B per year global PANDEMIC   Up to 60% of every ad dollar falls prey to ad-fraud, blackboxes, middlemen, and assorted wastages.”, “Ad fraud has become the world’s #2 criminal enterprise, far surpassing traditional criminal activities.   – sentiment and statistics shared by the likes of Marc Pritchard (CMO of P&G, world’s largest ad spender, in a Forbes article, and in conferences), and established and reputable research and analysis firms.  At a nearly $1’T per annum industry, and growing, that means between $400’B to $600’B per year is wasted.  Even Facebook, and Google, have been proven several times to be involved in the cheating and defrauding of advertising clientele. Regularly! http://www.marketing-interactive.com/facebook-admits-to-270-million-fake-and-duplicate-accounts/  This is the exact pain point that 兩obiuz is tackling.  Through the use of cutting edge and advanced Facial Recognition AI, Big Data, unique business and P2P processes, and empowered by the security, safety, reliability, and scalability of Blockchain 2.0+ technologies, 兩obiuz will be one of the very few, if not the first company globally to be able to truly claim a Fraud-Free environment for Advertisers.  It also helps that Advertising has always, and is expected, to grow at a healthy pace: http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/entertainment-media/outlook.html  Token Stats: Token type: ERC20 Total supply: 88.8'B # of MOBs in Pre-ICO: 5.55'B (6.25%) # of MOBs in ICO 39.96'B (45%) USD Value of MOBs in Pre ICO + ICO: USD $161.8'M 1x MOB price post-ICO: USD $0.003987 Combined Total Value of MOBs post-ICO: USD $354.13M Total Allotted to Founding Members: 15% Total in 兩obiuz Reserve: 33.75%     2. Where are we? (progress)  兩obiuz is already in pre-alpha before our ICO, is already seed-funded, has a full working team, and clients and investors.  Through our #First500 Recruitment Campaign which commenced last October 2017, 兩obiuz has already exceeded its initial target of recruiting 500 drivers, and has continued to surpass more than 16,000 partner sign-ups. All these with very limited resources, nearly $0 marketing budget and relatively small team size! Just imagine what 兩obiuz can accomplish with your support.  The demand is real. The public wants 兩obiuz.

(i literally spoke to the ex managing director of siemens about creating the first Smart Contracts blockchain before Ethereum was ever announced, and have been involved in Blockchain since 2010-ish. suffice it to say, i bought into Ethereum at genesis. Additionally, one of our mentors and a close friend of mine ""Jarrod Luo"", also actually created the first Smart Contracts blockchain before Ethereum, but suffered business setbacks since A- he didnt run an ICO, B- legal struggles. Jarrod also was the man that brought the first Bitcoin ATMs in the whole of Asia, period. Jarrod has been with Mobiuz since the very beginning.)  Did you know, that Bitcoin is simply only the first application built on blockchain technology? If you don't, you should, because you're on bitcointalk.org forum.  So what makes Bitcoin so very special? Because it uses Blockchain tech - that very same Blockchain, or Distributed Ledger Tech that allows for independent, trustless, accurate, reliable, immutable records and information.  Question: If I were a restaurant and I paid $1'M to Google or Facebook to advertise me, how would I ever know that I'm not being cheated?  Answer: I wouldn't. And the probabilities are, I HAVE been cheated. Check out the Whitepaper (https://mobiuz.com/resources/Mobiuz_Whitepaper.pdf) or our video (https://youtube.com/watch?v=N_V3_GJDS6Y) and you can see how many scandals even good old Facebook and Google have been involved in, sued for, and lost court cases over, ad-fraud. And this is just the TIP of the iceberg.  A- How would you know that ""John Smith"" didn't just dump all of your flyers into the trash despite you paying him $1000 per day to distribute your restaurant ad? You wouldn't.  B- How would you know that ""XYZ Corp"" didn't just spam your ads on undesirable websites such as hate, gore, porno, snuff, or spam websites, instead of legitimate websites? You wouldn't.  C- How would you know that hackers didnt just alter your video and image files into THEIR ads, so instead of your ads showing up, its THEIR ads showing up? You wouldn't.  D- How would you know that your own blogging website is not showing ads that Advertisers paid for but instead was hacked and other Ads showed up? You wouldn't.  E- How would you know that people are even SEEING your ads, and if its worth to pay for ""1 Million impressions"", when most people just walk past and refuse your flyer, or billboard, or worse, they're invisible pop-ups, pop-unders, or invisible ads, or blocked by ad-blockers? You wouldn't.  F- How would you know that instead of being distributed to within a 10km radius so that only nearby people would come to your restaurant, but instead having your ads distributed 300km away where there is no hope that your Ads will mean anything to them, cuz they're simply too far away? You wouldn't.  G- How would you know that your ads are being distributed at the RIGHT TIME for you restaurant, instead of nightcrawlers at 1-3 am, whom will NEVER have time to visit your restaurant's opening hours? You wouldn't.   We can give you a whole day's list worth of Ad-Fraud scams worldwide, and we'd still need a whole 'nother month to finish the list.  But I hope I've given you some food for thought, because these, and many more, are EXACTLY the things that Mobiuz are solving. Read the whitepaper - you will broaden your horizons about what Mobiuz really is, in this $600'B per year pandemic, in a nearly $1'T industry.  Through the use of Biometics, AI, Crypto, and DLTs such as Blockchain (Mobiuz uses multiple, parallel DLTs), it will be a one-way street. Mobiuz can't cheat the Advertisers, The Advertisers can't cheat Mobiuz, and Hackers can't cheat either of them.  Accurate, reliable, authentic, immutable and immortal records, transactions, and statistics, is what Blockchain/ DLT brings to this Industry, and it is through Mobiuz that we empower everyone to enjoy this new power.  DON'T ""pass this"". Read the whitepaper, or ask first. We do understand this is completely freaking new; it's never been available on the planet before. Mobiuz literally are #disruptors. <3  With love, Kairos. <3",False
