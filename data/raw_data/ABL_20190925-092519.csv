Project title Major subject of decentralization AIRBLOC's major subject of decentralization How AiIRBLOC protocol different itself Basic attention token User Attention & ad exposure personal data The subject of decentralization is different.   BAT uses browsers to decentralize personal interests data and its corresponding Ad Exposure, while AIRBLOC is decentralizing anonymized personal data.  AIRBLOC does not operate an independent browser nor advertisement placements. Therefore, AIRBLOC‚Äôs project yields no relation to personal interests. AdEx ad exposure personal data The subject of decentralization is different.  AdEx attempts to decentralize the whole process of Ad Exposure with decentralized advertisement placement, from the ad publisher to the advertiser. But such attempt is unrealistic since it requires having large set of advertisement placements or a very efficient use of the advertisement placements via machine learning or AI.  AIRBLOC basically aims anonymized personal data for decentralization, not advertisement placement transactions.  AIRBLOC first decentralizes anonymized personal data to create data market, and have other advertising platforms participate in this market voluntarily by purchasing personal data for effective advertisement. Naturally, decentralization of the ad market is formed. Datum Personal data Personal data AIRBLOC allows Apps to engage in surrogate data sales via DAuth & SDKs.  Also, with the launch of Data Marketplace can be added to the existing Airbridge dashboard and instantly commercialized. Ocean Protocol Any data or Data set Personal data AIRBLOC does not deal general data such as the acquisition and trading of schema data for the data market and development of AI like Ocean Protocol.  In particular, Users always become a primary data producers on AIRBLOC, not large organizations or government data sets.

To get ABL tokens, you must:     Buy at the exchange     Receive reward from node     Convert from AIR In this sense, the procedure of AIR issuance is rather important. And for this AIRBLOC introduces a concept of AIR pool. AIR pool will be a dynamic account, from which rewards will be given as per process described above. What is important is to understand how it is filled in the first place:     10% of total supply of ABL goes to AIR pool to ensure liquidity.     It is filled with trading fees, data usage rights fees paid by refineries and penalties for misbehavior. Thus we see that issue of AIR is an ongoing process. But in order to hinder potential price dumps by AIR holders, conversion of AIR to ABL per hour is limited to 0.1% of AIR generated by the network.  Team Roi Nam is the CEO and co-founder. He also served as CEO of ab180 (parent company) for two years.  He was engaged in web development for 1.5 years, as well as CSO for 1 year. Wonkyung Lyu is the Dev Team Lead and co-founder. He is also co-founder in ab180. Hunjae Jung serves as the project‚Äôs Back-end Part Lead and co-founder  and was also part of the founding team at ab180. Naeun Kim, Design Team Leader, rounds out the founding team at AIRBLOC. The broader team is filled with developers and business professionals that are associated with ab180. The advisory team includes JH Kim, who is also part of the ICON Foundation. He has almost 20 years of experience in the field of security, has experience in developing patented applications, such as the FCI protocol, has the CISA qualification, and is currently the director of Theloop. Jason Han, who serves General Director of Kakao Blockchain, is also on the advisory team. He has served co-chairman and technical director of FuturePlay Tech VC. Serial entrepreneur  Sungjae Hwang is also an adviser to the project. He is a partner of Futureplay, the initial high-speed accelerator in South Korea and the CEO of FoundationX. Prior to these companies, he founded several start-ups. He worked as the chief product officer in Fluenty Inc. and AI chatbot startup, which was acquired by Samsung Electronics in 2017. Louis Jinhwa Kim, who previously served as Director of the Tide Institute Institute of Finance and Delegate of the Republic of Korea to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (2012), is also on the team.  Partners include:     GS SHOP, a leading online retail platform in Korea.     Allbit, a new type of crypto exchange gateway. .     FoundationX, one of the growing funds and accelerators of venture capital in Korea.     VEAT, which is one of the leading law firms in Korea specializing in startup advisory services.     ORANGEFARM, which is focused on incubating promising startups in Korea. ab180, the parent company AIRBLOC, was incubated in ORANGEFARM as early as 2017.     SENTIENCE, one of the leading Korean research companies,.     Deblock, an accelerator in Korea which is jointly invested by ICON Foundation & Ad4th Insight, a specialized block-chain company.     Battle Entertainment, a leading comic platform in Korea, serving more than a million customers.     Humanscape, a the leading medical platform for customer relationship management in Korea, which helps hospitals monitor the condition of patients after surgery and provide follow-up services to patients.     Rainist, a leading Korean software company which provides recommendations for financial products based on lifestyle patterns.     Fysical, the world‚Äôs first full-fledged, fully functional, decentralized market for location data.     Indorse, a decentralized social network for professionals.  Verdict A large team with extensive experience in the sector looks solid. The guys were able to attract consultants in areas where there are obvious gaps, as well as partners represented by ICON.  Risks     Based on token sale ROI statistic, marketplaces and advertising related projects do not have a good performance in the short term. -1     Customer attraction could face challenges. However, to offset this, the platform has developed a proprietary AirBloc Protocol SDK (software development kit) that has already been stress tested by 60 million devices in Korea. The SDK Protocol functions like a layer that can be easily implemented on top of apps, allowing acquisition of customers. -0.5     Platform implementation and scaling could face difficulties, as Ethereum is not suitable for this. Therefore, AIRBLOC uses the hybrid-chain architecture that uses Ethereum and ICON. Data validation and the process will be done through Aero Network, which will use ICON. Such a combination seems promising; however, without a working MVP (planned to be in Q3 2018) it is hard to judge on its performance. -1     There are ptential regulatory barriers in relation to private data protection laws, although the team looks prepared to handle it. -0.5     I do not like the fact that private sale participants get 45%, even though 30% of 45% will be locked for 3 months as their overall part in the token distribution is rather high. -2     The project involves a complex inflation model, which involves two tokens. -1  Growth Potential     Mother company ab108 is already successful in advertising market analysis in Korea. +2     Whitepaper and documentation are pretty good. +1     The team is above average with many strong developers. +2     A lot of strong partnerships like ICON and GS shop, Coinplug as well as several VCs. +2     Token metrics and distribution are in a good range with a hard cap of 20,000 ETH (around $12 million). +2     Strong token use case. +1     A good growth strategy for user attraction. +1     Hype is there (Telegram has 10,000+ members and lots of people are on the whitelist). +2  Disposition This is definitely a project to look for. The team has all the necessary experience and knowledge for a successful execution. They leverage on their mother company ab108 and numerous partnerships. They have some obstacles in their way, but they have a clear plan how to overcome them. AIRBLOC receives 7 of 10.

Problems in the data industry  USERS Data Privacy Infringed The Data market is dominantly controlled by centralized services that aggregate data and sell them to other enterprises to generate huge revenues. Individuals do not know how their data is collected, priced and sold. Not Rewarded Fairly Neither fair rewards nor data ownership is granted to individuals, who are the original data source.  APPS Illegal Data Monetization Because there are no existing markets for apps to sell personal data, apps rely on the sales of data through illegal means. This results in a massive infringement of personal privacy as individuals do not know how their data is collected, priced and sold.  DATA CONSUMERS Rising Advertising Costs Advertising costs have increased because the control of data lies with centralized data brokers. This is a problem for small and medium enterprises as they find it hard to have access to high quality data in low quantities.   Missing Marketplace Today, there are no existing data marketplaces that allow enterprises to purchase high quality and insightful data at reasonable prices to run effective and targeted campaigns. Data consumers / advertisers needs more direct and granular data ‚Äì beyond simple pieces of info like gender, browsing history and residence.   AIRBLOC'S FEATURES DAuth Protocol DAuth is an approval system that seeks permission from users to allow apps to monetize their data on their behalf. Collected data include installed apps list, location data, app usage time, browsing history, apps store transaction history, etc. Through DAuth, users will be able to earn from the monetization process. The distribution of rewards is guaranteed by smart contracts.  Data Campaigns Aside from personal data collected by the Airbloc App and DAuth, enterprises can also initiate data campaigns to collect more granular and direct data about a user. Examples of such data include ‚ÄúAlice likes cats, and is intending to purchase a cat.‚Äù Although such inferred data can be bought from existing marketplaces, they are not conclusive of an individual‚Äôs real preference, furthermore to even obtain such data would be highly expensive. No such direct data is available today in any data marketplace.  Data Marketplace Personal data collected will be sold on the Airbloc Data Marketplace and enterprises would be able to buy these data to conduct Targeted advertising.   ABL Token Enterprises will purchase data through ABL tokens, users and apps are rewarded with ABL tokens for supplying data to the marketplace.

If an App has 30 million users, and the App's developers decides to install the Airbloc SDK, 30 million users will immediately be able to monetize their data and supply data to the Airbloc Data Marketplace.  youtube | website | whitepaper | techpaper | telegram | reddit | blog",False
