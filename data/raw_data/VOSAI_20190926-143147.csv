The goal of VOSAI is to build protocols, systems, and tools to provide an artificial general intelligence applicable to any domain. Founded in 2018 by Daniel Rodriquez and Jorge Puignau, we are overseeing the R&D of VOSAI. We intend to implement VOSAI based on open-source technologies and systems. VOSAI, Inc. will be established as the long-term governance body for the VOSAI technology. VOSAI will seek to grow an open ecosystem for decentralized processing power, while giving developers an open and sustainable platform to build, enhance and monetize. VOSAI has a list of clients in queue, with Animusoft first in line to leverage the technology for its customers in the construction and farming industries, which has developed and validated a market for this technology over the last few years.  Prior to founding VOSAI, we founded Animusoft Corporation in 2012 with the intent of offering quality software products and services. Animusoft is a group of seasoned computer scientists, artists and engineers, with whom we will contract for development and maintenance services related to VOSAI technology. VOSAI follows securities law with compliance to Reg D 506c and Reg S. For compliance we have included a SAFT as part of the offering as well as a PPM with supporting whitepapers.      Industries / Use Case Summary  Agriculture In a world that’s ever growing in population, the demands on our food production are strained. Diseases, illnesses, infections and wasteful methods are all problems farmers face. VOSAI aids them in detecting these issues ahead of time by consuming real world data (e.g. images) of farms and distilling them down to actionable results (e.g. trees infected with disease). Being able to train VOSAI to look for disease in the folio of fruit bearing plants like soy or corn or apples, could help farmers save millions of pounds of produce that would otherwise be lost due to illness. Think about the impact of this technology on a global scale, with farmers increasing their output by as much as 25%, how does that affect world hunger? How does that affect nations that rely on agriculture for their GDP? The impact would be exponential. Construction It’s been estimated that rework – or work that needs to be torn down and redone during a build – accounts for 5% of the total budget of a construction project. If the construction industry is forecasted to grow to $10 trillion by 2020, that’s hundreds of billions of dollars of wasted materials due to rework, we’re talking about precious resources like water, lumber, and metal. Imagine if general contractors could send a rover (treaded robot) to autonomously navigate the jobsite after workers have left for the day, capture the installation progress, feed the data to VOSAI which would then measure and report the variances of what’s been built compared to the virtual designs, and notify the superintendent of the issues. Now the project team can catch and correct the problems within 24 hours, instead of going a week or a month building something incorrectly and then having to tear it down and build it again.

I am not quite sure what you are asking there? Are you asking what is the AGI doing on our blockchain? Or where we are with development of the technology?  Thanks again for the feedback!  -dR,False

Presale for accredited investors worldwide through a SAFT @ $0.75 / token with pro-rata royalties on revenues 2. Upon network launch (sometime after 12 months from presale) tokens are disbursed to Presale investors 3. 215M tokens available during presale 4. 215M tokens available for future sales (e.g. Public ICO)  There is nothing there that says 9 months or that we would be buying back tokens from investors. We intend to make these tokens freely exchangeable in the future on available exchanges as the law permits at the time of release.  Hope this clears things up. If you did see something somewhere on our website please do send a screen shot or link so that it can be adjusted accordingly.  I can say that there are many sites that have picked up our ICO and many of them have inaccurate information. Make sure to use https://vos.ai as your primary source of information.,False
