From the time we have DEX exchanges (Etherdelta, Forkdelta, Edaex, Tokenstore, and many others), there is a possibility for everybody to list token even a fake one like Bitcoin with ticker BTC.  This will be not an official listing and you will be able to find such a token in the ""other"" tab on the exchange. The 'other' tab is the place where all unofficial tokens are listed.  The only way for Payera or any other project is to reach out to exchange staff and try to delist but this is only possible when there is a malicious attempt or abuse proved (not sure about this).

We are exited and happy, because you gave us the chance to make our vision become reality.  Nevertheless we are a young company company and we still have to learn our lessons with each day that passes.  Right now we are restructuring our team, because we think that this is the only way to guarantee the best outcome.  In the same move we are also working on a modified Smartcontract, wich will fit our and of course our future costumers needs.  This is not the time to take shortcuts. The structure we are building right now will be the fundament of our whole platform.  This is the reason for the delayed token-distribution. We are sorry for your inconvenience and hope that you will continue to support us.  At the moment we can't name you a specific date when the distribution will be completely performed. We are confident that we will manage it in the near future.  We are doing our best to create something unique and are confident that the result will be gamechanging.

Why ETH? There are so many new better, faster and cheaper solutions. Why not use some blockchain from 4th gen?

With your support we were able to achieve a sufficient amount in the pre-sale phases. 💪😍👍  Some very pleasant updates have been decided in the process of the pre-sale regarding the token price and the selling time.  As mentioned in the FAQs on our website www.PAYERA.io, we have used the pre-sale phases for internal statistics. This made it possible for us to take a number of important decisions that will be of great benefit to the PAYERA project and all investors. 🎉  The primary factor for the decision is that at the International Blockchain Event in London our team brought in new offers which make it possible to realise the project faster and cheaper.  The second factor for the decision is the currently highly volatile market situation of the crypto currencies. ⚠️ Since the majority of the team comes from the crypto scene and receives an enormous amount of input, we recalculated the token price based on the available knowledge and came to the following results:  ICO Price:                $ 0.02 USD Softcap:                   $ 5 million USD Hardcap:                 $ 21 million USD  Our ICO is live! Don't miss the chance to get yourself some PERA-Tokens! 💰💰💰  ❗️❗️IMPORTANT ❗️❗️ All investors who bought PERA Tokens at the old price will of course be credited with the differential amount.
