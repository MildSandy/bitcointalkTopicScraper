Let me start by giving you a quick update on our roadmap. We launched BCIO Token trading last month. We also solved some latency issues we had with the platform. If you have not visited the platform for a while please come back and check it out, you’ll see some significant improvements! It is now a nice looking and efficient platform for trading. We also launched a HODL program for BCIO Token holders. You can earn 60% more tokens by holding the tokens for a year. That’s quite an incentive for BCIO Token holders!  Also on the price, I know a number of you have questions about what the Token price is or should be. In my view, it is really based on the fact that as a utity token the price is trongly correlated to the number of users and the volume of trading on the platform. It is quite normal that, at this stage, when we are just launching and acquiring new customers, sometimes hundreads of customers in a single day are signing up to the platform ; It is quite normal that this ramp up of the number of customers takes some time. When the number of customers will reach a critical mass, then we’ll see an increase in the value of the token, quite logically. Again, it is quite normal that the price is now in line with the relatively small number of users on the platform but it is increasing rapidely. That’s what I can say at this point.  What’s next for us? We’re working on a new API to facilitate the integration of trading bots on the platform. That will increase the liquidity on the platform, that’s good for all the users. We’re also adding new tokens and pairs on the platform in the next few weeks. That’s good for customer’s intake. As a result, we’ll launch a marketing campaign to let the world know about our progress.  Thanks again for your support and talk to you soon!""

For those of you who don’t know me, I’m also the founder of Paymium.com. The same team that is building Blockchain.io has built Paymium.com. This is the first Bitcoin exchange in the world starting in 2011. So we have a lot of very experienced and knowledgeable people focused on security and optimal implementation of blockchain’s applications.   That being said, I want to thank you for your patience regarding the release of the BCIO Token. It was planned two weeks ago and now I am happy to say that in the next four weeks, we will be able to release the Token. Again, thanks for your patience.   In the meantime, we launched publicly Blockchain.io platform in mid-January, so it was less than 2 months ago. We want to make sure that the product is optimal and very secure and that’s why we are taking a few more weeks to test it, in fact, to make sure that the product is optimal.   Regarding the roadmap, what’s gonna happen over the next 4 weeks is the release of the first ERC20 token listing at the end of the month. BCIO Token holders will be asked to answer a questionnaire to vote for the tokens they want to be listed on the platform (start voting now). After that, we will introduce the KYC feature and the release of the BCIO Token for trading on the platform. We are also working in parallel on the API to facilitate the integration of the automated traded tool that some of you are using for trading. Not all our customers are using our trading interface, some of you use so-called ""bots"" and automated trading tools.

Releasing a first version of the exchange will allow us to field test the platform and enhance it to the point where we can offer a fully functional exchange  to our users when the platform goes fully live in the next few weeks.  Distribution of BCIO Token. BCIO Token will be distributed in Q1 2019 to ICO contributors. KYC process is required. Contributors will have to create an account with the email address they used to contribute to the ICO. A BCIO wallet will be created automatically in your account, and the tokens will be distributed directly to the wallet. The smart contract was successfully deployed on November 26th, and 100 million BCIO tokens were created back then. Contributors can check the generating transaction on EtherScan.  Dynamic Fee. Any users holding BCIO tokens on the exchange will be provided access to exclusive platform services and discounts, including but not limited to: -participating in community-wide surveys; -voting on new token listings; -and receiving discounted trading fees.  Once the exchange has been launched, trading fees will equate to 0.1% of the value of the trades made. Moreover, depending on the amount of BCIO tokens held, the nominal fee of 0.1% may be further discounted, up to 99%.  Paymium Rebirth. Alongside Blockchain.io platform’s development, we are also working on rebranding our existing platform, Paymium.com. New logo, new website, some new and very exciting things are coming! We are developing a complete ecosystem by taking advantage of the strong complementarity between Paymium.com and Blockchain.io.  We will also develop additional advanced exchange features in 2019. Advanced Orders — stop loss, take profit and trailing stop orders as well as self-canceling and expiration orders. Cross-chain Atomic Swaps Trading — Our decentralized settlement option will allow traders to execute trade orders via cross-chain atomic swaps, leveraging a cryptographic protocol designed specifically for trading and addressing issues of prior protocols such as front-running and grieving. Periodic Auctions — transparent auctions several times a day to bootstrap new currency markets with an efficient price discovery mechanism. Proprietary & Peer-to-peer lending [subject to regulatory approval] — traders borrow money from other platform users or from the Blockchain.io inventory for larger amounts. Short & Long Margin Trading [subject to regulatory approval] — traders can borrow to open long or short positions — with or without leveraging — guaranteed with a security margin.  Our objective is to become the leading European cryptocurrency exchange by 2020. It is an ambitious goal, and there is still a long path ahead of us, but we are confident that we will deliver a platform that meets the needs of each and every one of you.  Thank you for your ongoing support and trust.  Trade on,  The Blockchain.io Team""",False

A new milestone has been completed and we will soon be able to distribute BCIO tokens to ICO contributors.  Smart Contract Address The smart contract was successfully deployed on November 26th, marking the official birthday of the BCIO Token.  Here is the official BCIO smart contract public address: 0xCDC412F306e0C51e3249B88C65423Cd16b322673  Smart contracts with different public addresses claiming to manage BCIO tokens are not affiliated with Blockchain.io project and are likely to be scams.  You can access the smart contract on EtherScan through the following URL: https://etherscan.io/address/0xCDC412F306e0C51e3249B88C65423Cd16b322673.  We also registered the following custom URL to safely redirect to the official Blockchain.io smart-contract: https://etherscan.io/address/blockchainio.eth.  The Generating Transaction During the deployment of the smart contract, 100 million BCIO tokens were created. BCIO Token is not minable, which means that new tokens cannot be created and the total supply is finite. You can check the generating transaction on EtherScan https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6ce8bd5089ae4cc09ef10fa3291ff8cac8be992d73b7048f39ec2d67ea356871.  The Burning Transaction All unsold tokens during the Token Sale must be burned. Consequently, we’ve burned 52,518,208 BCIO Tokens, bringing the total supply down to 47,481,792 BCIO Tokens. You can check the Burning transaction on EtherScan https://etherscan.io/tx/0x283dfefe1f0779a4e299102d79e6cc0eb2df4fda06fb3a92611aa4ef72e7f7cb.  Vesting Period for Team & Advisors Tokens for the Team & Advisors have been locked in vesting smart contracts. Vesting periods are detailed below: ● Advisor tokens will be vested over a year with 3 months cliffs ● Team tokens will be vested over two years with 6 months cliffs  What’s next for Token Sale Contributors? We’ll start the KYC process once Blockchain.io platform has been launched. Token sale contributors will receive an email detailing the procedure to receive the tokens. Please remember that passing KYC is required to receive your tokens.  Thank you for your patience in this ongoing and exciting journey. We can’t wait for the tokens to be released and for seeing the first transactions on Blockchain.io platform!

Our focus lately has been on Blockchain.io to ensure ICO success and reliable BCIO exchange launch in November. However we have not forgot PAYMIUM. I can tell you that a major plan will be unrolled for the rebirth of PAYMIUM in the coming months including fees decrease, soft rebranding,additional fiat pairs and new partnerhsips.

Enable holders to benefit from discount on all platform fees (trading, lending, token lstin, ICO execution, etc) In addition, token holders will be able to influence the platform roadmap through polls and surveys (additional features and functionalities, token listing, buyback program, etc) Finally, we will maintain a vibrant community with regular rewards and we will always be more generous with our token holders.  – Where can I get BCIO after the ICO ? As the token will be distributed directly on Blockchain.io account anyone claiming to have BCIO tokens outside the exchange is fraudulent. Later, when the ERC20 contract deployment is enbaled you will be able to transfer them. We are in close relationships with main wallet providers to ensure only our official BCIO token is listed on their wallet.  – Do you concider migrating BCIO to another blockchain ? For now it is an ERC20 token but we carefully monitor new protocols in case it turn out to be better. – Any interaction with the decentralized settlement feature ? For now we have not formalized the business model of this feature but it might require to hold BCIO in order to use this feature. Keep in mind this is just one option, we might choose another business model.  – What is the future of BCIO token ? For now the token is a utility token so you are in fact buying future turnover at a discount. As mentioned earlier we want to become a security token and distribute dividends as soon as we get the MTF license in the EU.  About Blockchain.io Exchange  – Do you have any partnerships ? We have partnerships with multiple actors such as : Investment banking, communication, decentralized protocols, engineering, R&D, market maker ( with profesional traders)  – When can I use the decentralized settlement features ? This features is planed for Q2 2019  – When margin trading and peer-to-peer lending will be available ? It's planned for 2019  – How do you plan to bring liquidity to the margin trading ? By using specific orderbook based on lending interest rates we will fuel the margin trading of other pairs  – Can you tell me more about the decentralized settlement ? The trade are executed cross chain using atomic swap. You will only need to choose the decentralized settlement option when making you trade.  – Where does the liquidity of the decentralized settlement come from ? When you choose this option your order is matched against the centralized order book so there won't be any liquidity problem.  – API will be available ? Sure, you can expect a rest API on launch, FIX API and websockets will be available later.  About Regulation :  – What do you hope from regulation ? We are great supporters of the regulation initiatives of the AMF (that we meet regulary) and the government (French). Appropriate regulations will attract the intstitutional investments onto the ecosystem. Our ICO services will target institutions and large corporations.  – Do you have a partnership with French government ? We have a close relationship with M. Pierre Person, government deputy. We participated in the last Blockchain Forum about regulation and are in the shortlist of French companies that will obtain an official licence from AMF.  – What about global regulation ? Our goal is to become a trusted trading hub in Europe and beyong, this why the bigger plan is to apply for an MTF licence and be able to trade securities in Europe.  About the Exchange market:  – What are your advantages against the major exchange ? First, Paymium is the only marketplace in France. Blockchain.io have definitely more competitors globally but will adopt a compliant & regulation-ready stance that we believe, will drive investments from institutions and traditional finance.  – But what about competition from established exchange ? The main differentiator is the fact that we will have a proprietary token which will act as a strong marketing incentive to create a meaningful user base.  – Is Blockchain.io open to all customers ? Yes, except if your country is in the blacklist of Europe. Our goal is to ensure the market share in the EU, once complete we will focus on Global market.  About token listing:  – Do you already have ICO to be listed on Blockchain.io ? We have received a number of listing requests already and should start listing third party ERC20 tokens in december. We are aslo connected to ICO consulting firms that have a steady deal flow of good ICO projects.  – What kind of token assets will be listed ? Different classes of assets will be listed on our platform as we are buidling the Internet of Value.",False

Blockchain.io from what I have gathered is just an additional platform from an already existing platform Paymium which has been in the market since the early days of crypto around 2011. It prides itself as one of the few cryptocurrency exchanges that have not yet been hacked. I think they implemented a two platform strategy to leverage the different strengths of each platforms. If you read their whitepaper and understand what they are trying to accomplish you will see the brilliance of their strategy. They strike the perfect balance of regulatory conformity and innovative solutions. While other exchanges try to mitigate risk of regulations this company engages regulators directly and cooperate with them to develop a healthy and thriving crypto space. That is the very reason why this project is so great aside from an awesome address called blockchain.io ,False

Withdrawal fees are not set in stone and can easily be adjusted depending on the situation. I have seen other exchange changed their fees based on the sentiments of its users as well as on the rates of other exchanges. Transaction fee mining has its merit but it also some drawbacks. There is  a reason why CMC excludes exchanges that use them when ranking exchanges. I am sure that depending on market demand these types of incentives will be considered by the management of the site. Although transaction-fee mining looks good for some investors I am not sure of its long term prospect for the sites that are implementing them. In fact binance CEO and Huobi CTO has called out exchanges that are doing this and expressing their disapproval of the practice. Personally i have tried this on another exchange it was profitable for a awhile but when the hype is gone so does the profits.,False

I might be wrong but let us see what the admins of the site will tell us. I would be happy if they open it to the general public as it could also be a test for its scalability.

It will be the marketplace where cryptocurrencies will be traded against each other, a gateway to and a bridge across the multiple value networks powered by different blockchains/cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). Blockchain.io will combine the efficiency of a low-latency full-featured centralized exchange with decentralized “trustless” cross-chain settlement. The project leverages the latest developments in cross-chain atomic swaps, cryptographic protocols, and payment networks such as Lightning and Raiden. These developments will overcome the scalability issues of decentralized blockchains, allow transactions across heterogenous blockchains, increase the speed and lower the cost of these transactions, making them ready for mass adoption. Blockchain.io is driven by the highly experienced team of cryptocurrency experts who, seven years ago, founded Paymium, a fiat/bitcoin exchange catering to the underserved Euro market. Blockchain.io shares Paymium’s highest security, reliability, and accountability standards. It strives to overcome the shortcomings of rival crypto exchanges that have repeatedly caused severe losses for issuers and token holders. To achieve this, the team relies on its advanced knowledge of cryptographic technology, its operational in-depth understanding of the crypto world, and a strong company culture committed to security and compliance. Blockchain.io aims to be the cryptocurrency exchange of trust for individual and institutional traders and investors. It aims to combine a state-of-the-art low-latency cryptocurrency exchange with advanced decentralized settlement using the latest “trustless” cross-chain trading protocols to settle trades without the need for a trusted third-party or counterparty. Blockchain.io aims to overcome the current shortcomings of the crypto exchange market by applying the highest standards in security, reliability, compliance, and accountability. To achieve this, the team will rely on its advanced knowledge of cryptographic technology, its operational in-depth understanding of the crypto world, its strict discipline in software development, and its longstanding commitment to compliance and accountability. The founders of Blockchain.io are a seasoned team with in-depth knowledge of cryptocurrency protocols. They pioneered cryptocurrencies in Europe in 2009. They subsequently created Paymium in 2011, making it the first European Bitcoin exchange. Paymium claims the highest standards in security, reliability and accountability, which will also be the hallmark of Blockchain.io. Paymium has been operating hack-free since 2013. A company culture of commitment to security and technological competence are the underlying basis for this excellence. In terms of compliance and accountability, Paymium is, to the best of our knowledge, the only crypto exchange whose financial accounts are fully audited by an external auditor with a European title equivalent to an American CPA. The platform applies on a voluntary basis, and complies with, European Banking requirements for anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures. Paymium and Blockchain.io offerings are a perfect pair and the logical next step to meet the rising expectations of the crypto world as it evolves into the Internet of Value. The European cryptocurrency market is still up for grabs and Blockchain.io is determined to lead it. Blockchain.io will naturally address the untapped opportunity of the currently underserved European market. European governments have adopted Fintech friendly policies. They regard blockchain developments as an extremely valuable tool to revamp financial services. Institutional and individual investors show a growing appetite for Bitcoin, Ether, and European ICOs. Most European regulators are open, with a wait-and-see attitude. In Blockchain.io’s vision, these factors bring extremely compelling evidence of the strong growth potential of the European market. Blockchain.io will be dedicated to exchanging cryptocurrencies against each other, a complementary offering to the founders’ fiat exchange, Paymium. The Blockchain.io platform will combine the new-generation technology of a centralized custodial exchange with decentralized “trustless” cross-chain “fair exchange” settlement. The centralized cryptocurrency exchange will be a low-latency, full-featured exchange with custody services, centralized order booking, and efficient order matching. As Blockchain.io grows, it will add more functionalities such as margin trading, proprietary lending, and peer-to-peer lending. The decentralized cross-chain settlement will be based on cross-chain atomic swaps, i.e. cryptographic protocols that allow users to settle transactions across heterogeneous blockchain networks without ‘trusted’ third-party and without counterparty risk. This will represent a big departure from traditional markets and a major step toward the Internet of Value. Blockchain.io will jumpstart liquidity in three specific ways:    ICO services offering to assist issuers with their ICO campaigns and ICO listings,    Listing of other tokens (Non-ICO),    Market making using Blockchain.io inventory,       Custody and brokerage services for institutional clients,    Incentive program for Paymium users to ensure the smooth and seamless transition of the community to the new services. The 170,000 accounts of Paymium will become the first community to access Blockchain.io services and the Internet of Value. The Blockchain.io team will be the engaged drivers of the development of the advanced cryptocurrency protocols that will enable Blockchain.io’s decentralized settlement. Blockchain.io leverages research and development by the most prominent software developers who are entering the cryptocurrency ecosystem in droves. Among them, the teams at Lightning Networks, Tumblebit, and Rootstock are constantly improving on-chain and off-chain cryptographic protocols to enable atomic swaps through hashed timelock contracts (HTLC), payment channels, and sidechains.    These technologies enable seamless trading across heterogeneous blockchains fueled by cryptocurrencies of different nature such as POW, POS, DAG, and others, such as POB. They also provide solutions to the scalability issues of Bitcoin-based blockchain and massively lower the cost of transactions.    The Blockchain.io and Paymium teams believe in a regulated future for cryptocurrencies 2.0.    While a few governments such as the PRC’s have temporarily banned cryptocurrency exchanges, most national regulators, such as the SEC in the US and the AMF in France are seeking to define a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and ICOs. Gibraltar issued its own token. Japan licensed currency exchanges, while considering, like Estonia, issuing State-sponsored tokens for specific uses.    Blockchain.io strongly believes that cryptocurrencies will be regulated, in various forms, extent, and degrees, depending on the country or region. Our philosophy for Blockchain. io is to anticipate regulatory requirements and become the first exchange to be fully compliant as soon as relevant regulations are being issued.    Blockchain.io considers this as an essential feature for the successful course of business. The team has engaged in regulatory watch and conducts frequent discussions with various State authorities to educate them in cryptocurrency issues and to ensure that the key values of the crypto community are understood and respected.    Compliance and security are closely intertwined, as are the legal and technology standards they imply. Mastering both will unleash the potential of the cryptocurrency ecosystem and trigger mass adoption among institutional and individual investors.",False

Blockchain.io shares Paymium’s highest security, reliability, and accountability standards. It strives to overcome the shortcomings of rival crypto exchanges that have repeatedly caused severe losses for issuers and token holders. To achieve this, the team relies on its advanced knowledge of cryptographic technology, its operational in-depth understanding of the crypto world, and a strong company culture committed to security and compliance. Blockchain.io will combine the efficiency of a low-latency full-featured centralized exchange with decentralized “trustless” cross-chain settlement. The project leverages the latest developments in cross-chain atomic swaps, cryptographic protocols, and payment networks such as Lightning and Raiden. These developments will overcome the scalability issues of decentralized blockchains, allow transactions across heterogenous blockchains, increase the speed and lower the cost of these transactions, making them ready for mass adoption. Welcome to the Internet of Value! In the same way as the Internet redefined global communication, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are now reinventing money and value transactions. Before Bitcoin, money was defined by State sovereignty over a territory. From now on, any community can mint its own money in form of a cryptocurrency or digital token and start trading without any central supervising authority. In 2017 alone, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) raised around $5 billion. Each project was financed by a community of token holders who became its ambassadors. There are now already tens of millions of token holders. Digital tokens are like better, smarter cash. They are programmable money. Immediately liquid, indefinitely fragmentable, and instantly transferable, they can be programmed to meet the needs of particular assets, rights, goods, or services or of specific communities. The coming years will see a multitude of cryptocurrencies. New cryptographic developments and payment applications will allow us to transact in all these currencies, with the traditional ""fiat"" currencies retaining their role as price anchors.",False

The internet of value enables users to securely trade assets, rights, goods and services, globally and around the clock, without the involvement of a centralized authority, or traditional financial intermediaries, or so called ‘trusted’ third-parties.  The Internet of value is built on multiple decentralized, automated, transparent, and secure blockchain-based value networks. Different networks operate different versions of the blockchain, which in turn are fueled by different cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, or Litecoin. Each network meets the needs of certain types of transactions, such as high-value payments or title registry, or the needs of specific trading communities, such as a network of autonomous objects or an industry sector.  Blockchain.io as the leading exchange in the Internet of Value will enable users to trade across all these value networks.  Cryptocurrency Exchanges Enable Users to Navigate the Internet of Value  Cryptocurrency exchanges enable users to trade across multiple value networks powered by heterogeneous blockchains.  As the number of cryptocurrencies grows, cryptocurrency exchanges become the marketplaces for listing and trading cryptocurrencies. In the current context, users mainly buy cryptocurrencies as a store of value, in anticipation of a future value increase. As exchanges list multiple cryptocurrencies in one place, supply information about them, enable comparisons, and set bid/ask prices according to demand, they help separate the valuable cryptocurrencies from the useless ones. Investors become increasingly discriminate in their choices of cryptocurrencies as a store of value or as a utility token.  As technological and regulatory barriers to the Internet of value will be lifted, cryptocurrencies and decentralized value networks will gain mainstream acceptance. To trade on these different networks, users will need to buy multiple digital currencies and to exchange them as their needs evolve.  Blockchain.io will list a careful selection of cryptocurrencies: Proof-of-Work (POW) coins such as Bitcoin, Ether or Litecoin, Proof-of-Stake (POS) coins like Qtum or Stratis, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) coins, and other cryptographic protocols yet to be designed and minted.  Essential Features   Ultra-Secure & Decentralized  The centralized part of the exchange offers highly secure custody services with cold storage and cryptographic proof of reserve. Cryptocurrencies are held in cold storage (offline) for at least 98% of reserves. A cold wallet access requires multiple signatures. A cold wallet private key is split and held in a number of different vaults in multiple locations. Other in-house security processes and technological features. Internal procedures protect the exchange from social engineering attacks. Periodic technical audits and timestamped logs allow detection of any tampering attempts in the accounting database. Periodic financial audits verify that the inventory of coins (assets side) matches the records of liabilities with cryptographic proof. If the exchange’s customer balances are checked against a blockchain inventory of coins (utxos in Bitcoin language) every block interval, there is little or no room for a rogue intruder to alter database records with profit. Decentralized settlement relies on fair-exchange protocols allowing atomic swaps of cryptocurrencies to eliminate the counter-party risk inherent to a custodial exchange.  Fully Compliant & Transparent  Exhaustive accounting records are audited by independent professional auditors to ensure the integrity of the trading platform. The exchange aims to comply with all current applicable EU regulations, ensuring that assets never get seized or frozen. Customer balances on the liability side must match exactly the inventory of coins held by the exchange. Blockchain.io aims to perform such balance check and to publish its cryptographic proof at every block interval.   Reliable Infrastructure  Minimal downtime, typically restricted to server maintenance, application upgrades, or database migration. Resilience under high volume, heavy traffic conditions, or DDoS attacks. No technical debt: exchanges that quickly add new altcoins or new features without proper testing or careful software design accumulate technical debt by taking shortcuts. Technical debt translates into applications that are harder to maintain and prone to bugs and security holes. Blockchain.io will attract high volume traders with specific features such as a FIX API and a borrowing facility, but also with the high level of availability of the trading platform. Processing capacity in the first phase will be of up to 2 million orders per day.   Select Digital Currencies  Cryptocurrencies will be listed on the trading platform following a strict vetting process (sustainability, technical, and deep protocol review) by our team of blockchain experts. Regular updates and publications will inform platform stakeholders and the community through altcoin technical reviews and financial analyses.  ICO Execution & Token Listing  Blockchain.io will provide ICO campaign support and token listing services to assist entrepreneurs and technologists in the planning and execution of their fundraising campaigns. Following the ICO campaigns, Blockchain.io will ensure that newly created tokens are listed on Blockchain.io to provide liquidity to investors and traders. In addition, Blockchain.io will create Token liquidity through: Market making using Blockchain.io’s inventory Incentive program for Paymium users.

The following can be found in detail in our Whitepaper. The below serves as an introduction for investors and traders on what they can expect.  What is a BCIO Token?  So, you might be wondering what exactly will be the blockchain.io coin and how it will be used. Blockchain.io coins are called BCIO Tokens. BCIO Tokens are utility coins, designed to provide a smooth and secure experience for cryptocurrency traders and users on our trading platform.  We are determining 200 Million BCIO tokens for use, 60% of which to be available during the token sale. BCIO token distribution breakdown  We are launching these tokens in like manner with other ICOs. This means you can look forward to an incentivization bounty program aimed at fostering liquidity on the exchange.We’ll provide more info on our bounty program in a follow-up article.  BCIO Tokens will be held in a wallet on the Exchange. Each user will hold a certain number of Tokens both for services and to perform operations on the exchange. What are BCIO token usages? BCIO Token Usages Summary  Associated fees  As detailed in the graphic above, all exchange trades— including trading, borrowing, transfers, listing, ICO and other services — are subject to platform fees, with the exception of BCIO token “long” trades. Users have the freedom to pay associated fees in either BCIO tokens or another approved cryptocurrency .  All Services and Transaction fees paid in BCIO tokens or cryptocurrencies are automatically deducted from the user’s Wallet. If the user does not hold the required number of tokens or coins, the service will not be provided and the transaction will not be completed.  Discounted trading  Concerning some of the benefits granted to BCIO Token holders, platform fees paid in BCIO tokens are subject to discounts, and such fees will be discounted in several ways. For instance, we’ve established a discount token tier system, thus some discounts will be granted according to the total amount of BCIO tokens held by a trader.  Discount percentages associated with each tier will be decided by blockchain.io management after the token sale and following a survey of BCIO token holders. We’re all in this together, people! We will provide an example of the proposed discount framework soon.  Survey participation rights  Concerning the aforementioned survey, we at blockchain.io want to build a vibrant, trustworthy community. As such, we will regularly organize surveys and polls to act as consultation among BCIO Token holders regarding the introduction of new platform features, the listing of third party tokens or other strategic decisions like buyback programs. Token holders will thus be able to contribute to the blockchain.io roadmap. Each user’s voting rights and weight will be proportionate to the number of Tokens held in the user’s Exchange Wallet.  Loyalty & rewards  To sum all this up, BCIO tokens will be used to incentivize platform use and reward external developers as well as existing Paymium.com users and early blockchain.io adopters and supporters. BCIO holders will also have priviledged access to ICOs organized by Blockchain.io, benefit from complimentary services and will be prioritized for airdrops.  The time to opt-in is upon us, and the sooner users adopt tokens and engage the exchange the better. We look forward to building the Internet of Value together with you.  Trade on!

Today we are in the era of government regulations like SEC, After Bitcoin was released in 2009, the only way to trade it was to meet a friend at a coffee shop, open your laptops, and take out cash from your wallet. This trade was effective but clearly slow and inconvenient. Others felt the same way, and entrepreneurs realized there needed to be a better solution.  One of the most famous places to trade Bitcoin was Mt. Gox, which originally was named Magic The Gathering Online Exchange to trade rare playing cards. This exchange evolved into trading Bitcoin exclusively. It was founded by Jed McCaleb and then sold to Mark Karpeles who moved the exchange to Japan. Mt Gox was hacked in February 2014 and lost $460M from thousands of investors. Clearly, the notice will be ignored by most exchanges that are located in the United States or operating in other countries while allowing U.S. persons to use their service. Companies ignored the SEC while selling utility tokens through Initial Coin Offerings and now probably regret it.  I hope this coming 2020 Blockchain.io will be successful and i would love to see this company to be number 1 crypto exchange.",False

Periodic technical audits and timestamped logs allow detection of any tampering attempts in the accounting database. - Periodic financial audits verify that the inventory of coins (assets side) matches the records of liabilities with cryptographic proof. If the exchange’s customer balances are checked against a blockchain inventory of coins (utxos in Bitcoin language) every block interval, there is little or no room for a rogue intruder to alter database records with profit. - Decentralized settlement relies on fair-exchange protocols allowing atomic swaps of cryptocurrencies to eliminate the counter-party risk inherent to a custodial exchange.",False

The project here is building an exchange; not a blockchain. Our team is composed of exchange experts from both the crypto-sphere and the traditional financial world. To remove any doubts about our capabilities, the Blockchain.io platform is currently being developed as we speak. The Alpha is planned for June 2018 and the Beta for late July. Early investors will get access to Alpha & Beta.  Concerning volume, the situation will shift soon. We are currently working with a French bank and are constrained by French banking regulation, which is one of the strictest in the world. The banking cartel is very strong and proactively undermines our business. Following our migration to a different banking partner, they have imposed uncompetitive funding limits (10K€/year), preventing any significant high-volume traders from boosting volume and fueling platform liquidity. We are currently working on an alternative banking solution in Europe, and we plan to add USD & JPY to our bitcoin exchange. We are confident that volume will be back on Paymium once this is settled.  On the profitability side, please note that we have been operating a bitcoin exchange since 2011, thus we have significant reserves. The two previous years have been good regarding volume. The last few months have been tough, but we still largely benefited from the price rally of 2016 and especially that of last year. When considering hacking, this is one of our main concerns. 24H volume has little bearing on the funds held on our platform. With around 200,000 users, hackers will certainly try something, but we have developed very high security standards (more than 98% of cold storage), keeping our customers' funds safe.  Concerning the Blockchain.io exchange, our main exclusive feature is decentralized settlement. Blockchain.io will offer the possibility to settle trades without giving the custody of coins, which erases the last potential point-of-failure. Order Books will remain centralized, guaranteeing high-performance matching and liquid markets. Of course, this feature will be optional, as it could not fit some user profiles, such as market-makers (who prefer velocity over high security). Moreover, Blockchain.io will also offer basic & advanced trade orders from the start. In the long run, we plan to implement margin trading and peer-to-peer lending. Please check out our roadmap at this end of the thread.  Last, but not least, Blockchain.io will have a strong focus on institutions. We believe that ICOs will become the main way to raise funds, and that large companies will approach us to launch their respective tokens for new product launches. Our team is highly experienced and has strong connections in the traditional financial world, therefore, we are aiming to become the primary interlocutor for such companies. Blockchain.io will offer its expertise and knowledge to provide complete ICO services, from planning and execution to token listing on our platform.",False

We are happy to hear that you find our advisory board impressive. Regarding our team, we only displayed C-Level team members on this thread. In the manifesto, please note that we did not mention all members of our team (both those in tech and on the marketing side) because we are running an exchange and we need to keep some members anonymous as failsafes. It's true that we could have mentioned their presence.  I respectfully disagree concerning your remarks about the team. The project here is building an exchange; not a blockchain. Our team is composed of exchange experts from both the crypto-sphere and the traditional financial world. To remove any doubts about our capabilities, the Blockchain.io platform is currently being developed as we speak. The Alpha is planned for June 2018 and the Beta for late July. Early investors will get access to Alpha & Beta.  Concerning volume, the situation will shift soon. We are currently working with a French bank and are constrained by French banking regulation, which is one of the strictest in the world. The banking cartel is very strong and proactively undermines our business. Following our migration to a different banking partner, they have imposed uncompetitive funding limits (10K€/year), preventing any significant high-volume traders from boosting volume and fueling platform liquidity. We are currently working on an alternative banking solution in Europe, and we plan to add USD & JPY to our bitcoin exchange. We are confident that volume will be back on Paymium once this is settled.  On the profitability side, please note that we have been operating a bitcoin exchange since 2011, thus we have significant reserves. The two previous years have been good regarding volume. The last few months have been tough, but we still largely benefited from the price rally of 2016 and especially that of last year. When considering hacking, this is one of our main concerns. 24H volume has little bearing on the funds held on our platform. With around 200,000 users, hackers will certainly try something, but we have developed very high security standards (more than 98% of cold storage), keeping our customers' funds safe.  Concerning the Blockchain.io exchange, our main exclusive feature is decentralized settlement. Blockchain.io will offer the possibility to settle trades without giving the custody of coins, which erases the last potential point-of-failure. Order Books will remain centralized, guaranteeing high-performance matching and liquid markets. Of course, this feature will be optional, as it could not fit some user profiles, such as market-makers (who prefer velocity over high security). Moreover, Blockchain.io will also offer basic & advanced trade orders from the start. In the long run, we plan to implement margin trading and peer-to-peer lending. Please check out our roadmap at this end of the thread.  Last, but not least, Blockchain.io will have a strong focus on institutions. We believe that ICOs will become the main way to raise funds, and that large companies will approach us to launch their respective tokens for new product launches. Our team is highly experienced and has strong connections in the traditional financial world, therefore, we are aiming to become the primary interlocutor for such companies. Blockchain.io will offer its expertise and knowledge to provide complete ICO services, from planning and execution to token listing on our platform.  Please feel free to ask further questions if you have any. In all, development is ongoing, but coming along very well.  Thank you very much. The Blockchain.io Team",False

The internet of value enables users to securely trade assets, rights, goods and services, globally and around the clock, without the involvement of a centralized authority, or traditional financial intermediaries, or so called ‘trusted’ third-parties.  The Internet of value is built on multiple decentralized, automated, transparent, and secure blockchain-based value networks. Different networks operate different versions of the blockchain, which in turn are fueled by different cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, or Litecoin. Each network meets the needs of certain types of transactions, such as high-value payments or title registry, or the needs of specific trading communities, such as a network of autonomous objects or an industry sector.  Blockchain.io as the leading exchange in the Internet of Value will enable users to trade across all these value networks.  Cryptocurrency Exchanges Enable Users to Navigate the Internet of Value  Cryptocurrency exchanges enable users to trade across multiple value networks powered by heterogeneous blockchains.

As technological and regulatory barriers to the Internet of value will be lifted, cryptocurrencies and decentralized value networks will gain mainstream acceptance. To trade on these different networks, users will need to buy multiple digital currencies and to exchange them as their needs evolve.

Banks and other intermediaries limit us somehow. Cryptocurrencies give people more financial freedom and power to control their assets on their own. Per Blockchain.io platform, the concept looks sound. For example, they seem to recognize that institutional traders and investors intend to give the market a huge boost in the future. And they also recognize that the primary application of blockchain technology requires it to comply with government regulations, registration, and laws. Other factors that you should take into account are a successful blockchain project - security, reliability and trust. Based on the fact that all of the centralized crypto-exchanges subjected to hacking, Blockchain.io platform allows you to eliminate this issue. They explain their mission-vision as below:  ""Blockchain.io will combine the efficiency of a low-latency full-featured centralizedexchange with decentralized “trustless” cross-chain settlement. The project leverages the latest developments in cross-chain atomic swaps, cryptographic protocols, and payment networks such as Lightning and Raiden. These developments will overcome the scalability issues of decentralized blockchains, allow transactions across heterogenous blockchains, increase the speed and lower the cost of these transactions, making them ready for mass adoption.""  ""As a cryptocurrency exchange, Blockchain.io will play a major role in the Internet of Value’secosystem. It will be the marketplace where cryptocurrencies will be traded against eachother, a gateway to and a bridge across the multiple value networks powered by differentblockchains/cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).""

Since the birth of cryptocurrencies and blockchain, there has been need for better security in handling transactions in a friendly environment.  A fully compliant and decentralized system distributed and public digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the consensus of the network.  This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions inexpensively. A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests.  The result is a robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double spending. Blockchains have been described as a value-exchange protocol. This blockchain-based exchange of value can be completed quicker, safer and cheaper than with traditional systems.  A blockchain can assign title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels.",False

High level of digital asset protection and secure transaction. Built on fair exchange protocol, allowing atomic swap cryptocurrency to minimize risk. In Blockchain.io’s vision, the Internet of Value is the next level of evolution of the Internet. The internet of value enables users to securely trade assets, rights, goods, and services, globally and around the clock, without the involvement of a centralized authority, or traditional financial intermediaries, or so-called ‘trusted’ third-parties. The Internet of value is built on multiple decentralized, automated, transparent, and secure blockchain-based value networks. Different networks operate different versions of the blockchain, which in turn are fueled by different cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, or Litecoin. Each network meets the needs of certain types of transactions, such as high-value payments or title registry, or the needs of specific trading communities, such as a network of autonomous objects or an industry sector. Blockchain.io as the leading exchange on the Internet of Value will enable users to trade across all these value networks. As the number of cryptocurrencies grows, cryptocurrency exchanges become the marketplaces for listing and trading cryptocurrencies. In the current context, users mainly buy cryptocurrencies as a store of value, in anticipation of a future value increase. As exchanges list multiple cryptocurrencies in one place, supply information about them, enable comparisons, and set bid/ask prices according to demand, they help separate the valuable cryptocurrencies from the useless ones. Investors become increasingly discriminate in their choices of cryptocurrencies as a store of value or as a utility token. I believe that Blockchain.io can potentially be one of the top exchanges out there. Not only because of the Decentralized Exchanges system but because it’s actually designed to be an ecosystem that allows the user to manage cryptocurrency for a real-life usage.",False

It is ""an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way"".[8] For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority.  Blockchains are secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. Decentralized consensus has therefore been achieved with a blockchain.[9] This makes blockchains potentially suitable for the recording of events, medical records,[10][11] and other records management activities, such as identity management,[12][13][14] transaction processing, documenting provenance, food traceability[15], and voting.[16]  Blockchain was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin.[1] The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server.

Chúng tôi rất vui khi biết rằng bạn thấy ban cố vấn của chúng tôi ấn tượng. Về nhóm của chúng tôi, chúng tôi chỉ hiển thị các thành viên trong nhóm C-Level trên chủ đề này. Trong bản tuyên ngôn, xin lưu ý rằng chúng tôi không đề cập đến tất cả các thành viên trong nhóm của chúng tôi (cả những người trong lĩnh vực công nghệ và tiếp thị) vì chúng tôi đang trao đổi và chúng tôi cần giữ một số thành viên ẩn danh dưới dạng lỗi. Đúng là chúng tôi có thể đề cập đến sự hiện diện của họ.  Tôi trân trọng không đồng ý về những nhận xét của bạn về đội bóng. Dự án ở đây đang xây dựng một cuộc trao đổi; không phải là một blockchain. Nhóm của chúng tôi bao gồm các chuyên gia trao đổi từ cả lĩnh vực mật mã và thế giới tài chính truyền thống. Để loại bỏ bất kỳ nghi ngờ nào về khả năng của chúng tôi, nền tảng Blockchain.io hiện đang được phát triển khi chúng tôi nói. Alpha được lên kế hoạch cho tháng 6 năm 2018 và bản Beta cho cuối tháng Bảy. Nhà đầu tư ban đầu sẽ có quyền truy cập vào Alpha & Beta.  Về khối lượng, tình hình sẽ sớm thay đổi. Chúng tôi hiện đang làm việc với một ngân hàng Pháp và bị hạn chế bởi quy định ngân hàng Pháp, một trong những quy định nghiêm ngặt nhất trên thế giới. Các cartel ngân hàng là rất mạnh mẽ và chủ động làm suy yếu kinh doanh của chúng tôi. Sau khi chúng tôi chuyển sang một đối tác ngân hàng khác, họ đã áp dụng giới hạn tài trợ không cạnh tranh (10K € / năm), ngăn chặn bất kỳ nhà giao dịch lớn nào có khối lượng lớn đẩy mạnh khối lượng và thúc đẩy thanh khoản nền tảng. Chúng tôi hiện đang làm việc trên một giải pháp ngân hàng thay thế ở châu Âu và chúng tôi dự định thêm USD & JPY vào giao dịch bitcoin của chúng tôi. Chúng tôi tin tưởng rằng khối lượng sẽ được trả lại trên Paymium một khi điều này được giải quyết.  Về mặt lợi nhuận, xin lưu ý rằng chúng tôi đã điều hành một giao dịch bitcoin kể từ năm 2011, do đó chúng tôi có dự trữ đáng kể. Hai năm trước đã tốt về khối lượng. Những tháng cuối năm khó khăn, nhưng chúng tôi vẫn hưởng lợi rất lớn từ sự tăng giá của năm 2016 và đặc biệt là năm ngoái. Khi xem xét hack, đây là một trong những mối quan tâm chính của chúng tôi. Khối lượng 24H ít mang về các quỹ được tổ chức trên nền tảng của chúng tôi. Với khoảng 200.000 người dùng, tin tặc chắc chắn sẽ thử một số thứ, nhưng chúng tôi đã phát triển các tiêu chuẩn bảo mật rất cao (hơn 98% kho lạnh), giữ cho tiền của khách hàng an toàn.  Liên quan đến việc trao đổi Blockchain.io, tính năng độc quyền chính của chúng tôi là giải quyết phân cấp. Blockchain.io sẽ cung cấp khả năng để giải quyết các giao dịch mà không cho việc lưu giữ tiền xu, mà xóa điểm tiềm năng cuối cùng của thất bại. Đặt hàng Sách sẽ vẫn tập trung, đảm bảo hiệu suất cao phù hợp và thị trường chất lỏng. Tất nhiên, tính năng này sẽ là tùy chọn, vì nó không thể phù hợp với một số hồ sơ người dùng, chẳng hạn như các nhà hoạch định thị trường (những người thích vận tốc trên bảo mật cao). Hơn nữa, Blockchain.io cũng sẽ cung cấp các lệnh giao dịch cơ bản và nâng cao ngay từ đầu. Về lâu dài, chúng tôi dự định thực hiện giao dịch ký quỹ và cho vay ngang hàng. Vui lòng kiểm tra lộ trình của chúng tôi ở cuối chuỗi này.  Cuối cùng, nhưng không kém phần quan trọng, Blockchain.io sẽ tập trung mạnh vào các tổ chức. Chúng tôi tin rằng các ICO sẽ trở thành cách chính để gây quỹ và các công ty lớn sẽ tiếp cận chúng tôi để giới thiệu các mã thông báo tương ứng cho các sản phẩm mới ra mắt. Nhóm của chúng tôi có nhiều kinh nghiệm và có kết nối mạnh mẽ trong thế giới tài chính truyền thống, do đó, chúng tôi đang hướng tới trở thành người đối thoại chính cho các công ty như vậy. Blockchain.io sẽ cung cấp kiến thức chuyên môn và kiến thức của mình để cung cấp các dịch vụ ICO hoàn chỉnh, từ lập kế hoạch và thực hiện đến danh sách mã thông báo trên nền tảng của chúng tôi.   Cảm ơn nhiều. Nhóm Blockchain.io",False

As exchanges list multiple cryptocurrencies in one place, supply information about them, enable comparisons, and set bid/ask prices according to demand, they help separate the valuable cryptocurrencies from the useless ones. Investors become increasingly discriminate in their choices of cryptocurrencies as a store of value or as a utility token.

Even the best exchanges customer support has big issues, it is nearly impossible to get anyone on the phone should I require help with technical issues, even at some of the most well know exchanges. What customer service will Blockchain.io offer? Can I get a question answered by a knowledgeable human being, or will I be steered to an unsatisfactory FAQ page, user forum or heaven forbid a system generated response?

We are happy to hear that you find our advisory board impressive. Regarding our team, we only displayed C-Level team members on this thread. In the manifesto, please note that we did not mention all members of our team (both those in tech and on the marketing side) because we are running an exchange and we need to keep some members anonymous as failsafes. It's true that we could have mentioned their presence.  I respectfully disagree concerning your remarks about the team. The project here is building an exchange; not a blockchain. Our team is composed of exchange experts from both the crypto-sphere and the traditional financial world. To remove any doubts about our capabilities, the Blockchain.io platform is currently being developed as we speak. The Alpha is planned for June 2018 and the Beta for late July. Early investors will get access to Alpha & Beta.  Concerning volume, the situation will shift soon. We are currently working with a French bank and are constrained by French banking regulation, which is one of the strictest in the world. The banking cartel is very strong and proactively undermines our business. Following our migration to a different banking partner, they have imposed uncompetitive funding limits (10K€/year), preventing any significant high-volume traders from boosting volume and fueling platform liquidity. We are currently working on an alternative banking solution in Europe, and we plan to add USD & JPY to our bitcoin exchange. We are confident that volume will be back on Paymium once this is settled.  On the profitability side, please note that we have been operating a bitcoin exchange since 2011, thus we have significant reserves. The two previous years have been good regarding volume. The last few months have been tough, but we still largely benefited from the price rally of 2016 and especially that of last year. When considering hacking, this is one of our main concerns. 24H volume has little bearing on the funds held on our platform. With around 200,000 users, hackers will certainly try something, but we have developed very high security standards (more than 98% of cold storage), keeping our customers' funds safe.  Concerning the Blockchain.io exchange, our main exclusive feature is decentralized settlement. Blockchain.io will offer the possibility to settle trades without giving the custody of coins, which erases the last potential point-of-failure. Order Books will remain centralized, guaranteeing high-performance matching and liquid markets. Of course, this feature will be optional, as it could not fit some user profiles, such as market-makers (who prefer velocity over high security). Moreover, Blockchain.io will also offer basic & advanced trade orders from the start. In the long run, we plan to implement margin trading and peer-to-peer lending. Please check out our roadmap at this end of the thread.  Last, but not least, Blockchain.io will have a strong focus on institutions. We believe that ICOs will become the main way to raise funds, and that large companies will approach us to launch their respective tokens for new product launches. Our team is highly experienced and has strong connections in the traditional financial world, therefore, we are aiming to become the primary interlocutor for such companies. Blockchain.io will offer its expertise and knowledge to provide complete ICO services, from planning and execution to token listing on our platform.

The internet of value enables users to securely trade assets, rights, goods and services, globally and around the clock, without the involvement of a centralized authority, or traditional financial intermediaries, or so called ‘trusted’ third-parties.  The Internet of value is built on multiple decentralized, automated, transparent, and secure blockchain-based value networks. Different networks operate different versions of the blockchain, which in turn are fueled by different cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, or Litecoin. Each network meets the needs of certain types of transactions, such as high-value payments or title registry, or the needs of specific trading communities, such as a network of autonomous objects or an industry sector.  Blockchain.io as the leading exchange in the Internet of Value will enable users to trade across all these value networks.  Cryptocurrency Exchanges Enable Users to Navigate the Internet of Value  Cryptocurrency exchanges enable users to trade across multiple value networks powered by heterogeneous blockchains.  As the number of cryptocurrencies grows, cryptocurrency exchanges become the marketplaces for listing and trading cryptocurrencies. In the current context, users mainly buy cryptocurrencies as a store of value, in anticipation of a future value increase. As exchanges list multiple cryptocurrencies in one place, supply information about them, enable comparisons, and set bid/ask prices according to demand, they help separate the valuable cryptocurrencies from the useless ones. Investors become increasingly discriminate in their choices of cryptocurrencies as a store of value or as a utility token.  As technological and regulatory barriers to the Internet of value will be lifted, cryptocurrencies and decentralized value networks will gain mainstream acceptance. To trade on these different networks, users will need to buy multiple digital currencies and to exchange them as their needs evolve.  Blockchain.io will list a careful selection of cryptocurrencies: Proof-of-Work (POW) coins such as Bitcoin, Ether or Litecoin, Proof-of-Stake (POS) coins like Qtum or Stratis, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) coins, and other cryptographic protocols yet to be designed and minted.  Essential Features http://tinyimg.io/i/bPKSdNn.png  Ultra-Secure & Decentralized  The centralized part of the exchange offers highly secure custody services with cold storage and cryptographic proof of reserve. Cryptocurrencies are held in cold storage (offline) for at least 98% of reserves. A cold wallet access requires multiple signatures. A cold wallet private key is split and held in a number of different vaults in multiple locations. Other in-house security processes and technological features. Internal procedures protect the exchange from social engineering attacks. Periodic technical audits and timestamped logs allow detection of any tampering attempts in the accounting database. Periodic financial audits verify that the inventory of coins (assets side) matches the records of liabilities with cryptographic proof. If the exchange’s customer balances are checked against a blockchain inventory of coins (utxos in Bitcoin language) every block interval, there is little or no room for a rogue intruder to alter database records with profit. Decentralized settlement relies on fair-exchange protocols allowing atomic swaps of cryptocurrencies to eliminate the counter-party risk inherent to a custodial exchange.  Fully Compliant & Transparent  Exhaustive accounting records are audited by independent professional auditors to ensure the integrity of the trading platform. The exchange aims to comply with all current applicable EU regulations, ensuring that assets never get seized or frozen. Customer balances on the liability side must match exactly the inventory of coins held by the exchange. Blockchain.io aims to perform such balance check and to publish its cryptographic proof at every block interval.   Reliable Infrastructure  Minimal downtime, typically restricted to server maintenance, application upgrades, or database migration. Resilience under high volume, heavy traffic conditions, or DDoS attacks. No technical debt: exchanges that quickly add new altcoins or new features without proper testing or careful software design accumulate technical debt by taking shortcuts. Technical debt translates into applications that are harder to maintain and prone to bugs and security holes. Blockchain.io will attract high volume traders with specific features such as a FIX API and a borrowing facility, but also with the high level of availability of the trading platform. Processing capacity in the first phase will be of up to 2 million orders per day.   Select Digital Currencies  Cryptocurrencies will be listed on the trading platform following a strict vetting process (sustainability, technical, and deep protocol review) by our team of blockchain experts. Regular updates and publications will inform platform stakeholders and the community through altcoin technical reviews and financial analyses.  ICO Execution & Token Listing  Blockchain.io will provide ICO campaign support and token listing services to assist entrepreneurs and technologists in the planning and execution of their fundraising campaigns. Following the ICO campaigns, Blockchain.io will ensure that newly created tokens are listed on Blockchain.io to provide liquidity to investors and traders. In addition, Blockchain.io will create Token liquidity through: Market making using Blockchain.io’s inventory Incentive program for Paymium users.   http://tinyimg.io/i/Ax2ksCc.png  Blockchain.io is driven by the highly experienced team of cryptocurrency experts who, seven years ago, founded Paymium, a fiat/bitcoin exchange catering to the underserved Euro market. Blockchain.io shares Paymium’s highest security, reliability, and accountability standards. It strives to overcome the shortcomings of rival crypto exchanges that have repeatedly caused severe losses for issuers and token holders. To achieve this, the team relies on its advanced knowledge of cryptographic technology, its operational in-depth understanding of the crypto world, and a strong company culture committed to security and compliance.

Ultra-Secure & Decentralized  The centralized part of the exchange offers highly secure custody services with cold storage and cryptographic proof of reserve. Cryptocurrencies are held in cold storage (offline) for at least 98% of reserves. A cold wallet access requires multiple signatures. A cold wallet private key is split and held in a number of different vaults in multiple locations. Other in-house security processes and technological features. Internal procedures protect the exchange from social engineering attacks. Periodic technical audits and timestamped logs allow detection of any tampering attempts in the accounting database. Periodic financial audits verify that the inventory of coins (assets side) matches the records of liabilities with cryptographic proof. If the exchange’s customer balances are checked against a blockchain inventory of coins (utxos in Bitcoin language) every block interval, there is little or no room for a rogue intruder to alter database records with profit. Decentralized settlement relies on fair-exchange protocols allowing atomic swaps of cryptocurrencies to eliminate the counter-party risk inherent to a custodial exchange.",False

Thanks for detailed explanation, it helps. I like the decentralized settlement feature and will take a look into whitepaper. Reputation matters in this world. We strive to provide useful and transparent information on ICOs, helping users find projects that have a great potential for success. We also offer a whitelabel platform for ICO projects.The result is a robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double spending. Blockchains have been described as a value-exchange protocol.In order to receive our full whitepaper, you need to get whitelisted as we are still in our Token sale private round. We welcome your suggestions and shall try to provide more transparency while maintaining a strong level of security. It is fundamental thing.

I think Blockain.io is a great project, bringing great benefits to the community, because Blockchain.io aims: to overcome the current shortcomings of the crypto exchange market by applying the highest standards in security, reliability, compliance, and accountability; to be the cryptocurrency exchange of trust for individual and institutional traders and investors. The founders of Blockchain.io are a seasoned team with in-depth knowledge of cryptocurrency protocols. They pioneered cryptocurrencies in Europe in 2009. They subsequently created Paymium in 2011, making it the first European Bitcoin exchange. Paymium claims the highest standards in security, reliability and accountability, which will also be the hallmark of Blockchain.io. Paymium and Blockchain.io offerings are a perfect pair and the logical next step to meet the rising expectations of the crypto world as it evolves into the Internet of Value. This could lead to non-hackable web programs and services, transparent networks and greater system reliability. As a cryptocurrency exchange, Blockchain.io will play a major role in the Internet of Value’s ecosystem. It will be the marketplace where cryptocurrencies will be traded against each other, a gateway to and a bridge across the multiple value networks powered by different blockchains/cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).

It is helpful to see the filing has been registered with the US SEC for Reg D, Exempt Offering of Securities. This is a voluntary step that can head off potential problems with the project as it builds more public awareness.  Also the business proposition of building an exchange; not a blockchain is one that has more barriers for competition. This is good as a less crowded field is better for development. Having a cross-functional team of traditional finance experts and professionals in the crypto-sphere indicates strong capabilities.  The technical team needs to be closely followed and evaluated particularly in light of the high level of security and redundancy required to build an effective exchange.

Confirma que cada unidade de valor foi transferida apenas uma vez, resolvendo o problema de longa data do duplo gasto. Os blockchains foram descritos como um protocolo de troca de valores. Essa troca de valor baseada em blockchain pode ser concluída com mais rapidez, segurança e menor custo do que com os sistemas tradicionais.

Different networks operate different versions of the blockchain, which in turn are fueled by different cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, or Litecoin.

We are happy to hear that you find our advisory board impressive. Regarding our team, we only displayed C-Level team members on this thread. In the manifesto, please note that we did not mention all members of our team (both those in tech and on the marketing side) because we are running an exchange and we need to keep some members anonymous as failsafes. It's true that we could have mentioned their presence.  I respectfully disagree concerning your remarks about the team. The project here is building an exchange; not a blockchain. Our team is composed of exchange experts from both the crypto-sphere and the traditional financial world. To remove any doubts about our capabilities, the Blockchain.io platform is currently being developed as we speak. The Alpha is planned for June 2018 and the Beta for late July. Early investors will get access to Alpha & Beta.  Concerning volume, the situation will shift soon. We are currently working with a French bank and are constrained by French banking regulation, which is one of the strictest in the world. The banking cartel is very strong and proactively undermines our business. Following our migration to a different banking partner, they have imposed uncompetitive funding limits (10K€/year), preventing any significant high-volume traders from boosting volume and fueling platform liquidity. We are currently working on an alternative banking solution in Europe, and we plan to add USD & JPY to our bitcoin exchange. We are confident that volume will be back on Paymium once this is settled.  Last, but not least, Blockchain.io will have a strong focus on institutions. We believe that ICOs will become the main way to raise funds, and that large companies will approach us to launch their respective tokens for new product launches. Our team is highly experienced and has strong connections in the traditional financial world, therefore, we are aiming to become the primary interlocutor for such companies. Blockchain.io will offer its expertise and knowledge to provide complete ICO services, from planning and execution to token listing on our platform.

Ultra-secure and profitable, Paymium is registered with the French regulation authority ACPR and accounting is certified by external auditors.  Based on its record and experienced team, Paymium is launching a new crypto-exchange: Blockchain.io. This platform will be fully dedicated to crypto-trading while Paymium will remain the privileged hub for fiat currencies. Paymium customers (currently at 170,000 + accounts) will automatically have a Blockchain.io account and will obtain incentives for their loyalty. Our new platform will offer:  For users: centralized orderbooks (maximum liquidity) and decentralized settlement (even more security), advanced trading orders with Maker & Taker fees at 0.1% with additional discounts, market-making and peer-to-peer lending For entrepreneurs & institutions: ICO planning & execution services for institutions (thanks to an extensive network of bankers, lawyers, marketers, technologists, etc) up to the Blockchain.io exchange listing and guaranteed liquidity for BCIO tokens. What sets us apart is a concentrated effort in Europe, where the crypto market is largely still in its infancy and which as of today lacks a transparent and regulated crypto-exchange with a proprietary token enabling institutions to launch their ICOs. Our proprietary token will allow us to offer incentives to bootstrap the liquidity of the trading platform.  thanks & Regards Raghav",False

Different networks operate different versions of the blockchain, which in turn are fueled by different cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, or Litecoin.

The idea of founders is to create an European cryptocurrency exchange, which would stand out in crypto space thanks to its features. What’s more we have certainty about reality of the company not like in the case of other exchanges. The founder and CEO of the project co-founded in 2011 as one of the first bitcoin exchanges in the world, which proves his experience and contribution in cryptocurrrency industry.  The first feature ensure a deep orderbook on all pairs by using high availability and high scalability trade matching engine. Basic orders are quite common on the other exchanges but not all exchanges have advanced orders, that allow you to use your preferred trading methods. In my opinion, the next functions will contribute significantly to success of the platform. Periodic auctions will aim to bootstrap new currency markets with an efficient price discovery mechanism, which I didn’t noticed on others crypto exchanges. Furthermore whenever you will plan to oper short position it will be possbile on blockchain.io platform, you can also borrow or lend money from/to the other platform users what makes trading on the market much easier.

Atleast they are not incentivizing 100% refund of fees like Bit-Z and Coinbene which caused a bit of a scandal just a few days ago. The new thing here is that they would also be a platform for ICOs and incentives. I hope that just like Bnktothefuture, they can also offer incentives for catered research with regards to ICO applications within their platform. This means that the application process for ICOs on their platform.. some of the labor work will be given to the people... us... in general so that we can do the work for them. This would be a great approach in a sense that they would not only save on labor but also gives the regular people like us the possibility to help in the ICO application process via catered research. We at our team have been researching hundreds of ICOs yearly. It would also be a good help on our end if our efforts can be rewarded in a way as well. Overall, with the right marketing and strategy, this exchange can rival Binance in the future.

Chúng tôi rất vui khi biết rằng bạn thấy ban cố vấn của chúng tôi ấn tượng. Về nhóm của chúng tôi, chúng tôi chỉ hiển thị các thành viên trong nhóm C-Level trên chủ đề này. Trong bản tuyên ngôn, xin lưu ý rằng chúng tôi không đề cập đến tất cả các thành viên trong nhóm của chúng tôi (cả những người trong lĩnh vực công nghệ và tiếp thị) vì chúng tôi đang trao đổi và chúng tôi cần giữ một số thành viên ẩn danh dưới dạng lỗi. Đúng là chúng tôi có thể đề cập đến sự hiện diện của họ.  Tôi trân trọng không đồng ý về những nhận xét của bạn về đội bóng. Dự án ở đây đang xây dựng một cuộc trao đổi; không phải là một blockchain. Nhóm của chúng tôi bao gồm các chuyên gia trao đổi từ cả lĩnh vực mật mã và thế giới tài chính truyền thống. Để loại bỏ bất kỳ nghi ngờ nào về khả năng của chúng tôi, nền tảng Blockchain.io hiện đang được phát triển khi chúng tôi nói. Alpha được lên kế hoạch cho tháng 6 năm 2018 và bản Beta cho cuối tháng Bảy. Nhà đầu tư ban đầu sẽ có quyền truy cập vào Alpha & Beta.  Về khối lượng, tình hình sẽ sớm thay đổi. Chúng tôi hiện đang làm việc với một ngân hàng Pháp và bị hạn chế bởi quy định ngân hàng Pháp, một trong những quy định nghiêm ngặt nhất trên thế giới. Các cartel ngân hàng là rất mạnh mẽ và chủ động làm suy yếu kinh doanh của chúng tôi. Sau khi chúng tôi chuyển sang một đối tác ngân hàng khác, họ đã áp dụng giới hạn tài trợ không cạnh tranh (10K € / năm), ngăn chặn bất kỳ nhà giao dịch lớn nào có khối lượng lớn đẩy mạnh khối lượng và thúc đẩy thanh khoản nền tảng. Chúng tôi hiện đang làm việc trên một giải pháp ngân hàng thay thế ở châu Âu và chúng tôi dự định thêm USD & JPY vào giao dịch bitcoin của chúng tôi. Chúng tôi tin tưởng rằng khối lượng sẽ được trả lại trên Paymium một khi điều này được giải quyết.  Về mặt lợi nhuận, xin lưu ý rằng chúng tôi đã điều hành một giao dịch bitcoin kể từ năm 2011, do đó chúng tôi có dự trữ đáng kể. Hai năm trước đã tốt về khối lượng. Những tháng cuối năm khó khăn, nhưng chúng tôi vẫn hưởng lợi rất lớn từ sự tăng giá của năm 2016 và đặc biệt là năm ngoái. Khi xem xét hack, đây là một trong những mối quan tâm chính của chúng tôi. Khối lượng 24H ít mang về các quỹ được tổ chức trên nền tảng của chúng tôi. Với khoảng 200.000 người dùng, tin tặc chắc chắn sẽ thử một số thứ, nhưng chúng tôi đã phát triển các tiêu chuẩn bảo mật rất cao (hơn 98% kho lạnh), giữ cho tiền của khách hàng an toàn.  Liên quan đến việc trao đổi Blockchain.io, tính năng độc quyền chính của chúng tôi là giải quyết phân cấp. Blockchain.io sẽ cung cấp khả năng để giải quyết các giao dịch mà không cho việc lưu giữ tiền xu, mà xóa điểm tiềm năng cuối cùng của thất bại. Đặt hàng Sách sẽ vẫn tập trung, đảm bảo hiệu suất cao phù hợp và thị trường chất lỏng. Tất nhiên, tính năng này sẽ là tùy chọn, vì nó không thể phù hợp với một số hồ sơ người dùng, chẳng hạn như các nhà hoạch định thị trường (những người thích vận tốc trên bảo mật cao). Hơn nữa, Blockchain.io cũng sẽ cung cấp các lệnh giao dịch cơ bản và nâng cao ngay từ đầu. Về lâu dài, chúng tôi dự định thực hiện giao dịch ký quỹ và cho vay ngang hàng. Vui lòng kiểm tra lộ trình của chúng tôi ở cuối chuỗi này.  Cuối cùng, nhưng không kém phần quan trọng, Blockchain.io sẽ tập trung mạnh vào các tổ chức. Chúng tôi tin rằng các ICO sẽ trở thành cách chính để gây quỹ và các công ty lớn sẽ tiếp cận chúng tôi để giới thiệu các mã thông báo tương ứng cho các sản phẩm mới ra mắt. Nhóm của chúng tôi có nhiều kinh nghiệm và có kết nối mạnh mẽ trong thế giới tài chính truyền thống, do đó, chúng tôi đang hướng tới trở thành người đối thoại chính cho các công ty như vậy. Blockchain.io sẽ cung cấp kiến thức chuyên môn và kiến thức của mình để cung cấp các dịch vụ ICO hoàn chỉnh, từ lập kế hoạch và thực hiện đến danh sách mã thông báo trên nền tảng của chúng tôi.  Xin vui lòng đặt câu hỏi thêm nếu bạn có bất kỳ câu hỏi nào. Trong tất cả, phát triển đang diễn ra, nhưng đến cùng rất tốt.  Cảm ơn nhiều.",False

Firstly, you mentioned that Blockchai.io strives to overcome the shortcomings of rival crypto exchanges that caused heavy losses to issuers and token holders and that you will achieve this, as you state in your own words “ the team relies on its advanced knowledge of cryptographic technology, its operational in-depth understanding of the crypto world, and a strong company culture committed to security and compliance”. I wish to state that, many of these rival crypto exchanges do have similar claims spelt out in their white paper and yet we all know what happened thereafter. I will still be cautious on this one as the saying goes, only time will tell. It is not a deal breaker for me though.  Secondly, you stated that Blockchain.io aims to comply with all current applicable EU regulations, ensuring that assets never get seized or frozen.

They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests.[32] The result is a robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double spending. Blockchains have been described as a value-exchange protocol.[21] This blockchain-based exchange of value can be completed quicker, safer and cheaper than with traditional systems.[33] A blockchain can assign title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance",False

Advanced users can also use their own landing page.  Boost your viral traffic with a leaderboard Optionally include a leaderboard in your contest, which helps boost virality by gamifying your contest. The higher on the leaderboard your contestant goes, the more engaged he'll want to be with your contest.  Verified bonus entries help you grow your social following Get your entrants to complete actions like ""join your Facebook group"" or ""follow your Spotify playlist"". Bonus entries help you build your followers on social media by incentivizing the follow. Unlike other contest platforms, we verify actions where it's possible through API connections.  Get referral traffic with ""refer-a-friend"" style viral entries The bread and butter of any viral campaign. Viral sharing helps you to attract more entrants by getting your current audience to share your contest on social media or with their friends  In a nutshell, VYPER allows you to grow your business creatively, when you're stuck on what to do next!  Contests are known to produce great numbers, but don't you get a lot of bad emails who just want your freebie?? That's a fair concern and there are a lot of elements that affect the quality of your emails. For example, if you offer a Macbook Pro and you're a blog for moms, you're going to get a lot of emails that aren't right for you. On the other hand, if you offer a very specific item that only moms want, then your contestants will be much more high value. There are many other factors that affect engagement, and we discuss this a lot in our blog.    Do you integrate with X mailing list provider? Currently we integrate with Mailchimp, Aweber, ConvertKit, Sendy, Klaviyo, and Drip. You can also export to CSV after your contest is over, which we recommend. We're working on an ActiveCampaign integration & Zapier in the coming months.    Can your contest software help me get Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter followers? Yes! After a contestant enters, they're given the option to like or follow your social media pages.    How does a contest look on mobile? In this day and age, mobile has to be a priority. Our contests look amazing on mobile!      How does your system prevent contestants from cheating the system? We have a proprietary cheating algorithm that detects cheaters and prevents them from being chosen when you go to pick the winners. We don't reveal our algorithm publicly, because if we did it would make it that much easier to game our system. We pride ourselves in being one of the most advanced cheating detection systems for contest software out there.    Can I run a contest on my own domain instead of Vyper.io? Our enterprise plan allows you to set a custom subdomain and removes VYPER branding from your contest landing page.    Does this work even if I have zero audience? Viral contests work no matter your audience size. If you have no audience, you just have to get creative with how you initially ""seed"" your contest. In our blog we go in-depth with how you can seed your contest list and see the viral growth.    Do you allow pixel tracking and/or Google Analytics? Yes. Starting from our pro plan you'll be able to embed Google Analytics code as well as any pixel code (ie - Facebook pixel) to the contest.",False

Blockchains have been described as a value-exchange protocol.[21] This blockchain-based exchange of value can be completed quicker, safer and cheaper than with traditional systems.[33] A blockchain can assign title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.[34][35]",False

In the case of Blockchain.io, we have a real vision, a strong leader (well established in the crypto-world) as well as a real team of professionals, and the Financial strength to support such a project. Blockhain.io offers new forms of financial liquidity to companies that want to raise money for their startup project. At the end of the day, we are talking about real value creation (as new startup companies create products, services and jobs). This is the most important factor that make me believe that this company is completely viable, compared to other companies that may offer, at a first glance a similar value proposition, but are in fact, only based on speculation (as no actual service or products are linked to it). In the next future, I believe that a significant part of these cryptocurrencies (that are created every day at an unimaginable speed), will disappear due to this lack of real utility, which is not the case of Blockchain.io.

I have some more questions about the project I would like a member of the team, the original poster or any other person in this thread who understands better than I did, to clear up for me; The exchange will be using atomic swap features which is very good and would reduce the transaction fees in converting from one cryptocurrency to the major base crypto, before then converting back to the main currency wanted, but how are you going to manage that effectively considering that some part of the exchange will be centralized and the blockchain of the coins you mentioned are of different cyrptographic protocols? How will the hash-time locked contract function properly when it comes to the user providing the number that was generated via the hash function? I am optimistic about this feature, and hence my inquisitiveness More so, since the centralized part of the exchange will be offering highly secure custody services with cold storage and cryptographic proof of reserve which requires multiple signatures to gain access into? I understand it is a good security measure to prevent hacks and intruders but what happens if a user forgets his login details? There will be a chance to retrieve it back since the there is a cold wallet backup which you mentioned that the wallet private key is split and held in a number of different vaults in multiple locations?",False

I those exchanges had more opaque they were not able to fool me. I read Blockchain.io manifesto and realize that found and list all CEX problems I've ever faced with and they aims to fix them. They have analyzed these problems and they are going to provide us solution that will make our crypto users live much better. On the other hand Blockchain.io is not just another exchange. They will provide us ""Decentralized Settlement"" to allow us atomic swaps and Liquidity services. Liquidity is another big problem that I faced with almost every day on most exchanges (sure that you have seen that too). Blockchain.io pays a lot of attention to security (or how they say ""Ultra-Security"") which is very important in crypto.

The project here is building an exchange; not a blockchain. Our team is composed of exchange experts from both the crypto-sphere and the traditional financial world. To remove any doubts about our capabilities, the Blockchain.io platform is currently being developed as we speak. The Alpha is planned for June 2018 and the Beta for late July. Early investors will get access to Alpha & Beta.  Concerning volume, the situation will shift soon. We are currently working with a French bank and are constrained by French banking regulation, which is one of the strictest in the world. The banking cartel is very strong and proactively undermines our business. Following our migration to a different banking partner, they have imposed uncompetitive funding limits (10K€/year), preventing any significant high-volume traders from boosting volume and fueling platform liquidity. We are currently working on an alternative banking solution in Europe, and we plan to add USD & JPY to our bitcoin exchange. We are confident that volume will be back on Paymium once this is settled.  On the profitability side, please note that we have been operating a bitcoin exchange since 2011, thus we have significant reserves. The two previous years have been good regarding volume. The last few months have been tough, but we still largely benefited from the price rally of 2016 and especially that of last year. When considering hacking, this is one of our main concerns. 24H volume has little bearing on the funds held on our platform. With around 200,000 users, hackers will certainly try something, but we have developed very high security standards (more than 98% of cold storage), keeping our customers' funds safe.",False

This principle depends upon an unspoken agreement between market participants that information about a product's history is not only hidden but is actually lost. A product having this quality is, more or less, the very definition of a commodity.  Fungibility is even more important to money. Our system of money requires that each dollar be completely interchangeable with any other dollar. For it to function perfectly, users can have no knowledge of the history of each of those dollars.  I like to define money as a communication system that uses a commodity (the currency) to convey information about transfers of value. If the commodity's fungibility is challenged, the power to communicate that information is diminished.  You could say that assuring the fungibility of a currency is a matter of free speech.

In the current context, users mainly buy cryptocurrencies as a store of value, in anticipation of a future value increase. As exchanges list multiple cryptocurrencies in one place, supply information about them, enable comparisons, and set bid/ask prices according to demand, they help separate the valuable cryptocurrencies from the useless ones. Investors become increasingly discriminate in their choices of cryptocurrencies as a store of value or as a utility token.  As technological and regulatory barriers to the Internet of value will be lifted, cryptocurrencies and decentralized value networks will gain mainstream acceptance. To trade on these different networks, users will need to buy multiple digital currencies and to exchange them as their needs evolve.

Participation in this project will bring good profits to investors. You ask me, on what basis do I draw such conclusions? Let's deal with this together. No one will argue with the fact that the Internet in our time is an indispensable thing for any person. This means that over time, all communication among people will go online. All purchases will be made with one click. Due to the growing popularity of the Internet, its importance among The world's population is increasing. In such circumstances, it is very important that the Internet is independent of any centralized structure. The Internet should be an exclusively decentralized system. This is the system that the Blockchain.io offers. The level of evolution of the Internet depends on how decentralized it will be in the future. Only blockchain technology can provide the necessary level of decentralization. And the Blockchain.io will help make this transition to a new Internet  3.0 generation.

In the current context, users mainly buy cryptocurrencies as a store of value, in anticipation of a future value increase.

Investors become increasingly discriminate in their choices of cryptocurrencies as a store of value or as a utility token.  As technological and regulatory barriers to the Internet of value will be lifted, cryptocurrencies and decentralized value networks will gain mainstream acceptance. To trade on these different networks, users will need to buy multiple digital currencies and to exchange them as their needs evolve.  Blockchain.io will list a careful selection of cryptocurrencies: Proof-of-Work (POW) coins such as Bitcoin, Ether or Litecoin, Proof-of-Stake (POS) coins like Qtum or Stratis, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) coins, and other cryptographic protocols yet to be designed and minted.",False

The internet of value enables users to securely trade assets, rights, goods and services, globally and around the clock, without the involvement of a centralized authority, or traditional financial intermediaries, or so called ‘trusted’ third-parties.  The Internet of value is built on multiple decentralized, automated, transparent, and secure blockchain-based value networks. Different networks operate different versions of the blockchain, which in turn are fueled by different cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, or Litecoin. Each network meets the needs of certain types of transactions, such as high-value payments or title registry, or the needs of specific trading communities, such as a network of autonomous objects or an industry sector.  Blockchain.io as the leading exchange in the Internet of Value will enable users to trade across all these value networks.  Cryptocurrency Exchanges Enable Users to Navigate the Internet of Value  Cryptocurrency exchanges enable users to trade across multiple value networks powered by heterogeneous blockchains.  As the number of cryptocurrencies grows, cryptocurrency exchanges become the marketplaces for listing and trading cryptocurrencies. In the current context, users mainly buy cryptocurrencies as a store of value, in anticipation of a future value increase. As exchanges list multiple cryptocurrencies in one place, supply information about them, enable comparisons, and set bid/ask prices according to demand, they help separate the valuable cryptocurrencies from the useless ones. Investors become increasingly discriminate in their choices of cryptocurrencies as a store of value or as a utility token.  As technological and regulatory barriers to the Internet of value will be lifted, cryptocurrencies and decentralized value networks will gain mainstream acceptance. To trade on these different networks, users will need to buy multiple digital currencies and to exchange them as their needs evolve.  Blockchain.io will list a careful selection of cryptocurrencies: Proof-of-Work (POW) coins such as Bitcoin, Ether or Litecoin, Proof-of-Stake (POS) coins like Qtum or Stratis, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) coins, and other cryptographic protocols yet to be designed and minted.  Essential Features http://tinyimg.io/i/bPKSdNn.png  Ultra-Secure & Decentralized  The centralized part of the exchange offers highly secure custody services with cold storage and cryptographic proof of reserve. Cryptocurrencies are held in cold storage (offline) for at least 98% of reserves. A cold wallet access requires multiple signatures. A cold wallet private key is split and held in a number of different vaults in multiple locations. Other in-house security processes and technological features. Internal procedures protect the exchange from social engineering attacks. Periodic technical audits and timestamped logs allow detection of any tampering attempts in the accounting database. Periodic financial audits verify that the inventory of coins (assets side) matches the records of liabilities with cryptographic proof. If the exchange’s customer balances are checked against a blockchain inventory of coins (utxos in Bitcoin language) every block interval, there is little or no room for a rogue intruder to alter database records with profit. Decentralized settlement relies on fair-exchange protocols allowing atomic swaps of cryptocurrencies to eliminate the counter-party risk inherent to a custodial exchange.  Fully Compliant & Transparent  Exhaustive accounting records are audited by independent professional auditors to ensure the integrity of the trading platform. The exchange aims to comply with all current applicable EU regulations, ensuring that assets never get seized or frozen. Customer balances on the liability side must match exactly the inventory of coins held by the exchange. Blockchain.io aims to perform such balance check and to publish its cryptographic proof at every block interval.   Reliable Infrastructure  Minimal downtime, typically restricted to server maintenance, application upgrades, or database migration. Resilience under high volume, heavy traffic conditions, or DDoS attacks. No technical debt: exchanges that quickly add new altcoins or new features without proper testing or careful software design accumulate technical debt by taking shortcuts. Technical debt translates into applications that are harder to maintain and prone to bugs and security holes. Blockchain.io will attract high volume traders with specific features such as a FIX API and a borrowing facility, but also with the high level of availability of the trading platform. Processing capacity in the first phase will be of up to 2 million orders per day.   Select Digital Currencies  Cryptocurrencies will be listed on the trading platform following a strict vetting process (sustainability, technical, and deep protocol review) by our team of blockchain experts. Regular updates and publications will inform platform stakeholders and the community through altcoin technical reviews and financial analyses.  ICO Execution & Token Listing  Blockchain.io will provide ICO campaign support and token listing services to assist entrepreneurs and technologists in the planning and execution of their fundraising campaigns. Following the ICO campaigns, Blockchain.io will ensure that newly created tokens are listed on Blockchain.io to provide liquidity to investors and traders. In addition, Blockchain.io will create Token liquidity through: Market making using Blockchain.io’s inventory Incentive program for Paymium users.   http://tinyimg.io/i/Ax2ksCc.png  Blockchain.io is driven by the highly experienced team of cryptocurrency experts who, seven years ago, founded Paymium, a fiat/bitcoin exchange catering to the underserved Euro market. Blockchain.io shares Paymium’s highest security, reliability, and accountability standards.

I want to thank you for all founder and all people who envolved on this project both in directly and inderectly.  Let me reinform the statement of this project revies as below : Ultra-Secure & Decentralized      The centralized part of the exchange offers highly secure custody services with cold storage and cryptographic proof of reserve.     Cryptocurrencies are held in cold storage (offline) for at least 98% of reserves.     A cold wallet access requires multiple signatures.     A cold wallet private key is split and held in a number of different vaults in multiple locations.     Other in-house security processes and technological features.     Internal procedures protect the exchange from social engineering attacks. Periodic technical audits and timestamped logs allow detection of any tampering attempts in the accounting database.     Periodic financial audits verify that the inventory of coins (assets side) matches the records of liabilities with cryptographic proof. If the exchange’s customer balances are checked against a blockchain inventory of coins (utxos in Bitcoin language) every block interval, there is little or no room for a rogue intruder to alter database records with profit.     Decentralized settlement relies on fair-exchange protocols allowing atomic swaps of cryptocurrencies to eliminate the counter-party risk inherent to a custodial exchange.   Fully Compliant & Transparent      Exhaustive accounting records are audited by independent professional auditors to ensure the integrity of the trading platform.     The exchange aims to comply with all current applicable EU regulations, ensuring that assets never get seized or frozen.     Customer balances on the liability side must match exactly the inventory of coins held by the exchange. Blockchain.io aims to perform such balance check and to publish its cryptographic proof at every block interval.    Reliable Infrastructure      Minimal downtime, typically restricted to server maintenance, application upgrades, or database migration.     Resilience under high volume, heavy traffic conditions, or DDoS attacks.     No technical debt: exchanges that quickly add new altcoins or new features without proper testing or careful software design accumulate technical debt by taking shortcuts. Technical debt translates into applications that are harder to maintain and prone to bugs and security holes.     Blockchain.io will attract high volume traders with specific features such as a FIX API and a borrowing facility, but also with the high level of availability of the trading platform.     Processing capacity in the first phase will be of up to 2 million orders per day.    Select Digital Currencies      Cryptocurrencies will be listed on the trading platform following a strict vetting process (sustainability, technical, and deep protocol review) by our team of blockchain experts.     Regular updates and publications will inform platform stakeholders and the community through altcoin technical reviews and financial analyses.   ICO Execution & Token Listing      Blockchain.io will provide ICO campaign support and token listing services to assist entrepreneurs and technologists in the planning and execution of their fundraising campaigns.     Following the ICO campaigns, Blockchain.io will ensure that newly created tokens are listed on Blockchain.io to provide liquidity to investors and traders.  In addition, Blockchain.io will create Token liquidity through:      Market making using Blockchain.io’s inventory     Incentive program for Paymium users.  At last, there is no mistake in every project to be learned, so lets do and evaluate any steps and activities on this project as well for improvement and perfection of our goal and target.

As of today, thousands of Crypto Exchange has been creating and appearing more and more day by day, BUT, besides to some successful ones such as Binance, Kucoin, Okex... most of them are just like SCAM and not reliable. Some found out to be ""Easy to deposit in - Really hard to withdraw out"" etc.  Thus far, I really hope you guys can do much better and provide to the Crypto Currencies worldwide a better solutions and many opportunities to gain our investment with a Fast, Safe, Transparent, Reliable Infrastructure and User-Friendly flatform.  Further more, there also be an ICO service where to provide ICO token liquidity via listing on blockchain.io at the outset of the ICO. This is more than exciting since new tokens can be listed, traded directly on your new exchange flatform.  It's also very smart that you guys will provide a Prop & peer-to-peer lending where traders can borrow money from other platform users or from the blockchain.io central inventory for larger amounts and a Margin trading in which people can borrow to open leveraged (or not) long or short positions guaranteed with a security margin. Let's imagine how mush money we can make via these methods.  I only have a proposal for your consideration is that to use your Native tokens as a bind to users, of which people can receive more promotions by keeping, storing, staking and trading your own Native tokens. That will definitely gain users' interest in your exchange flatform for sure.  Last but not least, wish Team all the best luck, health to grow the community. In God we trust ^^",False

In the same way as the Internet redefined global communication, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are now reinventing money and value transactions. It have been more benefit for partners. Before Bitcoin, money was defined by State sovereignty over a territory. From now on, any community can mint its own money in form of a cryptocurrency or digital token and start trading without any central supervising authority. In 2017 alone, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) raised around $5 billion. Each project was financed by a community of token holders who became its ambassadors. There are now already tens of millions of token holders. Digital tokens are like better, smarter cash. They are programmable money. Immediately liquid, indefinitely fragmentable, and instantly transferable, they can be programmed to meet the needs of particular assets, rights, goods, or services or of specific communities. The coming years will see a multitude of cryptocurrencies. New cryptographic developments and payment applications will allow us to transact in all these currencies, with the traditional ""fiat"" currencies retaining their role as price anchors. Exchanges will be the marketplaces where cryptocurrencies will be traded against each other and with fiat currencies. Cryptocurrency exchanges will be the bridges between blockchains powered by Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptographic protocols. We confidently expect the Internet of Value to gain mass adoption, just as the free peerto-peer networks that preceded it on the Internet, namely email and the Web, did. Bitcoin introduces a platform on which you can run currency as an application on a network without any central points of control. A system completely decentralized like the internet itself.

We are happy to hear that you find our advisory board impressive. Regarding our team, we only displayed C-Level team members on this thread. In the manifesto, please note that we did not mention all members of our team (both those in tech and on the marketing side) because we are running an exchange and we need to keep some members anonymous as failsafes. It's true that we could have mentioned their presence.  I respectfully disagree concerning your remarks about the team. The project here is building an exchange; not a blockchain. Our team is composed of exchange experts from both the crypto-sphere and the traditional financial world. To remove any doubts about our capabilities, the Blockchain.io platform is currently being developed as we speak. The Alpha is planned for June 2018 and the Beta for late July. Early investors will get access to Alpha & Beta.  Concerning volume, the situation will shift soon. We are currently working with a French bank and are constrained by French banking regulation, which is one of the strictest in the world. The banking cartel is very strong and proactively undermines our business. Following our migration to a different banking partner, they have imposed uncompetitive funding limits (10K€/year), preventing any significant high-volume traders from boosting volume and fueling platform liquidity. We are currently working on an alternative banking solution in Europe, and we plan to add USD & JPY to our bitcoin exchange. We are confident that volume will be back on Paymium once this is settled.  On the profitability side, please note that we have been operating a bitcoin exchange since 2011, thus we have significant reserves. The two previous years have been good regarding volume. The last few months have been tough, but we still largely benefited from the price rally of 2016 and especially that of last year. When considering hacking, this is one of our main concerns. 24H volume has little bearing on the funds held on our platform. With around 200,000 users, hackers will certainly try something, but we have developed very high security standards (more than 98% of cold storage), keeping our customers' funds safe.  Concerning the Blockchain.io exchange, our main exclusive feature is decentralized settlement. Blockchain.io will offer the possibility to settle trades without giving the custody of coins, which erases the last potential point-of-failure. Order Books will remain centralized, guaranteeing high-performance matching and liquid markets. Of course, this feature will be optional, as it could not fit some user profiles, such as market-makers (who prefer velocity over high security). Moreover, Blockchain.io will also offer basic & advanced trade orders from the start. In the long run, we plan to implement margin trading and peer-to-peer lending. Please check out our roadmap at this end of the thread.  Last, but not least, Blockchain.io will have a strong focus on institutions. We believe that ICOs will become the main way to raise funds, and that large companies will approach us to launch their respective tokens for new product launches. Our team is highly experienced and has strong connections in the traditional financial world, therefore, we are aiming to become the primary interlocutor for such companies. Blockchain.io will offer its expertise and knowledge to provide complete ICO services, from planning and execution to token listing on our platform.  Please feel free to ask further questions if you have any. In all, development is ongoing, but coming along very well.  Thank you very much. The Blockchain.io Team",False

They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests.[32] The result is a robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double spending. Blockchains have been described as a value-exchange protocol.[21] This blockchain-based exchange of value can be completed quicker, safer and cheaper than with traditional systems.[33] A blockchain can assign title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance",False

Lorsque vous tradez, finalement, tout ce que vous faites c'est échangé des « titre de propriétés ». Les tokens ne sont transféré à l'utilisateur que lorsqu'il quitte l'exchange. C'est d'ailleurs pour cette raison que vous ne détenez pas vos token, chez binance et co, vous n'avez qu'un droit à recevoir des tokens si vous le souhaitez.     Ainsi l'inconvénient semble évident, si l'exchange pour x raison ferme ou se fait hack ou autre, vous n'aurez plus vos token et vous devrez commencez une longue procédure pour espérer recevoir quelque chose en dédommagement, cf MtGox .     Les exchange décentralisé, DEX, sont à l'opposé de leurs cousins. Si vous ne connaissez pas, imaginez simplement que vous tradez depuis votre wallet directement vers le wallet d'une autre personne, c'est à dire de pair à pair. Vos ordres ne passent pas par une entité centrale. Lorsque vous effectué un ordre d'achat/vente c'est un contrat qui est casté sur la blockchain et si une personne est intéressé elle remplie votre contrat et conclut la vente/achat.    Se faisant, plusieurs difficultés apparaissent, tout d'abord vous êtes le responsable. Vous détenez vos clés privée et donc vos tokens (c'est littéralement comme si vous tradiez depuis votre wallet, cf Metamask et Etherdelta) ainsi le premier risque est la perte de vos token. Une autre difficulté réside dans la lenteur. Si vous avez déjà utilisé un DEX vous remarquerez qu'un ordre prend environ 1 à 2 minute pour être casté. Ce délai augmente en fonction du token et de sa blockchain, par exemple si vous utilisez du bitcoin il vous faudra 10min (correspondant au délai de confirmation du block)     Toutefois, l'avantage est évident lui aussi, vous détenez vos token et le risque de hack est bien moins grands voir nulle. Mais voilà ils sont horrible, aussi bien au niveau du visuel que de l'utilisation, si vous êtes novices je vous conseil de regarder d'abord des tutos.     Ce qui nous mène à blockchain.io, ils souhaite le plus simplement du monde incorporer les deux. C'est à dire qu'il sera possible de switcher, l'exchange aura deux facettes, l'un centralisé si vous avez besoin de rapidité et l'autre décentralisé si vous avez besoin de sécurité. Vous pouvez passez de l'un à l'autre directement depuis l'exchange. C'est un bon compromis : si vous tradez sur une coutre durée, centralisé et si vous tradez sur une longue durée, décentralisé.",False

Transactions can be executed on smart contracts and atomic swaps using what is known as Hashed TimeLock Contracts (HTLCs).  DEXs are less vulnerable to attacks because corrupting a peer-to-peer blockchain would require an exceptional amount of energy, which is discouraging to most. A group of miners would have to take control of more than 50% of the network’s mining hash rate to own the blockchain and embezzle funds.  DEXs are still in their infancy. They are not as user-friendly as CEXs. They do not offer as many functionalities, nor do they offer the same liquidity. But they do offer the level of security and transparency that the first 2008 bitcoin enthusiasts expected. Does this mean that all cryptocurrency traders should let go of their CEX accounts? Definitely not. A cryptocurrency trader should have it all: liquidity, low-latency and security. So how can he or she manage to accomplish this?  Centralized exchanges with decentralized settlement offer both liquidity and stronger security A new generation of exchange platforms, combining the technology of a centralized custodial exchange with a decentralized “trustless” cross-chain “fair exchange” settlement might very well be the best solution. Users enjoy the efficiency of a low-latency, fully-featured centralized exchange when they need quick and liquid trading for exchanging big volumes, and they are able to turn to decentralized options if they feel like settling a transaction without the supervision of a third party, and thus, without counterparty risk.

There's a lot of useless coins that get listed nowadays. Also a very experienced team working on this wich gives me alot of confidence that their goals will be achieved. I also like the fact that users can securely trade any type of assets, rights, goods, or services that is of value to them in a decentralized value network, ofcourse without supervision by a central authority. Another thing i like is that they will combine the efficiency of a low-latency full-featured centralized exchange with decentralized “trustless” cross-chain settlement. The project leverages the latest developments in cross-chain atomic swaps, cryptographic protocols, and payment networks such as Lightning and Raiden. These developments will overcome the scalability issues of decentralized blockchains, allow transactions across heterogenous blockchains, increase the speed and lower the cost of these transactions, making them ready for mass adoption.

Blockchain.io has a super secure and decentralized exchange that is also fully compliant and transparent to customers and governments by having exceptional accounting, auditing and maintaining EU regulation compliance. The will have a guaranteed backing of all assets held on their reliable infrastructure. Another cool aspect is how they plan on only selecting certain currencies through a vetting process to ensure quality and high value trading. When pairing this along with their select ICO releases that they also plan on releasing on their platform, I believe they will offer a huge and hidden value to many investors using their services. Besides all of the features that make them unique and stand out from the crowd, most exchanges have produced a 10x multiple since their ICO and I don't see why Blockchain.io would be any different.

We are happy to hear that you find our advisory board impressive. Regarding our team, we only displayed C-Level team members on this thread. In the manifesto, please note that we did not mention all members of our team (both those in tech and on the marketing side) because we are running an exchange and we need to keep some members anonymous as failsafes. It's true that we could have mentioned their presence.  I respectfully disagree concerning your remarks about the team. The project here is building an exchange; not a blockchain. Our team is composed of exchange experts from both the crypto-sphere and the traditional financial world. To remove any doubts about our capabilities, the Blockchain.io platform is currently being developed as we speak. The Alpha is planned for June 2018 and the Beta for late July. Early investors will get access to Alpha & Beta.  Concerning volume, the situation will shift soon. We are currently working with a French bank and are constrained by French banking regulation, which is one of the strictest in the world. The banking cartel is very strong and proactively undermines our business. Following our migration to a different banking partner, they have imposed uncompetitive funding limits (10K€/year), preventing any significant high-volume traders from boosting volume and fueling platform liquidity. We are currently working on an alternative banking solution in Europe, and we plan to add USD & JPY to our bitcoin exchange. We are confident that volume will be back on Paymium once this is settled.  On the profitability side, please note that we have been operating a bitcoin exchange since 2011, thus we have significant reserves. The two previous years have been good regarding volume. The last few months have been tough, but we still largely benefited from the price rally of 2016 and especially that of last year. When considering hacking, this is one of our main concerns. 24H volume has little bearing on the funds held on our platform. With around 200,000 users, hackers will certainly try something, but we have developed very high security standards (more than 98% of cold storage), keeping our customers' funds safe.  Concerning the Blockchain.io exchange, our main exclusive feature is decentralized settlement. Blockchain.io will offer the possibility to settle trades without giving the custody of coins, which erases the last potential point-of-failure. Order Books will remain centralized, guaranteeing high-performance matching and liquid markets. Of course, this feature will be optional, as it could not fit some user profiles, such as market-makers (who prefer velocity over high security). Moreover, Blockchain.io will also offer basic & advanced trade orders from the start. In the long run, we plan to implement margin trading and peer-to-peer lending. Please check out our roadmap at this end of the thread.  Last, but not least, Blockchain.io will have a strong focus on institutions. We believe that ICOs will become the main way to raise funds, and that large companies will approach us to launch their respective tokens for new product launches. Our team is highly experienced and has strong connections in the traditional financial world, therefore, we are aiming to become the primary interlocutor for such companies. Blockchain.io will offer its expertise and knowledge to provide complete ICO services, from planning and execution to token listing on our platform.  Please feel free to ask further questions if you have any. In all, development is ongoing, but coming along very well.  Thank you very much. The Blockchain.io Team",False

The Blockchain.io project aims to be a European crypto currency exchange of trust for individual and institutional traders and investors.  Already registered with the SEC, the Blockchain.io platform aims to ""combine a centralised custodial exchange with a decentralised 'trustless' cross chain 'fair exchange' settlement. The centralised exchange will be low latency and full featured, with custody services, centralised order booking and efficient order matching"".  The decentralised cross-chain settlement will be based on cross chain atomic swaps, that is: cryptographic protocols that allow users to settle transactions across heterogeneous (diverse, mixed, different) blockchain networks without a third-party and without counterparty risk.  Already in place, Blockchain.io has an extensive team of developers, a growing list of partners and an abundance of advisors.  If you would like to find out more about the Blockchain.io project or would like to sign up for the whitelist, you can do so by following this link https://blockchain.io/. Make sure to enter a valid email address.  Blockchain.io definitely has great scope for a successful future with a great looking team and project.

After participating to the airdrop of another interesting project (I posted about it earlier) I am now noticing that airdrops have been substantially replaced by bounties. Initially, I did not like bounties because they tend to transform interested users into spammers. Yet, I have used some bounty as a way of trying to get some remuneration for the time spent reading about new ICOs, so I started liking them more.  Lately, I have noticed that most bounties, including blockchain.io, are using the ""entries"" system. I am generally interested in ICOs of interesting blockchain technology applications to real-life problems. Blockchain.io, however, appears to be an application to crypto coins market itself, as it seems to propose a new combination of exchange and other similar services. It is not my principal subject of interest, but I would still like to know a bit about it. So I have started the bounty, of which this post is task #11, but I must admit that up to here I did not learn anything about the actual project yet.  This is a direct consequence of how the bounty of blockchain.io is structured. The standardization of bounties provided by the airdrop.xxx.xxx websites (I guess section of vyper.io) is transforming bounties in a new type of marketing assembly line, made by a combination of mechanical tasks. At the moment, I am not very happy about it.  One interesting aspect of this bounty is that the BCIO token is currently worth €0.70, and the rewards attainable go from 20.000 to 15 tokens, and higher values do not seem to difficult to reach.

I was pleased to see Blockchain.io's airdrop format, as I noticed some unique tasks that allow interested parties to earn extra tokens/rewards for tasks that aren't usually found with other airdrops.  For example, the fact that there are Twitter tasks to follow the CEO and CMO of the blockchain.io community is a wonderful idea! As I was doing research on blockchain.io I noticed a new term they mentioned, ""Internet of Value.""  It was the first time I heard anything about the Internet of Value and upon further research I noticed that it, ""enables users to securely trade assets, rights, goods, and services, globally and around the clock, without the involvement of a centralized authority, or traditional financial intermediaries, or so-called ‘trusted’ third-parties."" Blockchain.io is your gateway to the Internet of Value. In the coming Internet of value, decentralized blockchain-operated value networks will become mainstream and compliant, enabling billions of Internet users to exchange value as quickly and as easily as they exchange information today. Multiple cryptocurrencies will co-exist. Each cryptocurrency will serve the needs of a community of users to securely trade any type of assets, rights, goods, or services thatis of value to them in a decentralized value network, i.e. without supervision by a central authority. As a cryptocurrency exchange, Blockchain.io will play a major role in the Internet of Value’s ecosystem. It will be the marketplace where cryptocurrencies will be traded against each other, a gateway to and a bridge across the multiple value networks powered by different blockchains/cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). Blockchain.io will combine the efficiency of a low-latency full-featured centralized exchange with decentralized “trustless” cross-chain settlement. The project leverages the latest developments in cross-chain atomic swaps, cryptographic protocols, and payment networks such as Lightning and Raiden. These developments will overcome the scalability issues of decentralized blockchains, allow transactions across heterogenous blockchains, increase the speed and lower the cost of these transactions, making them ready for mass adoption. Blockchain.io is driven by the highly experienced team of cryptocurrency experts who, seven years ago, founded Paymium, a fiat/bitcoin exchange catering to the underserved Euro market. Blockchain.io shares Paymium’s highest security, reliability, and accountability standards. It strives to overcome the shortcomings of rival crypto exchanges that have repeatedly caused severe losses for issuers and token holders. To achieve this, the team relies on its advanced knowledge of cryptographic technology, its operational in-depth understanding of the crypto world, and a strong company culture committed to security and compliance",False

It must be said that crypto-currencies are a very new type of Financial instrument that can be sometime misleading for new investors. I believe that the real question, as for any investment in a Financial product, is ""what is the underlying asset made for"" or ""what is the actual value proposition of this company"". In the case of Blockchain.io, we have a real vision, a strong leader (well established in the crypto-world) as well as a real team of professionals, and the Financial strength to support such a project. Blockhain.io offers new forms of financial liquidity to companies that want to raise money for their startup project. At the end of the day, we are talking about real value creation (as new startup companies create products, services and jobs). This is the most important factor that make me believe that this company is completely viable, compared to other companies that may offer, at a first glance a similar value proposition, but are in fact, only based on speculation (as no actual service or products are linked to it). In the next future, I believe that a significant part of these cryptocurrencies (that are created every day at an unimaginable speed), will disappear due to this lack of real utility, which is not the case of Blockchain.io.

Indeed, with its intelligent and secure exchange system, Blockchain.io will ""democratize"" the crypto-exchange and trading. In this blockchain and decentralized technology, a lot of problems are settled. In the past, companies needed to store files and have access to processing power for applications with a wide network bandwidth to adapt to daily use. Now, the Blockchain is introducing the second iteration of the computational structure. Through a distributed ledger system, Blockchain has created computational networks that are secure, immutable and democratic. This could lead to non-hackable web programs and services, transparent networks and greater system reliability.

O seguinte pode ser encontrado em detalhes em nosso Whitepaper. O abaixo serve como uma introdução para investidores e comerciantes sobre o que eles podem esperar.  O que é um token BCIO?  Então, você pode estar se perguntando o que exatamente será a moeda blockchain.io e como ela será usada. As moedas Blockchain.io são chamadas de fichas BCIO. Os Tokens da BCIO são moedas de utilidade, projetadas para fornecer uma experiência suave e segura para operadores e usuários de criptomoedas em nossa plataforma de negociação.  Estamos determinando 200 milhões de tokens BC O mercado global de criptomoedas começou em 2018 com um estrondo, alcançando um recorde de US $ 700 bilhões em capitalização de mercado. Todos os sinais apontam para um mercado de troca de criptomoedas cada vez maior, à medida que novos operadores de criptografia continuam participando das trocas.  À luz disso, vamos dar uma olhada nos mecanismos de troca de criptomoedas. Ao fazê-lo, abordarei as diferenças básicas entre o mercado de câmbio (forex) e as trocas de criptomoedas, para que os recém-chegados à criptografia de transações possam saber o que esperar.  Quais são os ativos? Fiat e moeda criptografada são considerados dinheiro. Ambos podem ser usados para comprar bens e serviços e transferir valor, ambos são considerados tão bons quanto os respectivos sistemas que os apóiam e, é claro, ambos podem ser negociados em trocas.  Quais são algumas das principais diferenças? Embora criptomoedas sejam usadas da mesma forma que moeda fiduciária, elas não têm o status de moeda legal em muitas nações. Isso, no entanto, não impediu que várias grandes empresas internacionais aceitassem criptomoedas como dinheiro para comprar seus produtos, nem afetou o crescimento constante da negociação de criptografia.  Claro, não ser uma moeda legal significa não ser apoiado por um banco central ou governo, o que por sua vez afeta a forma como entendemos o valor e o uso dessas duas formas de dinheiro.  O valor de uma moeda fiduciária deriva de várias partes do aparato econômico de uma nação, incluindo política monetária e fiscal, força de trabalho, bens e serviços, reservas de ouro, dívida em relação ao PIB ... a lista continua.  O valor da criptomoeda não deriva de um aparelho. Pelo contrário, deriva de uma rede, isto é, os indivíduos que distribuem a moeda. É por isso que Andreas Antonopoulos explica isso bem ao descrever o bitcoin, por exemplo, ao dizer que não é tanto dinheiro para a Internet tanto quanto ""a Internet do dinheiro"".  Com relação ao uso, as transações feitas com moedas fiduciárias, especialmente transações fiat digitais, concedem às autoridades centrais acesso aos hábitos de consumo de um indivíduo, enquanto as criptomoedas, sendo verdadeiras para o seu nome, concedem anonimato aos usuários.  Portanto, se o valor e a transferência dos mesmos forem diferentes entre essas duas formas de dinheiro, daí resultaria que a maneira pela qual negociamos essas moedas seria diferente.  Por exemplo, uma autoridade central pode, por decreto - sem trocadilhos - ditar o valor de sua moeda. Isso não é possível com a criptomoeda. Seus respectivos valores são de natureza distributiva. Por essa razão, uma moeda criptografada pode ser negociada a um preço em uma troca e a um preço diferente em outra. Isso se deve principalmente à falta de consenso sobre o volume de comércio de uma moeda, que pode ser maior ou menor dependendo da bolsa. Como a quantidade de moedas negociadas em cada bolsa é apenas uma parte do número total de moedas em circulação, é mais difícil obter um consenso sobre o preço de cada moeda - particularmente sem o envolvimento de uma autoridade central.",False

This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions inexpensively. A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests. The result is a robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double spending. Blockchains have been described as a value-exchange protocol.

Essential Features   Ultra-Secure & Decentralized  The centralized part of the exchange offers highly secure custody services with cold storage and cryptographic proof of reserve. Cryptocurrencies are held in cold storage (offline) for at least 98% of reserves. A cold wallet access requires multiple signatures. A cold wallet private key is split and held in a number of different vaults in multiple locations. Other in-house security processes and technological features. Internal procedures protect the exchange from social engineering attacks. Periodic technical audits and timestamped logs allow detection of any tampering attempts in the accounting database. Periodic financial audits verify that the inventory of coins (assets side) matches the records of liabilities with cryptographic proof. If the exchange’s customer balances are checked against a blockchain inventory of coins (utxos in Bitcoin language) every block interval, there is little or no room for a rogue intruder to alter database records with profit. Decentralized settlement relies on fair-exchange protocols allowing atomic swaps of cryptocurrencies to eliminate the counter-party risk inherent to a custodial exchange.  Fully Compliant & Transparent  Exhaustive accounting records are audited by independent professional auditors to ensure the integrity of the trading platform. The exchange aims to comply with all current applicable EU regulations, ensuring that assets never get seized or frozen. Customer balances on the liability side must match exactly the inventory of coins held by the exchange. Blockchain.io aims to perform such balance check and to publish its cryptographic proof at every block interval.   Reliable Infrastructure  Minimal downtime, typically restricted to server maintenance, application upgrades, or database migration. Resilience under high volume, heavy traffic conditions, or DDoS attacks. No technical debt: exchanges that quickly add new altcoins or new features without proper testing or careful software design accumulate technical debt by taking shortcuts. Technical debt translates into applications that are harder to maintain and prone to bugs and security holes. Blockchain.io will attract high volume traders with specific features such as a FIX API and a borrowing facility, but also with the high level of availability of the trading platform. Processing capacity in the first phase will be of up to 2 million orders per day.   Select Digital Currencies  Cryptocurrencies will be listed on the trading platform following a strict vetting process (sustainability, technical, and deep protocol review) by our team of blockchain experts. Regular updates and publications will inform platform stakeholders and the community through altcoin technical reviews and financial analyses.  ICO Execution & Token Listing  Blockchain.io will provide ICO campaign support and token listing services to assist entrepreneurs and technologists in the planning and execution of their fundraising campaigns. Following the ICO campaigns, Blockchain.io will ensure that newly created tokens are listed on Blockchain.io to provide liquidity to investors and traders. In addition, Blockchain.io will create Token liquidity through: Market making using Blockchain.io’s inventory Incentive program for Paymium users.

Targeted to develop 200 Million BCIO tokens for use, of which 60% is going to be made available during the token sale, 4% is reserved for the advisors, 16% of the token is locked for the team, giving out 5% for airdrop and ecosystem incentives for the community, and the remaining 15% is used for the inventory.  There are many crypto exchanges, but that has not totally eliminated the challenges faced by the users and traders which often lead to users creating several trading accounts in different exchanges looking to bridge the gap in achieving their desired crypto pairs or even the Fiat currencies they may be needing. But here on the Blockchain.io, there are several features offered to traders to concentrate their attention on the Blockchain.io making it almost unnecessary to have other crypto trading accounts on other exchanges.  The Blockchain.io in addition to the Fair exchange also provides a decentralized settlement together with the proof of work, proof of stake, Fiat currencies trading and a DAG coins (Direct Acyclic Graph which currently stands as a possible competitor to the blockchain in that it is capable of making new cryptocurrencies while overcoming some of the issues inherent to blockchain tech.), each of these features makes it possible for a trader to either choose to stake his coins for a long term trading and still get incentives from the platform or perform certain task and earn more, all this are not found in other crypto exchange which is why we believe that the unique features here will attract larger audiences.

My next question is regarding the cold storage service that you will offer, how will you implement that? It will be a kind of vault? Will it be available for all cryptocurrencies in the exchange or just for some of them?

They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests.[32] The result is a robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double spending. Blockchains have been described as a value-exchange protocol.[21] This blockchain-based exchange of value can be completed quicker, safer and cheaper than with traditional systems.[33] A blockchain can assign title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.[34][35]",False

If it's just the settlement that is decentralized (which is my understanding of how it's meant to work), bcio will have hard time differentiating itself from already established exchanges. That would make it significantly too centralized to be listed among DEX exchanges, and at the same time we already have some hundred fifty centralized exchanges, some of which are already legally compliant. Not saying it's not possible to one-up vast majority of them, since some of the top 20 exchanges are pretty new, bcio definitely has a shot at joining them if the project is executed succesfully. It would have some advantages of a DEX, while having the compliance of a centralized exchange. It is a major selling point to some. Stuff like p2p lending also seems great on paper.

In the same way as the Internet redefined global communication, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are now reinventing money and value transactions. Before Bitcoin, money was defined by State sovereignty over a territory. From now on, any community can mint its own money in form of a cryptocurrency or digital token and start trading without any central supervising authority. In 2017 alone, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) raised around $5 billion. Each project was financed by a community of token holders who became its ambassadors. There are now already tens of millions of token holders. Digital tokens are like better, smarter cash. They are programmable money. Immediately liquid, indefinitely fragmentable, and instantly transferable, they can be programmed to meet the needs of particular assets, rights, goods, or services or of specific communities. The coming years will see a multitude of cryptocurrencies. New cryptographic developments and payment applications will allow us to transact in all these currencies, with the traditional ""fiat"" currencies retaining their role as price anchors. Exchanges will be the marketplaces where cryptocurrencies will be traded against each other and with fiat currencies. Cryptocurrency exchanges will be the bridges between blockchains powered by Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptographic protocols. We confidently expect the Internet of Value to gain mass adoption, just as the free peerto-peer networks that preceded it on the Internet, namely email and the Web, did. Bitcoin introduces a platform on which you can run currency as an application on a network without any central points of control. A system completely decentralized like the internet itself. It is not money for the internet but the internet of money. — Andreas Antonopoulos “ 7 Manifesto May 2018 The Internet of Value will trigger new waves of innovation in financial systems and beyond.

They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests The result is a robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double spending.

Good luck with your project and ICO!  Here is more info about Blockchain.io: In the coming Internet of value, decentralized blockchain-operated value networks will become mainstream and compliant, enabling billions of Internet users to exchange value as quickly and as easily as they exchange information today.  Multiple cryptocurrencies will co-exist. Each cryptocurrency will serve the needs of a community of users to securely trade any type of assets, rights, goods, or services that is of value to them in a decentralized value network, i.e. without supervision by a central authority. As a cryptocurrency exchange, Blockchain.io will play a major role in the Internet of Values ecosystem. It will be the marketplace where cryptocurrencies will be traded against each other, a gateway to and a bridge across the multiple value networks powered by different blockchains/cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).  Blockchain.io will combine the efficiency of a low-latency full-featured centralized exchange with decentralized “trustless” cross-chain settlement. The project leverages the latest developments in cross-chain atomic swaps, cryptographic protocols, and payment networks such as Lightning and Raiden. These developments will overcome the scalability issues of decentralized blockchains, allow transactions across heterogenous blockchains, increase the speed and lower the cost of these transactions, making them ready for mass adoption.  Blockchain.io is driven by the highly experienced team of cryptocurrency experts who, seven years ago, founded Paymium, a fiat/bitcoin exchange catering to the underserved Euro market. Blockchain.io shares Paymium’s highest security, reliability, and accountability standards. It strives to overcome the shortcomings of rival crypto exchanges that have repeatedly caused severe losses for issuers and token holders. To achieve this, the team relies on its advanced knowledge of cryptographic technology, its operational in-depth understanding of the crypto world, and a strong company culture committed to security and compliance.  Together with Paymium, Blockchain.io aims to become the leading cryptographic exchange in Europe by 2020.",False

The internet of value enables users to securely trade assets, rights, goods and services, globally and around the clock, without the involvement of a centralized authority, or traditional financial intermediaries, or so called ‘trusted’ third-parties.  The Internet of value is built on multiple decentralized, automated, transparent, and secure blockchain-based value networks. Different networks operate different versions of the blockchain, which in turn are fueled by different cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, or Litecoin. Each network meets the needs of certain types of transactions, such as high-value payments or title registry, or the needs of specific trading communities, such as a network of autonomous objects or an industry sector  As the number of cryptocurrencies grows, cryptocurrency exchanges become the marketplaces for listing and trading cryptocurrencies. In the current context, users mainly buy cryptocurrencies as a store of value, in anticipation of a future value increase. As exchanges list multiple cryptocurrencies in one place, supply information about them, enable comparisons, and set bid/ask prices according to demand, they help separate the valuable cryptocurrencies from the useless ones. Investors become increasingly discriminate in their choices of cryptocurrencies as a store of value or as a utility token.  As technological and regulatory barriers to the Internet of value will be lifted, cryptocurrencies and decentralized value networks will gain mainstream acceptance. To trade on these different networks, users will need to buy multiple digital currencies and to exchange them as their needs evolve.  Blockchain.io will list a careful selection of cryptocurrencies: Proof-of-Work (POW) coins such as Bitcoin, Ether or Litecoin, Proof-of-Stake (POS) coins like Qtum or Stratis, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) coins, and other cryptographic protocols yet to be designed and minted.  Essential Features   Ultra-Secure & Decentralized   The centralized part of the exchange offers highly secure custody services with cold storage and cryptographic proof of reserve.Cryptocurrencies are held in cold storage (offline) for at least 98% of reserves. A cold wallet access requires multiple signatures.  A cold wallet private key is split and held in a number of different vaults in multiple locations.  Other in-house security processes and technological features.Internal procedures protect the exchange from social engineering attacks. Periodic technical audits and timestamped logs allow detection of any tampering attempts in the accounting database.Periodic financial audits verify that the inventory of coins (assets side) matches the records of liabilities with cryptographic proof. If the exchange’s customer balances are checked against a blockchain inventory of coins (utxos in Bitcoin language) every block interval, there is little or no room for a rogue intruder to alter database records with profit.Decentralized settlement relies on fair-exchange protocols allowing atomic swaps of cryptocurrencies to eliminate the counter-party risk inherent to a custodial exchange.  Fully Compliant & Transparent   Exhaustive accounting records are audited by independent professional auditors to ensure the integrity of the trading platform.  The exchange aims to comply with all current applicable EU regulations, ensuring that assets never get seized or frozen.  Customer balances on the liability side must match exactly the inventory of coins held by the exchange. Blockchain.io aims to perform such balance check and to publish its cryptographic proof at every block interval.  Reliable Infrastructure   Minimal downtime, typically restricted to server maintenance, application upgrades, or database migration.Resilience under high volume, heavy traffic conditions, or DDoS attacks.No technical debt: exchanges that quickly add new altcoins or new features without proper testing or careful software design accumulate technical debt by taking shortcuts. Technical debt translates into applications that are harder to maintain and prone to bugs and security holes. Blockchain.io will attract high volume traders with specific features such as a FIX API and a borrowing facility, but also with the high level of availability of the trading platform.Processing capacity in the first phase will be of up to 2 million orders per day.  Select Digital Currencies   Cryptocurrencies will be listed on the trading platform following a strict vetting process (sustainability, technical, and deep protocol review) by our team of blockchain experts. Regular updates and publications will inform platform stakeholders and the community through altcoin technical reviews and financial analyses.  ICO Execution & Token Listing   Blockchain.io will provide ICO campaign support and token listing services to assist entrepreneurs and technologists in the planning and execution of their fundraising campaigns.Following the ICO campaigns, Blockchain.io will ensure that newly created tokens are listed on Blockchain.io to provide liquidity to investors and traders.  In addition, Blockchain.io will create Token liquidity through:  Market making using Blockchain.io’s inventoryIncentive program for Paymium users.   Blockchain.io is driven by the highly experienced team of cryptocurrency experts who, seven years ago, founded Paymium, a fiat/bitcoin exchange catering to the underserved Euro market. Blockchain.io shares Paymium’s highest security, reliability, and accountability standards. It strives to overcome the shortcomings of rival crypto exchanges that have repeatedly caused severe losses for issuers and token holders. To achieve this, the team relies on its advanced knowledge of cryptographic technology, its operational in-depth understanding of the crypto world, and a strong company culture committed to security and compliance.       We just released a Medium article about our Token, check it out and tell us The advisory board is awesome and very professional, however, I don't find the core team capable to achieve their goal. There are no experienced blockchain developers at all. You claim like Paymium exist since the 2011 and it is secure (hack proof), I bet it is with the 24k USD volume, who will be interested to hack it? Also, you claim it is profitable. How can it be profitable with such volume of trading?   There are good partners on board, one of them Kima Ventures who backed Ledger back in a days. I didn't study whitepaper tho, because I'm not impressed with the team.  On the profitability side, please note that we have been operating a bitcoin exchange since 2011, thus we have significant reserves. The two previous years have been good regarding volume. The last few months have been tough, but we still largely benefited from the price rally of 2016 and especially that of last year. When considering hacking, this is one of our main concerns. 24H volume has little bearing on the funds held on our platform. With around 200,000 users, hackers will certainly try something, but we have developed very high security standards (more than 98% of cold storage), keeping our customers' funds safe.  Concerning the Blockchain.io exchange, our main exclusive feature is decentralized settlement. Blockchain.io will offer the possibility to settle trades without giving the custody of coins, which erases the last potential point-of-failure. Order Books will remain centralized, guaranteeing high-performance matching and liquid markets. Of course, this feature will be optional, as it could not fit some user profiles, such as market-makers (who prefer velocity over high security). Moreover, Blockchain.io will also offer basic & advanced trade orders from the start. In the long run, we plan to implement margin trading and peer-to-peer lending. Please check out our roadmap at this end of the thread.  Last, but not least, Blockchain.io will have a strong focus on institutions. We believe that ICOs will become the main way to raise funds, and that large companies will approach us to launch their respective tokens for new product launche. The project here is building an exchange; not a blockchain. Our team is composed of exchange experts from both the crypto-sphere and the traditional financial world. To remove any doubts about our capabilities, the Blockchain.io platform is currently being developed as we speak. The Alpha is planned for June 2018 and the Beta for late July. Early investors will get access to Alpha & Beta.  Concerning volume, the situation will shift soon. We are currently working with a French bank and are constrained by French banking regulation, which is one of the strictest in the world. The banking cartel is very strong and proactively undermines our business. Following our migration to a different banking partner, they have imposed uncompetitive funding limits (10K€/year), preventing any significant high-volume traders from boosting volume and fueling platform liquidity. We are currently working on an alternative banking solution in Europe, and we plan to add USD & JPY to our bitcoin exchange. We are confident that volume will be back on Paymium once this is settled.  On the profitability side, please note that we have been operating a bitcoin exchange since 2011, thus we have significant reserves. The two previous years have been good regarding volume.

Thank you very much for this very interesting post and your exciting project.

In the case of Blockchain.io, we have a real vision, a strong leader (well established in the crypto-world) as well as a real team of professionals, and the Financial strength to support such a project. Blockhain.io offers new forms of financial liquidity to companies that want to raise money for their startup project. At the end of the day, we are talking about real value creation (as new startup companies create products, services and jobs). This is the most important factor that make me believe that this company is completely viable, compared to other companies that may offer, at a first glance a similar value proposition, but are in fact, only based on speculation (as no actual service or products are linked to it). In the next future, I believe that a significant part of these cryptocurrencies (that are created every day at an unimaginable speed), will disappear due to this lack of real utility, which is not the case of Blockchain.io.",False

Ultra secure, non custodial, reliable, fully compliant and transparent crypto exchange with institutional ICO and token listing services.  Blockchain.io coins are called BCIO Tokens. BCIO Tokens are utility coins, designed to provide a smooth and secure experience for cryptocurrency traders and users on our trading platform. Exchange will give you power to trade crypto to crypto, crypto to fiat trading, most of the exchanges with larger volumes don’t have crypto to fiat trading option leading to big hurdle in payout in fiat.

Blockchain.io offers highly secure custody services with cold storage and cryptographic proof of reserve with assets are held in cold storage (offline) for at least 98% of reserves. Wallet access requires multiple signatures and private key is split and held in a number of different vaults in multiple locations which protect the exchange from social engineering attacks monitored by Periodic technical audits and timestamped logs allow detection of any tampering attempts in the accounting database. Blockchain.io aims to perform such balance check and to publish its cryptographic proof at every block interval. Blockchain.io aims to comply with all current applicable EU regulations, ensuring that assets never get seized or frozen.  Exhaustive accounting records are audited by independent professional auditors to ensure the integrity of the trading platform.   Blockchain.io will attract high volume traders with specific features such as a FIX API and a borrowing facility, but also with the high level of availability of the trading platform. Processing capacity in the first phase will be of up to 2 million orders per day. Minimal downtime, typically restricted to server maintenance, application upgrades, or database migration. Resilience under high volume, heavy traffic conditions, or DDoS attacks will give you smooth trading experience with Blockchain.io. Regular updates and publications will inform platform stakeholders and the community through altcoin technical reviews and financial analyses.  Bliockchain.io will not only provide Cryptocurrency listing on the trading platform with strict vetting process (sustainability, technical, and deep protocol review by their team of blockchain experts) to provide liquidity to investors and traders but also provide ICO campaign support to assist entrepreneurs and technologists in the planning and execution of their fundraising campaigns. In addition, Blockchain.io will create Token liquidity through Market making using Blockchain.io’s inventory Incentive program for Paymium users.

They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests.[32] The result is a robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double spending. Blockchains have been described as a value-exchange protocol.[21] This blockchain-based exchange of value can be completed quicker, safer and cheaper than with traditional systems.[33] A blockchain can assign title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.[34][35]",False

Türkçeye Değerin İnterneti ya da Kıymetin İnterneti olarak çevirebileceğimiz yeni bir kavramla karşı karşıyayız; Value Of İnternet.  Bitcoin ve diğer kripto para birimleri artık para ve değer işlemlerini yeniden icat ediyor. Bitcoin’den önce, para bir bölge üzerindeki Devlet egemenliği tarafından tanımlanırdı. Şu andan itibaren, herhangi bir topluluk kendi parasını kripto para birimi veya dijital para şeklinde toplayabilir ve merkezi denetleme makamı olmadan işlem yapmaya başlayabilir. Sadece 2017 yılında, ICO dediğimiz yöntemle toplanan para yaklaşık 5 milyar dolar arttı. Her proje, temsilcileri olan bir token sahipleri topluluğu tarafından finanse edildi. Şu anda on milyonlarca holder dediğimiz insanlar var.  Bitcoin ve diğer dijital paralar daha iyi, daha akıllı nakit gibidir. Bunlar programlanabilir paradır. İstediğiniz gibi bölünebilir ve anında aktarılabilir, belirli varlıkların, hakların, malların veya hizmetlerin veya belirli toplulukların ihtiyaçlarını karşılayacak şekilde programlanabilirler.  Dijital geçişin en önemli sorunu “kazanan herkesi” kuralıyla oynanan uygulamaların merkezileştirilmesidir. Silikon Vadisi’ndeki yeni şirketler tarafından ortaya atılan fonlar, Avrupa’da gözlemlenenlerden genellikle on kat daha yüksek. Avrupa, Amerika Birleşik Devletleri’nin “dijital kolonisi” statüsünü koruyacak mı?  En çok veriyi merkezileştiren şirketler, algoritma kontrollü bir ekonominin başlangıcında zorlayıcı bir rekabet avantajına sahiptir. Veriler yapay zekanın hammaddesidir ve hatta dünyanın en iyi algoritması “büyük veriye” erişmeden istismar edilemez.  İşte tüm bu sebeplerden ötürü dijital paralar gelecekte çok daha fazla hayatımızda olacaklar. Siz de bu tufanda yerinizi erkenden almak istiyorsanız önemli projelerden biri olan blockchain.io yarışmasın katılıp görevleri yapıp daha çok kazanabilirsiniz.",False

Very promising project, I think that everyone who supports it will not remain without thanks. A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed and public digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that the record can not be retroactively changed without altering all subsequent blocks and network consensus. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double spending. Blockchains have been described as a value-exchange protocol.  I am an airdrop enthusiast so I sign up for quite a few airdrops on a daily basis. I was pleased to see Blockchain.io's airdrop format, as I noticed some unique tasks that allow interested parties to earn extra tokens/rewards for tasks that aren't usually found with other airdrops.  For example, the fact that there are Twitter tasks to follow the CEO and CMO of the blockchain.io community is a wonderful idea!  As I was doing research on blockchain.io I noticed a new term they mentioned, ""Internet of Value.""  It was the first time I heard anything about the Internet of Value and upon further research I noticed that it, ""enables users to securely trade assets, rights, goods, and services, globally and around the clock, without the involvement of a centralized authority, or traditional financial intermediaries, or so-called ‘trusted’ third-parties.""  Everyone has been crazy about the “Internet of Things” over the past 2 to 3 years.  I feel like we are still a long way from mass adoption.  However, I am hopeful that progress will continue.  I still have to do some more research on the concept of “Internet of Value” but I am very interested and will be investing a bit of my portfolio into this project.

Everyone has been crazy about the “Internet of Things” over the past 2 to 3 years.  I feel like we are still a long way from mass adoption.  However, I am hopeful that progress will continue.

Blockchain.io as the leading exchange in the Internet of Value will enable users to trade across all these value networks.[/size]  Cryptocurrency Exchanges Enable Users to Navigate the Internet of Value  Cryptocurrency exchanges enable users to trade across multiple value networks powered by heterogeneous blockchains.  As the number of cryptocurrencies grows, cryptocurrency exchanges become the marketplaces for listing and trading cryptocurrencies. In the current context, users mainly buy cryptocurrencies as a store of value, in anticipation of a future value increase. As exchanges list multiple cryptocurrencies in one place, supply information about them, enable comparisons, and set bid/ask prices according to demand, they help separate the valuable cryptocurrencies from the useless ones. Investors become increasingly discriminate in their choices of cryptocurrencies as a store of value or as a utility token.  As technological and regulatory barriers to the Internet of value will be lifted, cryptocurrencies and decentralized value networks will gain mainstream acceptance. To trade on these different networks, users will need to buy multiple digital currencies and to exchange them as their needs evolve.  Blockchain.io will list a careful selection of cryptocurrencies: Proof-of-Work (POW) coins such as Bitcoin, Ether or Litecoin, Proof-of-Stake (POS) coins like Qtum or Stratis, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) coins, and other cryptographic protocols yet to be designed and minted.  Essential Features http://tinyimg.io/i/bPKSdNn.png  Ultra-Secure & Decentralized  The centralized part of the exchange offers highly secure custody services with cold storage and cryptographic proof of reserve. Cryptocurrencies are held in cold storage (offline) for at least 98% of reserves. A cold wallet access requires multiple signatures. A cold wallet private key is split and held in a number of different vaults in multiple locations. Other in-house security processes and technological features. Internal procedures protect the exchange from social engineering attacks. Periodic technical audits and timestamped logs allow detection of any tampering attempts in the accounting database. Periodic financial audits verify that the inventory of coins (assets side) matches the records of liabilities with cryptographic proof. If the exchange’s customer balances are checked against a blockchain inventory of coins (utxos in Bitcoin language) every block interval, there is little or no room for a rogue intruder to alter database records with profit. Decentralized settlement relies on fair-exchange protocols allowing atomic swaps of cryptocurrencies to eliminate the counter-party risk inherent to a custodial exchange.  Fully Compliant & Transparent  Exhaustive accounting records are audited by independent professional auditors to ensure the integrity of the trading platform. The exchange aims to comply with all current applicable EU regulations, ensuring that assets never get seized or frozen. Customer balances on the liability side must match exactly the inventory of coins held by the exchange. Blockchain.io aims to perform such balance check and to publish its cryptographic proof at every block interval.   Reliable Infrastructure  Minimal downtime, typically restricted to server maintenance, application upgrades, or database migration. Resilience under high volume, heavy traffic conditions, or DDoS attacks. No technical debt: exchanges that quickly add new altcoins or new features without proper testing or careful software design accumulate technical debt by taking shortcuts. Technical debt translates into applications that are harder to maintain and prone to bugs and security holes. Blockchain.io will attract high volume traders with specific features such as a FIX API and a borrowing facility, but also with the high level of availability of the trading platform. Processing capacity in the first phase will be of up to 2 million orders per day.   Select Digital Currencies  Cryptocurrencies will be listed on the trading platform following a strict vetting process (sustainability, technical, and deep protocol review) by our team of blockchain experts. Regular updates and publications will inform platform stakeholders and the community through altcoin technical reviews and financial analyses.  ICO Execution & Token Listing  Blockchain.io will provide ICO campaign support and token listing services to assist entrepreneurs and technologists in the planning and execution of their fundraising campaigns. Following the ICO campaigns, Blockchain.io will ensure that newly created tokens are listed on Blockchain.io to provide liquidity to investors and traders. In addition, Blockchain.io will create Token liquidity through: Market making using Blockchain.io’s inventory Incentive program for Paymium users.   http://tinyimg.io/i/Ax2ksCc.png  Blockchain.io is driven by the highly experienced team of cryptocurrency experts who, seven years ago, founded Paymium, a fiat/bitcoin exchange catering to the underserved Euro market. Blockchain.io shares Paymium’s highest security, reliability, and accountability standards. It strives to overcome the shortcomings of rival crypto exchanges that have repeatedly caused severe losses for issuers and token holders. To achieve this, the team relies on its advanced knowledge of cryptographic technology, its operational in-depth understanding of the crypto world, and a strong company culture committed to security and compliance.

They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests.[32] The result is a robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double spending. Blockchains have been described as a value-exchange protocol.[21] This blockchain-based exchange of value can be completed quicker, safer and cheaper than with traditional systems.[33] A blockchain can assign title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.[34][35]",False

The advisory board is awesome and very professional, however, I don't find the core team capable to achieve their goal. There are no experienced blockchain developers at all. You claim like Paymium exist since the 2011 and it is secure (hack proof), I bet it is with the 24k USD volume, who will be interested to hack it? Also, you claim it is profitable. How can it be profitable with such volume of trading?  There are good partners on board, one of them Kima Ventures who backed Ledger back in a days.

Different networks operate different versions of the blockchain, which in turn are fueled by different cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, or Litecoin.

No longer does investment belong to the few and no longer does launching a project mean having to go through all the required conditions of Venture Capital investment. There are now multiple platforms where users can crowdfund their dreams and projects into reality.  In the Blockchain space, crowdfunding has become extremely popular. These campaigns usually occur in the form of ICOs (Initial Coin Offering), which consist in offering tokens from the project in exchange for Bitcoin, other cryptos or national currencies. ICOs have become so common that is not unusual to see a new one being launched more than once a week. However, it can be very hard to tell the good apart from the bad.  While there are projects that seek to solve this problem, like the Wings platform which is currently being developed. In this platform, projects are vetted by a decentralized community of WINGS token holders. These token holders can forecast the success of a certain project or its funding campaign, allowing investors to easily get a prediction of how successful a project can be without having to research it himself and without having to trust a single centralized entity.  However, Wings is still in development and even after its launch, some projects will continue to work outside of the platform, especially the shady ones. This is why we want to show our users how to successfully distinguish a real project from a scam.  Now, we can’t tell you if a certain project is worth investing in or not and we won’t tell you what to look for in order to find profitable ICOs. No, we are simply going to show you the markings that scam projects often carry so that you can avoid wasting your hard earned Bitcoins on them. With that being said, even honest projects can be a complete failure, so make sure you know what you’re doing and remember to never invest more than what you can afford to lose.",False

To be honest then it was friend of mine who told me about an airdrop from a “site”, I then got curious to see what it was and went to the site of Blochain.io After I’ve read the whitepapers which is detailed and quite easy to read and understand. Done some quick research and checked out some of the members onboard the team, then I admit that I’ve got even more interested now. The Internet of Value will be a part of bringing financial inclusion to the billions of people who are still unbanked today.  By last year 2017 there was somewhere between 1.7 – 2 billion people in the world who didn’t had a bank account. It’s time to bank the unbanked! I like the point about the efficiency that the low-latency full-featured centralized exchange with decentralized “trustless” cross-chain settlement that Blockchain.io will combine. Number one reason to why people prefer centralized exchanges (CEX) is the speed of the transactions. But a centralized exchange can also accept FIAT payment and transactions, which is a big plus for many people. On a centralized exchange the users do not have their own specific private keys to their assets. Instead you rely on the exchange to handle your funds on the safest and most secure manner.

How can it be profitable with such volume of trading?  There are good partners on board, one of them Kima Ventures who backed Ledger back in a days. I didn't study whitepaper tho, because I'm not impressed with the team. I can be wrong, just my thoughts.  Blockchain.io is your gateway to the Internet of Value. In the coming Internet of value,  decentralized blockchain-operated value networks will become mainstream and compliant, enabling billions of Internet users to exchange value as quickly and as easily as they exchange information today.  Multiple cryptocurrencies will  co-exist. Each cryptocurrency will serve the needs of a community of users to securely trade any type of assets, rights, goods, or services thatis of value to them in a decentralized value network, i.e. without supervision by a central authority.  As a  cryptocurrency exchange, Blockchain.io will play a major role in the Internet of Value’s ecosystem. It will be the marketplace where cryptocurrencies will be traded against each other, a gateway to and a bridge across the multiple value networks powered by different blockchains/cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).",False

We are happy to hear that you find our advisory board impressive. Regarding our team, we only displayed C-Level team members on this thread. In the manifesto, please note that we did not mention all members of our team (both those in tech and on the marketing side) because we are running an exchange and we need to keep some members anonymous as failsafes. It's true that we could have mentioned their presence.  I respectfully disagree concerning your remarks about the team. The project here is building an exchange; not a blockchain. Our team is composed of exchange experts from both the crypto-sphere and the traditional financial world. To remove any doubts about our capabilities, the Blockchain.io platform is currently being developed as we speak. The Alpha is planned for June 2018 and the Beta for late July. Early investors will get access to Alpha & Beta.  Concerning volume, the situation will shift soon. We are currently working with a French bank and are constrained by French banking regulation, which is one of the strictest in the world. The banking cartel is very strong and proactively undermines our business. Following our migration to a different banking partner, they have imposed uncompetitive funding limits (10K€/year), preventing any significant high-volume traders from boosting volume and fueling platform liquidity. We are currently working on an alternative banking solution in Europe, and we plan to add USD & JPY to our bitcoin exchange. We are confident that volume will be back on Paymium once this is settled.  On the profitability side, please note that we have been operating a bitcoin exchange since 2011, thus we have significant reserves. The two previous years have been good regarding volume. The last few months have been tough, but we still largely benefited from the price rally of 2016 and especially that of last year. When considering hacking, this is one of our main concerns. 24H volume has little bearing on the funds held on our platform. With around 200,000 users, hackers will certainly try something, but we have developed very high security standards (more than 98% of cold storage), keeping our customers' funds safe.  Concerning the Blockchain.io exchange, our main exclusive feature is decentralized settlement. Blockchain.io will offer the possibility to settle trades without giving the custody of coins, which erases the last potential point-of-failure. Order Books will remain centralized, guaranteeing high-performance matching and liquid markets. Of course, this feature will be optional, as it could not fit some user profiles, such as market-makers (who prefer velocity over high security). Moreover, Blockchain.io will also offer basic & advanced trade orders from the start. In the long run, we plan to implement margin trading and peer-to-peer lending. Please check out our roadmap at this end of the thread.  Last, but not least, Blockchain.io will have a strong focus on institutions. We believe that ICOs will become the main way to raise funds, and that large companies will approach us to launch their respective tokens for new product launches. Our team is highly experienced and has strong connections in the traditional financial world, therefore, we are aiming to become the primary interlocutor for such companies. Blockchain.io will offer its expertise and knowledge to provide complete ICO services, from planning and execution to token listing on our platform.  Please feel free to ask further questions if you have any. In all, development is ongoing, but coming along very well.  Thank you very much. The Blockchain.io Team",False

Blockchain.io is the new internet! Good idea!

With P2P lending, users can offer loans to one another at a rate lower than banks’. Robo-advisory platforms offer users asset management that will not only be faster and cheaper, but also more transparent in what they charge you, in the future, a new banking model is likely to emerge. FinTech start-ups will handle front-end operations and the customer experience. Matters relating to deposits and assets, reconciliation and regulatory reporting will be left to the care of traditional banks. “This means that the very banks we know today could become utility providers to technology firms.

This is a great oportunity to be part of an interesting blockchain project and a community that will change the world.

In the coming Internet of value, decentralized blockchain-operated value networks will become mainstream and compliant, enabling billions of Internet users to exchange value as quickly and as easily as they exchange information today. Multiple cryptocurrencies will co-exist. Each cryptocurrency will serve the needs of a community of users to securely trade any type of assets, rights, goods, or services thatis of value to them in a decentralized value network, i.e. without supervision by a central authority. As a cryptocurrency exchange, Blockchain.io will play a major role in the Internet of Value’s ecosystem. It will be the marketplace where cryptocurrencies will be traded against each other, a gateway to and a bridge across the multiple value networks powered by different blockchains/cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). Blockchain.io will combine the efficiency of a low-latency full-featured centralized exchange with decentralized “trustless” cross-chain settlement. The project leverages the latest developments in cross-chain atomic swaps, cryptographic protocols, and payment networks such as Lightning and Raiden. These developments will overcome the scalability issues of decentralized blockchains, allow transactions across heterogenous blockchains, increase the speed and lower the cost of these transactions, making them ready for mass adoption. Blockchain.io is driven by the highly experienced team of cryptocurrency experts who, seven years ago, founded Paymium, a fiat/bitcoin exchange catering to the underserved Euro market. Blockchain.io shares Paymium’s highest security, reliability, and accountability standards. It strives to overcome the shortcomings of rival crypto exchanges that have repeatedly caused severe losses for issuers and token holders. To achieve this, the team relies on its advanced knowledge of cryptographic technology, its operational in-depth understanding of the crypto world, and a strong company culture committed to security and compliance.",False

Market awareness and penetration are the two biggest factors determining a coins success today, this project has maintained an active voice in the community for most of bitcoins existence and their team shows this. Their team is active in communicating with the crowds and have been active in telegram, bitcointalk and other blockchain forums. This bounty is also one of the most subscribed bounties currently active, with hundreds of thousands of enrollments. There is no doubt that the project will succeed and the coin will achieve top 100 activity and market cap. I personally am very excited for the future of Blockchain.io and the entire blockchain space.  Product:  Currently there are no institutional grade bitcoin exchanges where large sums of bitcoin are freely moved at an agreed upon price, there are Over the Counter (OTC) markets where large sums of bitcoin can be purchased for an agreed upon price, but the idea of auction based price discovery is not seen anywhere in the market. Blockchain.io plans to have auction based price discovery for institutional investors as well as Decentralized Settlement, what this means for you as a consumer is your safety as a purveyor to their website and exchange. What this means for institutional investors is the actual peace of mind required to handle millions of dollars in exchanges a day. GDAX, Bitfinex and OKex are regularly the three largest exchanges of bitcoin in the world, there is no auction function for buying millions of dollars in bitcoin. Currently one must slowly work their way up through the orderbook at whatever price is given, this is the major problem with maker taker markets, a consumer must pay whatever the market is asking for large sums of bitcoin, often driving the price up to unreasonable amounts only to have the arbitration robots return the price to it's initial value.  Solution:  By having an institutional graded exchange we can expect price stability across the open market for bitcoin, as well as a healthier change to it's price in a given period. Huge swings in the market would be mitigated because of their auction function and we could anticipate steady growth instead of huge ups and downs by having the market stabilized by a fair price discovery mechanism.",False

I think that the potential of the Blockchain to take advantage of the computing power of the entire Internet destroys the fictitious belief that the cryptocurrency has no value, is a bubble or the latest fashion of technology. The truth is that cryptocurrency can act as a more intelligent and secure exchange system that improves the delivery of Internet technologies and applications. With the Blockchain, we can create a voluntary network, an Internet / Cloud 2.0, that improves cybersecurity and lends itself to advances in computing, AI, IoT and record keeping. It is a multi-million dollar solution to solve problems in all vertical markets and we are only scratching the surface. The cloud was the first step to move away from centralization. Companies needed to store files and have access to processing power for applications with a wide network bandwidth to adapt to daily use. Now, the Blockchain is introducing the second iteration of the computational structure. Through a distributed ledger system, Blockchain has created computational networks that are secure, immutable and democratic. This could lead to non-hackable web programs and services, transparent networks and greater system reliability.

The internet of value enables users to securely trade assets, rights, goods and services, globally and around the clock, without the involvement of a centralized authority, or traditional financial intermediaries, or so called ‘trusted’ third-parties.  The Internet of value is built on multiple decentralized, automated, transparent, and secure blockchain-based value networks. Different networks operate different versions of the blockchain, which in turn are fueled  different cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, or Litecoin. Each network meets the needs of certain types of transactions, such as high-value payments or title registry, or the needs of specific trading communities, such as a network of autonomous objects or an industry sector.  Blockchain.io as the leading exchange in the Internet of Value will enable users to trade across all these value networks.  Cryptocurrency Exchanges Enable Users to Navigate the Internet of Value  Cryptocurrency exchanges enable users to trade across multiple value networks powered by heterogeneous blockchains.  As the number of cryptocurrencies grows, cryptocurrency exchanges become the marketplaces for listing and trading cryptocurrencies. In the current context, users mainly buy cryptocurrencies as a store of value, in anticipation of a future value increase. As exchanges list multiple cryptocurrencies in one place, supply information about them, enable comparisons, and set bid/ask prices according to demand, they help separate the valuable cryptocurrencies from the useless ones. Investors become increasingly discriminate in their choices of cryptocurrencies as a store of value or as a utility token.  As technological and regulatory barriers to the Internet of value will be lifted, cryptocurrencies and decentralized value networks will gain mainstream acceptance. To trade on these different networks, users will need to buy multiple digital currencies and to exchange them as their needs evolve.  Blockchain.io will list a careful selection of cryptocurrencies: Proof-of-Work (POW) coins such as Bitcoin, Ether or Litecoin, Proof-of-Stake (POS) coins like Qtum or Stratis, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) coins, and other cryptographic protocols yet to be designed and minted.  Essential Features http://tinyimg.io/i/bPKSdNn.png  Ultra-Secure & Decentralized      The centralized part of the exchange offers highly secure custody services with cold storage and cryptographic proof of reserve.     Cryptocurrencies are held in cold storage (offline) for at least 98% of reserves.     A cold wallet access requires multiple signatures. “Bitcoin introduces a platform on which you can run currency as an application on a network without any central points of control. A system completely decentralized like the internet itself. It is not money for the internet but the internet of money.”  Andreas Antonopoulos  In the same way as the Internet redefined global communication, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are now reinventing money and value transactions.  Before Bitcoin, money was defined by State sovereignty over a territory. From now on, any community can mint its own money in form of a cryptocurrency or digital token and start trading without any central supervising authority.  In 2017 alone, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) raised around $5 billion. Each project was financed by a community of token holders who became its ambassadors. There are now already tens of millions of token holders.  Bitcoins and digital tokens are like better, smarter cash. They are programmable money. Immediately liquid, indefinitely divisible, and instantly transferable, they can be programmed to meet the needs of particular assets, rights, goods, or services or of specific communities.  In the coming years, we will see a multitude of cryptocurrencies being deployed. New cryptographic developments and payment applications will allow us to transact in all these currencies, with the traditional “fiat” currencies retaining their role as price anchors/index currencies.",False

Cryptocurrencies are held in cold storage (offline) for at least 98% of reserves. A cold wallet access requires multiple signatures. A cold wallet private key is split and held in a number of different vaults in multiple locations. Other in-house security processes and technological features. Internal procedures protect the exchange from social engineering attacks. Periodic technical audits and timestamped logs allow detection of any tampering attempts in the accounting database. Periodic financial audits verify that the inventory of coins (assets side) matches the records of liabilities with cryptographic proof. If the exchange’s customer balances are checked against a blockchain inventory of coins (utxos in Bitcoin language) every block interval, there is little or no room for a rogue intruder to alter database records with profit. Decentralized settlement relies on fair-exchange protocols allowing atomic swaps of cryptocurrencies to eliminate the counter-party risk inherent to a custodial exchange.  Fully Compliant & Transparent  Exhaustive accounting records are audited by independent professional auditors to ensure the integrity of the trading platform. The exchange aims to comply with all current applicable EU regulations, ensuring that assets never get seized or frozen. Customer balances on the liability side must match exactly the inventory of coins held by the exchange. Blockchain.io aims to perform such balance check and to publish its cryptographic proof at every block interval.   Reliable Infrastructure  Minimal downtime, typically restricted to server maintenance, application upgrades, or database migration. Resilience under high volume, heavy traffic conditions, or DDoS attacks. No technical debt: exchanges that quickly add new altcoins or new features without proper testing or careful software design accumulate technical debt by taking shortcuts. Technical debt translates into applications that are harder to maintain and prone to bugs and security holes. Blockchain.io will attract high volume traders with specific features such as a FIX API and a borrowing facility, but also with the high level of availability of the trading platform. Processing capacity in the first phase will be of up to 2 million orders per day.

What a shame I think the computer isn;t working properly:   Glenn Chan's Random Notes on Investing DISCLAIMER: Some of the information on this site is wrong. Always do your own research. Menu Skip to content      Home     *** Donate money to SIRF – it’s investigative journalism that matters ***     About  February 20, 2018 by GlennC    Blockchain is a useless technology  Blockchain, a way of implementing a distributed ledger (distributed record-keeping), is a novel technology with little real-world practicality.  The original Bitcoin white paper published back in October 31, 2008 spurred little interest in distributed ledgers.  The distributed ledger was ignored for years until Bitcoin started receiving mainstream attention and a few years had passed.  I simply couldn’t find much evidence that distributed ledgers are useful for any real-world applications (other than speculative asset bubbles).  Once you understand that blockchains are bad at solving real-world problems, then you will understand why Bitcoin will fail.  The blockchain imposes limitations that makes Bitcoin a bad version of something that has been tried in the past: e-gold (description here and Wired profile here).  A company’s stance on blockchain can also serve as a test of a company’s management.  In my view, companies pushing blockchain technology (e.g. IBM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle) are disconnected from customers’ actual needs and have mediocre management.  Companies that don’t talk about blockchain (e.g. Facebook, Amazon, Google, Apple) are more likely to produce sensible technology that will work in the real world.  Blockchain and its “benefits”  The only truly innovative part of Bitcoin is its implementation of a distributed ledger.  Instead of having a single trusted party maintain a single ledger (that an oppressive government can coerce), anybody can join the network and receive their own copy of the ledger.  A set of fixed rules governs how the copies of the ledger should be maintained.  In theory, this does not allow for a single party to exert control over the network.  The supposed benefits of decentralization are:      The ledger can’t be changed without the Bitcoin owner’s permission.  An oppressive government can’t seize a citizen’s assets since a transfer of funds would require the owner’s private key (which is like a password that grants control over someone’s Bitcoins).     The rules governing Bitcoin can’t be changed.  Central banks can’t devalue the currency by printing money.  (In reality, Bitcoins devalue due to inflation built into the system.)  In practical use, the upsides will never materialize.  For Bitcoin to see mainstream adoption for legitimate purposes, the surrounding ecosystem of Bitcoin exchanges will have to follow government regulations and interface with traditional banking.  Otherwise, governments concerned about illegal activities (and therefore money laundering) will force banks to cut off ties with the Bitcoin ecosystem, preventing ordinary citizens from buying and selling Bitcoin on exchanges.  Governments can attempt to seize Bitcoins by arresting individuals and threatening them with jail time.  In that sense, the government can exert a lot of control and influence over Bitcoin.  This is currently the case as banks are afraid of the fines they would have to pay if they were to breach anti-money laundering laws.  Many of them limit access to the Bitcoin ecosystem.  And while the ledger and rules governing Bitcoin “can’t” be changed, users actually want changes to the ledger and changes to the rules of the game.      Somebody exploited a bug to create 92 billion Bitcoins in a system designed to reach only 21 million Bitcoins (see here and here).  Bitcoin’s extreme hyperinflation needed to be fixed… by swapping the ledger (with the ledger from an earlier point in time before the bug was exploited) so that the ‘money printing’ exploit could be reversed.     If Bitcoin is to see wider adoption, it will require fundamental changes to increase its transaction capacity.  Current capacity limits have caused transaction fees to skyrocket to a peak of around US$55 (chart) and for confirmation times to increase to several hours.  However, the Bitcoin community has been divided as to the best technical path to take to solve the issues.  The users of a system might as well rely on a trusted party to make changes and to choose a direction in driving the software forward.  That trusted party could be a democratically-elected party or a benevolent dictatorship.  If there is dissatisfaction with the project’s leadership, open-source projects can be ‘forked’- those wishing to take things in a different direction can make their own version of the software as the software’s source code (the secret recipe for making the software) is open to everybody.  A centralized open-source project (or a number of them) would do the same thing.  The distributed ledger isn’t necessary.  Unfortunately, distributed ledgers have technical downsides.  In practical usage, distributed ledgers impose technical limitations onto a system with no benefit. Bitcoin’s strength is in speculative asset bubbles  It is unlikely that Bitcoin will survive as a platform with legitimate uses.  Bitcoin is a bad payment network tied at the hip to an intrinsically worthless currency.  As a payment network, Bitcoin is slow, expensive, has terrible security, and is not user-friendly.  Something similar to Bitcoin has been tried before with e-gold (description here and Wired profile here).  The major advantages of e-gold over the current Bitcoin system are:      Fast confirmations.  Payment confirmations did not range from minutes to 16+ hours.     Lower fees in some cases- e-gold’s 1% storage fee is comparable to Bitcoin’s current inflation rate of 4.3% (chart) that pays for overhead.  E-gold transactions were 50 cents or 1% of the transaction (whichever is lower) versus Bitcoin’s average ranging from $2 to $55 last year.     Far superior security.  Bitcoin’s security is abysmal.     More user-friendly.  Bitcoin’s supposed advantage over e-gold (decentralization) will likely be irrelevant in practice.  It offers no advantages over current payment systems.  The other major difference between Bitcoin and e-gold is that Bitcoin is backed by ones and zeroes (inherently worthless numbers generated by a computer) whereas e-gold was backed by gold and other precious metals.  Currently, financial markets are ascribing significant value to Bitcoin’s 1s and 0s.  Here are some misconceptions fueling the speculative bubble in Bitcoin:      Decentralization will provide freedom from the government, money printing, central banking, and (risky) fractional reserve banking.  E-gold was designed to do all of those things but was forced by the US government into changing its business practices.  This ultimately forced e-gold to shut down.     Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency will be the dominant currency in the future.  E-gold’s failure strongly suggests that cryptocurrencies will fail because it is unlikely that cryptocurrencies will be more effective than e-gold.     Bitcoins are safe because they are protected by encryption and cryptography.  In reality, Bitcoin’s security is abysmal.  Gold and fiat currencies have never experienced incredibly high losses due to theft.     Bitcoin will have lower fees than price-gouging banks.  In reality, Bitcoin’s current inflation rate of 4.3% goes towards overhead while transaction fees have spiked as high as US$55 / transaction.     Blockchain is a disruptive technology.  In reality, nobody cared about distributed ledgers for years.  What allows the misconceptions to exist is blockchain.  There is the mistaken belief that Bitcoin’s key innovation will actually allow a decentralized system to work.  The reason why the bubble exists is because speculators don’t understand why blockchain is useless.  Mostly, the situation exists because people don’t understand Bitcoin and simply assume that it works because the technobabble sounds so complicated. Why Bitcoin is a bad payment network (feel free to skip this section)  Many many ideas have been tried in payments and in digital money, especially during the Dot-Com era when there were many well-funded startups (some of which had the backing of big banks).  Paypal saw something like 30 or so of its competitors go out of business.  There isn’t much that hasn’t been tried in payments and there is a graveyard full of failed ideas.  Bitcoin bears similarities to Paypal and the defunct e-gold (description here and Wired profile here).  However, Bitcoin lacks any useful innovation over previous systems.  The key innovation, the distributed ledger, solves a non-problem (centralization).  Other than that, Bitcoin doesn’t attempt to solve any of the difficult problems in payments.  It is also inherently flawed at dealing with some of the existing problems in payments.      Account security:  As with any financial account, scammers will try to trick consumers into giving away their passwords via phishing scams.  A good payment processing system will look for footprints of such attacks, e.g. the IP address used to log into an account when it is emptied.  Because IP addresses reveal the user’s location, a good payment processing system will flag logins where the user has traveled faster than commercial aviation (since that is highly improbable).  This type of surveillance goes against the ethos of Bitcoin.  But it’s worse than that.  Historically, a significant fraction of the Bitcoins in circulation have been stolen.  The second Mt Gox breach was estimated to have resulted in a loss of 650,000 Bitcoins, which was roughly 5% of all Bitcoins in existence at the time.  Bad actors (some of whom are likely exchange employees) have been very good at stealing Bitcoins.  Bitcoins are attractive targets because today’s complicated computer systems have a huge attack surface (this includes crooked employees and social engineering), because Bitcoins don’t have weight like cash or gold (a single person will take a long time to physically move millions of dollars), because Bitcoin is designed to be irreversible, and because the banking industry has yet to develop strong money laundering controls to stop thieves from converting stolen Bitcoins into cash.     “Fast” settlement:  The reason why many financial transactions take a long time to clear (days or months) is to allow for fraudulent transactions to be reversed.  However, many financial institutions will allow low-risk transactions to clear immediately and will bear the risk of losing money if it turns out that the transaction was fraudulent.  This makes the system far less inconvenient without losing the fraud-fighting properties of long settlement times.     Fraud:  Fraud is the reason why all of Paypal’s competitors failed in the eBay auction payments market.  It’s a very difficult problem.  In its early days, Paypal was ruthless in freezing accounts (especially those of legitimate customers- just Google “Paypal sucks”), saying no to risky business, and in providing no customer service.     Convenience:  Customers like payment systems that are easy to sign up for, clear quickly, and have good user experiences.  Bitcoin’s design is not very user friendly.  A consumer needs to get a bank account.  Then they need to fund an account at a Bitcoin exchange, which will require a credit card or wire transfer… requiring them to participate in the traditional financial system.  This is inconvenient if the customer tries to do this at a financial institution that closes accounts associated with Bitcoin (the anti-money laundering burden is not worth it for most banks).  If the consumer is worried about their Bitcoins being stolen (roughly a third of all Bitcoin exchanges have been compromised), they can transfer the Bitcoins to their own Bitcoin wallet (many of which have been compromised).  Then they should make a backup of their private key on paper because they will lose their Bitcoins if their hard drive crashes or if they forget the password protecting their private key.  Compare all this to credit cards- consumers don’t worry much about losing their credit card, rarely have their money stolen, and don’t have to learn about computers.     Money laundering:  Most countries have laws that require financial companies to police their customers and to implement safeguards against money laundering.  This includes knowing the identity of the customer.  On the compliance front, the Bitcoin system does not allow for accounts to be frozen and would have to rely on (centralized) exchanges to comply with money laundering safeguards.  The Bitcoin ecosystem would also need to develop safeguards against the current tumbling services (which masks a user’s public paper trail on the Bitcoin ledger) and should implement some way of blacklisting stolen Bitcoins currently in circulation.  Such blacklisting would require centralization.  Bitcoin also fails in areas that aren’t difficult:      Fast payment confirmation:  Due to Bitcoin’s distributed ledger design, the fastest a transaction can be confirmed is around 10 minutes.  Paypal and Visa can confirm transactions in seconds, so somebody purchasing a good can receive it in seconds rather than waiting for minutes.     Overhead that does not cost billions of dollars a year:  The Bitcoin system is supported by Bitcoin ‘mining’.  The idea is that users would use their CPU to perform a lot of math calculations to support the integrity of the blockchain.  Record keepers in the network will trust the side that has poured more computing power into its calculations; cryptography allows each node in the network to easily verify the amount of math performed.  If the honest users do more math than bad actors trying to disrupt the system, then the Bitcoin network will function as intended.  If the good guys don’t dedicate a lot of computing power to Bitcoin mining, then a bad actor can simply round up more computing power than the good guys and gain the trust of other nodes on the network.  To try to prevent this, there’s an incentive system for the good guys to build up a large standing army of CPUs.  Inflation is designed into Bitcoin to encourage the good guys to maintain a large army.  This is done by giving out Bitcoins to Bitcoin miners depending on how much work they put in (the number of Bitcoins given out in a year is more or less pre-determined).  Because the price of Bitcoin has skyrocketed, billions of dollars in Bitcoins will likely be given away this year to miners fighting over their share of Bitcoins.  The ‘mining’ analogy is used because Bitcoin miners put in work and are rewarded with digital ‘gold’.  Unfortunately, the current system results in an overhead of billions of dollars for a very low volume of transactions.     Network capacity:  Bitcoin is currently limited to around 3 transactions a second.  As the Bitcoin network approaches this limit, fees skyrocket and payment confirmations can take several hours.  This has caused some retailers like Steam to drop Bitcoin as a payment option.  While this technical obstacle can be overcome, Bitcoin has dysfunctional governance that has prevented work on the issue.  In the Bitcoin community, there was a civil war over whether the block size should be increased.  (Doing so would solve impending capacity issues of the Bitcoin network in a simple, elegant fashion.  The motivations for opposing it are unclear.)  Opponents of a larger block size used denial of service attacks, propaganda, and censorship to fight this change.  Ironically, a system that is supposed to be free from oppressive governments is being influenced by bad actors launching cyberattacks on their opponents.  Problems unique to Bitcoin:      Security vulnerabilities:  The distributed ledger has some outstanding security vulnerabilities that have yet to be resolved (e.g. malleability attacks, denial of service attacks on the peer-to-peer network, Sybil attacks, etc.).     Centralization of Bitcoin miners:  In practice, Bitcoin mining has been concentrated in undesirable ways… making it much easier for one party to disrupt the Bitcoin network with a 51% attack (see the earlier discussion about “overhead that does not cost billions of dollars a year”).  Bitcoin mining will concentrate in countries with lots of cheap electricity.  It will be concentrated among big companies that build large, efficient data centers.  And it will continue to be dominated by ASICs, computer chips designed to do one thing and one thing only (mining Bitcoins in this case).  Whichever company designs the best ASIC will see their ASIC dominate Bitcoin mining.  Ideally, there should not be any backdoors programmed into that ASIC… such as the one programmed into Bitmain’s Antminer S9.  If most of the mining power is concentrated in a single country (currently this is China), among a handful of companies, or in a single ASIC design (Bitmain, a Chinese company, currently has the best ASICs)… there is a risk of a 51% attack.     Unknown economics:  When the Bitcoin ‘money printing’ stops after all 21 million Bitcoins are mined, it is unclear if the economic incentives will still lead to a well-functioning system.  Bitcoin is a terrible store of value      It is far, far easier to lose Bitcoins to theft than it is to lose gold.     Various technical and economic obstacles need to be overcome for Bitcoin to be a usable payments network for mainstream use.     Why would you trust a system where a software bug was exploited to create 92 billion Bitcoins?!  Blockchain as a litmus test  Companies that promote distributed ledgers are more focused on appearing to be innovative rather than solving their clients’ problems.  To spot many of these companies, you can simply look at those donating to the Hyperledger project (which is developing distributed ledgers and giving away the source code).      The publicly-traded Premier members are ACN, AXP, EADSF (Airbus), BIDU, CSCO, DDAIY (Daimler), FJTSY (Fujitsu), HTHIY (Hitachi), IBM, INTC, JPM, NIPNF (NEC Corp), and SAP.     Some publicly-traded general members are: AMS:ABN (ABN AMRO), AET, BBVA, BNP Paribas, CME, ETR:DB1 (Deutsche Boerse), LLY, GM (GM Financial), TYO:9613 (NTT Data), ORCL, RHT, KRX:018260 (Samsung SDS), SBRCY (Sberbank), LON:SDR (Schroders), STT, EPA:HO (Thales), TRI, TSE:X (TMX Group), VMW, WFC, and WIT.  I raise my eyebrows at the technology and IT services providers on that list such as Microsoft, IBM, and SAP- these guys should know better because it’s their core business.  I would point out that it would make sense for companies to sell sensible solutions and to slap the word “blockchain” onto them for marketing reasons.  However, I’m not aware of any publicly-traded companies that do this.  Seeing the words “blockchain” and “distributed ledger” should be a reasonably reliable shortcut in figuring out whether or not a company is crazy.  Some companies like Microsoft and IBM even offer buzzwords Blockchain as a Service while Intel and Oracle have teamed up for a Blockchain Cloud Service… perhaps working a little too hard in trying to appear cutting-edge.  Granted, it likely won’t end in tears.  Some tech giants will continue to make money despite wasting resources on useless technologies.  A few of the companies are blessed with scale advantages (Intel, Visa, Mastercard), network effects that lead to a near monopoly situation (Microsoft Windows), or a big competitive lead that will take a long time to catch up to (Microsoft, SAP, Oracle).  These companies will simply make less money and their competitive advantages will erode over time.  Others may not be so lucky.  Cisco currently faces very strong competition so its political rot will likely cause Cisco to fall even more behind its competitors.  Banks and financial companies will not be hurt that much by their incompetence when it comes to technology.  The reason why many financial companies are so bad at technology is because technology rarely determines the winners and losers in their field.  As long as their core business is strong, their profits will greatly exceed the waste from bad technology.  The real issue with banks is that they constantly find new ways of losing money as they get into trouble from non-core businesses, e.g. competing against Paypal in the early 2000s, the subprime housing bubble, subprime auto lending, etc.  I wouldn’t focus too much on their skill in technology.  Conversely, I’m interested in technology, database, and IT services providers that aren’t talking about blockchain (e.g. the FANG stocks + Apple).  These companies have more sensible corporate cultures.  Google/Alphabet shareholders should be pleased to see that its only serious competitor in search (Microsoft) is wasting resources on blockchain. AMD’s stock promotion  In this CNBC interview, AMD’s CEO Lisa Su claims that blockchain is a “positive foundational technology” and that cryptocurrencies only accounted for a small fraction of the company’s revenues.  That’s crazy talk.  Cryptocurrencies are the only blockchain implementation that has seen any mainstream adoption.  When the crypto bubble bursts, AMD will be hurt as video card demand will drop dramatically (see a previous blog post for more detail).  Yet AMD’s CEO would like to mislead investors regarding AMD’s sensitivity to cryptocurrencies, suggesting that AMD’s exposure is low.  She is likely trying to mislead because the growth in cryptocurrencies has been masking poor performance in some of AMD’s business lines.  AMD’s technology is pretty good but the company has a problem with generating profits. Closing thoughts  Unlike other manias, blockchain lacks a kernel of value creation.  Asset bubbles in Dot-Com stocks and the Nifty Fifty were based on ideas that have merit as the Internet did change the world and quality businesses did perform better over very long time periods.  Current excitement over cloud-based delivery of software (a technology that has been around for decades), fintech (making software for the financial industry), and venture capital (investing in startups) does have merit if you ignore valuations.  Distributed ledgers on the other hand are useless.  I just don’t know when the bubble will pop.  *Disclosure:  I am short a company (not mentioned in this article) that hypes its ‘blockchain’ solutions.  Short AMD.  Long FB and GOOGL.",False

We are happy to hear that you find our advisory board impressive. Regarding our team, we only displayed C-Level team members on this thread. In the manifesto, please note that we did not mention all members of our team (both those in tech and on the marketing side) because we are running an exchange and we need to keep some members anonymous as failsafes. It's true that we could have mentioned their presence.  I respectfully disagree concerning your remarks about the team. The project here is building an exchange; not a blockchain. Our team is composed of exchange experts from both the crypto-sphere and the traditional financial world. To remove any doubts about our capabilities, the Blockchain.io platform is currently being developed as we speak. The Alpha is planned for June 2018 and the Beta for late July. Early investors will get access to Alpha & Beta.  Concerning volume, the situation will shift soon. We are currently working with a French bank and are constrained by French banking regulation, which is one of the strictest in the world. The banking cartel is very strong and proactively undermines our business. Following our migration to a different banking partner, they have imposed uncompetitive funding limits (10K€/year), preventing any significant high-volume traders from boosting volume and fueling platform liquidity. We are currently working on an alternative banking solution in Europe, and we plan to add USD & JPY to our bitcoin exchange. We are confident that volume will be back on Paymium once this is settled.  On the profitability side, please note that we have been operating a bitcoin exchange since 2011, thus we have significant reserves. The two previous years have been good regarding volume. The last few months have been tough, but we still largely benefited from the price rally of 2016 and especially that of last year. When considering hacking, this is one of our main concerns. 24H volume has little bearing on the funds held on our platform. With around 200,000 users, hackers will certainly try something, but we have developed very high security standards (more than 98% of cold storage), keeping our customers' funds safe.  Concerning the Blockchain.io exchange, our main exclusive feature is decentralized settlement. Blockchain.io will offer the possibility to settle trades without giving the custody of coins, which erases the last potential point-of-failure. Order Books will remain centralized, guaranteeing high-performance matching and liquid markets. Of course, this feature will be optional, as it could not fit some user profiles, such as market-makers (who prefer velocity over high security). Moreover, Blockchain.io will also offer basic & advanced trade orders from the start. In the long run, we plan to implement margin trading and peer-to-peer lending. Please check out our roadmap at this end of the thread.  Last, but not least, Blockchain.io will have a strong focus on institutions. We believe that ICOs will become the main way to raise funds, and that large companies will approach us to launch their respective tokens for new product launches. Our team is highly experienced and has strong connections in the traditional financial world, therefore, we are aiming to become the primary interlocutor for such companies. Blockchain.io will offer its expertise and knowledge to provide complete ICO services, from planning and execution to token listing on our platform.  Please feel free to ask further questions if you have any. In all, development is ongoing, but coming along very well.  Thank you very much. The Blockchain.io Team",False

I like the decentralized settlement feature and will take a look into whitepaper. Reputation matters in this world. But also consider the technical team to expose a little more, as you will manage exchange which require a lot of development on different blockchains. It is fundamental thing. As for me I do appreciate projects with strong technical team working together for some time to the good executive team who ""buy"" new technical team(all people new and has no experience in this squad at all, could be a lot of conflicts as it builds). Just added this incredible ICO to my website   https://findico.io/ico/blockchainio  Findico.io is a leading cryptocurrency and ICOs portal.

The idea of founders is to create an European cryptocurrency exchange, which would stand out in crypto space thanks to its features. What’s more we have certainty about reality of the company not like in the case of other exchanges. The founder and CEO of the project co-founded in 2011 as one of the first bitcoin exchanges in the world, which proves his experience and contribution in cryptocurrrency industry.  The first feature ensure a deep orderbook on all pairs by using high availability and high scalability trade matching engine. Basic orders are quite common on the other exchanges but not all exchanges have advanced orders, that allow you to use your preferred trading methods. In my opinion, the next functions will contribute significantly to success of the platform. Periodic auctions will aim to bootstrap new currency markets with an efficient price discovery mechanism, which I didn’t noticed on others crypto exchanges.

The internet of value enables users to securely trade assets, rights, goods and services, globally and around the clock, without the involvement of a centralized authority, or traditional financial intermediaries, or so called ‘trusted’ third-parties.  The Internet of value is built on multiple decentralized, automated, transparent, and secure blockchain-based value networks. Different networks operate different versions of the blockchain, which in turn are fueled by different cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, or Litecoin. Each network meets the needs of certain types of transactions, such as high-value payments or title registry, or the needs of specific trading communities, such as a network of autonomous objects or an industry sector.  Blockchain.io as the leading exchange in the Internet of Value will enable users to trade across all these value networks.  Cryptocurrency Exchanges Enable Users to Navigate the Internet of Value  Cryptocurrency exchanges enable users to trade across multiple value networks powered by heterogeneous blockchains.  As the number of cryptocurrencies grows, cryptocurrency exchanges become the marketplaces for listing and trading cryptocurrencies. In the current context, users mainly buy cryptocurrencies as a store of value, in anticipation of a future value increase. As exchanges list multiple cryptocurrencies in one place, supply information about them, enable comparisons, and set bid/ask prices according to demand, they help separate the valuable cryptocurrencies from the useless ones. Investors become increasingly discriminate in their choices of cryptocurrencies as a store of value or as a utility token.  As technological and regulatory barriers to the Internet of value will be lifted, cryptocurrencies and decentralized value networks will gain mainstream acceptance. To trade on these different networks, users will need to buy multiple digital currencies and to exchange them as their needs evolve.  Blockchain.io will list a careful selection of cryptocurrencies: Proof-of-Work (POW) coins such as Bitcoin, Ether or Litecoin, Proof-of-Stake (POS) coins like Qtum or Stratis, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) coins, and other cryptographic protocols yet to be designed and minted.  Essential Features http://tinyimg.io/i/bPKSdNn.png  Ultra-Secure & Decentralized  The centralized part of the exchange offers highly secure custody services with cold storage and cryptographic proof of reserve. Cryptocurrencies are held in cold storage (offline) for at least 98% of reserves. A cold wallet access requires multiple signatures. A cold wallet private key is split and held in a number of different vaults in multiple locations. Other in-house security processes and technological features. Internal procedures protect the exchange from social engineering attacks. Periodic technical audits and timestamped logs allow detection of any tampering attempts in the accounting database. Periodic financial audits verify that the inventory of coins (assets side) matches the records of liabilities with cryptographic proof. If the exchange’s customer balances are checked against a blockchain inventory of coins (utxos in Bitcoin language) every block interval, there is little or no room for a rogue intruder to alter database records with profit. Decentralized settlement relies on fair-exchange protocols allowing atomic swaps of cryptocurrencies to eliminate the counter-party risk inherent to a custodial exchange.  Fully Compliant & Transparent  Exhaustive accounting records are audited by independent professional auditors to ensure the integrity of the trading platform. The exchange aims to comply with all current applicable EU regulations, ensuring that assets never get seized or frozen. Customer balances on the liability side must match exactly the inventory of coins held by the exchange. Blockchain.io aims to perform such balance check and to publish its cryptographic proof at every block interval.   Reliable Infrastructure  Minimal downtime, typically restricted to server maintenance, application upgrades, or database migration. Resilience under high volume, heavy traffic conditions, or DDoS attacks. No technical debt: exchanges that quickly add new altcoins or new features without proper testing or careful software design accumulate technical debt by taking shortcuts. Technical debt translates into applications that are harder to maintain and prone to bugs and security holes. Blockchain.io will attract high volume traders with specific features such as a FIX API and a borrowing facility, but also with the high level of availability of the trading platform. Processing capacity in the first phase will be of up to 2 million orders per day.   Select Digital Currencies  Cryptocurrencies will be listed on the trading platform following a strict vetting process (sustainability, technical, and deep protocol review) by our team of blockchain experts. Regular updates and publications will inform platform stakeholders and the community through altcoin technical reviews and financial analyses.  ICO Execution & Token Listing  Blockchain.io will provide ICO campaign support and token listing services to assist entrepreneurs and technologists in the planning and execution of their fundraising campaigns. Following the ICO campaigns, Blockchain.io will ensure that newly created tokens are listed on Blockchain.io to provide liquidity to investors and traders.

The idea of founders is to create an European cryptocurrency exchange, which would stand out in crypto space thanks to its features. What’s more we have certainty about reality of the company not like in the case of other exchanges. The founder and CEO of the project co-founded in 2011 as one of the first bitcoin exchanges in the world, which proves his experience and contribution in cryptocurrrency industry.  The first feature ensure a deep orderbook on all pairs by using high availability and high scalability trade matching engine. Basic orders are quite common on the other exchanges but not all exchanges have advanced orders, that allow you to use your preferred trading methods. In my opinion, the next functions will contribute significantly to success of the platform. Periodic auctions will aim to bootstrap new currency markets with an efficient price discovery mechanism, which I didn’t noticed on others crypto exchanges. Furthermore whenever you will plan to oper short position it will be possbile on blockchain.io platform, you can also borrow or lend money from/to the other platform users what makes trading on the market much easier",False

Before Bitcoin, money was defined by State sovereignty over a territory. From now on, any community can mint its own money in form of a cryptocurrency or digital token and start trading without any central supervising authority.  In 2017 alone, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) raised around $5 billion. Each project was financed by a community of token holders who became its ambassadors. There are now already tens of millions of token holders.  Bitcoins and digital tokens are like better, smarter cash. They are programmable money. Immediately liquid, indefinitely divisible, and instantly transferable, they can be programmed to meet the needs of particular assets, rights, goods, or services or of specific communities.  In the coming years, we will see a multitude of cryptocurrencies being deployed. New cryptographic developments and payment applications will allow us to transact in all these currencies, with the traditional “fiat” currencies retaining their role as price anchors/index currencies.",False

For example, the fact that there are Twitter tasks to follow the CEO and CMO of the blockchain.io community is a wonderful idea!  As I was doing research on blockchain.io I noticed a new term they mentioned, ""Internet of Value.""  It was the first time I heard anything about the Internet of Value and upon further research I noticed that it, ""enables users to securely trade assets, rights, goods, and services, globally and around the clock, without the involvement of a centralized authority, or traditional financial intermediaries, or so-called ‘trusted’ third-parties.""  Everyone has been crazy about the “Internet of Things” over the past 2 to 3 years.  I feel like we are still a long way from mass adoption.  However, I am hopeful that progress will continue.  I still have to do some more research on the concept of “Internet of Value” but I am very interested and will be investing a bit of my portfolio into this project.

But because it is not true, the code will know a big change in the next month / months, and it is really important to go into the regulatory process.

We are currently working on an alternative banking solution in Europe, and we plan to add USD & JPY to our bitcoin exchange. We are confident that volume will be back on Paymium once this is settled.  On the profitability side, please note that we have been operating a bitcoin exchange since 2011, thus we have significant reserves. The two previous years have been good regarding volume. The last few months have been tough, but we still largely benefited from the price rally of 2016 and especially that of last year. When considering hacking, this is one of our main concerns. 24H volume has little bearing on the funds held on our platform. With around 200,000 users, hackers will certainly try something, but we have developed very high security standards (more than 98% of cold storage), keeping our customers' funds safe.  Concerning the Blockchain.io exchange, our main exclusive feature is decentralized settlement. Blockchain.io will offer the possibility to settle trades without giving the custody of coins, which erases the last potential point-of-failure. Order Books will remain centralized, guaranteeing high-performance matching and liquid markets. Of course, this feature will be optional, as it could not fit some user profiles, such as market-makers (who prefer velocity over high security). Moreover, Blockchain.io will also offer basic & advanced trade orders from the start. In the long run, we plan to implement margin trading and peer-to-peer lending. Please check out our roadmap at this end of the thread.  Last, but not least, Blockchain.io will have a strong focus on institutions. We believe that ICOs will become the main way to raise funds, and that large companies will approach us to launch their respective tokens for new product launches. Our team is highly experienced and has strong connections in the traditional financial world, therefore, we are aiming to become the primary interlocutor for such companies. Blockchain.io will offer its expertise and knowledge to provide complete ICO services, from planning and execution to token listing on our platform.

The project here is building an exchange; not a blockchain. Our team is composed of exchange experts from both the crypto-sphere and the traditional financial world. To remove any doubts about our capabilities, the Blockchain.io platform is currently being developed as we speak. The Alpha is planned for June 2018 and the Beta for late July. Early investors will get access to Alpha & Beta.  Concerning volume, the situation will shift soon. We are currently working with a French bank and are constrained by French banking regulation, which is one of the strictest in the world. The banking cartel is very strong and proactively undermines our business. Following our migration to a different banking partner, they have imposed uncompetitive funding limits (10K€/year), preventing any significant high-volume traders from boosting volume and fueling platform liquidity. We are currently working on an alternative banking solution in Europe, and we plan to add USD & JPY to our bitcoin exchange. We are confident that volume will be back on Paymium once this is settled.  On the profitability side, please note that we have been operating a bitcoin exchange since 2011, thus we have significant reserves. The two previous years have been good regarding volume. The last few months have been tough, but we still largely benefited from the price rally of 2016 and especially that of last year. When considering hacking, this is one of our main concerns. 24H volume has little bearing on the funds held on our platform. With around 200,000 users, hackers will certainly try something, but we have developed very high security standards (more than 98% of cold storage), keeping our customers' funds safe.  Concerning the Blockchain.io exchange, our main exclusive feature is decentralized settlement. Blockchain.io will offer the possibility to settle trades without giving the custody of coins, which erases the last potential point-of-failure. Order Books will remain centralized, guaranteeing high-performance matching and liquid markets. Of course, this feature will be optional, as it could not fit some user profiles, such as market-makers (who prefer velocity over high security). Moreover, Blockchain.io will also offer basic & advanced trade orders from the start. In the long run, we plan to implement margin trading and peer-to-peer lending. Please check out our roadmap at this end of the thread.  Last, but not least, Blockchain.io will have a strong focus on institutions. We believe that ICOs will become the main way to raise funds, and that large companies will approach us to launch their respective tokens for new product launches. Our team is highly experienced and has strong connections in the traditional financial world, therefore, we are aiming to become the primary interlocutor for such companies. Blockchain.io will offer its expertise and knowledge to provide complete ICO services, from planning and execution to token listing on our platform.  Please feel free to ask further questions if you have any. In all, development is ongoing, but coming along very well.",False

Likewise, Wikipedia entries are not the product of a single publisher. No one person controls the information. Descending to ground level, however, the differences that make blockchain technology unique become more clear. While both run on distributed networks (the internet), Wikipedia is built into the World Wide Web (WWW) using a client-server network model. A user (client) with permissions associated with its account is able to change Wikipedia entries stored on a centralized server.  Whenever a user accesses the Wikipedia page, they will get the updated version of the 'master copy' of the Wikipedia entry. Control of the database remains with Wikipedia administrators allowing for access and permissions to be maintained by a central authority. Wikipedia's digital backbone is similar to the highly protected and centralized databases that governments or banks or insurance companies keep today. Control of centralized databases rests with their owners, including the management of updates, access and protecting against cyber-threats. The distributed database created by blockchain technology has a fundamentally different digital backbone. This is also the most distinct and important feature of blockchain technology. Wikipedia's 'master copy' is edited on a server and all users see the new version. In the case of a blockchain, every node in the network is coming to the same conclusion, each updating the record independently, with the most popular record becoming the de-facto official record in lieu of there being a master copy.",False

In 2017 alone, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) raised around $5 billion. Each project was financed by a community of token holders who became its ambassadors. There are now already tens of millions of token holders.  Bitcoins and digital tokens are like better, smarter cash. They are programmable money. Immediately liquid, indefinitely divisible, and instantly transferable, they can be programmed to meet the needs of particular assets, rights, goods, or services or of specific communities.

Combining the efficiency of low latency with all centralized exchange functions with the ""reliable"" cross-chain decentralized solution, the project platform takes advantage of the latest developments in the exchange of atomic exchanges, cryptographic protocols and payment networks such as Lightning and Raiden. .

Blockchain.io as the leading exchange in the Internet of Value will enable users to trade across all these value networks.[/size]  Cryptocurrency Exchanges Enable Users to Navigate the Internet of Value  Cryptocurrency exchanges enable users to trade across multiple value networks powered by heterogeneous blockchains.  As the number of cryptocurrencies grows, cryptocurrency exchanges become the marketplaces for listing and trading cryptocurrencies. In the current context, users mainly buy cryptocurrencies as a store of value, in anticipation of a future value increase. As exchanges list multiple cryptocurrencies in one place, supply information about them, enable comparisons, and set bid/ask prices according to demand, they help separate the valuable cryptocurrencies from the useless ones. Investors become increasingly discriminate in their choices of cryptocurrencies as a store of value or as a utility token.  As technological and regulatory barriers to the Internet of value will be lifted, cryptocurrencies and decentralized value networks will gain mainstream acceptance. To trade on these different networks, users will need to buy multiple digital currencies and to exchange them as their needs evolve.  Blockchain.io will list a careful selection of cryptocurrencies: Proof-of-Work (POW) coins such as Bitcoin, Ether or Litecoin, Proof-of-Stake (POS) coins like Qtum or Stratis, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) coins, and other cryptographic protocols yet to be designed and minted.  Essential Features http://tinyimg.io/i/bPKSdNn.png  Ultra-Secure & Decentralized  The centralized part of the exchange offers highly secure custody services with cold storage and cryptographic proof of reserve. Cryptocurrencies are held in cold storage (offline) for at least 98% of reserves. A cold wallet access requires multiple signatures. A cold wallet private key is split and held in a number of different vaults in multiple locations. Other in-house security processes and technological features. Internal procedures protect the exchange from social engineering attacks. Periodic technical audits and timestamped logs allow detection of any tampering attempts in the accounting database. Periodic financial audits verify that the inventory of coins (assets side) matches the records of liabilities with cryptographic proof. If the exchange’s customer balances are checked against a blockchain inventory of coins (utxos in Bitcoin language) every block interval, there is little or no room for a rogue intruder to alter database records with profit. Decentralized settlement relies on fair-exchange protocols allowing atomic swaps of cryptocurrencies to eliminate the counter-party risk inherent to a custodial exchange.  Fully Compliant & Transparent  Exhaustive accounting records are audited by independent professional auditors to ensure the integrity of the trading platform. The exchange aims to comply with all current applicable EU regulations, ensuring that assets never get seized or frozen. Customer balances on the liability side must match exactly the inventory of coins held by the exchange. Blockchain.io aims to perform such balance check and to publish its cryptographic proof at every block interval.   Reliable Infrastructure  Minimal downtime, typically restricted to server maintenance, application upgrades, or database migration. Resilience under high volume, heavy traffic conditions, or DDoS attacks. No technical debt: exchanges that quickly add new altcoins or new features without proper testing or careful software design accumulate technical debt by taking shortcuts. Technical debt translates into applications that are harder to maintain and prone to bugs and security holes. Blockchain.io will attract high volume traders with specific features such as a FIX API and a borrowing facility, but also with the high level of availability of the trading platform. Processing capacity in the first phase will be of up to 2 million orders per day.   Select Digital Currencies  Cryptocurrencies will be listed on the trading platform following a strict vetting process (sustainability, technical, and deep protocol review) by our team of blockchain experts. Regular updates and publications will inform platform stakeholders and the community through altcoin technical reviews and financial analyses.  ICO Execution & Token Listing  Blockchain.io will provide ICO campaign support and token listing services to assist entrepreneurs and technologists in the planning and execution of their fundraising campaigns. Following the ICO campaigns, Blockchain.io will ensure that newly created tokens are listed on Blockchain.io to provide liquidity to investors and traders. In addition, Blockchain.io will create Token liquidity through: Market making using Blockchain.io’s inventory Incentive program for Paymium users.   http://tinyimg.io/i/Ax2ksCc.png  Blockchain.io is driven by the highly experienced team of cryptocurrency experts who, seven years ago, founded Paymium, a fiat/bitcoin exchange catering to the underserved Euro market. Blockchain.io shares Paymium’s highest security, reliability, and accountability standards. It strives to overcome the shortcomings of rival crypto exchanges that have repeatedly caused severe losses for issuers and token holders.

There are already quite a few cryptocurrency exchanges so what is the value proposition with this one? They claim they want to be the exchange of trust for individuals and institutional traders and investors. Cryptocurrency is still early stage, and we need this kind of exchange that can onboard institutionals to give the whole industry more credibility as well as propel it to mainstream adoption. An exchange that can facilitate the flow of money from big players could lead to tremendous values for the whole space, and that is something I would like to see.  Now why is blockchain.io interesting? Let's have a quick look at the team:  Pierre Noizat: He holds an MSc from Ecole Polytechnique, France’s leading Engineering School. He is the CEO of Paymium, a company he co-founded in 2011 as one of the first bitcoin exchanges in the world, so this isn't some random person just trying to ride the wave.  They say they want to be the exchange of trust for institutionals, one of their advisor, Jean-Pascal Beaufret, is Former Head of the Tax Administration at the French Ministry of Finance and working with Goldman Sachs.  They have several other advisors from NewFund, Tikehau Investment Management and more.

We are happy to hear that you find our advisory board impressive. Regarding our team, we only displayed C-Level team members on this thread. In the manifesto, please note that we did not mention all members of our team (both those in tech and on the marketing side) because we are running an exchange and we need to keep some members anonymous as failsafes. It's true that we could have mentioned their presence.  I respectfully disagree concerning your remarks about the team. The project here is building an exchange; not a blockchain. Our team is composed of exchange experts from both the crypto-sphere and the traditional financial world. To remove any doubts about our capabilities, the Blockchain.io platform is currently being developed as we speak. The Alpha is planned for June 2018 and the Beta for late July. Early investors will get access to Alpha & Beta.  Concerning volume, the situation will shift soon. We are currently working with a French bank and are constrained by French banking regulation, which is one of the strictest in the world. The banking cartel is very strong and proactively undermines our business. Following our migration to a different banking partner, they have imposed uncompetitive funding limits (10K€/year), preventing any significant high-volume traders from boosting volume and fueling platform liquidity. We are currently working on an alternative banking solution in Europe, and we plan to add USD & JPY to our bitcoin exchange. We are confident that volume will be back on Paymium once this is settled.  On the profitability side, please note that we have been operating a bitcoin exchange since 2011, thus we have significant reserves. The two previous years have been good regarding volume. The last few months have been tough, but we still largely benefited from the price rally of 2016 and especially that of last year. When considering hacking, this is one of our main concerns. 24H volume has little bearing on the funds held on our platform. With around 200,000 users, hackers will certainly try something, but we have developed very high security standards (more than 98% of cold storage), keeping our customers' funds safe.  Concerning the Blockchain.io exchange, our main exclusive feature is decentralized settlement. Blockchain.io will offer the possibility to settle trades without giving the custody of coins, which erases the last potential point-of-failure. Order Books will remain centralized, guaranteeing high-performance matching and liquid markets. Of course, this feature will be optional, as it could not fit some user profiles, such as market-makers (who prefer velocity over high security). Moreover, Blockchain.io will also offer basic & advanced trade orders from the start. In the long run, we plan to implement margin trading and peer-to-peer lending. Please check out our roadmap at this end of the thread.  Last, but not least, Blockchain.io will have a strong focus on institutions. We believe that ICOs will become the main way to raise funds, and that large companies will approach us to launch their respective tokens for new product launches. Our team is highly experienced and has strong connections in the traditional financial world, therefore, we are aiming to become the primary interlocutor for such companies. Blockchain.io will offer its expertise and knowledge to provide complete ICO services, from planning and execution to token listing on our platform.  Please feel free to ask further questions if you have any. In all, development is ongoing, but coming along very well.  Thank you very much. The Blockchain.io Team",False

I am encouraged with this new cryptocurrency exchange project by Blockchain.io because it meet and exceeds many of so needed features that make an exchange transparent, secure and reliable. Here are examples which make me to support this initiative:  - Security: the centralized component secures cold storage (98%+) and cryptographic proof of reserves. Internal procedures protect the platform from socially engineered attacks. - Decentralization: Decentralized settlement process embeds fair-exchange protocols allowing atomic swaps of cryptocurrencies to eliminate the counter-party inherent risks. - Transparency and compliance: Blockchain.io will comply with all current applicable EU regulations, ensuring that assets never get seized or frozen. - Infrastructure reliability: minimal downtime, resilience to high volume conditions and DDoS attacks  P.S: It would be interesting for some of us to benefit from demo accounts with which we could why help the community by giving our feelings.",False

We also offer a whitelabel platform for ICO projects.The result is a robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double spending.

The internet of value enables users to securely trade assets, rights, goods and services, globally and around the clock, without the involvement of a centralized authority, or traditional financial intermediaries, or so called ‘trusted’ third-parties.  The Internet of value is built on multiple decentralized, automated, transparent, and secure blockchain-based value networks. Different networks operate different versions of the blockchain, which in turn are fueled by different cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, or Litecoin. Each network meets the needs of certain types of transactions, such as high-value payments or title registry, or the needs of specific trading communities, such as a network of autonomous objects or an industry sector.  Blockchain.io as the leading exchange in the Internet of Value will enable users to trade across all these value networks.  Cryptocurrency Exchanges Enable Users to Navigate the Internet of Value  Cryptocurrency exchanges enable users to trade across multiple value networks powered by heterogeneous blockchains.  As the number of cryptocurrencies grows, cryptocurrency exchanges become the marketplaces for listing and trading cryptocurrencies. In the current context, users mainly buy cryptocurrencies as a store of value, in anticipation of a future value increase. As exchanges list multiple cryptocurrencies in one place, supply information about them, enable comparisons, and set bid/ask prices according to demand, they help separate the valuable cryptocurrencies from the useless ones. Investors become increasingly discriminate in their choices of cryptocurrencies as a store of value or as a utility token.  As technological and regulatory barriers to the Internet of value will be lifted, cryptocurrencies and decentralized value networks will gain mainstream acceptance. To trade on these different networks, users will need to buy multiple digital currencies and to exchange them as their needs evolve.  Blockchain.io will list a careful selection of cryptocurrencies: Proof-of-Work (POW) coins such as Bitcoin, Ether or Litecoin, Proof-of-Stake (POS) coins like Qtum or Stratis, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) coins, and other cryptographic protocols yet to be designed and minted.  Essential Features http://tinyimg.io/i/bPKSdNn.png  Ultra-Secure & Decentralized  The centralized part of the exchange offers highly secure custody services with cold storage and cryptographic proof of reserve. Cryptocurrencies are held in cold storage (offline) for at least 98% of reserves. A cold wallet access requires multiple signatures. A cold wallet private key is split and held in a number of different vaults in multiple locations. Other in-house security processes and technological features. Internal procedures protect the exchange from social engineering attacks. Periodic technical audits and timestamped logs allow detection of any tampering attempts in the accounting database. Periodic financial audits verify that the inventory of coins (assets side) matches the records of liabilities with cryptographic proof. If the exchange’s customer balances are checked against a blockchain inventory of coins (utxos in Bitcoin language) every block interval, there is little or no room for a rogue intruder to alter database records with profit. Decentralized settlement relies on fair-exchange protocols allowing atomic swaps of cryptocurrencies to eliminate the counter-party risk inherent to a custodial exchange.  Fully Compliant & Transparent  Exhaustive accounting records are audited by independent professional auditors to ensure the integrity of the trading platform. The exchange aims to comply with all current applicable EU regulations, ensuring that assets never get seized or frozen. Customer balances on the liability side must match exactly the inventory of coins held by the exchange. Blockchain.io aims to perform such balance check and to publish its cryptographic proof at every block interval.   Reliable Infrastructure  Minimal downtime, typically restricted to server maintenance, application upgrades, or database migration. Resilience under high volume, heavy traffic conditions, or DDoS attacks. No technical debt: exchanges that quickly add new altcoins or new features without proper testing or careful software design accumulate technical debt by taking shortcuts. Technical debt translates into applications that are harder to maintain and prone to bugs and security holes. Blockchain.io will attract high volume traders with specific features such as a FIX API and a borrowing facility, but also with the high level of availability of the trading platform. Processing capacity in the first phase will be of up to 2 million orders per day.   Select Digital Currencies  Cryptocurrencies will be listed on the trading platform following a strict vetting process (sustainability, technical, and deep protocol review) by our team of blockchain experts. Regular updates and publications will inform platform stakeholders and the community through altcoin technical reviews and financial analyses.  ICO Execution & Token Listing  Blockchain.io will provide ICO campaign support and token listing services to assist entrepreneurs and technologists in the planning and execution of their fundraising campaigns. Following the ICO campaigns, Blockchain.io will ensure that newly created tokens are listed on Blockchain.io to provide liquidity to investors and traders. In addition, Blockchain.io will create Token liquidity through: Market making using Blockchain.io’s inventory Incentive program for Paymium users.   http://tinyimg.io/i/Ax2ksCc.png  Blockchain.io is driven by the highly experienced team of cryptocurrency experts who, seven years ago, founded Paymium, a fiat/bitcoin exchange catering to the underserved Euro market. Blockchain.io shares Paymium’s highest security, reliability, and accountability standards. It strives to overcome the shortcomings of rival crypto exchanges that have repeatedly caused severe losses for issuers and token holders. To achieve this, the team relies on its advanced knowledge of cryptographic technology, its operational in-depth understanding of the crypto world, and a strong company culture committed to security and compliance.

Each block characteristically contains a crypto-graphic hash of the earlier block, a timestamp, and operation data. By design, a block-chain is opposed to modification of the data. Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree. Each block includes the cryptographic hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks form a chain. This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way back to the original genesis block.  A block-chain is a decentralized, dispersed and community digital ledger that is used to confirmation transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be distorted retroactively without the modification of all succeeding blocks and the consensus of the network. This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions inexpensively. A block-chain database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed time-stamping server. They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests.",False

As exchanges list multiple cryptocurrencies in one place, supply information about them, enable comparisons, and set bid/ask prices according to demand, they help separate the valuable cryptocurrencies from the useless ones. Investors become increasingly discriminate in their choices of cryptocurrencies as a store of value or as a utility token.",False

They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests.The result is a robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double spending. Blockchains have been described as a value-exchange protocol. This blockchain-based exchange of value can be completed quicker, safer and cheaper than with traditional systems. A blockchain can assign title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.  Nice project.",False

I could be there's a certain possibilities that bitcoin was the greatest biggest scam ever created by humanity who know only satoshi can answer that, but if this happens lot of people who will not trust crypto for a long time for sure and it will have a huge impact to the crypto community in a certain point where no one else will believe in crypto.  just showing my insight it could be wrong, foremost the important is say your side and opinion might not affect the others right. Because, blockchain is a decentralised system. It means that bitcoin transactions cannot be tracked or prevented. It is very bad for the governments. They can now control all the money flow in banks. But, they won't be able to control btc transfers. As we know, bitcoin was initially used for illegal things such as serial killer renting, drugs etc. Thanks!",False

Today we have the ability to exchange and manage assets by private entities like Banks (Money transactions, Loans), Governments (Land, car, apartment ownership), AirBnB (connecting free apartments with bed seekers), Uber (Connecting free drivers with transportation seekers) and so on. Banks for example have management systems to make sure there is no double spending or that someone actually holds the money they wish to transfer. These systems cost time, fees, and are vulnerable to hacks (one system to hack). The blockchain allows someone to transfer a digital asset to another without an intermediary. The miners/nodes validate that there is no double spending and that one has the money he intends to send. It significantly reduces costs, time, and is extremely secure.

Think of a giant, global spreadsheet that runs on millions and millions of computers. It’s distributed. It’s open source, so anyone can change the underlying code, and they can see what’s going on. It’s truly peer to peer; it doesn’t require powerful intermediaries to authenticate or to settle transactions. It uses state-of-the-art cryptography, so if we have a global, distributed database that can record the fact that we’ve done this transaction, what else could it record? Well, it could record any structured information, not just who paid whom but also who married whom or who owns what land or what light bought power from what power source.  In the case of the Internet of Things, we’re going to need a blockchain-settlement system underneath. Banks won’t be able to settle trillions of real-time transactions between things. So this is an extraordinary thing. An immutable, unhackable distributed database of digital assets. This is a platform for truth and it’s a platform for trust. The implications are staggering, not just for the financial-services industry but also right across virtually every aspect of society. Most blockchains—and Bitcoin is the biggest—are what you call permission-less systems. We can do transactions and satisfy each other’s economic needs without knowing who the other party is and independent from central authorities.",False

One problem with CEXs: they are much easier to hack than decentralized exchanges, and many new coins are only listed on new and unproven CEXs – often leaving emerging cryptos more vulnerable. We have seen the failings of CEXs (which operate uninsured and unregulated) in various cryptocurrency exchange hacks over the years, most famously when Mt. Gox lost ~850,000 BTC, and they continue to occur too frequently.  An alternative to CEXs are decentralized exchanges (DEXs) which, much like Bitcoin, use peer-to-peer technology. With a DEX, users resume total control of their funds and have the security of trading directly from their own wallets with on-chain settlement and don’t rely on any central authority’s supervision. Transactions can be executed on smart contracts and atomic swaps using what is known as Hashed TimeLock Contracts (HTLCs). DEXs are less vulnerable to attacks, but still in their infancy. Many are not as user-friendly, offer less functionality, and lack the liquidity offered by CEXs.  Traders who want everything cryptocurrency has been touted to offer including liquidity, low-latency and security, don’t really have many options. The best solution is an exchange platform that combines a decentralized “trustless” cross-chain “fair exchange” settlement with the technology of a centralized custodial exchange. This allows decentralized options if users feel like settling a transaction without the supervision of a third party (eliminating counterparty risk), but also the efficiency of a low-latency, fully-featured centralized exchange when they need quick and liquid trading for exchanging large volumes. Many people are ready to move away from CEXs and DEXs to a platform that can meet all their needs.  Blockchain.io looks poised to offer users the best option available for any scenario, and it will all be available at a single exchange.  CEXs and DEXs have their strengths, but neither is able to give traders everything they need. A credible cryptocurrency exchange needs to be accessible, efficient and functional; it must encourage trade while ensuring trust. Blockchain.io, a centralized exchange with a decentralized settlement, aims to do just that and I look forward to trying it out.",False

Here is description: Blockchain.io aims to become the most reliable crypto-assets marketplace in Europe, where crypto-currencies and tokens will be traded securely among institutional and individual investors. BCIO tokens will be available for trading in October 2018, which will mark the end of our ICO. Blockchain is centralized order-book with decentralized settlement, which is encourage trade while ensuring trust. A centralized exchange with a decentralized settlement will do just that. According to Pierre Tavernier, the Blockchain.io platform will combine a centralized custodial exchange with a decentralized “trustless” cross-chain “fair exchange” settlement. The centralized exchange will be low-latency and full-featured, with custody services, centralized order booking and efficient order matching. Blockchain has three characteristics: Fully compliant and transparent; Ultra-secure and non-custodial; and Reliable infrastructure. These items would protect your assets and mitigate your risk at least. According to Blockchain, there are liquidity services as follows: + Built on Paymium’s proven security and technological record. A high level of digital asset protection and safe record of transactions. + Built on fair-exchange protocols enabling cryptocurrency atomic swaps to mitigate counter-part risk. + Advisory and technology services to execute third-party ICOs. New listing and market making services to foster enhanced token liquidity. In addition, Blockchain has a team of talented and professional people: Pierre Noizat (CEO), Dominique Rodrigues (CTO), Pierre Tavernier (CMO), Laetitia Zito (CFO) and other outperformed staffs. All of them are specialists in their field and have a great deal of experience. They devoted their time and efforts to build Blockchain. Therefore, it will help Blockchain develop and advance in the cryptocurrency world. In conclusion, I think that this is a huge potential and good project! I hope the project will develop in the future and will go to the moon. Good luck to your team. I will support the project until the end. I hope you can share your results as soon as possible.",False

Resilience under high volume, heavy traffic conditions, or DDoS attacks. DDoS attacks is really a fear of me since I always put my money on exchanges.

Blockchain.io shares Paymium’s highest security, reliability, and accountability standards. It strives to overcome the shortcomings of rival crypto exchanges that have repeatedly caused severe losses for issuers and token holders. To achieve this, the team relies on its advanced knowledge of cryptographic technology, its operational in-depth understanding of the crypto world, and a strong company culture committed to security and compliance. Cryptocurrency exchanges enable users to trade across multiple value networks powered by heterogeneous blockchains.  As the number of cryptocurrencies grows, cryptocurrency exchanges become the marketplaces for listing and trading cryptocurrencies. In the current context, users mainly buy cryptocurrencies as a store of value, in anticipation of a future value increase. As exchanges list multiple cryptocurrencies in one place, supply information about them, enable comparisons, and set bid/ask prices according to demand, they help separate the valuable cryptocurrencies from the useless ones. Investors become increasingly discriminate in their choices of cryptocurrencies as a store of value or as a utility token.  As technological and regulatory barriers to the Internet of value will be lifted, cryptocurrencies and decentralized value networks will gain mainstream acceptance. To trade on these different networks, users will need to buy multiple digital currencies and to exchange them as their needs evolve.  Blockchain.io will list a careful selection of cryptocurrencies: Proof-of-Work (POW) coins such as Bitcoin, Ether or Litecoin, Proof-of-Stake (POS) coins like Qtum or Stratis, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) coins, and other cryptographic protocols yet to be designed and minted.",False

The future of Bitcoin was one of the hot topics at this year’s Sohn Investment Conference. The leading cryptocurrency is the first viable candidate to replace gold according to John Pfeffer, hedge fund manager at Pfeffer Capital. Bitcoin could rise to no less than $90,000 in the next couple of years, and potentially as high as $700,000, Pfeffer predicted during the annual event.",False

The advisory board is awesome and very professional, however, I don't find the core team capable to achieve their goal. There are no experienced blockchain developers at all. You claim like Paymium exist since the 2011 and it is secure (hack proof), I bet it is with the 24k USD volume, who will be interested to hack it? Also, you claim it is profitable. How can it be profitable with such volume of trading?  There are good partners on board, one of them Kima Ventures who backed Ledger back in a days.

The Block-chain innovation is more prominent. Blockchain.io will be the pioneer who make the advantages of digital money to more individuals in this excellent world. In what manner will cryptographic money encourage you?  Misrepresentation: Individuals cryptographic forms of money are computerized and can't be forged or turned around discretionarily by the sender, similarly as with Visa charge-backs.  Prompt Settlement:Purchasing genuine property commonly includes some outsiders (Lawyers, Notary), deferrals, and installment of expenses. From numerous points of view, the bitcoin/digital money blockchain resembles a ""huge property rights database,"" says Gallippi. Bitcoin contracts can be composed and implemented to dispose of or include outsider endorsements, reference outer actualities, or be finished at a future date or time for a small amount of the cost and time required to finish customary resource exchanges.  Lower Fees: There aren't generally exchange expenses for digital money trades on the grounds that the diggers are remunerated by the system (Side note: This is the situation for the present). Despite the fact that there's no bitcoin/cryptographic money exchange charge, numerous expect that most clients will connect with an outsider administration, for example, Coinbase, making and keeping up their bitcoin wallets. These administrations demonstration like Paypal improves the situation money or Mastercard clients, giving the online trade framework to bitcoin, and thusly, they're probably going to charge expenses. It's fascinating to take note of that Paypal does not acknowledge or exchange bitcoins.  Wholesale fraud: When you give your charge card to a trader, you give him or her entrance to your full credit line, regardless of whether the exchange is for a little sum. Visas work on a ""draw"" premise, where the store starts the installment and pulls the assigned sum from your record. Digital money utilizes a ""push"" system that enables the cryptographic money holder to send precisely what he or she needs to the dealer or beneficiary with no additional data.  Access to Everyone: There are roughly 2.2 billion people with access to the Internet or cell phones who don't as of now approach conventional trade, these individuals are prepared for the Cryptocurrency showcase. Kenya's M-PESA framework, a cell phone-based cash exchange, and microfinancing administration as of late declared a bitcoin gadget, with one of every three Kenyans presently owning a bitcoin wallet. (Give me a chance to rehash that. 1/3)  Decentralization: A worldwide system of PCs utilize blockchain innovation to together deal with the database that records Bitcoin exchanges. That is, Bitcoin is overseen by its system, and no one focal specialist. Decentralization implies the system works on a client to-client (or distributed) premise. The types of mass cooperation this makes conceivable are simply starting to be examined.  Acknowledgment at general level: Since cryptographic money isn't bound by the trade rates, loan costs, exchanges charges or different charges of any nation; in this way it can be utilized at a worldwide level without encountering any issues. This, thusly, spares loads of time and in addition cash with respect to any business which is generally spent in exchanging cash from one nation to the next.

The internet of value enables users to securely trade assets, rights, goods and services, globally and around the clock, without the involvement of a centralized authority, or traditional financial intermediaries, or so called ‘trusted’ third-parties.  The Internet of value is built on multiple decentralized, automated, transparent, and secure blockchain-based value networks. Different networks operate different versions of the blockchain, which in turn are fueled by different cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, or Litecoin. Each network meets the needs of certain types of transactions, such as high-value payments or title registry, or the needs of specific trading communities, such as a network of autonomous objects or an industry sector.  Blockchain.io as the leading exchange in the Internet of Value will enable users to trade across all these value networks.  Cryptocurrency Exchanges Enable Users to Navigate the Internet of Value Join the next successful project  Cryptocurrency exchanges enable users to trade across multiple value networks powered by heterogeneous blockchains.  As the number of cryptocurrencies grows, cryptocurrency exchanges become the marketplaces for listing and trading cryptocurrencies. In the current context, users mainly buy cryptocurrencies as a store of value, in anticipation of a future value increase. As exchanges list multiple cryptocurrencies in one place, supply information about them, enable comparisons, and set bid/ask prices according to demand, they help separate the valuable cryptocurrencies from the useless ones. Investors become increasingly discriminate in their choices of cryptocurrencies as a store of value or as a utility token.  As technological and regulatory barriers to the Internet of value will be lifted, cryptocurrencies and decentralized value networks will gain mainstream acceptance. To trade on these different networks, users will need to buy multiple digital currencies and to exchange them as their needs evolve.

The internet of value enables users to securely trade assets, rights, goods and services, globally and around the clock, without the involvement of a centralized authority, or traditional financial intermediaries, or so called ‘trusted’ third-parties.  The Internet of value is built on multiple decentralized, automated, transparent, and secure blockchain-based value networks. Different networks operate different versions of the blockchain, which in turn are fueled by different cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, or Litecoin. Each network meets the needs of certain types of transactions, such as high-value payments or title registry, or the needs of specific trading communities, such as a network of autonomous objects or an industry sector.  Blockchain.io as the leading exchange in the Internet of Value will enable users to trade across all these value networks.  Cryptocurrency Exchanges Enable Users to Navigate the Internet of Value  Cryptocurrency exchanges enable users to trade across multiple value networks powered by heterogeneous blockchains.  As the number of cryptocurrencies grows, cryptocurrency exchanges become the marketplaces for listing and trading cryptocurrencies. In the current context, users mainly buy cryptocurrencies as a store of value, in anticipation of a future value increase. As exchanges list multiple cryptocurrencies in one place, supply information about them, enable comparisons, and set bid/ask prices according to demand, they help separate the valuable cryptocurrencies from the useless ones. Investors become increasingly discriminate in their choices of cryptocurrencies as a store of value or as a utility token.  As technological and regulatory barriers to the Internet of value will be lifted, cryptocurrencies and decentralized value networks will gain mainstream acceptance. To trade on these different networks, users will need to buy multiple digital currencies and to exchange them as their needs evolve.  Blockchain.io will list a careful selection of cryptocurrencies: Proof-of-Work (POW) coins such as Bitcoin, Ether or Litecoin, Proof-of-Stake (POS) coins like Qtum or Stratis, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) coins, and other cryptographic protocols yet to be designed and minted.  Essential Features http://tinyimg.io/i/bPKSdNn.png  Ultra-Secure & Decentralized  The centralized part of the exchange offers highly secure custody services with cold storage and cryptographic proof of reserve. Cryptocurrencies are held in cold storage (offline) for at least 98% of reserves. A cold wallet access requires multiple signatures. A cold wallet private key is split and held in a number of different vaults in multiple locations. Other in-house security processes and technological features. Internal procedures protect the exchange from social engineering attacks. Periodic technical audits and timestamped logs allow detection of any tampering attempts in the accounting database. Periodic financial audits verify that the inventory of coins (assets side) matches the records of liabilities with cryptographic proof. If the exchange’s customer balances are checked against a blockchain inventory of coins (utxos in Bitcoin language) every block interval, there is little or no room for a rogue intruder to alter database records with profit. Decentralized settlement relies on fair-exchange protocols allowing atomic swaps of cryptocurrencies to eliminate the counter-party risk inherent to a custodial exchange.  Fully Compliant & Transparent  Exhaustive accounting records are audited by independent professional auditors to ensure the integrity of the trading platform. The exchange aims to comply with all current applicable EU regulations, ensuring that assets never get seized or frozen. Customer balances on the liability side must match exactly the inventory of coins held by the exchange. Blockchain.io aims to perform such balance check and to publish its cryptographic proof at every block interval.   Reliable Infrastructure  Minimal downtime, typically restricted to server maintenance, application upgrades, or database migration. Resilience under high volume, heavy traffic conditions, or DDoS attacks. No technical debt: exchanges that quickly add new altcoins or new features without proper testing or careful software design accumulate technical debt by taking shortcuts. Technical debt translates into applications that are harder to maintain and prone to bugs and security holes. Blockchain.io will attract high volume traders with specific features such as a FIX API and a borrowing facility, but also with the high level of availability of the trading platform. Processing capacity in the first phase will be of up to 2 million orders per day.   Select Digital Currencies  Cryptocurrencies will be listed on the trading platform following a strict vetting process (sustainability, technical, and deep protocol review) by our team of blockchain experts. Regular updates and publications will inform platform stakeholders and the community through altcoin technical reviews and financial analyses.  ICO Execution & Token Listing  Blockchain.io will provide ICO campaign support and token listing services to assist entrepreneurs and technologists in the planning and execution of their fundraising campaigns. Following the ICO campaigns, Blockchain.io will ensure that newly created tokens are listed on Blockchain.io to provide liquidity to investors and traders. In addition, Blockchain.io will create Token liquidity through: Market making using Blockchain.io’s inventory Incentive program for Paymium users.   http://tinyimg.io/i/Ax2ksCc.png  Blockchain.io is driven by the highly experienced team of cryptocurrency experts who, seven years ago, founded Paymium, a fiat/bitcoin exchange catering to the underserved Euro market. Blockchain.io shares Paymium’s highest security, reliability, and accountability standards. It strives to overcome the shortcomings of rival crypto exchanges that have repeatedly caused severe losses for issuers and token holders. To achieve this, the team relies on its advanced knowledge of cryptographic technology, its operational in-depth understanding of the crypto world, and a strong company culture committed to security and compliance.

The warning board is marvelous and extremely proficient, be that as it may, I don't discover the center group able to accomplish their objective. There are no accomplished blockchain designers by any stretch of the imagination. You assert like Paymium exist since the 2011 and it is secure (hack verification), I wager it is with the 24k USD volume, will's identity intrigued to hack it? Likewise, you guarantee it is beneficial. How might it be beneficial with such volume of exchanging?  There are great accomplices on board, one of them Kima Ventures who sponsored Ledger in a days. I didn't ponder whitepaper tho, since I'm not awed with the group. I can not be right, only my considerations.  Concerning volume, the circumstance will move soon. We are at present working with a French bank and are compelled by French keeping money direction, which is one of the strictest on the planet. The saving money cartel is extremely solid and proactively undermines our business. Following our movement to an alternate saving money accomplice, they have forced uncompetitive subsidizing limits (10K€/year), keeping any critical high-volume merchants from boosting volume and filling stage liquidity. We are at present chipping away at an elective managing an account arrangement in Europe, and we intend to add USD and JPY to our bitcoin trade. We are sure that volume will be back on Paymium once this is settled.  Concerning the Blockchain.io trade, our primary selective component is decentralized settlement. Blockchain.io will offer the likelihood to settle exchanges without giving the authority of coins, which eradicates the last potential purpose of-disappointment. Request Books will stay incorporated, ensuring elite coordinating and fluid markets. Obviously, this component will be discretionary, as it couldn't fit some client profiles, for example, advertise producers (who favor speed over high security).  Additionally, Blockchain.io will likewise offer essential and propelled exchange orders from the begin. Over the long haul, we intend to actualize edge exchanging and shared loaning. If it's not too much trouble look at our guide at this finish of the string.  Last, however not minimum, Blockchain.io will have a solid spotlight on organizations. We trust that ICOs will turn into the primary method to raise reserves, and that huge organizations will approach us to dispatch their individual tokens for new item dispatches. Our group is profoundly experienced and has solid associations in the conventional money related world, in this way, we are expecting to end up the essential conversationalist for such organizations. Blockchain.io will offer its skill and information to give finish ICO administrations, from arranging and execution to token posting on our stage.  On the productivity side, if it's not too much trouble take note of that we have been working a bitcoin trade since 2011, in this way we have noteworthy stores. The two earlier years have been great in regards to volume. The most recent couple of months have been extreme, yet we still to a great extent profit by the value rally of 2016 and particularly that of a year ago.  While considering hacking, this is one of our primary concerns. 24H volume has small bearing on the assets hung on our stage. With around 200,000 clients, programmers will unquestionably have a go at something, however we have grown high security guidelines (over 98% of chilly stockpiling), guarding our clients' assets.  Concerning the Blockchain.io trade, our principle elite element is decentralized settlement.

The internet of value enables users to securely trade assets, rights, goods and services, globally and around the clock, without the involvement of a centralized authority, or traditional financial intermediaries, or so called ‘trusted’ third-parties.  The Internet of value is built on multiple decentralized, automated, transparent, and secure blockchain-based value networks. Different networks operate different versions of the blockchain, which in turn are fueled by different cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, or Litecoin. Each network meets the needs of certain types of transactions, such as high-value payments or title registry, or the needs of specific trading communities, such as a network of autonomous objects or an industry sector.  Blockchain.io as the leading exchange in the Internet of Value will enable users to trade across all these value networks.  Cryptocurrency Exchanges Enable Users to Navigate the Internet of Value  Cryptocurrency exchanges enable users to trade across multiple value networks powered by heterogeneous blockchains.  As the number of cryptocurrencies grows, cryptocurrency exchanges become the marketplaces for listing and trading cryptocurrencies. In the current context, users mainly buy cryptocurrencies as a store of value, in anticipation of a future value increase. As exchanges list multiple cryptocurrencies in one place, supply information about them, enable comparisons, and set bid/ask prices according to demand, they help separate the valuable cryptocurrencies from the useless ones. Investors become increasingly discriminate in their choices of cryptocurrencies as a store of value or as a utility token.  As technological and regulatory barriers to the Internet of value will be lifted, cryptocurrencies and decentralized value networks will gain mainstream acceptance. To trade on these different networks, users will need to buy multiple digital currencies and to exchange them as their needs evolve.  Blockchain.io will list a careful selection of cryptocurrencies: Proof-of-Work (POW) coins such as Bitcoin, Ether or Litecoin, Proof-of-Stake (POS) coins like Qtum or Stratis, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) coins, and other cryptographic protocols yet to be designed and minted.  Essential Features  Ultra-Secure & Decentralized  The centralized part of the exchange offers highly secure custody services with cold storage and cryptographic proof of reserve. Cryptocurrencies are held in cold storage (offline) for at least 98% of reserves. A cold wallet access requires multiple signatures. A cold wallet private key is split and held in a number of different vaults in multiple locations. Other in-house security processes and technological features. Internal procedures protect the exchange from social engineering attacks. Periodic technical audits and timestamped logs allow detection of any tampering attempts in the accounting database. Periodic financial audits verify that the inventory of coins (assets side) matches the records of liabilities with cryptographic proof. If the exchange’s customer balances are checked against a blockchain inventory of coins (utxos in Bitcoin language) every block interval, there is little or no room for a rogue intruder to alter database records with profit. Decentralized settlement relies on fair-exchange protocols allowing atomic swaps of cryptocurrencies to eliminate the counter-party risk inherent to a custodial exchange.  Fully Compliant & Transparent  Exhaustive accounting records are audited by independent professional auditors to ensure the integrity of the trading platform. The exchange aims to comply with all current applicable EU regulations, ensuring that assets never get seized or frozen. Customer balances on the liability side must match exactly the inventory of coins held by the exchange. Blockchain.io aims to perform such balance check and to publish its cryptographic proof at every block interval.   Reliable Infrastructure  Minimal downtime, typically restricted to server maintenance, application upgrades, or database migration. Resilience under high volume, heavy traffic conditions, or DDoS attacks. No technical debt: exchanges that quickly add new altcoins or new features without proper testing or careful software design accumulate technical debt by taking shortcuts. Technical debt translates into applications that are harder to maintain and prone to bugs and security holes. Blockchain.io will attract high volume traders with specific features such as a FIX API and a borrowing facility, but also with the high level of availability of the trading platform. Processing capacity in the first phase will be of up to 2 million orders per day.   Select Digital Currencies  Cryptocurrencies will be listed on the trading platform following a strict vetting process (sustainability, technical, and deep protocol review) by our team of blockchain experts. Regular updates and publications will inform platform stakeholders and the community through altcoin technical reviews and financial analyses.  ICO Execution & Token Listing  Blockchain.io will provide ICO campaign support and token listing services to assist entrepreneurs and technologists in the planning and execution of their fundraising campaigns. Following the ICO campaigns, Blockchain.io will ensure that newly created tokens are listed on Blockchain.io to provide liquidity to investors and traders. In addition, Blockchain.io will create Token liquidity through: Market making using Blockchain.io’s inventory Incentive program for Paymium users.    Blockchain.io is driven by the highly experienced team of cryptocurrency experts who, seven years ago, founded Paymium, a fiat/bitcoin exchange catering to the underserved Euro market. Blockchain.io shares Paymium’s highest security, reliability, and accountability standards. It strives to overcome the shortcomings of rival crypto exchanges that have repeatedly caused severe losses for issuers and token holders. To achieve this, the team relies on its advanced knowledge of cryptographic technology, its operational in-depth understanding of the crypto world, and a strong company culture committed to security and compliance.  Paymium, the company behind Blockchain.io  Relationship between the two platforms  Together with Paymium, Blockchain.io aims to become the leading cryptographic exchange in Europe by 2020.

As the number of cryptocurrencies grows, cryptocurrency exchanges become the marketplaces for listing and trading cryptocurrencies. In the current context, users mainly buy cryptocurrencies as a store of value, in anticipation of a future value increase. As exchanges list multiple cryptocurrencies in one place, supply information about them, enable comparisons, and set bid/ask prices according to demand, they help separate the valuable cryptocurrencies from the useless ones. Investors become increasingly discriminate in their choices of cryptocurrencies as a store of value or as a utility token.  As technological and regulatory barriers to the Internet of value will be lifted, cryptocurrencies and decentralized value networks will gain mainstream acceptance. To trade on these different networks, users will need to buy multiple digital currencies and to exchange them as their needs evolve.  Blockchain.io will list a careful selection of cryptocurrencies: Proof-of-Work (POW) coins such as Bitcoin, Ether or Litecoin, Proof-of-Stake (POS) coins like Qtum or Stratis, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) coins, and other cryptographic protocols yet to be designed and minted.",False

We are happy to hear that you find our advisory board impressive. Regarding our team, we only displayed C-Level team members on this thread. In the manifesto, please note that we did not mention all members of our team (both those in tech and on the marketing side) because we are running an exchange and we need to keep some members anonymous as failsafes. It's true that we could have mentioned their presence.  I respectfully disagree concerning your remarks about the team. The project here is building an exchange; not a blockchain. Our team is composed of exchange experts from both the crypto-sphere and the traditional financial world. To remove any doubts about our capabilities, the Blockchain.io platform is currently being developed as we speak. The Alpha is planned for June 2018 and the Beta for late July. Early investors will get access to Alpha & Beta.  Concerning volume, the situation will shift soon. We are currently working with a French bank and are constrained by French banking regulation, which is one of the strictest in the world. The banking cartel is very strong and proactively undermines our business. Following our migration to a different banking partner, they have imposed uncompetitive funding limits (10K€/year), preventing any significant high-volume traders from boosting volume and fueling platform liquidity. We are currently working on an alternative banking solution in Europe, and we plan to add USD & JPY to our bitcoin exchange. We are confident that volume will be back on Paymium once this is settled.  On the profitability side, please note that we have been operating a bitcoin exchange since 2011, thus we have significant reserves. The two previous years have been good regarding volume. The last few months have been tough, but we still largely benefited from the price rally of 2016 and especially that of last year. When considering hacking, this is one of our main concerns. 24H volume has little bearing on the funds held on our platform. With around 200,000 users, hackers will certainly try something, but we have developed very high security standards (more than 98% of cold storage), keeping our customers' funds safe.  Concerning the Blockchain.io exchange, our main exclusive feature is decentralized settlement. Blockchain.io will offer the possibility to settle trades without giving the custody of coins, which erases the last potential point-of-failure. Order Books will remain centralized, guaranteeing high-performance matching and liquid markets. Of course, this feature will be optional, as it could not fit some user profiles, such as market-makers (who prefer velocity over high security). Moreover, Blockchain.io will also offer basic & advanced trade orders from the start. In the long run, we plan to implement margin trading and peer-to-peer lending. Please check out our roadmap at this end of the thread.  Last, but not least, Blockchain.io will have a strong focus on institutions. We believe that ICOs will become the main way to raise funds, and that large companies will approach us to launch their respective tokens for new product launches. Our team is highly experienced and has strong connections in the traditional financial world, therefore, we are aiming to become the primary interlocutor for such companies. Blockchain.io will offer its expertise and knowledge to provide complete ICO services, from planning and execution to token listing on our platform.  Please feel free to ask further questions if you have any. In all, development is ongoing, but coming along very well.  Thank you very much. The Blockchain.io Team",False

In the coming Internet of value, decentralized blockchain-operated value networks will become mainstream and compliant, enabling billions of Internet users to exchange value as quickly and as easily as they exchange information today.  Multiple cryptocurrencies will co-exist. Each cryptocurrency will serve the needs of a community of users to securely trade any type of assets, rights, goods, or services thatis of value to them in a decentralized value network, i.e. without supervision by a central authority.  As a cryptocurrency exchange, Blockchain.io will play a major role in the Internet of Value’s ecosystem. It will be the marketplace where cryptocurrencies will be traded against each other, a gateway to and a bridge across the multiple value networks powered by different blockchains/cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).  Blockchain.io will combine the efficiency of a low-latency full-featured centralized exchange with decentralized “trustless” cross-chain settlement. The project leverages the latest developments in cross-chain atomic swaps, cryptographic protocols, and payment networks such as Lightning and Raiden. These developments will overcome the scalability issues of decentralized blockchains, allow transactions across heterogenous blockchains, increase the speed and lower the cost of these transactions, making them ready for mass adoption.  Blockchain.io is driven by the highly experienced team of cryptocurrency experts who, seven years ago, founded Paymium, a fiat/bitcoin exchange catering to the underserved Euro market. Blockchain.io shares Paymium’s highest security, reliability, and accountability standards. It strives to overcome the shortcomings of rival crypto exchanges that have repeatedly caused severe losses for issuers and token holders. To achieve this, the team relies on its advanced knowledge of cryptographic technology, its operational in-depth understanding of the crypto world, and a strong company culture committed to security and compliance.",False

Wish you all the best !!!!!  Cryptocurrencies Power the Internet of Value In Blockchain.io’s vision the Internet of Value is the next level of evolution of the Internet. The internet of value enables users to securely trade assets, rights, goods and services, globally and around the clock, without the involvement of a centralized authority, or traditional financial intermediaries, or so called ‘trusted’ third-parties. The Internet of value is built on multiple decentralized, automated, transparent, and secure blockchain-based value networks. Different networks operate different versions of the blockchain, which in turn are fueled by different cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, or Litecoin. Each network meets the needs of certain types of transactions, such as high-value payments or title registry, or the needs of specific trading communities, such as a network of autonomous objects or an industry sector.Blockchain.io as the leading exchange in the Internet of Value will enable users to trade across all these value networks.  Cryptocurrency Exchanges Enable Users to Navigate the Internet of Value  Cryptocurrency exchanges enable users to trade across multiple value networks powered by heterogeneous blockchains.  As the number of cryptocurrencies grows, cryptocurrency exchanges become the marketplaces for listing and trading cryptocurrencies. In the current context, users mainly buy cryptocurrencies as a store of value, in anticipation of a future value increase. As exchanges list multiple cryptocurrencies in one place, supply information about them, enable comparisons, and set bid/ask prices according to demand, they help separate the valuable cryptocurrencies from the useless ones. Investors become increasingly discriminate in their choices of cryptocurrencies as a store of value or as a utility token.  As technological and regulatory barriers to the Internet of value will be lifted, cryptocurrencies and decentralized value networks will gain mainstream acceptance. To trade on these different networks, users will need to buy multiple digital currencies and to exchange them as their needs evolve.  Blockchain.io will list a careful selection of cryptocurrencies: Proof-of-Work (POW) coins such as Bitcoin, Ether or Litecoin, Proof-of-Stake (POS) coins like Qtum or Stratis, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) coins, and other cryptographic protocols yet to be designed and minted.",False

Let’s start, The main thing distinguishing a blockchain from a normal database is that there are specific rules about how to put data into the database. centralization or decentralization ? In the quest of the holy grail of block-chain decentralization is very attractive because it implies there is no single point of failure. That is, no single authority will be able to take away your asset or change “history” to suit their needs. This immutable audit trail where you don’t have to trust anyone is the benefit that everyone that’s play-ing with this technology is looking for . With this little knowledge, little guy try to find an exchange who answers to what he has just learn to feel really safe. Blockchain.io seems to giving an appropri-ate offer, little guy will keep an eye on this powerful project and get ready to be part of this beautiful journey. Tomorrow, he may switch on this plateform.  Stay tuned.",False

Cryptocurrencies are held in cold storage (offline) for at least 98% of reserves. A cold wallet access requires multiple signatures. A cold wallet private key is split and held in a number of different vaults in multiple locations. Other in-house security processes and technological features. Internal procedures protect the exchange from social engineering attacks. Periodic technical audits and timestamped logs allow detection of any tampering attempts in the accounting database. Periodic financial audits verify that the inventory of coins (assets side) matches the records of liabilities with cryptographic proof. If the exchange’s customer balances are checked against a blockchain inventory of coins (utxos in Bitcoin language) every block interval, there is little or no room for a rogue intruder to alter database records with profit.

Each cell contains information in electronic form, owned by any of us, and we can dispose of it personally, for which we are given a personal key. And God forbid you lose it, all that you have time to put in your cell will not be available, you will lose it forever.  All cells are linked together, forming a chain of blocks (cells) that are not connected to the common server. This is a kind of database that can be used equally by all Internet users. Only the owner of a cell can change the information in a particular cell. The right to do so and gives him a personal key.  By the way, the technology of blogging was first used as a component of bitcoin as a digital currency in 2009. It was based on the idea of using block chains, put forward a year before Satoshi Nakamoto.  The blockchain system assumes the highest degree of security of the data entered in the storage of your cells.  Is that so?  Not so long ago bought a smartphone. When trying to enter manually the key to enter the Voice, failed: it was extremely inconvenient to enter its data on this small device. Already having given up on this business a hand, decided that I will only read a news Tape, and to make all other operations on the laptop.  However, a few minutes later I found that I was still in the Voice network... How it happened, I can not even imagine.  In addition, one golasinski craftsman not long ago suggested how to recover a forgotten password using your own computer. I. e., if desired, any attacker will be able to find your secret valuable key.  It is unlikely that this system will protect your property or intellectual property rights, because to copy the text or photos posted by you, and give them for their own, can any dishonorable citizen, as I wrote about it not so long ago under one of the posts one of the voters. Yes, and added that I should be happy that someone on my text makes money, ""content with the glory.""  What else did I find out?  The fact that the blockchain itself is considered a decentralized system is beyond doubt. But I do not agree with the statements of some voters that the Voice is also decentralized, there is in itself and is not obliged to obey any rules, referring to the various mathematical and other codes, through which Bare works.  One thing is that it has a team of founders who have invested in the development of this platform, a group of programmers and developers, lawyers and other professionals who unobtrusively monitor the order on the site.  Another thing is that users have been given much more freedom of action than on other, more or less similar projects, nevertheless organizing such a structure as the Delegation, designed to also keep order on the site. The fact that some delegates often shirk from their duties, wrote a lot, but that's another question.  As much as some users would like to present a Voice free from any conventions and obligations, but it has a set of rules that we try to adhere to. Let everything go on its own, using the slogan "" Anarchy is the mother of order!""the project as a whole will not do any good to any of us individually. What is happening now on the Voice shows the harmfulness of this policy.  The amount of content and interesting, and useful is almost reduced to a minimum for one simple reason: rollback systems and boosters pulled over the main part of the pool, which stood out for the whole project. As a result, 5-7 people receive super profits, the rest - get a penny. When I tried to resent the rest of the Board, were issued: ""in the blockchain, baby! Here you can do everything, and casino games too!""  Just something I never found information that the blockchain system is allowed to open prohibited by law casinos.  Somehow it happened that I started with the concept of blockchain, and then moved to the Voice.

As the number of cryptocurrencies grows, cryptocurrency exchanges become the marketplaces for listing and trading cryptocurrencies.

As exchanges list multiple cryptocurrencies in one place, supply information about them, enable comparisons, and set bid/ask prices according to demand, they help separate the valuable cryptocurrencies from the useless ones. Investors become increasingly discriminate in their choices of cryptocurrencies as a store of value or as a utility token.

In the manifesto, please note that we did not mention all members of our team (both those in tech and on the marketing side) because we are running an exchange and we need to keep some members anonymous as failsafes. It's true that we could have mentioned their presence.  I respectfully disagree concerning your remarks about the team. The project here is building an exchange; not a blockchain. Our team is composed of exchange experts from both the crypto-sphere and the traditional financial world. To remove any doubts about our capabilities, the Blockchain.io platform is currently being developed as we speak. The Alpha is planned for June 2018 and the Beta for late July. Early investors will get access to Alpha & Beta.   the situation will shift soon. We are currently working with a French bank and are constrained by French banking regulation, which is one of the strictest in the world. The banking cartel is very strong and proactively undermines our business. Following our migration to a different banking partner, they have imposed uncompetitive funding limits (10K€/year), preventing any significant high-volume traders from boosting volume and fueling platform liquidity. We are currently working on an alternative banking solution in Europe, and we plan to add USD & JPY to our bitcoin exchange. We are confident that volume will be back on Paymium once this is settled.",False

It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double spending. Blockchains have been described as a value-exchange protocol.[21] This blockchain-based exchange of value can be completed quicker, safer and cheaper than with traditional systems.[33] A blockchain can assign title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.[34][35]",False

My honest comments on this project, thank you very much for reading And i will point out my most impressive point in this project: It is: Cryptocurrency Exchanges Enable Users to Navigate the Internet of Value  Cryptocurrency exchanges enable users to trade across multiple value networks powered by heterogeneous blockchains.  As the number of cryptocurrencies grows, cryptocurrency exchanges become the marketplaces for listing and trading cryptocurrencies. In the current context, users mainly buy cryptocurrencies as a store of value, in anticipation of a future value increase. As exchanges list multiple cryptocurrencies in one place, supply information about them, enable comparisons, and set bid/ask prices according to demand, they help separate the valuable cryptocurrencies from the useless ones. Investors become increasingly discriminate in their choices of cryptocurrencies as a store of value or as a utility token.  As technological and regulatory barriers to the Internet of value will be lifted, cryptocurrencies and decentralized value networks will gain mainstream acceptance. To trade on these different networks, users will need to buy multiple digital currencies and to exchange them as their needs evolve.  Blockchain.io will list a careful selection of cryptocurrencies: Proof-of-Work (POW) coins such as Bitcoin, Ether or Litecoin, Proof-of-Stake (POS) coins like Qtum or Stratis, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) coins, and other cryptographic protocols yet to be designed and minted.",False

Here are examples which make me to support this initiative:  - Security: the centralized component secures cold storage (98%+) and cryptographic proof of reserves. Internal procedures protect the platform from socially engineered attacks. - Decentralization: Decentralized settlement process embeds fair-exchange protocols allowing atomic swaps of cryptocurrencies to eliminate the counter-party inherent risks. - Transparency and compliance: Blockchain.io will comply with all current applicable EU regulations, ensuring that assets never get seized or frozen. - Infrastructure reliability: minimal downtime, resilience to high volume conditions and DDoS attacks - Currency Listing: there will be very robust currency listing application and selection process to ensure that vetting is in place and the exchange community can reliably trade and make informed decisions based on technical reviews and financial analyses. - ICO listings: it is another important advanatage that will allow to invest first hand in the primary markets. Blockchain.io will provide ICO campaign support and token listing services to assist entrepreneurs and technologists in the planning and execution of their fundraising campaigns. Following the ICO, the newly created tokens will be listed on the exchange to provide liquidity to investors and traders.",False

Blockchains have been described as a value-exchange protocol.[21] This blockchain-based exchange of value can be completed quicker, safer and cheaper than with traditional systems.[33] A blockchain can assign title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.[34][35]",False

In the coming Internet of value, decentralized blockchain-operated value networks will become mainstream and compliant, enabling billions of Internet users to exchange value as quickly and as easily as they exchange information today.  Multiple cryptocurrencies will co-exist. Each cryptocurrency will serve the needs of a community of users to securely trade any type of assets, rights, goods, or services thatis of value to them in a decentralized value network, i.e. without supervision by a central authority.  As a cryptocurrency exchange, Blockchain.io will play a major role in the Internet of Value’s ecosystem. It will be the marketplace where cryptocurrencies will be traded against each other, a gateway to and a bridge across the multiple value networks powered by different blockchains/cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).  Blockchain.io will combine the efficiency of a low-latency full-featured centralized exchange with decentralized “trustless” cross-chain settlement. The project leverages the latest developments in cross-chain atomic swaps, cryptographic protocols, and payment networks such as Lightning and Raiden. These developments will overcome the scalability issues of decentralized blockchains, allow transactions across heterogenous blockchains, increase the speed and lower the cost of these transactions, making them ready for mass adoption.  Blockchain.io is driven by the highly experienced team of cryptocurrency experts who, seven years ago, founded Paymium, a fiat/bitcoin exchange catering to the underserved Euro market. Blockchain.io shares Paymium’s highest security, reliability, and accountability standards. It strives to overcome the shortcomings of rival crypto exchanges that have repeatedly caused severe losses for issuers and token holders. To achieve this, the team relies on its advanced knowledge of cryptographic technology, its operational in-depth understanding of the crypto world, and a strong company culture committed to security and compliance.",False

Here is description: Blockchain.io aims to become the most reliable crypto-assets marketplace in Europe, where crypto-currencies and tokens will be traded securely among institutional and individual investors. BCIO tokens will be available for trading in October 2018, which will mark the end of our ICO. Blockchain is centralized order-book with decentralized settlement, which is encourage trade while ensuring trust. A centralized exchange with a decentralized settlement will do just that. According to Pierre Tavernier, the Blockchain.io platform will combine a centralized custodial exchange with a decentralized “trustless” cross-chain “fair exchange” settlement. The centralized exchange will be low-latency and full-featured, with custody services, centralized order booking and efficient order matching. Blockchain has three characteristics: Fully compliant and transparent; Ultra-secure and non-custodial; and Reliable infrastructure. These items would protect your assets and mitigate your risk at least. According to Blockchain, there are liquidity services as follows: + Built on Paymium’s proven security and technological record. A high level of digital asset protection and safe record of transactions. + Built on fair-exchange protocols enabling cryptocurrency atomic swaps to mitigate counter-part risk. + Advisory and technology services to execute third-party ICOs. New listing and market making services to foster enhanced token liquidity. In addition, Blockchain has a team of talented and professional people: Pierre Noizat (CEO), Dominique Rodrigues (CTO), Pierre Tavernier (CMO), Laetitia Zito (CFO) and other outperformed staffs. All of them are specialists in their field and have a great deal of experience. They devoted their time and efforts to build Blockchain. Therefore, it will help Blockchain develop and advance in the cryptocurrency world. In conclusion, I think that this is a huge potential and good project! I hope the project will develop in the future and will go to the moon. Good luck to your team. I will support the project until the end. I hope you can share your results as soon as possible.",False

Multiple cryptocurrencies will co-exist. Each cryptocurrency will serve the needs of a community of users to securely trade any type of assets, rights, goods, or services that is of value to them in a decentralized value network, i.e. without supervision by a central authority. As a cryptocurrency exchange, Blockchain.io will play a major role in the Internet of Value’s ecosystem. It will be the marketplace where cryptocurrencies will be traded against each other, a gateway to and a bridge across the multiple value networks powered by different blockchains/cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). Blockchain.io will combine the efficiency of a low-latency full-featured centralized exchange with decentralized “trustless” cross-chain settlement. The project leverages the latest developments in cross-chain atomic swaps, cryptographic protocols, and payment networks such as Lightning and Raiden. These developments will overcome the scalability issues of decentralized blockchains, allow transactions across heterogenous blockchains, increase the speed and lower the cost of these transactions, making them ready for mass adoption. Blockchain.io is driven by the highly experienced team of cryptocurrency experts who, seven years ago, founded Paymium, a fiat/bitcoin exchange catering to the underserved Euro market. Blockchain.io shares Paymium’s highest security, reliability, and accountability standards. It strives to overcome the shortcomings of rival crypto exchanges that have repeatedly caused severe losses for issuers and token holders. To achieve this, the team relies on its advanced knowledge of cryptographic technology, its operational in-depth understanding of the crypto world, and a strong company culture committed to security and compliance.",False

As banks and big financial institutions were criticized for being reckless with people’s assets, Satoshi came up with a decentralized solution for currency exchange. The blockchain relies on a peer-to-peer technology and does not involve a third party as an intermediate to transfer value. The system is completely separate from the bank and relies only on the Internet. Decentralization is one of the main reasons bitcoin is so popular.  Yet, nowadays, a majority of cryptoasset trading platforms are centralized, which might seem to negate the purpose of a decentralized form of money. Let’s take a quick look at how centralized and decentralized exchanges work and their respective benefits.  Bitcoins and digital tokens are like better, smarter cash. They are programmable money. Immediately liquid, indefinitely divisible, and instantly transferable, they can be programmed to meet the needs of particular assets, rights, goods, or services or of specific communities.

It must be said that crypto-currencies are a very new type of Financial instrument that can be sometime misleading for new investors.

Much obliged to you for this exceptionally fascinating post and your energizing undertaking.  It must be said that cryptographic forms of money are another kind of Financial instrument that can be at some point misdirecting for new speculators. I trust that the genuine inquiry, with respect to any interest in a Financial item, is ""what is the hidden resource made for"" or ""what is the real offer of this organization"". On account of Blockchain.io, we have a genuine vision, a solid pioneer (entrenched in the crypto-world) and also a genuine group of experts, and the Financial quality to help such an undertaking. Blockhain.io offers new types of monetary liquidity to organizations that need to fund-raise for their startup venture. Toward the day's end, we are discussing genuine esteem creation (as new businesses make items, administrations and employments). This is the most essential factor that influence me to trust that this organization is totally feasible, contrasted with different organizations that may offer, at a first look a comparative incentive, yet are truth be told, just in light of hypothesis (as no genuine administration or items are connected to it).

I could have his good and bad but in over all I think that Decentralized Exchanges are the future of trading. To do a peer to peer exchange with no intermediary. DEXs are still in their very infancy. They are not as user-friendly as regular exchanges. They do not offer as many functionalities, nor do they offer the same liquidity. But they do offer a level of security and transparency without comparison .   People that now are invested in that are the ones that are going to have the expertise to solve and optimize the system for real-life usage when to time is right for Decentralized Exchanges to emerge victorious and it would be great to be part of one of them from the beginning.  I believe that Blockchain.io can potentially be one of the top exchanges out there. No only because of the Decentralized Exchanges system but because its actually designed to be and ecosystem that allows the user to manage cryptocurrency for a real life usage.  And like they say: The Blockchain.io platform will combine a centralized custodial exchange with a decentralized “trustless” cross-chain “fair exchange” settlement. The centralized exchange will be low-latency and full-featured, with custody services, centralized order booking and efficient order matching.  We cannot ask for more right now.",False

We are happy to hear that you find our advisory board impressive. Regarding our team, we only displayed C-Level team members on this thread. In the manifesto, please note that we did not mention all members of our team (both those in tech and on the marketing side) because we are running an exchange and we need to keep some members anonymous as failsafes. It's true that we could have mentioned their presence.  I respectfully disagree concerning your remarks about the team. The project here is building an exchange; not a blockchain. Our team is composed of exchange experts from both the crypto-sphere and the traditional financial world. To remove any doubts about our capabilities, the Blockchain.io platform is currently being developed as we speak. The Alpha is planned for June 2018 and the Beta for late July. Early investors will get access to Alpha & Beta.  Concerning volume, the situation will shift soon. We are currently working with a French bank and are constrained by French banking regulation, which is one of the strictest in the world. The banking cartel is very strong and proactively undermines our business. Following our migration to a different banking partner, they have imposed uncompetitive funding limits (10K€/year), preventing any significant high-volume traders from boosting volume and fueling platform liquidity. We are currently working on an alternative banking solution in Europe, and we plan to add USD & JPY to our bitcoin exchange. We are confident that volume will be back on Paymium once this is settled.  On the profitability side, please note that we have been operating a bitcoin exchange since 2011, thus we have significant reserves. The two previous years have been good regarding volume. The last few months have been tough, but we still largely benefited from the price rally of 2016 and especially that of last year. When considering hacking, this is one of our main concerns. 24H volume has little bearing on the funds held on our platform. With around 200,000 users, hackers will certainly try something, but we have developed very high security standards (more than 98% of cold storage), keeping our customers' funds safe.  Concerning the Blockchain.io exchange, our main exclusive feature is decentralized settlement. Blockchain.io will offer the possibility to settle trades without giving the custody of coins, which erases the last potential point-of-failure. Order Books will remain centralized, guaranteeing high-performance matching and liquid markets. Of course, this feature will be optional, as it could not fit some user profiles, such as market-makers (who prefer velocity over high security). Moreover, Blockchain.io will also offer basic & advanced trade orders from the start. In the long run, we plan to implement margin trading and peer-to-peer lending. Please check out our roadmap at this end of the thread.  Last, but not least, Blockchain.io will have a strong focus on institutions. We believe that ICOs will become the main way to raise funds, and that large companies will approach us to launch their respective tokens for new product launches. Our team is highly experienced and has strong connections in the traditional financial world, therefore, we are aiming to become the primary interlocutor for such companies. Blockchain.io will offer its expertise and knowledge to provide complete ICO services, from planning and execution to token listing on our platform.  Please feel free to ask further questions if you have any. In all, development is ongoing, but coming along very well.  Thank you very much. The Blockchain.io Team",False

Thank you for this very interesting post and your exciting project. It must be said that crypto-currencies are a very new type of Financial instrument that can be sometime misleading for new investors.

Blockhain.io offers new forms of financial liquidity to companies that want to raise money for their startup project. At the end of the day, we are talking about real value creation (as new startup companies create products, services and jobs). This is the most important factor that make me believe that this company is completely viable, compared to other companies that may offer, at a first glance a similar value proposition, but are in fact, only based on speculation (as no actual service or products are linked to it).

It must be said that crypto-currencies are a very new type of Financial instrument that can be sometime misleading for new investors. I believe that the real question, as for any investment in a Financial product, is ""what is the underlying asset made for"" or ""what is the actual value proposition of this company"". In the case of Blockchain.io, we have a real vision, a strong leader (well established in the crypto-world) as well as a real team of professionals, and the Financial strength to support such a project. Blockhain.io offers new forms of financial liquidity to companies that want to raise money for their startup project. At the end of the day, we are talking about real value creation (as new startup companies create products, services and jobs). This is the most important factor that make me believe that this company is completely viable, compared to other companies that may offer, at a first glance a similar value proposition, but are in fact, only based on speculation (as no actual service or products are linked to it). In the next future, I believe that a significant part of these cryptocurrencies (that are created every day at an unimaginable speed), will disappear due to this lack of real utility, which is not the case of Blockchain.io. I believe that Blockchain.io has a great future and I will certainly keep an eye on it for quite some time. Good luck guys  ! hope on you",False

Blockchain.io, Your Gateway To The Internet Of Value TELEGRAM|TWITTER|REDDIT|FACEBOOK|MEDIUM|LINKEDIN|YOUTUBE   Cryptocurrencies Power the Internet of Value  In Blockchain.io’s vision the Internet of Value is the next level of evolution of the Internet. The internet of value enables users to securely trade assets, rights, goods and services, globally and around the clock, without the involvement of a centralized authority, or traditional financial intermediaries, or so called ‘trusted’ third-parties.  The Internet of value is built on multiple decentralized, automated, transparent, and secure blockchain-based value networks. Different networks operate different versions of the blockchain, which in turn are fueled by different cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, or Litecoin. Each network meets the needs of certain types of transactions, such as high-value payments or title registry, or the needs of specific trading communities, such as a network of autonomous objects or an industry sector.  Blockchain.io as the leading exchange in the Internet of Value will enable users to trade across all these value networks.  Cryptocurrency Exchanges Enable Users to Navigate the Internet of Value  Cryptocurrency exchanges enable users to trade across multiple value networks powered by heterogeneous blockchains.  As the number of cryptocurrencies grows, cryptocurrency exchanges become the marketplaces for listing and trading cryptocurrencies. In the current context, users mainly buy cryptocurrencies as a store of value, in anticipation of a future value increase. As exchanges list multiple cryptocurrencies in one place, supply information about them, enable comparisons, and set bid/ask prices according to demand, they help separate the valuable cryptocurrencies from the useless ones. Investors become increasingly discriminate in their choices of cryptocurrencies as a store of value or as a utility token.  As technological and regulatory barriers to the Internet of value will be lifted, cryptocurrencies and decentralized value networks will gain mainstream acceptance. To trade on these different networks, users will need to buy multiple digital currencies and to exchange them as their needs evolve.  Blockchain.io will list a careful selection of cryptocurrencies: Proof-of-Work (POW) coins such as Bitcoin, Ether or Litecoin, Proof-of-Stake (POS) coins like Qtum or Stratis, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) coins, and other cryptographic protocols yet to be designed and minted.  Essential Features  Ultra-Secure & Decentralized  The centralized part of the exchange offers highly secure custody services with cold storage and cryptographic proof of reserve. Cryptocurrencies are held in cold storage (offline) for at least 98% of reserves. A cold wallet access requires multiple signatures. A cold wallet private key is split and held in a number of different vaults in multiple locations. Other in-house security processes and technological features. Internal procedures protect the exchange from social engineering attacks. Periodic technical audits and timestamped logs allow detection of any tampering attempts in the accounting database. Periodic financial audits verify that the inventory of coins (assets side) matches the records of liabilities with cryptographic proof. If the exchange’s customer balances are checked against a blockchain inventory of coins (utxos in Bitcoin language) every block interval, there is little or no room for a rogue intruder to alter database records with profit. Decentralized settlement relies on fair-exchange protocols allowing atomic swaps of cryptocurrencies to eliminate the counter-party risk inherent to a custodial exchange.  Fully Compliant & Transparent  Exhaustive accounting records are audited by independent professional auditors to ensure the integrity of the trading platform. The exchange aims to comply with all current applicable EU regulations, ensuring that assets never get seized or frozen. Customer balances on the liability side must match exactly the inventory of coins held by the exchange. Blockchain.io aims to perform such balance check and to publish its cryptographic proof at every block interval.   Reliable Infrastructure  Minimal downtime, typically restricted to server maintenance, application upgrades, or database migration. Resilience under high volume, heavy traffic conditions, or DDoS attacks. No technical debt: exchanges that quickly add new altcoins or new features without proper testing or careful software design accumulate technical debt by taking shortcuts. Technical debt translates into applications that are harder to maintain and prone to bugs and security holes. Blockchain.io will attract high volume traders with specific features such as a FIX API and a borrowing facility, but also with the high level of availability of the trading platform. Processing capacity in the first phase will be of up to 2 million orders per day.   Select Digital Currencies  Cryptocurrencies will be listed on the trading platform following a strict vetting process (sustainability, technical, and deep protocol review) by our team of blockchain experts. Regular updates and publications will inform platform stakeholders and the community through altcoin technical reviews and financial analyses.  ICO Execution & Token Listing  Blockchain.io will provide ICO campaign support and token listing services to assist entrepreneurs and technologists in the planning and execution of their fundraising campaigns. Following the ICO campaigns, Blockchain.io will ensure that newly created tokens are listed on Blockchain.io to provide liquidity to investors and traders. In addition, Blockchain.io will create Token liquidity through: Market making using Blockchain.io’s inventory Incentive program for Paymium users.    Blockchain.io is driven by the highly experienced team of cryptocurrency experts who, seven years ago, founded Paymium, a fiat/bitcoin exchange catering to the underserved Euro market. Blockchain.io shares Paymium’s highest security, reliability, and accountability standards. It strives to overcome the shortcomings of rival crypto exchanges that have repeatedly caused severe losses for issuers and token holders. To achieve this, the team relies on its advanced knowledge of cryptographic technology, its operational in-depth understanding of the crypto world, and a strong company culture committed to security and compliance.  Paymium, the company behind Blockchain.io  Relationship between the two platforms  Together with Paymium, Blockchain.io aims to become the leading cryptographic exchange in Europe by 2020.

We are happy to hear that you find our advisory board impressive. Regarding our team, we only displayed C-Level team members on this thread. In the manifesto, please note that we did not mention all members of our team (both those in tech and on the marketing side) because we are running an exchange and we need to keep some members anonymous as failsafes. It's true that we could have mentioned their presence.  I respectfully disagree concerning your remarks about the team. The project here is building an exchange; not a blockchain. Our team is composed of exchange experts from both the crypto-sphere and the traditional financial world. To remove any doubts about our capabilities, the Blockchain.io platform is currently being developed as we speak. The Alpha is planned for June 2018 and the Beta for late July. Early investors will get access to Alpha & Beta.  Concerning volume, the situation will shift soon. We are currently working with a French bank and are constrained by French banking regulation, which is one of the strictest in the world. The banking cartel is very strong and proactively undermines our business. Following our migration to a different banking partner, they have imposed uncompetitive funding limits (10K€/year), preventing any significant high-volume traders from boosting volume and fueling platform liquidity. We are currently working on an alternative banking solution in Europe, and we plan to add USD & JPY to our bitcoin exchange. We are confident that volume will be back on Paymium once this is settled.  On the profitability side, please note that we have been operating a bitcoin exchange since 2011, thus we have significant reserves. The two previous years have been good regarding volume. The last few months have been tough, but we still largely benefited from the price rally of 2016 and especially that of last year. When considering hacking, this is one of our main concerns. 24H volume has little bearing on the funds held on our platform. With around 200,000 users, hackers will certainly try something, but we have developed very high security standards (more than 98% of cold storage), keeping our customers' funds safe.  Concerning the Blockchain.io exchange, our main exclusive feature is decentralized settlement. Blockchain.io will offer the possibility to settle trades without giving the custody of coins, which erases the last potential point-of-failure. Order Books will remain centralized, guaranteeing high-performance matching and liquid markets. Of course, this feature will be optional, as it could not fit some user profiles, such as market-makers (who prefer velocity over high security). Moreover, Blockchain.io will also offer basic & advanced trade orders from the start. In the long run, we plan to implement margin trading and peer-to-peer lending. Please check out our roadmap at this end of the thread.  Last, but not least, Blockchain.io will have a strong focus on institutions. We believe that ICOs will become the main way to raise funds, and that large companies will approach us to launch their respective tokens for new product launches. Our team is highly experienced and has strong connections in the traditional financial world, therefore, we are aiming to become the primary interlocutor for such companies. Blockchain.io will offer its expertise and knowledge to provide complete ICO services, from planning and execution to token listing on our platform.  Please feel free to ask further questions if you have any. In all, development is ongoing, but coming along very well.  Thank you very much. The Blockchain.io Team",False

As for the platform's Blockchain.io, the concept looks sound. For example, they seem to recognize that institutional traders and investors intend to give the market a huge boost in the future. And they also recognize that the primary application of blockchain technology requires it to comply with government regulations, registration, and laws. Other factors that you should take into account are a successful blockchain project - security, reliability and trust. Based on the fact that all of the centralized crypto currency exchange subjected to hacking, platform Blockchain.io allows you to eliminate this fact, while leaving some easy centralized kryptomere. Overall a great project with great potential for the future.",False

More than people think today. Very often I must think on some star trek movies I saw when I was a teenager. The world becoming one big oranism, connected with an Internet which is really like a brain, It‘s so fantastic to see everyday new projccts popping up, trying to re-invent everything we know. In my homecountry, Germany, the society refuses to develop, people want to go back to the ""golden 1930's"", vote for Nazis, love diesel machines, gear weels and machine oil, so I'm quite happy to see the crypto revolution in other parts of the world taking over every single part of the digital world, So I wish this project and all other projects. Foming these days the best luck… And of course I hope, that in the current dip at all crypto currencies, as the big instutions are about to take over the market, neither blockchain.io nor other projects will get affected too much, as I know lots of money could get burned now, bevor a big jump will happen in September this year or later.
