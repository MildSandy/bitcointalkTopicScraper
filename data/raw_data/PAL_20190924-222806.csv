Pally ICO Referral Program  Weâ€™ve structured this to reward members of our community for spreading the word on our ICO, as well as to overcome the slow start to the crowdsale due to the technical difficulties experienced on Sunday.  The program is as follows:  You will get 10% extra PAL when you refer somebody who successfully contributes to the ICO. For example, if you bring somebody in who purchases 100 PAL, you would earn 10 PAL.  The way to prove that you have played a part in the contribution, is to send the wallet address which the contribution will be made to ico@pallyapp.co along with your own wallet that you would like the 10% bonus to be deposited to. This needs to be done before the transfer of your referral is made to Pallyâ€™s contract address.   5M PAL has been allocated towards the referral program, which will be taken out of the Development Team allocation.  â€”----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  An example email that should be sent to ico@pallyapp.co before the referral contribution would look like:  Contributor address: 0xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  My referral address that I would like 10% of the contribution received from the above address deposited to: 0yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy",False

Reviews are a critical element of maintaining the quality of hosts and experiences within our community, so our process will ensure reviews which are fair and unbiased.  All reviews would not require approval before they are posted, to ensure they're a fair representation of people's thoughts. The only exceptional cases of reviews requiring further checks would be those reviews that contain certain 'red flag words' which make serious or libellous allegations. These will require immediate escalation to, and attention from the operations team.  Our Dispute Resolution is also driven through reviews, where over 50% of people who attend an experience are required to corroborate whether an experience was misrepresented by a host, for a refund to be triggered and for a host to be reprimanded.

C) Our HARD cap is $4.55M. Our soft cap is 15% of that amount.  D) We are proud of our advisory board and delighted to have such rigorous experience across several big industries contributing to the company  Please let us know if you have any further questions of course",False

Congratulations for having a famous team behind you and 18+ months of experience, I had hoped they would have brought something like that to the table but could not find anything like it in the whitepaper and position paper.

And one of this is Airbnb. So, how do you think you are going to get customers? Why nobody is asking this and everybody just throw money in the ICOs? Everybody in the travel sector knows that the problem for travel website and apps is to get customers. And, do not tell me that you charge a low (or none) commission fee to list and book activities with locals because nobody cares if nobody know your website. And then, as marketplace, you have to scale also the supply (people listing the activities)! Good luck to challenge Airbnb!  I do not get why if you are a normal startup, you have to prove that you have product, users, traction, etc. to approach funding and, instead, with a token, nobody care about the outcome of the company. I understand that is more gambling and trading (in fact nobody almost care anymore what is the product but just what is the price at the pre-ico and ico, what is the total supply and when it will be listed at exchanges), but it is important to understand that you are fueling a bubble instead of fueling real startups. Why do not throwing money in equity crowdfunding?  So just as information, here is a list of only some website providing the same service since years!

To address some of your points:  1. We have existed for 18 months and have gone through a private seed round (in which product, users, traction etc were of course addressed in order to find investors). Secondly, we are not challenging Airbnb's core product (which is renting out accommodation and which, yes, has been around for years) but their Airbnb Experiences branch. This has not been around for years, more precisely, under a year (i.e. after we had started working on our idea). We differ from Airbnb Experiences in that we primarily target 18-30 year old users who are budget travellers, currently studying, on a gap-year or fresh out of school and into the real world. We therefore strive to create significantly cheaper experiences than the average cost of Airbnb's experiences (yes, it is possible to find affordable experiences, but they don't constitute the main-bulk of their curated selection.  2. We of course are aware that there are competitors out there but don't necessarily agree with your point that 'just because there are other companies in the travel space. you shouldn't create a new company' which essentially is what you are implying. If nobody challenged the current status quo, nothing would ever change or develop.  3. Finally, to your point of people pitching in money 'just because there is a cryptocurrency involved': This again is a point we definitely agree with and we don't necessarily agree that a company that is pre-product and has a very small team will need 100s of millions of dollars to get started on their project. However that is not a correct assessment of Pally. In light of you now knowing that we have previously raised money in the private market, have existed for well over a year, have taken products to market and are aiming to raise just below 5 million USD (again, VERY similar to what we'd be looking for in a Series A private fundraising round) rather than 50 or 500 million USD we hope you can see the logic behind our target amount. Not every company in this space is unjustifiably raising unnecessarily large amounts of capital, some of us are using it because it actually makes a lot of sense from a product perspective and because blockchain technology is one of the amazing technologies of tomorrow.  We hope we, with the above answer, somewhat have addressed some of your questions and concerns and of course welcome a good debate such as this. So thanks for your question and have a good day.",False

Does it matter how long a company existed? I know that Airbnb experiences launched just one year ago, but still they are a huge DIRECT competitor for you. And, most of the other websites that I listed have been around for at least 4 years. And, they are not keeping the price high because they want, but just because experiences are time consuming for the providers and time is money. Plus, the website needs to take commissions because it cannot sell ""tokens"" to get money but it needs a sustainable business model.  2. Of course you can create a company. But in this case it is crystal clear that you are not innovating anything. You are adding the blockchain to the product just to sell tokens, because you were not able to raise funds in a conventional way.  3. You are claiming that you have product and traction. So, where are the product and traction that you claim? A website or app with a marketplace costs barely nothing..there a are white label and even open source software. And, adding blockchain with ETH costs even less. So your product without users has zero value. Therefore, where are your users? Where is the traction? Where is your business model, where are your sales and number of active users? Why if you want to raise money in conventional way (giving away equity) you have to prove that you have all of them and instead, in this case, you can just claim something? Then, you claimed that you have already raised money in private market...where are the documents?  Too many people are throwing money without any proof of anything.  PS. You claim that you have been around for 18 months. I see from SimilarWeb that your website is online only from May. So, where were you? Another name? Do you have press release? Do you have some facts to sustain what you are claiming?",False

Another point to your list of competitors is that almost half of your list of competitors are exclusively food-experience apps. You forgot to mention projects such as Backpackr, Tripr, Partywithalocal, CoolCousin and a few others who are also present in the space... Challenging the supply has proved to be a fairly easy hurdle giving that people are receptive to receiving the more than 20% commission fee taken by Airbnb themselves... Furthermore, these other companies and Pally can easily live in peaceful holistic co-existence since we do not recruit hosts to work for us full-time. If they would like to be listed across multiple experience sharing sites, we will not oppose that. The above comment coupled with anecdotal conversations with hosts who have been dealing with some of the other websites and who have had very poor experiences liaising with these companies likewise paves the way for Pally.  2: We just mentioned that we have been through a private fundraising round, yet you still claim that the reason behind adding blockchain technology to our product is because we aren't able to raise funds in a 'conventional' way. VC funding is a relatively new phenomena in itself and if you are so bound by 'conventionalism' that you can't see the advantages of opening up crowdfunding to the masses then there isn't much we can do to change that perception. Additionally, a wealth of VCs are currently exploring [Suspicious link removed]panies and are getting involved. Alternatively, you can read the piece our founder put up a while back which also spells out some of the broader advantages to blockchain crowdfunding as opposed to 'conventional funding'. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/blockchain-n-roll-oliver-f-andersen. Quote ""Private fundraising at large falls prey to capitalistic short-termism, seeking immediate return on investment (ROI) as opposed to having an in-depth look at the company roadmap and to have the companyâ€™s long term interest in mind - two key factors leading to sustainable growth. This in turn lead companies to spend several months (and sometimes years) at distraction from what really matters; the product and the end-user experience"" Taken directly from the article.  3: Going from an idea to a fully fledged concept, to recruitment of a team, to capital raising, to marketing to operational set up, to technical development, to information architecture to legal set-up is not as easy as spelling it out and there is a world more to it than what you are making it out to be.  In your opinion, this may be 'easy' to do, however, most other companies in our network and most business biographies would argue that taking products to market and developing a brand is both extremely challenging and quite costly.    It seems an unnecessarily bearish view towards the new paradigm of blockchain technology from your perspective and it would seem that you somehow have taken a personal offence by our concept which we of course regret to be the case. We'd be interested to hear your thoughts on a bunch of other projects such as Storj (decentralised storage, competing with cloud storage as we know it), Swarm City (marketplace competing with Amazon), Ahoolee (search engine competing with....Google), LaZooz (ride-sharing competing with Uber) or even Bitcoin and Litecoin (currencies that are challenging the fiat world) who all seem to be in ""Direct"" competition with a conglomerate-like centralised counterpart.  You are correct that 'Pally' only has been around since earlier this year... our name prior to Pally was PenPal. If you follow this link you will find a whois picture which states that the domain has been active since March 2016 https://i.imgur.com/g6OsVdb.png. It seems that you'd like us to share every statistic, incorporation document and private correspondences with investors we have had with you.. we will be happy to share these with you when we prepare for our Initial Public Offering (IPO) sometime in the distant future...    Good Labor Day weekend to you @realuser.  ",False

However, i find it extremely funny that princa and dexter42 are copying a post that I made on several of their scam threads to accuse someone else of scam. the original post clearly states that princa and dexter42 are well-known scammers. So my guess is they trying to utilize my post to either soften their stance on the thread or something else nefarious that am yet to figure out, but i do plan on figuring out really quick.

By the way, the originial text  was directed to both princa and dexter42 states   It's the same accounts shilling this coin, evolution lab, padideo coin and securivitas, and bitcoinash. Anyway, I impulsively bought padideo and yet to receive any coins. when I threatened to expose padideo and all affiliated accounts as a scam, they locked and close all the aforementioned threads in a day.

At this point there is no PallyCoin specific wallet but since it is an ERC20 token, we recommend keeping it in a MyEtherWallet or Mist wallet.

They include companies that we have been in ongoing discussions with in regard to marketing, PR and operations around our ICO, such as Kraken for example.
