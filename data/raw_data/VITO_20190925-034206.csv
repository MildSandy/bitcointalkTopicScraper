Coming up is Public Token Sale.    We thank everyone who has supported the VISO project and is staying with us! The Private Token Sale is going full blast and has captured the undivided attention of investors the world over. For our part, we’re getting ready to launch the Public Token Sale, which will be open to all.  Be reminded that the Public Token Sale is starting pretty soon—November 25. Anyone will be able to invest, but those buying over $500 of tokens during the first month will qualify for some hearty bonuses:      Day 1—25% Week 1—20% Week 2—15% Week 3—10% Week 4—5%  What’s more, the Public Token Sale will take place along with a Bounty campaign: Bitcointalk signature campaign: 40% of total reward; Referral campaign: 40% of total reward; For outstanding support: 20% of total reward.  Our experience shows that VISO has drawn interest from users and has a great future ahead of it. We have every reason to expect Token Sale to succeed as we look forward. We have set for ourselves three levels of goals, depending on how much money VISO can raise from the Token sale. The amount of funds raised will determine the types of technologies to be launched.",False

Cryptocurrencies are changing the world, eliminating boundaries for payments between countries. VISO creates an open ecosystem for payments, which is transparent and connected to such traditional means of payment as bank cards. With VISO, cryptocurrency services will become daily payments for an entire country for the first time.   VISO’s technology know- how:  - For buyers. Connect the cryptocurrency to the VISO wallet and obtain contactless payments from your smartphone at any place that accepts VISA PayWave or MasterCard PayPass within a mere 5 minutes.  - For sellers. POS-infrastructure of SMART-terminals 3 in 1: a banking terminal, a cash desk and a payment terminal, with online reports of all purchases, on any device. Additionally, an online shop can be set up within only an hour.  - For investors. A unique mechanism for investment return from token purchases, which is built on the increase in its turnover in the secondary market.  What problem does VISO solve?  The speed, at which cryptocurrencies have penetrated regular payments, has until today been too slow. The transaction time for cryptocurrencies is not large, yet the ease of their use leaves much to be desired. VISO solves this problem through a special wallet technology and through physical presence of payment terminals at sales locations.  How does VISO work? VISO is a full cycle payment system, which combines in itself the entire collection of technologies for receiving payments at sales locations, invoices and purchases in traditional currencies, through bank cards and in cryptocurrency. Key elements of the VISO ecosystem will be:  - A network of SMART banking terminals combined with cash desks, which allow you to complete purchases in cash, using regular bank cards and cryptocurrencies  - VISO Card bank cards, which allow you to make payments from the VISO wallet in fiat money as well as cryptocurrencies.  - VISO Wallet, with combines traditional payment methods and the VITO cryptocurrency.  - VISO Exchange for cryptocurrencies, where you will be able to exchange the VITO cryptocurrency for another cryptocurrenty or fiat money.  The VISO system incorporates traditional payment technologies with bank cards and new payment technologies based on cryptocurrencies. The combination of traditional payment methods as well as cryptocurrencies leads to a substantial decrease on costs for participants and a more transparent way of payments. The system permits payments at sales locations as well as online.  VISO Token(VITO)  The VITO tokens are the internal cryptocurrency of the VISO payment system. VITO are created on the Waves platform. The token value is created through its turnover within the payment system. The turnover of VITO is supported by the operation of the VISO payment system. VITO tokens do not give any right to the company's profits, and can VITO holders can only expect a return from a resale of tokens or their exchange to other cryptocurrencies.  Limited token amount: 1.000.000.000 (1 billion VITO tokens)  Initial rate: 0,1 USD for 1 VITO token  Token distribution:  - 80% of the tokens for VITO buyers  - 18% for founders and advisers  - 2% for the bounty company (during Token sale)  Sales of VITO tokens  The profitability of the VISO business model depends on the number of technologies launched. Some of the technologies are too costly to launch prior to collecting enough funds from the Token sale. We have 3 levels of goals according to how much revenue VISO generate through the Token sale. Depending on the amount of funds generated, different technologies will be launched.     If less than 3.000.000 USD (3 million) is collected during the Token sale, the entire amount shall be refunded. Maximum value to be collected: USD 25mn This amount will be sufficient to launch a full-scale business and purchase enough SMART terminals to replace half of Georgia’s cashier equipment market.  Token sale occurs in two phases: Private Token Sale and Open Token Sale. Private Token Sale is intended for wholesale token buyers and is planned to run from 12:00 UTC, Nov 1, 2017, to 12:00 UTC, Nov 25, 2017. Private Token Sale envisages a 35% bonus for buyers who spend more than USD 5,000 in total purchases.   VISO Wallet  The VISO wallet serves as an intermediary payment method, which allows to fix a conversion rate of the cryptocurrency at the time of the sale/purchase at the sales location or at the client's wishes, and to complete payments between members of the system. The VISO wallet gives access to the cryptocurrency exchange.  Anyone with an internet connection can create a VISO wallet. Once created, you can convert other cryptocurrencies into the balance of the VISO wallet, namely BitCoin, Etherium, Waves and other. The wallet balance can be denominated in VITO, USD, Euro and Georgian Lari.  VISO Cards  All VISO cards are linked to the VISO Wallet. The balance can be in Georgian Lari, USD, Euro and VITO. Any VISO card user can set up his preferred currency. VISO cards support the SMART-Balance technology, which permits the automatic conversion of funds from the card or bank account into cryptocurrency and vice versa through a link to the VISO Wallet. You will not have to sell/purchase the cryptocurrency manually, once you have this option enabled. The conversion rules can be set up by the user himself.  The company will issue 4 types of cards:  - VISO Card Light. Plastic card with a balance and turnover within the limits of Anti-Money-Laundering legislation. Supports contactless payments.  - VISO Card Pro. Plastic card linked to a identified account in a Georgian bank without limits on operations.  - VISO Card Virtual. Virtual bank card with limits established by the client.  - VISO Card HCE. Card operating on Host Card Emulation technology, which permits contactless payments from any smartphone supporting NFC technology.     The VISO cards will be distributed across the entire globe. Anyone wishing to do so will be able to order the card via post. The VISO cards will be issued according to regulations of worldwide payment systems of VISA and MasterCard and are accepted across the world.  VISO Exchange  The cryptocurrency exchange is intergrated with the VISO Wallet and permits sale/purchase operations of the VITO cryptocurrency and exchange it into fiat money with a transfer to bank accounts in a Georgian bank, as well as into other cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrency rate changes automatically according to the current currency rate – the dynamics of sales and purchases of VITO in relation to all currencies.  The VITO cryptocurrency can also be traded on external exchanges, which are not linked to the VISO ecosystem. VISO owners can buy and sell the cryptocurrency to other users, establishing the exchange rate themselves.   VISO Terminals    VISO SMART-terminals represent a new generation of banking terminals. They combine all functions of standard banking terminals, cashiers and also enable the launch of any mobile applications on the Google Android operation system. Every VISO SMART-terminal can be integrated with the accounting system of any entreprise, making it a full-fledged cashier system, where the entire list of purchases is documented. Collecting all devices into one enables a minimisation of costs of any enterprise, but is especially important for small businesses. SMART-terminals are certified by VISA and MasterCard. Security is compliant with security requirements of the PCI DSS 3 standard.   Advisers    Igor Khmel LinkedIn  BankEx founder.

Georgia today: Association Agreement with the EU; American law; Constitutionally fixed taxation; Security; Well- developed payment infrastructure; No limitations on cryptocurrency payments by the central bank; Well-developed payments system.
