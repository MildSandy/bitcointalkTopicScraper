It could be done by a free rechargeable reserve of EtherInc, enabling 2 or 3 transactions a day. If users want to send more often, they would have to purchase some EtherInc.  The idea is that influencers could easily distribute tokens to their fans. Fans would just load the browser add-on or the mobile app, and they would easily receive and transfer tokens, without buying EtherInc except if they use the app more than 2 or 3 times a day.  Will it be possible to do such things on EtherInc in the near future ?  Thanks",False

Malik is an alum of global corporations including PwC and SwissRe as well as pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson and biotech firm Biogen. His experience at multinational corporations across industries should serve him well in eInc’s goal to create global decentralized companies on the blockchain. eInc’s advisory panel of eight includes Tyler Sanford, who has lent his expertise to some eight ICOs that combined have raised more than $130 million. Sanford also has experience with high-profile tech startups including Yelp and Zenefits. Oh and he is a former Major League Baseball player in the United States, having played for the Los Angeles Angels. Nikolay Shkileve is also on the advisory panel. Shkileve appears to be highly selective about the ICO projects he accepts as co-founder of Top ICO Advisors. According to his LinkedIn profile, he advises on other blockchain projects including South Korea-based clean energy project CyClean and crypto mining project ETHernitymining.  Verdict eInc is an ambitious project that has the wind of Ethereum’s network at its back. With its blockchain already launched and mining activity under way, eInc is miles ahead of many other projects that are pursuing ICOs. eInc’s technology has the potential to be the answer to some of the chief criticizms of blockchain startups. BTCC Founder Bobby Lee has said that many startups aren’t blockchain companies at all and instead more closely resemble database companies. By providing the blockchain-in-a-box solution, eInc could validate blockchain businesses and make sure they’re using the ledger in the manner in which it was intended. eInc plans to be listed on exchanges and asks that you follow them on Telegram for listing updates.  Risks     Forked digital currencies have a higher propensity for 51% attacks than the coins of the original blockchain networks like Ethereum. A complaint of forked coins generally speaking has been that they fail to reflect the ingenuity of an original network. (-1.5)     If startups fail to show an interest in the eInc platform, that would likely lead to the decline in value of the ETI coin. It’s unclear if there’s a pipeline of startups ready to sign up for the eInc blockchain. Based on the white paper, it appears eInc will begin inviting startups to use its platform in Q4 2018. They also have yet to partner with wallet providers. (-1)  Growth Opportunity     EtherInc has a live product and apps. They launched Mainnet (7 nodes) and Ropsten (3 nodes) test networks back in February 2018 and will be distributing MainNet ETI coins during the ICO. Many ICO projects have yet to develop an actual product at the time of the token sale and are relying on funds not yet raised to do so. EtherInc is several steps ahead in this regard. (+4)     Supports dApps that are running on the Ethereum network (+2)     eInc boasts a deep bench of talent in its management team and impressive advisory panel. (+2)     eInc appears to have a unique understanding of the hurdles that startups face, and its turnkey solution could enable more entrepreneurs to succeed in a decentralized world.

However, we forked ethereum to build eInc as a special purpose blockchain to create and manage DAOs.  Here's how eInc works:    #1 use case: To build trusted, resilient and democratic virtual organizations  eInc removes the legal, financial and operational complications of setting up an organization.  - Reserve a name and quickly register your blockchain based DAO as an eInc. - The day to day decisions of the organization are made through Proposals. - Proposals can be used to create roles, add members, assign roles and associate grade to build a robust organizational structure that ensures key people can instantly execute certain actions. - Issue and assign stock with different vesting schedules and voting power of the shares to the team. This helps distribute the ownership and bring different stakeholders into an organization. - Easily pay salaries to employees or make payments to third party contractors based on accepted proposals. - ETI (EtherInc) coins are used to power the eInc DAO ecosystem on the eInc blockchain. - ETI can be used for payments, external investments, and finally building the assets within the organization.  # 2 use case: To offer a new standard of conducting a scam proof trustless crowdsale  - A reserved einc will be able to raise funds by passing a proposal for ICO and issue of a tradable token. Using einc‘s built-in tokensale smart contract will ensure that tokensales is scam-proof, since the release of organization fund raised in the tokensale will be tied to the resolutions and will require voting from investors.  - ICOs have a lot of potential as fundraising mechanism, but there is an increasing need for governance to protect token buyers from scams or organizations that aren’t executing correctly their roadmap or aren’t managing well the funds raised.  - In eInc, the funds raised in an ICO will be protected are tied to the proposals. If ICO supporters disagree with steps that an organization is taking or the way they spend the capital raised, they can submit a proposal and put it to vote to withdraw the remaining funds to ICO buyers in the same proportion as they were raised.  #3 use case: Securing elections with blockchain where votes are secure, transparent and impossible to forge.  - Members of a democracy are allowed to vote democratically on budget, implementation, and ideas from the community. - Members create proposals to define how certain actions are decided and triggered and put them to vote. - Members must reach a consensus based on the democracy’s Quorum voting percentage. They may be of different opinions, but ultimately have to agree on a consensus to determine the state of the blockchain. - Proposals can be used to create roles, add members, assign roles and associate grade to build a robust governance structure that ensures key people can instantly execute certain actions in a democracy. - Autonomy is implemented via eInc Blockchain and its mechanism with no central administrative body. - Source code is publicly available on GitHub - By capturing all aspects and processes on the blockchain, transparency is ensured and manipulation is made impossible, at least in theory.   WHAT DIFFERENTIATES US FROM ETHEREUM:  We decided to take a different path than Ethereum by:  - reducing block time from 15s to 6s - increasing network transactions per sec by 2.5x - increasing transaction confirmation speed by 2.5x - increasing miner reward by 2.5x - removing uncle reward - implementing finite supply for mineable coins  This makes the eInc blockchain faster than Ethereum and allows for better scaling while preserving decentralization. einc was created as a fork of Ethereum blockchain with replay protection and hence, has all the capabilities of the Ethereum blockchain with some of our added enhancements.  Unlike Ethereum, the GAS prices aren’t as high on the eInc blockchain and hence, dApps can run inexpensively.  What we've already built:   Checkout the eInc project here: https://einc.io",False
