In fact, they may grant the holder a number of rights. This could be shareholding, periodic dividends, finance inflows, debt payments, voting rights, and more. All these rights are secured by a smart contract that controls tokens.  What is important is the fact that, due to the peculiarities of these tokens, from a legal and regulatory perspective, they are treated quite differently.

JungSik Lee: Lee is the manager of HW engineering at Tinnos, Inc.  Advisors Rachael McCrary: McCrary was a senior designer at Skechers and Delta Galil.  Verdict Below is a breakdown of the risks and growth potential of Bonafi.  Risks     Many blockchain supply chain management projects already exist and are further developed. (-1)     The absence of team members working for world-class companies might make it hard to establish partnerships with huge companies. (-2)     More information on the platform and the Crypto-Tag security would be better. (-1)  Growth Potential     Permanent immutable nature of public blockchains is a perfect fit for supply chain management. (+2.5)     The team has obtained enormous experience working in automobile part companies, an industry where counterfeit goods are a huge problem. (+4)     Combined with a blockchain, the trademarked main product, the Crypto-Tag, ensures that the product is genuine. (+2)  Disposition The existence of counterfeit products is a huge problem for everyone. The use of low-quality materials in production causes consumer health problems and even death in extreme cases such as in 2008 Chinese Baby Milk Scandal. To solve this crucial issue, many blockchain supply chain management projects have been launched. Most of these projects aim to create an immutable permanent transparent ledger of the product’s life from the very beginning of its production to the time the consumer obtains it so that any platform user can access to check the product’s authenticity. Bonafi is one among many, standing out with it’s the Crypto-tag product. Although the project seems promising, compared to similar projects, there are not many team members who have worked for Fortune 500 companies and this might make it hard for the project to establish connections and partnerships with such companies. This is a crucial element for any blockchain supply management project, because if there is no such partnership, then there is no chain of data to validate authenticity. Yet the team is highly experienced in the automobile parts industry in which counterfeit goods is a huge problem. More information on the platform and product security would be better to evaluate the project’s worth and estimate any return on investment as any security vulnerability would be costly.

They find the product is a fake and the seller is not an authorized reseller of the brand. They report counterfeit product to the authorities. The counterfeit account gets blocked, and customer’s money is saved.  Use Case # 2  A seller chooses to drop ship through Amazon. Somehow Amazon forgets to follow the policy and stores the products without charges without checking their authenticity. The product gets shipped to the customer. The customer uses the Bonafi app on his/her smartphone to scan the product. The product scans as fake. Customer sends the product back and informs Amazon about the counterfeiter. Amazon blocks the counterfeit account.  Use Case # 3  Amazon sets policy for sellers to send their items to its warehouse before being able to sell online. Amazon scans every arriving product for authenticity. Amazon lets authentic products pass into its warehouse and blocks the fake ones. Subsequently, Amazon blocks the counterfeit account as well as their merchandise. Eventually, there are only authentic products and brands on Amazon.  Use Case # 4  A seller XYZ registers on Amazon.

Customers place an order after seeing low price of a branded item. Amazon’s warehouse auditing team scans all the stored items.

PROBLEM: According to International Chamber of Commerce and a study done by Frontier Economics, it was estimated that the total global economic value of counterfeit and pirated goods was projected to be almost $1.8 Trillion by 2015.  TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET SIZE: USD $600 Billion Annually according to Netnames report 2016.  SOLUTION: Crypto-Tag™ - Our Crypto-Tag™ does not run on battery. Once scanned by an NFC enabled mobile device, power is sent through the air and the Crypto-Tag™ will automatically authenticate the product. Mobile Application - The mobile application will be used by brands, retailers, and consumers to communicate with the Crypto-Tag™ and add additional data onto the blockchain. Blockchain - Genuine data for each individual item and the journey through the supply chain will be permanently recorded on the Blockchain, allowing anyone to verify the authenticity of the products. Tokens by Rewards- Manufacturers send tokens to reward the consumers who wishes to provide user reviews and feedback. This creates token demand and supply.
