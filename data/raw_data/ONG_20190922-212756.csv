RE:  Advertisers. This will not compromise the idea of a well informed and trusted community because we give each person the choice to turn off ads,  but still give them the choice to turn on an advertsiment (which is clearly identified), so if someone wants the extra earnings and they feel they are in line with the advertiser they can make that choice. We give each person the ability to choose custom ads or automate the system.  Our core value is ""choice"", therefore we want to present much opportunity and then ""get out of the way"" to let the community decide.  The benefit is obvious that now you will have increased trust with brands that some one with a large following can validate because they chose them to be featured and it provides another outside source of revenue coming into the system.  We love the Steem project, but decided to differentiate in a few areas from their project by allowing an outside revenue source via  the ""ad-share"" program (G-Bucks) and by limiting the supply of our onG Coin asset, which we feel will make it much more valuable over time. There are other differences of course in our project as you have noted.  Cheers and thank you for such insightful questions. Quote from: networkzombie on July 08, 2017, 10:42:23 PM Read the thread, read the whitepaper. This looks like an interesting project and I will definitely be in on the ICO!

Pre-ICO Valuation OneName Global, Inc. (The parent Delaware Corporation of onG.social) has a $25 Million, Pre-ICO valuation at $1.00/share, which puts us ahead of many ICO’s.  During our ICO we will issue a total of 70 Million onG Coin Tokens at a decreasing discount structure that will be posted on the site at https://onGcoin.io  Pre-sale ICO:  Contact Success@onG.social for inquiries.  These are selling out fast kiddies!  IBM We’ve been backed by IBM since 2014, because they believe in the value of our project.  Built on the Ultra-Reliable Ethereum Blockchain Ethereum is the most versatile blockchain that is available. The ERC20 standards set a precedent for creating a token with a tested rule set, which allows onG to analyze and modify the algorithm that distributes its token while not compromising the security layer of the token itself. Pair this with Ethereum’s incredible growth without compromising stability and you have a winning partner in the blockchain world.  A True Tested Product onG.social is live right now! You can test it out for yourself before it goes into the blockchain! Most ICOs are based on very well thought out concepts that are seeking funding to test their idea. Our ICO is to take our proven product into the blockchain. Having a functioning product before an ICO increases its value significantly  We include fantastic projects such as Storj and Golem  We love supporting other amazing blockchain technologies like Storj and Golem!  Storj is a decentralized blockchain storage system. Instead of a service like AWS, Storj uses decentralized and distributed nodes to store data. Global Supercomputer, CPU – Golem integration  An encryption project that is focused on decentralizing super-computing power is also a protocol that could be added into onG to increase the viability of the dashboard.  Both of these fantastic projects give incredible boosts to our project which goes perfectly with our motto of “Achieve More Together”  Protect Your Content with our Content Mirror  More than ever people are having to worry about the future of their years of hard work on Social Media platforms. Too many talented people are being squeezed out of their hard work and carefully crafted content by profit driven algorithms meant to exclude people not bring them together.
