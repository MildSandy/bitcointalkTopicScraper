Almost endless scalability. Such projects technically have the ability to handle millions of transactions per second.  2. Almost endless decentralization. So the voting process should take place with at least 10-100 thousand votes. voting.  3. Low energy use. Currently, bitcoin consumes 30 terawatt hours of energy with about 50 million users. This is electricity consumption at the level of a small country like Ireland. All banks taken together consume 100 Terawatt hours of energy. By the way, if 5 billion people used bitcoin, then it would consume 3000 Tera-hours, 300 times more than all banks put together, which makes Bitcoin completely useless as a global currency!  4. Almost immediate transactions. So the transaction should be confirmed within a maximum of 3 seconds. 10 seconds is already a lot, it can cause a network clogging.  5. No restrictions. It's mainly about two: the first is the lack of third parties that set the rules on how to vote, thus giving permission to vote. The second is the lack of connections in the matter of trust, meaning nodes do not have to trust each other to participate in the vote. Whenever there are two limitations (third parties expressing permission to vote and the need for trust between nodes), then cartels are formed, lobbying and many other negative matters take place.  6. No fees. However, this is not as important as the above 5 points.  Currently, only 3 cryptocurrencies meet these criteria:  Ethereum (soon after the implementation of Casper, Raiden, Plasma and Shardingu), IOTA and Elastos.",False

Behind it are not only ordinary blockchain developers, but also specialists of large Chinese universities and research centers. Elastos is a great choice. Its creators have a good and promising vision for the future of blockchain technology and possible directions of development of a new generation of the Internet, known as the Internet of Wealth.  A bit difficult to understand how the internet can be completely decentralized. In the end it requires a centralized infrastructure in order to work I thought?  Yea I'm waiting for the day when we can get rid of ISP's that would be amazing if somehow that could be accomplished with blockchain tech, I really don't like how we are dependent on these multinational corps for our internet. There has to be some innovative way for the internet to be truly decentralized   Also is there a more in depth description of what this coin will actually do maybe in more laymen s terms?",False

No, Elastos completed private sales last August in China, raised 4000 BTC, and released 6 million ELA tokens.  #3  The first token sale January 1, 2018 and then on Huobi.pro on Feb 1, 2018. Also, please note that it is a token sale event. ICO happened in August 2017 when we raised 4,000 BTCs.   So what does above tell me? China first! People behind this project are very shortsighted to see that a project of this scale should have been WORLDWIDE from the beginning. So now that they sold the most favorable ICO to Chinese investors, it's time oversell the leftovers in the rest of the world.

It also prohibits apps from directly accessing the network so as to prevent malicious attacks.  Elastos focuses on a new internet that is secure, credible, and smart.

He is also one of the most respected Tsinghua alumni. Rong worked at Microsoft from 1992 to 2000. During his time there, he led the teams of Microsoft Research OS, IE3 ActiveX, Ole Automation, .COM, and .NET. He proposed various new ideas on the technology of Operating Systems 30 years ago, but failed to see progress until the launch of Windows 10 and the development of blockchain.  It is now possible to make an OS environment safer and more efficient. When he left Microsoft, Rong started working on the Elastos OS. He founded Kortide in 2000 to build elastos OS from scratch. Elastos has been supported by Foxconn, the Chinese Central Government, Tsinghua University, and most recently, a pre-ICO. Rong had been invited by the former Premiere of China to speak at the Great Hall of the People about his work on Operating Systems.  Han Feng, Board Member of elastos:  Feng is one of the most reputable blockchain thinkers in China, respected and recognized by tens of thousands of blockchain and cryptocurrency enthusiasts.

Introduction  Elastos is the Internet operating system that uses Internet as the base-layer infrastructure rather than an application. It emphasizes that network communications should be separated from application computing, and prohibits applications from direct network access.  Is short, elastos is building the foundation of a decentralized internet. Why Elastos?  Following are the key factors that led to the vision of building the foundation of a decentralized internet: Credit system: the vision is to build an automated economy built on top of a global credit system. Individuals or IoT enabled ecosystem should be able to transact without intermediaries & externally susceptible systems. Security: one of the limitations of applications developed on a traditional operating system is that they are prone to privacy leaks and network attacks. elastos believes that apps shouldn’t interact directly with the network, but rather in a controlled fashion. Digital rights: digital assets and information should be easily convertible into money, enabled by digital economy. That adds the need of digital rights information, identity and mapping transactions.  Elastos’ philosophy can be traced 17.5 years back when the team started working on it, however, now it is focused on building a technical infrastructure of a smart economy.  The overall architecture includes a public Blockchain, a decentralized Internet infrastructure, and a runtime environment for conventional apps, mobile apps and DApps.  Excitingly, elastos employs merged mining and Bitcoin as a parent Blockchain enabling more rewards for miners mining both BTC and ELA at the same time. Consequently, elastos will have a significant computing capabilities from the get go.  The foundation is supported by elastos carrier that provides decentralized computational power, storage and effectively a decentralized internet for OS and DApps.  The OS is specifically built to respect security by not allowing direct TCP/IP interaction and direct process creation. It will generate remote invocations and provide event based responses, thus restricting any possibility of malicious attack as part of the application layer.  Elastos also offers a runtime environment to enable running of existing OS such as Android, iOS, thereby enabling the decentralized internet infrastructure of existing applications.  For individual users, elastos tokens can be used to register an ID and use that to purchase DApps, cloud storage, digital assets and products. All transactions can happen in a trustless manner, over the Blockchain, without sharing private information or any fear of being attacked maliciously.    To keep it simple, elastos is decentralized across the Internet, and utilizes Blockchain to authenticate user IDs, application IDs, as well as machine IDs. To build a flourishing ecosystem, anybody may freely implement their own markets, social apps, search engines, location-based services, advertisement agents, and so on, while being rewarded with elastos coins.     Elastos and Other Existing Systems  Elastos and Windows OS  Elastos shares the same technology source with Microsoft COM and has certain similarity to it. Microsoft .NET has been revised to chose the technology direction for elastos.  The biggest difference between elastos and Windows is that elastos chose the operation way of open-source community. The blockchain-constructed foundation makes elastos a credible and decentralized network operating system, while Windows, representative of a traditional operating system, is closed, centralized and emphasizes on Microsoft’s authority and applications.  Elastos and Android  For meeting the App developers and users usage habits, elastos adopted an Android like framework for application development. Meanwhile, as elastos can compile Android APKs (5.0 or higher), which makes elastos application ecology richer and fuller, yet compatible.  Technically, what Android VM runs is not the original code. However, some application scenarios need to use original code base for which Android system must open a direct channel to underlying system (JNI). It is equivalent to opening a hole at the sandbox bottom, and that includes significant safety risks.  Elastos and Ethereum  Ethereum realizes credible computations for blockchain through smart contract and makes contract be executed without human intervention. It turns the blockchain data into ‘execution power.’ But Ethereum adopts the single mainchain structure. While there is no doubt that smart contract increases the mainchain burden, no matter how the optimization runs, there is always a bottleneck of computing power and throughput upper limit.  elastos combines the mainstream computation mentality to develop ‘the blockchain elastic computation.’ On the blockchain layer, elastos adopts the complex structure of mainchain + sidechain, realizes the load balancing of multiple chains and technical characteristics of flexible extensions.  It makes elastos unlimited by the single mainchain power of the blockchain, and also be able to extend the blockchain service capability infinitely. Besides, through elastos Runtime, blockchain credibility can be transferred to the traditional usage scenarios such as cellphone and PC. The smart contract ensures that digital assets are distributed strictly according to the contract content.  Elastos and Blockstack  Based on distributed storage, Blockstack saves the encrypted file data in the cloud, while Hash stamps were put on the blockchain as the storage proof. It is a trade-off between high credibility, low efficiency of blockchain and low credibility, high efficiency of traditional storage. elastos has its P2P network layer, which is called elastos Carrier. elastos Carrier focuses on making the elastos blockchain cluster chain service integrated into the same P2P network and provides the upper elastos Runtime and DApps with unified addressing service based on ID nodes.  In digital content storage, elastos adopts the mindset similar to Blockstack. Furthermore, it combines the authentication characteristics of the blockchain digital assets and the DRM technology on the operating system layer, making the digital content, including sound, video, electronic books, and applications, be able to be authenticated and quantified as digital currency. The digital assets become tradable, consumable and investable.  Elastos and EOS  EOS, through the adoption of the DPOS consensus mechanism, can realize high throughput rate.  elastos computation bandwidth is distributed according to the number of tokens held. It refers to the design philology of time sliced distribution in the traditional multi-task operating system and encourages the community to hold tokens. It can be called a creativity on algorithm layer, and an improved version of Ethereum.  elastos adopts the elastic computation mindset of chain cluster service on blockchain layer. The mainchain design focuses on improving extensibility for smooth access to sidechain. The consensus mechanism on the sidechain can be DPOS, DBFT or others.  Moreover, services on the elastos blockchain layer can be shared by multiple side chains. It greatly lowers the mainchain pressure. When necessary, the sidechain can be duplicated to extend sidechain-level service capability through bifurcation mechanism, while the extension of this computing power can be infinite.
