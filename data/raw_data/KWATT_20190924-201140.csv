(just an FYI, you're gonna wanna go for option 2.

This means that any additional plants added to the project, will have their power added to the existing tokens, no new ones will be issued, and with the team planning on reaching 22 plants in the next 5 years, I think its going to pay to hold.

The specific method that the team uses on their plants is called 'Anaerobic Digestion', this in turn ends up producing methane, which is what is used to power the plants generators.   From the below article, this is the steps:  The process of anaerobic digestion consists of three steps:  1) The first step is the decomposition (hydrolysis) of plant or animal matter. This step breaks down the organic material to usable-sized molecules such as sugar. 2) The second step is the conversion of decomposed matter to organic acids. 3) Finally, the acids are converted to methane gas.  Source: http://www.energy.ca.gov/biomass/anaerobic.html  So no coal or petroleum is used in any step of the plant.

KWATT is the native token of an energy company that has figured out how to convert garbage into electricity, and they decided to bring their business to the Blockchain.  2017 has been a record breaking, awe inspiring rollercoaster ride for cryptocurrency valuations with over 2000% valuation increases. With all the hype and global attention on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Initial Coin Offerings have attempted to tokenize just about everything in 2017. However, in this culture of tokenization, what everybody has failed to observe is that, with price spikes in crypto valuations comes energy spikes in transactions processing.  As of September 30, 2017, 1 Bitcoin transaction could power 7.5 homes in the US for a day.  As of December 31, 2017, 1 Bitcoin transaction could power 10.5 homes in the US for a day.  This trend should cause severe alarm and provide us all with reason for concern. Furthermore, with a tidal wave of ICOs forthcoming this year all intending to take advantage of the hype and frenzy that is frothing within our community, the consumption of electricity to process all these transactions is only expected to rise exponentially.  A proof-of-work (POW) system (or protocol, or function) is an economic measure to deter denial of service attacks and other service abuses such as spam on a network by requiring some work from the service requester, usually meaning processing time by a computer.  On the contrary, Proof of Stake (PoS) concept states that a person can mine or validate block transactions according to how many coins he or she holds. This means that the more Bitcoin or altcoin owned by a miner, the more mining power he or she has.  While we all look forward to proof of stake to evolve, nevertheless, the most sought after, pioneer proven currency remains Bitcoin, which continues to operate on a proof of work methodology. This is why the network is voraciously consuming electricity for the foreseeable future.",False

I also saw that video, but that I don't know this plant is already working or in under development. That we need to be confirmed with admin or need to be wait for some announcement from 4new.  I have heard that there should be a big announcement from 4New this week. Maybe the power plant will be mentioned, we'll see. At any rate, I am very curious what you will tell us  Really looking forward to the announcement. It can be anything: An exchange that will list the tokens, news about the power plant or the release of the reworked website ....  I'm more hoping on tangible news like breaking ground on the first plant over exchange listings, in the end i think its healthier for projects like this to make big progress in the actual platform than just listings, if people want to trade they will find a way to trade with DEX... but breaking ground really is a major milestone  I don't see it being an exchange announcement at all, I think they have something big to announce, and after the ICO will open again to capitalise on the FOMO.  I hope you are right. But my guess is that they will announce an exchange that lists the tokens. It's common news after the ICO and when they have an agreement with a big exchange it would be also huge.  Nah i don't see an exchange announcement most likely it might be the completion of successfully implementation of kyc on site and continuation of ico.",False

Is there any information about exchange for this token?  I don't think there has been any announcements regarding exchanges yet (correct me if I am wrong). But I guess we will get this news as soon as their 3 Day prelisting sale is over.  I am confused here after the kyc implementation will the  sale run for another 3 days or 3 to 4 weeks?  The ICO will run for three days only, I have confirmed that with them in Telegram. You can also join the group and check the pinned message that states this.  Telegram: https://t.me/FRNCoin  From the pinned message:  IMPORTANT NEWS - The 4New ICO has paused and will resume in the coming weeks, following a complete integration with Ocular’s Anti- Money Laundering (AML) compliance platform that provides instant verification of a customer`s background (KYC). 4New’s ICO will then re-open for a three day pre-listing sale the dates for which will be announced via the company’s community channels, web site and portal.  Thanks for this darkoth89 it is nice to be informed and i have also joined the telegram group thanks for sharing that also.  No problem, i've seen alot of misinformation in this thread especially with some people saying 4-6 weeks, it's always best to fact check yourself before taking on any new information. Telegram is the single best place to get a reliable answer quickly!",False

I also saw that video, but that I don't know this plant is already working or in under development. That we need to be confirmed with admin or need to be wait for some announcement from 4new.  I have heard that there should be a big announcement from 4New this week. Maybe the power plant will be mentioned, we'll see. At any rate, I am very curious what you will tell us  Really looking forward to the announcement. It can be anything: An exchange that will list the tokens, news about the power plant or the release of the reworked website ....  I'm more hoping on tangible news like breaking ground on the first plant over exchange listings, in the end i think its healthier for projects like this to make big progress in the actual platform than just listings, if people want to trade they will find a way to trade with DEX... but breaking ground really is a major milestone  I don't see it being an exchange announcement at all, I think they have something big to announce, and after the ICO will open again to capitalise on the FOMO.  I hope you are right. But my guess is that they will announce an exchange that lists the tokens. It's common news after the ICO and when they have an agreement with a big exchange it would be also huge.  Nah i don't see an exchange announcement most likely it might be the completion of successfully implementation of kyc on site and continuation of ico.  There is no official announcement from 4NEW team regarding exchange or listing. And I think we have to wait until special token sale window is over. I just checked on their telegram channel about exchanges listing. They said ""it will be after ICO, but ICO has paused for kyc implementation. Just wait for the announcement.""",False

Which means it utilizes the Ethereum network. The total number of coins that can ever exist is 300 million KWATTs. It is estimated that each plant will generate about 10 megawatts/hours on launch. The plant as it develops is expected to generate 4x that value of 40 megawatts per hour. To keep this in perspective 1 megawatt equals 1000 kilowatts (KWATTs). Each household consumes about 1.5 kilowatts per day. So 1000 kilowatts would operate 650 households.  The KWATT coin is pegged to the actual WATTs and would represent 1 Kilowatt and that is how you can own electricity internationally and without having to be constrained to a specific location. With KWATT tokens it means you can do two things. You can sell the tokens to the UK national grid as energy; since 1 KWATT represented the same actual Kilowatt. The other option is apply the token to 4NEW’s cryptocurrency mining farm.,False

Imagine how much KWATT could change the futures of so many people, in terms of development of the continent as a whole whilst introducing new industries and buiding a brand new workforce which consequently could increase the overall GDP.

If mining revenue is greater then the third site will cater to mining. However this fine balance will be closely tracked as there is no way to know what the people will choose. Nevertheless, our understanding and expectation from the masses is that most want mining Also, in the distant future, once enough revenues are flowing within the ecosystem, the management team will initiate a Research & Development department where we will manufacture our own hardware.

That means you can choose what you want to do with each of your token, for 50 years.  You can put it towards mining, sell it to the grid to acquire more, or use it to pay your electric (as well as medical soon I believe?) bills.  On top of this, they will be increasing the hashpower of their farms, so you own a % of the hash, rather than a set rate so you'll always be competitive.  Before the mining, they break even on collecting the trash, show me another mining provider that breaks even before they have even factored in the mining profits minus the electric costs, I know personally for me on hashflare, the fees are something like 70% of my mining rewards now, this is going to massive once people realise.",False

I really liked the below mentioned details  KWATT Coin — Its Mining Power  The most difficult part of the KWATT Coin design has been determining a model to correlate with the increase in mining difficulty. Its understood that one hash today can represent half of its mining power a month from now. To solve this issue, It was decided to have the coin represent a fraction of the total mining capacity of the 4NEW network rather than a fixed mathematical rate. This concept allows 4NEW to expand their mining capacity to match a competitive rate on the network. This rate of exponential expansion will be a predetermined reinvestment strategy of the funds recieved through 4NEW’s own mining portfolio, in addition to the profits from the other revenue streams. This model not only guarantees the longevity of free energy, but the longevity of competitive mining practices",False
