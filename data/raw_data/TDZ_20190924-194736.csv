Also, can you imagine professional trader working via web-based application, let‚Äôs say on a laptop? It is not efficient, not professional, and quiet absurd, as I see it. ProTraders need at least 3 screens to monitor all data they need to make weighted decisions. It is impossible to customize Web solutions in a way to do so. That is why only software solution can be applied here, not Web.  As for Blockchain Terminal, I say: First of all, Blockchain Terminal is focused on institutional investors only. They are not aiming such markets as independent private companies and retail traders. They do not have instruments for them at all. Secondly, Blockchain Terminal is not free and charge a really high prices for usage of it (thousands of dollars). Finally, our terminal is an instrument and just one of our three products. Our global goals differ dramatically, therefore we are not even competitors, because our global goal is to attract professional traders from mature markets and trading companies, to make crypto trading mass adoption easy and profitable, giving an opportunity to enter this market for housewives, doctors, teachers, students and etc, without leaving behind existing crypto holders. Blockchain Terminal goal is institutional trading: banks and etc. That‚Äôs it",False

There will be an account on which all transactions will be consolidated. By combining transactions through one account on each exchange, we believe that we can get the most profitable fees and transfer these savings to you by offering lower tariffs for each bargain. To act as a custodian for our users, we will get a license. Your money will be placed on the exchange accounts of our system. No one will have direct access to your funds except us, and we could access the funds that you deposited on the platform for copying transactions. (It is also possible to connect to the API).  2) The use of block in our system will allow you to record all the statistics of traders, which guarantees 100% transparency of the performance of traders. Also, each trader will have to trade for two months through our terminal before the investor can subscribe to it.  3) Our product for investors Tradelize.Web will allow not only to follow the trader in an automatic mode, but also the opportunity to trade itself will be available. It will be possible to manage the portfolio, that is, on the one hand, you can view traders' portfolios, and on the other - use extensive settings for risk management, adjust the amount allocated for trader copying and / or strategy and ranges of allowed price execution for copying transactions (trades, which repeat the execution of the trader and / or strategy).  4) Our system will also provide an algorithm creation function for automatic trading along with tools that will help you create your own bot.  5) Our project is designed for three types of audience: a trader, an investor, and a newcomer in the crypto-currency world. Thus absolutely any person can be a participant of cryptology. This will attract a new audience, which in these markets has not yet worked. This will make crypto-economy more healthy. This will also bring additional liquidity, which in general will have a positive impact on the market.  6) Our trading terminal can be customized at the request of the trader. It was developed by traders for traders.  Features of our terminal: 1) A few clicks can be found in the liquidity window with the liquidity depth of the stock exchange or the market. 2) Manage and track all orders from one window 3) The arbitration window will allow to find inefficiency of the market and to earn on them 4) The Positions window will allow you to monitor the performance of your portfolio 5) WatchList will help to keep up to date on the movements of selected crypto-currency assets 6) Ability to add hot keys and newsfeed, as well as charts (graphics) 7) Ability to resolve transactions directly by clicking on the chart (graph) A wide range of risk management settings 9) All sorts of cryptopairs 10) Ability to split the terminal into several screens",False

As planned, the full version of Tradelize‚Äôs professional terminal will be available for testing in just a few weeks.  This last month has been filled with negotiations with potential advisors, partners, and consumers in the Asian market. We actively carry on working with them with the goal of improving our product and increasing its visibility in the crypto realm.  We are excited to announce that Tradelize has attracted major interest in Asia, especially in the South Korean crypto community. The exact nature of the participation of these parties will be contingent upon the expected government regulation in crypto trading.  We believe the introduction of new regulations is a reason to be optimistic about the future of the crypto economy as a whole and Tradelize in particular. It will allow a large group of new users to flood the market.  For these reasons, our team has decided to move the public sale to a time after official regulations have been announced at the end of June. The public sale is now planned for 15 July, 2018.  Thank you for keeping up to date with Tradelize! Our team is always glad to answer any questions and address any concerns.  -The Tradelize Team",False

Attempts to unite various exchanges in one terminal were made, but all were limited to poor-made solutions, where there were no real professional tools.  We also made a unique decision to attract professional traders to our platform - 80% of the collected funds will be allocated to them for management at 50% commission (the amount of funds per each of such traders will be up to 500 thousand dollars).  But it seems to us that it is much more important to talk about the ideological side of our project.  The project is aimed at attracting a new audience to crypto trading, which has not yet worked on this market. This will make crypto-economy more healthy. This will also bring additional liquidity, which in general will have a positive impact on the market.  The new audience will consist of players such as private trading companies, who now do not have either technical or risk management tools that allow them to enter the market. Professional traders with extensive trading experience in traditional markets, bringing with them huge capital.  In addition, the project is aimed at making smart mass adoption of cryptoworld. We want the broad masses of the population to enter the market with the help of our functionality and they will be able to get results comparable to the results of professionals. A student, a housewife, a taxi driver, a hairdresser, a doctor - all of them will be able to invest and trade in the crypto currency market, using exclusively our application.  Also, we do not forget about the huge existing market of holders of crypto-currencies, who have the means, but not the knowledge and skills. That is why, we want to create for them the opportunity to multiply their funds by repeating the actions of others.  It is overall description, but still very short  I hope you share our enthusiasm and believe in the crypto-currency economy, as well as the desire to develop it, creating new products and useful things.",False

Any interested trader can connect their accounts on exchanges to Tradelize.score through Tradelize.terminal or directly through API and start using the platform to build their personal Tradelize score. After completion of all the legal formalities and technical procedures the funds will be released from the escrow account and distributed among the 300 best ProTraders and the liquidity pool as follows (provided that the ICO hard cap has been reached): TOP 10: $500–ö each TOP 11-50: $100–ö each TOP 51-100: $75–ö each TOP 101-300: $40–ö each  Best traders would want to use our platform, because we believe that there's a huge number of traders looking for a professional trading terminal to utilize their skills to full extent.
