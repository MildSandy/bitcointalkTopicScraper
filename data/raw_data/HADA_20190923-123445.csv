As it should be.,"PRE-ICO IS LIVE NOW www.Hada-DBank.com WHITEPAPER   INTRODUCTION  HADA DBANK – your Caring and Personal Banking partners. We aim to be your financial partners, rather than just a financial institution that you use for transactions. This whitepaper will explain how HADA DBANK is different, and the steps we will take towards our goals.  We are the first Digital Bank to fuse Islamic Banking Module with Blockchain Technology, to create an ethical and responsible banking ecosystem. We are troubled with the current mistreatment by banks and financial institutions towards their customers. Existing players create money out of thin air from debt and interest. This is why the global economy has collapsed time after time, evidently since the 1st century. The lack of responsibilities bore by banks is simply audacious. This is why we chose to be a part of the current financial revolution through establishing a Bank, a caring and personal bank.  Caring and Personal: these are our core values, shaping and influencing our services, transactions, interactions and running of our businesses. These words will guide our conduct internally within our organization, and externally with our customer and the community. We aspire to be the bank that actually cares to improve people’s lives, rather than just to profit from it. Personalization will also be the main focus in our services. Different customers have different needs, and require different services and attention. HADA DBANK’s customers will have tailored services because we believe, not everyone can wear the same pair of pants.   WHY ISLAMIC BANKING?  Our reason is simple. We aspire to be a ‘just’ organization in the financial industry. The financial crisis of 2007-2008 serves as a grim reminder how several irresponsible players can capsize an entire industry, putting millions in financial ruins. Islamic banking, due to its transparency, profit and loss sharing concept, will minimize market manipulation and eliminate another domino crash.  Islamic Banks are less risky and more resilient than their counterparts, due to the aspects of their bank capital requirements and mobilisation of deposits. As opposed to Conventional Banking, depositors to Islamic Banks are entitled to be informed about what the bank does with their money. They also have a say in where their money should be invested. Islamic banks also strive to avoid interest at all levels of financial transactions and promote risk-sharing between the lender and borrower.  There are two basic principles in Islamic banking. One is the sharing of profit and loss; and two, significantly, the prohibition of the collection and payment of interest by lenders and investors. Collecting interest or ""Riba"" is not permitted under Islamic law. In the case of profit, both the bank and its customer share in a pre-agreed proportion. In the case of a loss, all financial losses will then be borne by the lender. In addition to this, Islamic bank cannot create debt without goods and services to back it (i.e. physical assets including machinery, equipment, and inventory). Hence savings, deposits and investments with our DBank will be backed by physical assets such as precious metals and gemstones.  You might think that Islamic banking is only for Muslims. It is not. In June 2014, Britain became the first non-Muslim country to issue Sukuk; the Islamic equivalent of a bond (the word itself is the plural of Sakk, which means contract or deed). In September 2014, the governments of Luxembourg and South Africa as well as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority made issuances. But Sukuk is not limited to sovereigns: in September 2014, Goldman Sachs issued a USD500 Million Sukuk and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Malaysia raised its 1st USD50 from its USD500 Million issuance. All of these entities want in on the USD2 Trillion Islamic financial market.   Hada DBank Exclusive Features and Advantages  Among the services that Hada DBank will provide includes:-  1.
