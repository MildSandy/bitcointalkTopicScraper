Today there are about 4 billion computers with over 500 Exabyte of free space in the world. If all those capacities are placed on USB flash drives of 64 gigabyte each, one can lay a road to the Moon!  DeNet suggests to more rationally use these resources. The company creates a decentralized eco-system using blockchain-technologies for data storage, hosting of websites and applications and other computational tasks. DeNet solutions, based on a concept of sharing economy, will let millions of people all over the world not only rent out idle capacities of their computers and earn on it, but become part of a global society, influencing development of data storage technology.  To join DeNet network (https://denet.pro/denet-node/), you need a PC with 256 Mb RAM and internet with a speed of 1 mbit/s minimum. Now the application works on Linux and Mac OS.  Cloud storage market volume grows by almost 30 % per year and will approach about USD 100 billion by 2022. Several major players, such as Dropbox, Google, Yandex and Mail.ru, own the market now.  If a decentralized storage can capture even a small percentage of this market, it will be a big industry. Today DeNet, Storj, Sia, Filecoin, Substratum and more are already competing for share of this market. Different platforms work differently. But regardless of the approach, decentralized storage is a rapidly growing industry and the future is promising for any project that can improve the technology.  To prove the idea‚Äôs operability, in the end of 2017 DeNet presented an alpha-version of a shared static hosting; and a pre-beta version of DeNet.Storage ‚Äì in July 2018.

One year has passed since we stepped on DeNet path. Do you remember how in 2017 we launched the first version of HTTP distributed hosting‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähttps://alpha.denet.pro/  We worked hard to achieve the goals we specified in RoadMap during this year.

Join us, earn on idle capacities of your computer, and become part of DeNet community!  So what?  Now we have an app for miners and an app for users; that‚Äôs why we work on expanding the audience and improvement of services for DNET token is used as much as possible within our network.  Why does it matter?  Tokens value increases with growing demand on services within DeNet network. It means that the same amount of tokens will let you get more services tomorrow than it used to be yesterday.  For example:  DeNet network turnover in petabytes‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääup to 300 How many TB you can store for 300 tokens per month? Up to 10. Up to 3,000‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääup to 100.  Buy tokens now: when we develop a turnover of 3,000 petabytes, you will be able to get ten times more capacities than today.  Take part in fundraising  We spare no effort to make private and safe data storage available to everyone. Join token sale to support us and become part of DeNet community.  Our presale started at 9:00 am GMT on October 1st, 2018‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähttps://denet.pro/fund/.  Our goal  The goal of this stage of token sale is to raise funds for further improvement of the development, full-fledged launch of services on the scheduled date and entry in South Korean and Russian markets.  Conditions of token sale  There is no minimum entry threshold. The exchange rate is fixed at the moment of payment. Maximum threshold: USD 100,000 (if above USD 100,000‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou become a participant of a closed presale and receive bonuses)  The main token sale will be different: without regular bonuses.

If source code is not available, then how you can guarantee the storage is indeed 100% decentralized - how you can prove those files are not kept on your local data center storage 100% private - how you can prove you do not have backdoor key to every single file on the storage? 100% safe - how you can prove the integrity of the data is guaranteed, even if multiple hosting computers will switch off  So the bottomline - with closed-source code there is no way to audit it, so why users should trust you? Or... are there legal guarantees (instead of open-code-based ones), as with existing centralized storage solutions?  I am not trying to be mean.

So what's new in DeNet?  DeNet is working on development of alternative decentralized storage services and already submitted pre-beta version of secure data service DeNet.Storage. In July we offered all those who wish to test it (you can try it too if still not: https://storage.denet.pro/landing/).  We`ve got a feedback: reviews, observations and suggestions from our colleague, advisers and common users. So, whole last month we`ve been working on improving the service. We`ve updated a website architecture, the frontend-version and have increased storage‚Äôs security.  To do list:  Storage landing: storage.denet.pro/landing  DeNet.Storage update Usability Authorization Creating folders Previews  Front-end:  Private keys encryption and decryption by passwords Fast search  Overall updates:  Files fragmentation and defragmentation Rating system Digital signatures  Usability  It`s hard to get used to something new. Usually people do not want to spend time for learning about something. Therefore we made Denet.Storage functionary and design are intuitive. You can load into the storage any files you want. Unlike traditional services, nobody can get access to your data or use it (even us).  Frontend  We`ve implemented Vue.js framework and increased the working speed.  We constantly analyze new technologies and implement the most effective in our service. We want to make its interface handy and secure.  For instance, we made files preview. It is common for traditional services, but new for blockchain one. Now it is generating on backend. In next versions they are going to be generated and encrypted only in frontend.  There are folders to make file organization more convenient.  Backend  We`ve upgraded signing up system with the help of public and private keys. We abandoned the signing up form with Metamask, because it could limit us in future.  What private key allows us in frontend? Digital signature generation regardless of other apps To approve transactions between user and node in the background To download files directly from slave-nodes Appropriate account switching We`ve developed and have tested a library for files fragmentation and defragmentation, which will be implemented in next versions. This is the next step towards end-state product vision.  Moreover we`ve developed and have tested nodes rating system, which we are going to implement in upcoming upgrades.  Decentralization  By the way, we believe that it`s not good to get carried away by blockchain in projects. The reason is in limits. But what we should do when we have to build an independent network without those limits? While developing DeNet we learned each fact and can offer several solutions to avoid limits. We will definitely write about it. Stay tuned!",False

This test will be a key feature in DeNet‚Äôs global strategy, which focuses on security guarantees for its platform and for every user in the DeNet network.  Naoris‚Äô vision is to revolutionize the way in which cybersecurity is thought about and delivered around the world. Its infinitely scalable platform, the Naoris Security Ecosystem (Naoris SE), leverages the unique benefits of blockchain technologies and the latest in artificial intelligence (AI) to offer near-instantaneous detection and reporting of cyber threats, facilitating a consensually approved fix action without the need to rely on a central point of failure to command changes. Naoris‚Äô technology is a perfect solution for DeNet‚Äôs ecosystem for data storage and web-hosting.  Naoris will examine DeNet‚Äôs durability and will prove that decentralized services are much safer than any existing centralized solution. A team of industry professionals, led by David Carvalho, an experienced Global Chief Information Security Officer, will audit DeNet‚Äôs platform accordingly until December 2018.  ‚ÄúOur supreme goal is to provide everyone with a safe, reliable and completely secure network for global data hosting and storage. By applying Naoris‚Äô real-time anonymous tamper-proof assurance into the DeNet system, we are bringing a powerful solution that proves an unprecedented level of security for our data-storage and web-hosting platform, while ensuring maximum trust on the system‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsays Rafik Singatullin, CEO DeNet.  At the moment DeNet has two minimum viable working products, which demonstrate the functionality and usability of decentralized blockchain-based system. Users are able to test DeNet.Storage and alpha-version of web-hosting at their official site. The company is constantly working on developing and improving its products and plans to roll out ready-to-go products by 2019. Naoris will provide a senior inspection, which will help DeNet build a powerful system of trust.  ‚ÄúWe are seeing that the blockchain, for the first time ever, is reimagining cybersecurity and addressing the recurring defect in current solutions of a single central point of failure within growing networks. Current cloud networks are increasingly susceptible to cyber intrusions for companies holding vast amounts of user data. Therefore, robust cybersecurity solutions are crucial for companies such as DeNet, as its data storage and hosting capabilities expand.  We are pleased to sign this agreement with DeNet, a decentralized blockchain platform whose vision is complementary to Naoris. We are undertaking a comprehensive audit in order to support the considerable cybersecurity requirements of DeNet‚Äôs platform. We look forward to working together with DeNet and continuing to grow our relationship‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsays David Carvalho, Founder & CEO Naoris.  About DeNet:  DeNet‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääis an international provider company that is developing a blockchain based platform, which unites computers and servers all over the world into a network to provide decentralized web hosting services, as well as safe and secure data storage and data processing. The company aims to create decentralized hosting and routing plans, DNS and other network elements from a centralized ownership, ensuring autonomy of the network. DeNet was one of the first to test its minimum viable product (alpha-version on public test since November 2017). Please visit https://denet.pro for more information.  About Naoris:  Launched in 2018, Naoris is the world‚Äôs first holistic blockchain-based cybersecurity platform.
