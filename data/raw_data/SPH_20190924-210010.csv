The main cryptocurrency that established a basis of crypto market was Bitcoin. Underlying technology of Bitcoin is Blockchain that enables to store any transaction data into blocks, sequentially.  Currently, many startups around the world in the field of financial and banking services strive to raise money through ICO by copying traditional bank functionality. The main goal of that startups is to build one more traditional bank in traditional bank industry with inherited bureaucratic mechanisms coming from a number of licenses. Meantime, two of the most important and basic components of any successful bank are just ignored, reserve system and program of client insurance.   BANKllect is a decentralized intellectual bank network that allowing anyone worldwide to participate as a lender or borrower. The object of lending as well as borrowing can be any tokenized item â€“ token, fiat money, real estate, car, boat, motorcycle, bicycle, pen and even pencil.   Besides unique services BANKllect designed for their users there are many recognizable services many bank clients are used to use on a daily basis. Among them:  1. Â«DEPOSIT & CHECKING ACCOUNTSÂ». Opening and storing cryptocurrencies are realized by Â«Program of intellectual account (PIA)Â». In contrast to traditional deposit of traditional bank Â«program of intellectual accountÂ» presents a series of advantages. Among those advantages are, first, no need for a bulk of documents, second, dynamic interest that increases with deposit cryptocurrency regardless of deposit time term.  2. Â«CREDIT PROGRAMÂ». BANKllect will revolutionized global traditional bank system through our innovative client-oriented credit system, Â«System of loyal crypto lending (SLCL)Â». Â«System of loyal crypto lendingÂ» has many significant differences from traditional credit system. Among them: a. SLCL doesn't have such notion as client credit history. For example, as soon as borrower pays off his credit debt he will be clear for any other credits. b. SLCL let any user to be as a lender as a borrower. Amount of money which  BANKllect user has in his wallet doesn't make sense.  3. Â«INSURANCEÂ». BANKllect's team developed two insurance program, Â«Program of individual insurance (PII)Â» and Â«Program of collective insurance (PCI)Â». PII doesn't require any initial payment or monthly fee from its clients. PCI allow clients to: a. insure any object that can be tokenized. b. earn money on an insured object.  4. Â«PAYMENTS. MONEY ORDERSÂ». Designed technology Â«UnicountÂ» presents itself as an innovative program product that allow worldwide to: a. open client account. b. update client account. c. close client account. d. transfer any type of money. e. pay for any services. f. issue virtual payment cards. g. issue virtual savings cards.  5. Â«CAPITAL MANAGEMENTÂ». BANKllect's team developed Â«Forecast & Earn System (FES)Â» which is based on own forecast mathematical method Â«M-methodÂ». This method was tested on FX market and proved its high profitability.  6. Â«MONEY EXCHANGEÂ». Real time asynchronous system Â«ExcoinÂ» lets users convert any type of crypto money in one another momentarily. Â«ExcoinÂ» allow clients to: a. make a suspended money exchange. b. make a fix rate money exchange. c. make an automatic term-passed money exchange.  BANKllect presents a full package of bank services of any type for as individual as business.       The main purpose of many current bank solutions in crypto market is to build a traditional bank with a Â«fiat-to-tokenÂ» and Â«token-to-fiatÂ» functionality. Thus, those solutions modernize exclusively the traditional bank industry not the crypto one.  The main purpose of BANKllect is to develop a bank crypto market and further, integrate it with traditional one.   Fundamental difference of BANKllect from other solutions is that BANKllect first of all and mainly focuses on designing unique financial ecosystem inside the crypto market. Thus, BANKllect doesn't require a number of money and time as well for various central authoritative licenses.   In order to launch BANKllect as soon as possible the team of the project plans to start a procedure of Initial Coin (Token)  Offering (ICO). The name of BANKllect's token is Â«SphereÂ» (SPH). The name of the token was not accidentally chosen. BANKllect is going to function inside Decentralized Intellectual Advanced Network (DIAN), Â«IntellSphereÂ» (Intellectual Sphere).    Sphere token is independent of any other token or coin. It is reached by economical constituents that realized in Protocol of Participation (PoP).     In its turn, the procedure of Coin (Token) Offering will be realized by four phases.  Phase 1. Pre-ICO â€“ for launching first server cluster and user interface.  Phase 2. ICO â€“ for forming reserve fund and completion of development of such own technologies as Â«Smart TransactionsÂ», Â«UnicountÂ», Â«Forecast & EarnÂ», Â«M-methodÂ» and Â«ExcoinÂ».  Phase 3. SCO â€“ for traditional global IT market integration's purposes.  Phase 4. TCO â€“ for global launching Decentralized Intellectual Advanced Network, Â«IntellSphereÂ» for many other business spheres.   BOUNTY CAMPAIGN   BANKllect  is a decentralized peer-to-peer bank network.  Its main task is to create an unique and new generation bank ecosystem where each its participant will have a chance to choose a needed bank service and earn on it.    The key difference from currently presented crypto bank solutions (Bankera, Polybius, Datarius, Crypterium, Change, etc.) is that BANKllect proposes a series of bank-focused services in the way different from what the traditional banks do.  At the heart of BANKllect network is a participant. The participant is an individual or company with or without initial financial capital (fiat money, coins, tokens). Our own technology Â«Proof of Participation (PoP)Â» allows the participants to earn money by a level of its activity in BANKllect network.   Mining process is as simple as choosing one of the bank services and earn on it.   1 sphere = 0,01 US dollars   Bounty campaign starts:  29 March 2018 Bounty campaign ends:  29 June 2018   Total token pool of bounty campaign: 3 million US dollars  (300M spheres)    WE VALUE OUR USERS' TIME AND EVERY HIS OR HER SINGLE ACTIVITY DURING THE BOUNTY CAMPAIGN WILL BE PAID ON A FIXED PRICE.

First we already have so projects which are struggling to deliver none of them got succeed to do this"" but only in term of "" First"".  As for the projects that, in some cases, call themselves a BANK we shouldn't be considered as an analog because of existing two cardinal differences between us, at least. First, we are not looking for a traditional licenses (as a majority of bank-oriented solutions in crypto market do), second, what is more important, we are about to launch own high-performance platform-network (DIAN) using our two innovative technologies, ""Smart Transactions"" and ""Neural Chain"".       We are NOT a classical bank, we are a worldwide network that presents bank services inside crypto market.

There are two reasons of why this token value was taken.   First: Reserve Fund of BANKllect bank. It is impossible to properly function without any financial reserves for bank of any kind.      The Reserve Fund of BANKllect bank will allow us to realize many extremely important services such as insurance and token price stability.    Second: Possibility of additional future token offering (Second Coin Offering, Third Coin Offering) for attracting new investors and strategic partners.
