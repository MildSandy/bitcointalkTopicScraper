A strong team behind HetaChain ensures a robust infrastructure and bright future, both evident from the achievements of HetaChain within the first few months of our launch. ¬∑ Within one month of our debut, HetaChain and T-Hub officially signed a Memorandum of Understanding to implement HetaChain and T-Hub at Fuzhou High-Tech Park on October 10th 2018. The MOU will open doors for T-Hub and HetaChain to expand their wings in various communities and organization in China. ¬∑ On November 10th 2018, HetaChain officially raised $185,650,000 USD from their private sales. ¬∑ On December 10th 2018, HetaChain officially ended ICO campaign with 263,551,903 total HETA Tokens sold. ¬∑ Within the first few months of our launch, HetaChain garnered 15 early adopters and 9 industry verticals in 8 countries. Hetachain also launched a public demo of block explorer, and completed the development of Testnet and the side Chain development in the process.  What‚Äôs next? HetaChain is a promising project with a clear roadmap ahead. Through the end of this year, HetaChain will keep our complete focus on product development and expanding use cases for blockchain. In the first quarter of 2019, we will test the public launch, start a web portal for public release, focus on Dapp development for the Dapp store, develop smart contracts, and update their wallet for multi-token support. The Heta token will be listed on exchanges in February 2019. The funds will then be locked for 10 years to ensure security for the community. 1/40 of the total token amount will be distributed every quarter.
