But I do believe that is part of the plan. That being said there is no reward to staking this is just a means of verification and spam protection that will be required by actors using our platform.  As far as the Telegram group is concerned there is a bot that will ban anyone that does not verifiy through its verification prompt in the first 30 seconds of joining. You can message me at @theocrypt and I can unban you if you like.,False

We spent time working hard at moving all of our services from now.sh to Amazon Web Services. This is going to give everyone working and testing in our playground and demo environments a much faster and smoother experience. This will be crucial in allowing newcomers to get a better grasp of what we are building when they are checking out everything that we have to offer on our Github. You can see more on how this will work here.  We finished the Search API which is now deployable in both our demo and playground environments. This will allow those using it to search by location.  We renamed the WT Update API to WT Notification API to reduce confusion amongst users.  During the last few weeks, we have had a lot going on. We ran our own hackathon from 10/24 to 10/25 in Prague leading up to Devcon 4. We are still implementing the feedback and work done at the hackathon and you can expect to hear more about that in the near future.  Thank you for your continued support and patience!

Given the fact distribution in the travel industry is controlled by a handful of huge, entrenched players; how do you envisage bootstrapping your marketplace? As I see it, you have a classic chicken and egg problem (suppliers will only invest in getting their inventory into Winding Tree if there are consumers; consumer will only use Winding Tree backed B2C agents/sites if there is a comparable level of inventory choice available through it compared to existing channels). To complicate it further, due to the existing power dynamics in the industry, small and medium sized players will find it very hard to embrace WT (technically, and relationship/business contract wise) without risking being blacklisted by the industry gatekeepers.  2. For WT to work, travel suppliers (hotels, airlines) are going to need to make large investments in their IT platforms and back-office processes to integrate with WT. Travel buyers (agents, B2C sites etc.) are also going to need to invest in working with your blockchain (versus consuming a simple REST/SOAP API from aggregators/GDS providers as they do today). That's a lot of upfront dev (and legal/compliance) work and the travel industry is not known for its IT competency. In fact, most suppliers, aggregators and travel retailers today actually rely on tech provided from the very companies Winding Tree is trying to disrupt (Amadeus, Sabre, Travelport, Navitaire etc.). Where are all these participants going to find the talent and vision they need to build in-house integrations to the WT blockchain? I feel like all they will end up doing is moving the cost of distribution to the cost of integration (i.e. having to pay high priced consultants to create back-end software for them).  3. Your whitepaper mentions the need for massive improvements in the volume of transactions that can be processed (either on or off chain) in order to support the scale needed by the travel industry. With things like LN and plasma still years away, how comfortable are you that the necessary t/x volume support will come to WT in good enough time so as not to harm your scale up?  4. It seems to me that the main problem WT proposes to solve (removing the concentration of distribution from the hands of a few big gatekeepers) could be solved with industry adoption of standardized and open intercom protocols. The airline industry is already seeing this with NDC, for example. This way, the marketplace gets the same benefit of WT (i.e. lower barrier to entry for new startups; reduced overhead, complexity and waste through open standardization; easier/more affordable for less technically savvy suppliers to participate, reduced or eliminated need to consume inventory through platform intermediaries etc.) but without the need to completely re-invent distribution from the ground up and move everything in to a blockchain. Or put another way, why do you so hastily dismiss NDC as being a viable blueprint for the rest of the travel sector to learn from?  Apologies if these are hard questions but I am deeply interested in anything that removes the bondage of distribution as it is today from travel suppliers and yields a cheaper, faster, better experience for consumers. I'm just not 100% sold on the idea that simply moving distribution to a blockchain is the most expedient or realistic approach to ushering in such a revolution.",False

So people can book directly through the blockchain or  marketplaces can be built around winding tree which source inventory from the platform. We have been working on the on-boarding of partners - and Lufthansa was the first partnership we've been able to announce officially. There's a lot of interest on the supplier side - it's more the legal hassle that slows us down.  2) Correct - so with the suppliers we've talked to the aim is to initially push inventory to the blockchain live and in the long-term integrate winding tree at the source i.e. the Property Management System. That's another reason why we've been pushing to working with suppliers as we can work together with them to find ideal solutions for making integration as seamless as possible. Overall cost of integration is a fixed cost, distribution is a variable cost which occurs at every booking. If you consider the commission rates suppliers are paying it should be a very profitable investment.  3) For travel bookings you don't necessarily need instant verification. In fact it's very likely you'll be booking something that's a couple of days out or even months. But in the general scheme of things we are looking closely at all scaling projects and already talking to some to see what the best path for us could be on scalability.  4) NDC has been tried, everyone just integrated their own version of NDC. I think we need a radical change in distribution, and to enable everyone to get access to inventory and resell it blockchain is the ideal solution.

Point taken, although suppliers are not going to be incentivized to push their inventory in to a black hole. You will have to stimulate some adoption on the other side too. Lufthansa is a great partner but I'd argue they're also one of the easier ones to launch with. They have the budget and in house tech knowledge to experiment with this and they're at the vanguard of trying to push back on the level of control incumbent distributors have over the industry.   2) Correct - so with the suppliers we've talked to the aim is to initially push inventory to the blockchain live and in the long-term integrate winding tree at the source i.e. the Property Management System. That's another reason why we've been pushing to working with suppliers as we can work together with them to find ideal solutions for making integration as seamless as possible. Overall cost of integration is a fixed cost, distribution is a variable cost which occurs at every booking. If you consider the commission rates suppliers are paying it should be a very profitable investment.  Agree with this although the elephant in the room is that most suppliers don't have the cash flow (or bank credit) to invest in up front capex/fixed costs. It's much easier for them to bleed some profit via commissions as sales are generated rather than swallow a big integration cost (and the associated time and disruption that implies) before seeing returns.   3) For travel bookings you don't necessarily need instant verification. In fact it's very likely you'll be booking something that's a couple of days out or even months. But in the general scheme of things we are looking closely at all scaling projects and already talking to some to see what the best path for us could be on scalability.  There will be an almost immediate need to guarantee double bookings don't take place though (beyond whatever threshold an airline or hotel usually tries to aim for)? Also, things like booking alterations, cancellations, refunds etc.?   4) NDC has been tried, everyone just integrated their own version of NDC. I think we need a radical change in distribution, and to enable everyone to get access to inventory and resell it blockchain is the ideal solution. We also believe in the benefits of decentralized networks.  There are small implementation quirks and differences but these are not huge (nothing an overlay library doesn't easily solve) and are projected to reduce over time as the industry agrees on best practices.",False

It's just that what you are trying to solve is a very hard problem: technically, economically and politically. I've spent a lot of time myself thinking about the underlying incentives that have caused today's mess in distribution and how that could be fixed.  I haven't got all the answers but I'm convinced it starts with making technology and intercom easier and cheaper for travel suppliers and retailers. For me this means open, easily implemented standards that have wide industry adoption (and maybe even replacing commercial PSS/CRS systems with better open source alternatives). I'm not sure increasing complexity with a blockchain solution necessarily changes much (other than unnecessarily increasing friction).  In the case of Lufthansa, for example, new entrants and startups can already get direct API access to their inventory (https://developer.lufthansa.com) without needing to learn about tokens and blockchains. Surely that's a good thing and the industry (airlines and hotels) needs more of it?",False

Just running on a busy schedule  We already have companies lined up who want to source inventory from winding tree and resell it! Also by making it easy for developers to integrate with the platform anyone could resell a hotel room i.e. in a hotel review etc. I think ways of monetizing distribution and distribution reach will change when the inventory is just there - easy to integrate and resell. But coming back to your point we will announce some projects building on the reseller site before our TGE!  I don't think the setup cost is that high. Initially we can be used as a seperate channel and if WT saves the suppliers enough and the math works then it'll make sense for them to integrate WT right into their CRS.  About your comment on overbooking - we don't have a large order book for hotel reservations. It's a spontaneous purchase and today's system run way behind anyway. Also the broadcasting of the transaction can already temporarily remove the room or seat from the suppliers inventory - without having to wait for x confirmations. If it doesn't confirm then it can be released again after 2-3 blocks 50 seconds or so currently on Eth.  We do believe a standard is necessary - that's why we will be working closely with suppliers to get a uniform standard.,False

I've been looking at WT mainly from an airline perspective since that's where I'm a bit more familiar. I think for hotels you'll have a much easier time getting suppliers and resellers to use the platform. The hotel business is bigger, a lot more fragmented, generally subject to higher rent seeking margins from gatekeepers, enjoys less regulation (in terms of who the end contract is with, delay compensation etc.) and is just a better ""place"" for this sort of experiment to find its feet (I think).   I don't think the setup cost is that high. Initially we can be used as a separate channel and if WT saves the suppliers enough and the math works then it'll make sense for them to integrate WT right into their CRS.  Sounds like a very sensible approach. Doubly so if you can make it super easy for CRS developers to add WT as a channel to push to (through good docs, standardization and maybe paid for training run by the WT foundation). Another reason why I think WT will work better for hotels than airlines is that hotels have more choices when it comes to CRS (most airlines are exclusively using systems provided by the companies WT is designed to disrupt - outside of doing it ad-hoc and then manually trying to reconcile bookings with their existing system - it isn't easy for most of them to just 'add' another channel to push to).   About your comment on overbooking - we don't have a large order book for hotel reservations. It's a spontaneous purchase and today's system run way behind anyway. Also the broadcasting of the transaction can already temporarily remove the room or seat from the suppliers inventory - without having to wait for x confirmations. If it doesn't confirm then it can be released again after 2-3 blocks 50 seconds or so currently on Eth.  Temporarily removing inventory and releasing back if the t/x isn't confirmed makes sense (didn't think of this!) - definitely removes some immediate scaling pressure.  So, really appreciate you taking the time to thoughtfully reply  I think you're going to have a hard time with airlines (especially tier 2 ones) but for hotels WT looks interesting (and anything that can help change how distribution is done in the travel industry is definitely worth trying!).  Good luck.   Edit: You guys should maybe consider talking to Triptease and seeing if they'd be an early adopter/brand champion (seems WT should be aligned with their mission).",False

Typical fees for a hotel booking made through an OTA range from 10% (for large branded hotels) up to 25% (for individual hotels) of the total booking amount. The Winding Tree blockchain will be a decentralized entity so it can't and won't take any fees from travel suppliers. The only fee liable during a booking is the gas needed to execute the contract and register the booking on the blockchain.  As Winding Tree is primarily a B2B blockchain, the businesses selling the rooms to the customer can have incentives to do so both for profit as well as not for profit:  Case 1 - Not for profit: An event organizer has a deal with the hotel it is organizing the event at and resells the hotels inventory directly on its own website.  Case 2 - Booking Fee: Winding Tree being decentralized will offer equal distribution to all inventory, companies may take their time to offer customers a curated selection of hotels and flights and maybe even bundle these together with other services and charge the customer a booking fee for it.  Case 3 - Smart Commission: Hotels and Airlines can set a smart commission which will be given to businesses who sell inventory for the hotel. A default smart commission is available for anyone to resell, suppliers will also be able to set custom commissions for specific vendors.  Case 4 - Open Source Travel Agent: Similarly to OpenBazaar and Duo Search - search engines for travel inventory can be built. . I hope that answers your question.",False
