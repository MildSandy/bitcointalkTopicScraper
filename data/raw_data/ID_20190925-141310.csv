By leveraging blockchain and distributed storage technologies, Everest empowers banks, governments, NGOs, hospitals, businesses and other institutions to transparently and effectively exchange value with those hard to reach users, especially the 5 billion users without smartphones, all while giving users the most control and privacy in the market.  It does sound quite interesting - all these things you are trying to achieve, but how will you approach people who do not use updated technology?  you mean people who do not use smartphones? maybe a desktop app would be ok for them.  Collect documents, biometrically sign contracts to serve billions of users with or without device.  But if they do not have the device how can you enable the collection? For collection of data the individual does not have to own a device himself. An agent of the organisation will in this scenario connect the person with the agent DApp. The individual just needs to be physically present.",False
