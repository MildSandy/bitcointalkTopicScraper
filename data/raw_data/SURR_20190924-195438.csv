You need SURR to pay for our car theft insurance. Buying them during the presale & the ICO is a bargain, due to the bonuses. This is one of the advantages for investors. The other one is a guaranteed buyback of SURR tokens for the first 300 ETH deposited with a 25% revenue. It will happen on the lasy day of ICO.  The other option for SURR tokenholders is to exchange them for SRS security tokens. These will be issued after the ICO. Each SRS represents a search module. SRS token owners will receive payments as long as SurruS is live and profitable.  1 ETH = 5000 SURR 1 SRS = 65 000 SURR = 13 ETH  You can buy less that 1 SRS, e.g. if you own 10 000 SURR, you can get 0,15 SRS.

In this case a vehicle is removed either by breaking and entry, followed by hotwiring or other methods to start the engine, or else towing.  2Ô∏è‚É£ Carjacking ‚Äì taking of a vehicle from its owner by force, or threat of force. In this case a driver is forced from the vehicle while the carjacker drives it away.  3Ô∏è‚É£ Opportunistic theft. In this case a car is removed with a key that was stolen from the car owner. This type also includes cases when an owner leaves a car with a running engine and key in the ignition unattended ‚Äì e.g. at a gas station or when shopping.  ‚ö†Ô∏è In Russia and in many other countries you can‚Äôt obtain an insurance payment in case the car was stolen with a key or papers inside, all the more so ‚Äì with both. And if you were carjacked or fell victim to opportunistic theft, chances are your car was taken away with keys inside. No payment from the insurance company in this case, no matter how expensive your insurance policy was.  üëç Good news: SurruS helps to find cars in all 3 cases, and if we fail to find a car, we pay 100% of its market value ‚Äì even if it was taken with a key and papers inside.

Car thieves claim that they can steal literally any car, only the time of breaking in and hotwiring may vary.  Anti-theft devices may fail to protect your car, and car theft insurance payment often comes out to be insufficient to cover your expenses when buying a new car. So it‚Äôs better to prevent your car from stealing, and here are 6 pieces of advice upon the matter.  ‚úîÔ∏è Always cut the engine and lock the doors when leaving a car. ‚úîÔ∏è Don‚Äôt keep an extra key and car registration papers inside the car. ‚úîÔ∏è When inside, always enable door lock function, if you have one. ‚úîÔ∏è Pay attention to unusual situations: a false car alarm or a trouble with opening a car remotely. ‚úîÔ∏è Ask a friend to look after your car and move it from time to time, if you leave the city for a week or more. ‚úîÔ∏è Attend only well-known car service centers.  Keep in mind that all these tricks only lower the chances of your car being stolen. The best option to protect yourself is a SurruS car insurance. We are capable of finding the most of stolen cars. And for those cars we failed to find we pay the owner 100% of a vehicle‚Äôs market value. *** SurruS pre-sale is going full steam, a 25% revenue is guaranteed for the first 300 ETH.

The SurruS project does not exist only on paper. For several years we have been developing and testing our system so to get a ready-made working model.

The project has already been launched in test mode in Novosibirsk. In 2017 Surrus equipment was installed on 50 machines. One car was stolen. Searches were conducted by means of portable search modules and the quadcopter. The car was found and returned to the owner.  In addition, the team of SurruS is always ready to prove the effectiveness of our search modules and to come anywhere in the world for a demonstration.  To scale the project around the world Surrus conducts its own ICO. On the 1 of April started the Pre-Sale which will last until the 31 of may. Thanks to this everyone will be able to become a part of a large project of SurruS by purchasing SURR tokens.

I'd only add that the cost MAY be 3-4 times cheaper, because it depends on the car brand and model.

Today in the USA, Europe and Russia there are about 703 million cars, and every year this figure increases by 30 million units. That is, we have at least 4 parties, each pursues its own interests:  1. Car owners-strive to protect cars from theft or get a guaranteed insurance benefit. 2. Car manufacturers who supply cars with anti-theft systems in order to increase sales, but lag behind modern technology in many respects. 3. Manufacturers of anti-theft systems-complicate the mechanisms of their devices, but are unable to surpass the advanced technology hijackers. 4. Insurance companies-minimize insurance risks, seeking to increase profits from insurance premiums.  Today, the market needs an infrastructure solution that can solve the problem of theft once and for all. And that solution is our project SurruS! Think yourself: car owners get an innovative system to protect their vehicles. Transmitter is installed on a car, which in case of theft, allows you to detect the car and quickly find it. And car manufacturers who cooperate with the brand - have the opportunity to disappear forever from the ratings of the most stolen cars. In turn, insurance companies will be able to minimize insurance risks.

During the pre-sale and the ICO you can purchase SURR tokens. 1 ETH = 5000 SURR. SURR is a utility token, so tokenholders don't receive any benefits or payouts just because they hold SURR tokens. But they can pay with their tokens for a car insurance. They can also sell them on exchanges. And for the first 300 ETH the company offers a buyback with 90% ROI on the last day of ICO.  And the best thing is that they can trade SRS tokens for theis SURRs after the ICO. 1 SRS = 65 000 SURR. SRS is a security token, and SRS tokenholders will receive payouts from the company's revenue. 10% of insurance payments and 20% of monthly payments will be transferred to a fund for rewarding SRS tokenholders.

Today, there are more than 1 billion cars in the world and every owner of a vehicle is not insured against theft. Of course, we're not talking about your car being stolen tomorrow. However, there is such a possibility, and it is great. Insurance companies today offer compensation in case of theft of a car, but none of them promises you to return it. Or you can put an anti ‚Äì theft system that is designed to protect a car, but it can't guarantee its 100% protectiom. Both of these options are expensive and not effective. What do we offer? A unique project in the field of blockchain insurance SurruS! Innovative solution in the insurance industry which is based on blockchain technology. Through the use of this technology we have been able to create a system that allows for the effective search and return of a stolen car and ensure payment of compensation in case of failure. We have already developed special search modules and automotive equipment, set up their production, created and patented software, and set up a search network.   How does SurruS system work in practice?   A car is equipped with special devices that do not give any signals until they fall into the range of the search module (about 700 meters in the open area). This means that  hijackers will not be able to detect and remove such a device, and the search engine will easily detect your car in its range and transmit information about its location. Multiple modules in risk areas ensure that the stolen vehicle is within the range of at least several of them. If a car is stolen, our system immediately receives a notification and then activates the search algorithm that calculates the probable location of the car.   The search will be supervised by a self-learning neural network, improved depending on the behavior of the hijackers in a particular region, so the probability of non-return of the machine will decrease!   And if for some reason we can not find a vehicle, an owner is guaranteed to receive 100% of its market value.

Vladimir's amazing story is a must-read for anyone who does not believe that in Russia it is possible to do big business honestly, without nepotism and bribes. As well as for those who have failed and given up. Vladimir's history can inspire even the most hardened skeptics!  A four-year student creates a business with a turnover of $ 35 million a year  The first business Vladimir Kosenko opened in 1994 as a fourth-year student of the faculty of engineering and economics, SSTU (then ‚Äì NIVIT) in Novosibirsk. Together with friends he created a close corporation""Assol"" (INN 5407156434), a company producing alcoholic beverages. The company's turnover in the Novosibirsk region alone was about $35 million a year.  In 1997 Vladimir decided to leave the business for the sale of alcohol and established closed corporation ""Karachinskaya"" (INN 5404147135). He acquired a plant for the production of soft drinks Vimerkati (Italy) with a capacity of 5,700 bottles per hour. On the basis of the empty warehouse a whole complex was built from scratch, assembled and launched production under the brand ""Marka"". Vladimir was personally involved in the company's strategy, product, marketing, finance and budget.  A year after the launch the production was awarded the quality mark of an independent group of Vladimir Dovgan. The costs of organizing production, launch and promotion were $3 million and it was reimbursed for 19 months, although it was in the midst of crisis of 1998.  Construction, entertainment industry, agriculture ‚Äì new business projects  In 1997 Vladimir Kosenko together with partners established a production and building society ""Youth housing initiative"" (INN 5406140738). The cooperative acted as the customer of construction of a 10-storey residential building at Novosibirsk, Ermak str., 4.  Then, in 1997 Vladimir and his partners established a closed corporation ""Sekstet"" (INN 5407156434) and opened a billiard club with an area of about 1000 m2. Investments amounted to $ 150 thousand, the business paid off and came out on profitability in 7 months.  In 2001 Vladimir launched a project on agriculture OOO ""Sibagrocom"" (INN 5406211611), which was successfully operated until 2012.  From the factory - bankrupt to profitable production  In 2002 on a public auction he bought the property of the plant OAO ""Sibteploizolyaziya"". At that time it was unprofitable production at the stage of bankruptcy with a staff of 270 people. Vladimir invested $2 million in the enterprise and took over the management of the company. After 8 months the plant reached its planned profitability, and 20 months from later Vladimir was able to recoup his investment.  In 2002 Vladimir with partners have established OOO ""Soft Papery Trade"" (INN 5405188705). The company is engaged in deliveries of household chemicals, cleaners and cleaning equipment, is an official distributor of brands Ecolab, Tork, Mola, Paclan and Vileda in Western Siberia.  From 2002 to 2006 Vladimir was a part of shareholders of closed corporation ""Investment Construction Corporation ""Green"" (INN 5405178658). The corporation's portfolio includes a business center ""Novograd"", mall ""Europe"", ""Business center"" and residential complex ""Krasnaya Gorka"".   The story of one theft: how the stolen Lexus launched a new business  In 2007 Vladimir had his favorite Lexus-GX-470 stolen. Anti-theft systems did not help and the insurance company took advantage of the loophole in the contract and refused to pay. Then Vladimir understood that in the market there was a niche for more perfect product allowing to protect interests of car owners. He appealed to the scientists of Novosibirsk Akademgorodok and set the task to develop a reliable system for finding stolen cars.  Thus was born the project ""AutoPoisk"". Vladimir became a business angel and took over the management of the project. In 2009 after successful defence of a complex ""AutoPoisk"" to the leadership of GUVD in the Novosibirsk region, he established and headed the independent noncommercial organization ""Interregional Union of Protection of Motorists of Siberia"" ‚Äì ANO ""MSZAS"" ( INN 5406546128). The organization was engaged in the promotion of the project "" PBDD ""(""Road Safety Prevention""), which included two areas:  monitoring the cycle of drivers on the route;  the project ""AutoPoisk"" ‚Äì a mobile network to search for a stolen vehicle.   In 2010 the PBDD system entered the Federal target program and received the gold medal of the exhibition ""AVTOSIB 2010"". In 2011 the system was adapted to international safety standards and again won the gold medal of ""AVTOSIB 2011"".  In 2012 ANO ""MSzAS"" signed the tripartite agreement with the government of the Novosibirsk region and the Korean company ""KT Corporation"" on the joint development of systems of transport security. In the same year Vladimir became a member of the Public Council under the Ministry of transport and in 2015 became one of the founders of the Novosibirsk city public movement ""Law and Order of Siberia"" (INN 5406598006).  25 years of experience in business + blockchain technology = SurruS project  In 2017 the development of technologies based on blockchain and artificial intelligence made it possible to scale ""AutoPoisk"" system in several cities of Russia and abroad. Vladimir Kosenko founded SurruS project which combined: -ready and proven solution for the search of stolen car; -the ecosystem of blockchain-theft insurance with a guarantee of return of the car or 100% of its value; -the mechanism of searching for a car by hundreds of volunteers with guaranteed remuneration.  In the summer of 2018 the project goes to ICO and aims to raise investments in the amount of 80 000 ETN. This will allow launching the project in 8 cities of Russia, Great Britain, France and Italy.  Vladimir Kosenko went from a struggling entrepreneur to a successful businessman and a business angel. He was not broken by ""dashing nineties"" or two crises. In any problem Vladimir is able to see opportunity. The plant-bankrupt? We will bring to profitability in less than 2 years. Stolen car? We will create a solution for guaranteed return of the car or its full cost. Probably, only with this approach you can do business!   https://surrus.io/   https://d.radikal.ru/d42/1804/5b/18add7b204fc.jpg",True

Thanks for asking. In fact, many people wonder, why would the police cooperate with SurruS. Well, both the police and SurruS will benefit from cooperation, since the company ensures the return of a vehicle to its client, while the police will improve its clearance rate without putting in any extra effort.  Before the police involvement, SurruS search team determines the exact location of the vehicle. Only at this point the police involvement is required to go the the specified address to capture the perpetrators and retrieve the vehicle, thus turning a difficult case with a low chance of success into an easy and guaranteed accomplishment.  To further increase the speed of the process, SurruS negotiates with the heads of departments in advance and decide the exact course of action, as well as the number of responsible people. Therefore, when needed, SurruS doesn‚Äôt just call ""911"" (or ""112"" in Russia) but directly contacts the people who know how to act. The cooperation between the police and our search teams allows to return stolen vehicles to their owners efficiently.",True

We offer a 25% bonus till May, 31, a 15% bonus till June, 8, a 10% bonus till June, 23, and 5% bonus - till July, 7.  Second, the ICO investors will be the first ones to get access to SRS tokensale. So even if you buy SURR after July,7, without any bonuses, you still have a leg-up. You'll be among the first ones to buy SRS tokens and start receiving payouts.  Third, no matter when you buy SURR during the ICO, today or July, 31 - you can spend your SURR tokens on the car insurance as soon as it will be available in your city. Moreover, you can sell your SURR tokens on exchanges (SURR will be listed in a month after the ICO is over).  So it makes sense to buy SURR at any ICO stage - but of course, the sooner the better)",True

The idea of creating a project SurruS appeared when one of the founders of the project had his car stolen! It was then that he was personally convinced of the ineffectiveness of existing measures to prevent theft and compensation for damage ‚Äì the anti-theft system was unable to protect the car from intruders, and the insurance company refused to pay for the insured event, taking advantage of the loophole in the contract.  The study of all the existing proposals on the market has showed that there is no tool that can guarantee the protection of the car from theft or compensate for damage in the amount of 100% of the market value of the car. This situation on the market marked the beginning of a long way of development and research aimed at creating a perfect vehicle protection system. 11 years of operation and 10 million us dollars of investment allowed to develop a concept that would have been impossible a few years ago due to the high cost of equipment, imperfection of technologies and the lack of a decentralized system of data exchange with a high degree of encryption. Today, thanks to the breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence, the emergence of blockchain technology and reducing the cost of components, the launch of this concept on an international scale has finally become possible!

Because the main purpose of each insurance company ‚Äì is to minimize their costs in case of an insured event. How do insurance companies achieve their goals? They distribute risks and responsibilities among all participants of insurance‚Ä¶ The tariffs of insurance companies are designed in such a way that the payments for insurance cases are covered by the amount of insurance premiums. In other words, the expenses of the company, which it bears upon the occurrence of an insured event, are covered by those owners of cars, whose insured event has not occurred. This is the reason for the high cost of the insurance policy.  Despite the fact that car insurance only from theft exists, it is impossible to insure the car against theft‚Äì such a policy would cost the owner almost as much as the pay for a packet insurance from car theft + damages. The insurers require the installation on the vehicle of anti-theft system and compliance with certain conditions to receive payments upon occurrence of the insured event. And if all the same happens misfortune and the car will be stolen-insurers will try to minimize the amount of payment.  Why is SurruS better? The main and only purpose of the project SurruS is that in case of theft to return to an owner his car! Specially in order to achieve this goal we have developed our own search algorithm and our own search network. And thanks to the use of blockchain technology in the project, every owner whose car could not be returned, will be able to get 100% of its market value!

And this is quite logical, because the hijacking of a certain model or brand of the car has a negative impact on the level of its sales. To ensure that their cars are stolen as rarely as possible, automakers equip their cars with standard anti-theft systems, which in practice is ineffective and unable to solve the problem of theft. Whatever perfect anti-theft system a manufacturer has put on his car,  in any case it will be a basic level system, which is very quickly hacked by professional hijackers.  Today neither budget cars nor  premium ones can be insured from theft. A solution to this problem can't be found by garage storage or paid parking ‚Äì very often the guards enter into a conspiracy with the attackers. In most cases, the theft of a car means that it is lost to the owner forever ‚Äì the level of detection of theft is extremely low, and even if the car is found, its state is often no longer subject to recovery.  Taxis are also suffering from the problem of theft, as well as leasing companies, car rental companies, car-sharing services, urban public transport, etc.  Today, the market of cars needs a real technological breakthrough, which SurruS project promises to implement.

Monthly payments are there to ensure that the vehicle remains on the search network. The amount of monthly payments will vary from $20 to $40 in SURS tokens, depending on the city and country.  There are no extra expenses.  These prices allow the company to fully fulfill its responsibilities to its clients, namely to develop search modules, make and install devices in vehicles, paying employees, amortization and marketing expenses, as well as insurance payments and taxes.  Supposedly, the first customers are going to be among the owners of premium cars, which are among the most stolen ones, since for them the SurruS solution is the most advantageous. However, anyone can become SurruS customer, regardless of the price, model and age of their vehicle.",True

First, the insurance will cost you money, so when it comes to a dog, you have to decide if it is worth it. Second, you cannot hide the device - you can only buckle it to the dog's collar. And if someone takes it off - occasionally or on purpose - then we'll not be able to track your pet any more.  Maybe if we get more requests like that, we'll run a research and construct a tracking device for smaller objects - bikes, packages, gadgets - or even pets.  But in fact the need for SurruS system in tracking stolen cars is mostly caused by the problem of signal muffling. Thieves use mufflers to muffle GPS/GSM signal. And we solve this problem in our system. But when it comes to pets, gadgets and stuff like that - who on Earth would use mufflers?

At the same time, this system is quite expensive and is able, together with insurance, to cost the owner of the car 15% of the cost of the car per year.  Why will devices from the company SurruS work more effectively than any anti-theft system?  Because our devices give a signal only when they fall within the range of the search module.

This car had a steam engine and was designed to move artillery guns. The first car with an internal combustion engine appeared much later-in 1885. Its creator was Karl Benz, who in 1888  started a serial production of cars.  With the advent of cars it became much more comfortable to live-the distance ceased to be a problem. However, there was another problem ‚Äì the protection of the vehicle from intruders? This problem hasn't been solved so far.  Over the past 130 years numerous insurance companies have been established, which guarantee to minimize the loss of the owner of the car in case of theft. Also, there is a variety of anti-theft systems that seek to reduce the probability of theft. However, none of these tools can guarantee the owner that his car won't be stolen and even if they can ‚Äì they will surely return it. So until now the protection of the vehicle from theft has remained open.

We also have an option of volunteer searching: people who have a SurruS app on their devices, can go and search for the car. If a volunteer locates the car before our search squad does, he gets a reward.

Investments into the development and launch of the system have exceeded $10 million.Today, thanks to the blockchain technology, a revolutionary breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence, and cheaper component parts, the international launch of the project has become possible.  We invite everybody to join us in creating the SurruS system, earn money investing into a new market, and solve the age-old problem of car thefts once and for all.   BLOCKCHAIN-BASED INSURANCE  The existence of a decentralized digital ledger allows us to change the way information is processed:     SURR TOKEN:      SRS TOKEN  A security token, SRS is equivalent in price to one search module in the SurruS infrastructure. SRS token issue will take place in December 2018. The priority right to buy SRS tokens will be granted to SURR token holders. SRS token holder will be receiving monthly payouts, pegged to the company‚Äôs revenue.  In December 2018 SRS tokens will be issued according to the number of search modules in the system (1 SRS = 1 module). Token holders will be able to exchange their SURR for SRS at the rate of 1 SRS = 65000 SURR. SRS holders will start receiving monthly payouts, pegged to the company‚Äôs revenue.  FEATURE DEMO  All the components of the system are already developed, manufactured and ready for use. Therefore, at the request of stakeholders, the SurruS company conducts a demonstration of the system anywhere in the world.  How it works:       FOR WHOM ARE WE USEFUL?

Among the solutions to this issue he has a choice between an anti-theft alarm system, a solid insurance plan or a guarded parking complex. However, did you know that:  √ò Anti-theft systems can only protect your car from amateur thieves. Professionals can steal absolutely any vehicle, the only issue is time and tools in his disposal.  √ò A good insurance package is expensive and doesn‚Äôt solve all problems. Besides, an insurance contract contains special conditions, obliging the car owner to install a satellite anti-theft system, as well as liability disclaimers that let the insurance company shed all responsibility on an insurance claim (very often the insurance claim payment is rejected if the car was stolen with the documents inside). Even if the payment is made, it will never match the market value of the car.  √ò When it comes to guarded parking lots, they‚Äôre not exactly convenient as they‚Äôre often further from home than the owner would feel comfortable with, besides, having a gate or a fence around the car does not guarantee it won‚Äôt be stolen.

All participants of the ecosystem of SurruS can see the alleged location of the missing car and join the search of a car together with our technicians. The user, who will be the first to detect the stolen car, will receive a reward, and the found car will be returned to its rightful owner. If for some reason we are unable to find the vehicle, its owner is guaranteed to receive 100% of its market value.  SurruS project enters the market in the second quarter of 2018. Everyone who wants to take part in it can invest in it by purchasing SURR tokens within the ICO .

Imagine that you have bought a brand new car and want to protect it from theft... What will you do?   Actually a lot of options: you can park your car inly in protected parks, equip it with the most modern alarm or arrange for an insurance policy with protection from theft... that is, all currently existing tools will allow you or try to prevent theft of the car, or to receive compensation in case if iron horse is still run off in an unknown direction... But what about search? Why until recently no one has thought about the fact that the stolen car can be found? Why there were  no solutions in this area, and the search itself was simply delegated to law enforcement? After all, even if you have a satellite alarm system that allows you to call a patrol in case of emergency, it is important to understand that the arrived response team will try to protect you and your property, but won't look for a car in case of theft‚Ä¶   And who will do that? We will! Implementing the project SurruS, we have invented a unique way to search for stolen cars, developing owr own search network! Now we will tell more‚Ä¶   So, we have already developed special search modules and automotive equipment, established its production, created and patented software, as well as set up a search network. Thanks to owr own network and unique search algorithm, SurruS can quickly find stolen cars and guarantee peace of mind to car owners. How does it work?   Your car is equipped with special devices that doesn't give any signals until they fall into the range of the search module (about 700 meters in the open area). This means that the hijackers will not be able to detect and remove such a device, and the search engine will easily detect your car in its range and transmit information about its location. The location of the numerous modules in the risk areas ensures that the hijacked car will fall into the range of at least a few of them. The first signal will be enough to narrow the search area.  After the approximate location of the vehicle is found, a search group travels to the specified square, which, using manual and search modules and quadrocopters, scans the terrain on the ground from the air and determines the exact coordinates of the machine. At this point the crew is already accompanied by police officers. And then-a matter of technology, the car is removed and returned to the owner!  It is interesting that our platform allows all its users to participate in the search for the missing car . In the mobile application they receive a notification about the beginning of the search operation and can independently travel to the area where the last signal has come from. The user, who will be able to find the car receives a reward.  The search will be supervised by a self-learning neural network, which is improved depending on the behavior of hijackers in a particular region, so that the probability of non-return of the machine will decrease over time!  Sounds impressive? Already want to protect your car with the technology described above? Soon it will be possible! Till then, read more about SurruS on our website https://surrus.io",True

According to Forbes magazine, the capitalization of the global insurance industry reaches 7.3 trillion US dollars! This is one of the most steadily growing segments of the market, which is an advantage for its participants. However, it has its disadvantages, the main of which is a slow reaction to technological innovations.  The banking sector has been actively using blockchain technology in its work for a long period of time. The insurance segment is just getting to know it. Meanwhile, its integration into the insurance business can solve many problems and offer interesting products to the clients of insurance companies.  Our SurruS project is a comprehensive and innovative solution. Its components are blockchain insurance against theft of the car with a guarantee of instant return of 100% of its market value, as well as a decentralized system of search and return of the stolen car. We have already written about it in one of the previous posts: https://medium.com/@SurruS_ICO/how-does-surrus-work-3a48a75ba3aa  The ecosystem of SurruS project is not just a new insurance system, it is a set of mechanisms and algorithms, including: * a special device inside the car which sends the signal on modules; * search engines placed in key points of the city; * search teams traveling to look for a missing car; * smart contract-based system for accepting payments and payments for insured events.  All this allows to quickly and efficiently find and return stolen cars and to guarantee payment of 100% of the market value to their owners in case of failure of searches.
