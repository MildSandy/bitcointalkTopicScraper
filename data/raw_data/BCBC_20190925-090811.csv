With our project we want to offer breweries a way to fight for their market share with the pinnacle of modern technology. Participating breweries can offer their consumers a beer, which not only tastes great, but enables the consumer to mine a cryptocurrency with it.  To help our Beercoin cryptocurrency taking off, we provide an interface to users to not only donate, but also use Beercoins to buy more beer.
