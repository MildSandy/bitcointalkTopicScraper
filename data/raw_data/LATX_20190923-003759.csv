I can open task in a new window, then I need to return and scroll-scroll to find needed task Also adding categories (filters) might be good idea, especially when there will be more tasks and users  2) Why Bond/Guaranty is needed? Firstly it was not so understandable for me, why is it needed, especially on small tasks (such as like facebook page, follow on Twitter) You either do this small task and get paid or don't do it and you are not paid. While on big tasks this might be good idea, for smaller tasks I think it's not necessary. Also I would advise to remove this in the beginning, so more users will register  3) Tasks which i already did appear again  Also it seems withdrawals are not working, but may be that's because it's alpha version.

Only 60 mil left to reach the target of 180 mil.  That is absolutely fantastic!  this one is the next 'big thing'  To top it off, they have a 5% commission referral in effect, so you sign up, you are given a link to give to others, and if they sign up using your link, you collect 5% commission from LATIUM on whatever they spend to buy their coin.  So, feel free to click here to get started:  https://latium.org/welcome/mfchiro  Let's say you buy $100 of tokens (approx 1,250 LATX at .08 per coin).  Latium then sends me $5.00 in token (or 40 LATX coin), for your spending $100.    Once you are signed up, you have your link to pass on to others and start earning.  It's a win-win.  By the way, I've earned 800+ tokens this way so far, so it's doable.   so a friendly click on that welcome link,  https://latium.org/welcome/mfchiro then you can follow up and email me if you have more questions or would like to dialogue further on why this is such a great venture, the best one out there right now (in my opinion).  wishing you all success,",False

Something also to consider, and this is a good thing, right now they want to grow WIDE, get as many tokens out there as they can, since they are not really diluting the token value, (0.25 is already pretty much the lowest baseline).  To accomplish the goals of their business plan, latium needs a lot of coin to be circulating, and then the coin will increase in value, more likely at a slower, stable, conservative rate, from a much wider base.    So, as bonuses would dilute the value of the token, it's best to issue the bonus now while the token is priced so low.  That's just my speculation...",False

Their goal is 180 mil tokens, which will make them 9x bigger than bitcoin, because they project needing more tokens to circulate in the latium ecosystem they are building.  At ~0.25 a coin, this is a steal, would recommend everyone buy in even with as little as $100 USD.    If you would have spent $100 in 2010 on bitcoin, and just sat on it, you would have $4.5 million today.  With Latium, the risk is there, sure, that's why it's called 'venture capital', but with the potential, you HAVE to get in.    Don't forget, crazy as he is, they interviewed McAfee, and he said, ""I don't lose a bet.""    One more thing, you can also EARN coins right now at Latium.

But #1 thing to do for any due diligence is the white whitepaper, then research owners/advisors. LinkedIn profiles. Articles (McAfee's smack down on Dimon is what introduced me to Latium - I'm thrilled I got in when I did).  The business model and technology is what got me to invest. Besides tokenization, the one:many feature is one of the key technical/features differentiators then current task-driven websites and the use cases for Latium are far superior to those same current sites.

The ability to do in-person tasks is one of our favorite features of the platform. Pretty much any type of in-person task can be run through the platform. To use construction as an example, you could hire as many people as your budget allows to build something for you. You will be able to have them either scan a QR code at the beginning and end of the task, or require them to be in a certain GPS range for a certain time. The same goes for the entertainment industry. If you want 10,000 people to show up for a concert, you can put that task out there, accept applicants, and run either the QR code or GPS examples in order to verify they were there.  You will also have the option either to automatically release payment or determine individually whether or not the task doers completed the task to your standards.",False

Latium’s goal is to improve the world by making a transparent decentralized platform to help harness the world’s labor force, while increasing labor equality and opportunity for those who may not have the ability or opportunity to find work. By creating a digital platform that allows for real world actions to be taken and digital reward given Latium helps bridge the gap between the digital and physical world. You can view more at https://latium.org/.  The Latium ecosystem will consist of many components, but the major roles are played by task doers and task makers. Task makers consist of anyone (Persons, Companies, Organizations, Governments, etc) with a desire to have an action completed and willing to pay a reward to whomever is willing to complete the required task (task doer).  Task doers consist of anyone (Persons, Companies, Organizations, Governments, etc) willing to complete a task for a reward.  In its most basic form Latium is a platform to exchange effort for reward or vice versa. There are many basic examples (Freelancer, Fiver, Upwork, etc.) but all of these examples are very limited in scope and do not facilitate the much broader needs of a global labor market. The Latium platform will allow users around the globe to create tasks of any size, from getting more twitter followers to providing clean water to a Sub-Saharan African community. No task is too big or too small for Latium.  All payments within the Latium Platform will be made using the LATX ERC20 token. This is truly a token with a purpose.    Latium will be hosting a token sale for the new LATX ERC20 token, which will be the only form of payment within the platform. You can purchase the LATX token using ETH.   Token Symbol: LATX   Overview of Token Structure Token Sale: 180,000,000 LATX (60% of total supply) tokens available during all phases of the token sale. Any tokens not sold during this period will be burned.  Platform Adoption Incentives:60,000,000 LATX (20% of total supply) will be used for promotion once the Latium platform is in production. These tokens will provide incentives to sign up and use the Latium platform during the ramp up of production. New users will be allocated a certain amount of tokens to use within the Latium Ecosystem (cannot be withdrawn but can be spent on task creation). These 60 million tokens will be held in a lockup contract and released, according to the schedule below, for use in the system. After release, these funds will be held in a single contract. The only function of this contract will be to release tokens to platform users and will be made available for public inspection prior to the first token release in order to ensure transparency. The below schedule is the maximum that can be withdrawn on a given date. The amount of the withdrawal will be determined at the time of release up to the maximum allowed by the lockup contract. The amount withdrawn will be solely up to the management team and based on project requirements at the time of release. This contract has been made available on Github for public review and etherscan.io  15 million LATX Tokens released - January 31st, 2018 15 million LATX Tokens released - April 30th, 2018 15 million LATX Tokens released - July 31st, 2018 15 million LATX Tokens final incentive released - October 31st, 2018  Founder's Lockup Contract:45,000,000 LATX (15% of total supply) tokens will be held in the founder’s lockup contract for 12 months releasing November 1st 2018. These funds will be used to expand the management team after production release in key areas and founder’s equity. This amount is the maximum amount that can be withdrawn from the Lockup contract. The amounts actually withdrawn will be left up to the founders to decide up to the maximum allowed by the contract. This contract has been made available on Github for public review.  Bounty Programs:15,000,000 LATX (5% of total supply) will be allocated for bounty programs. The following programs are included in this allocation Wings (1% of total supply), General Affiliate System (up to 2.6% of total supply), General Bounty (1% of total supply), Marketing bounties (0.4% of total supply), such as promotional programs, content writing, etc. The Marketing Bounty is an additional bounty campaign, not a guaranteed distribution and will be up to the management team who can receive this bounty.

Follow us on Twitter Subscribe to our Subreddit   All purchases of LATX should be for the sole purpose of use within the platform. This is not an offer for investment or a security. If you are looking to purchase the LATX token with a purpose other than usage within the platform you should reconsider your purchase.",False

During that you will receive 11 LATX per 1 LAT that you transfer.",False
