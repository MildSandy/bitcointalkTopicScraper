Together, Opacity and QLC are committed to developing applications for real-world use. By combining the zero-knowledge capabilities of Opacity with the hardware encryption of QLC Chain’s Confidant system, we can create a strong foundation for a larger ecosystem that includes secure and private data owned by all users across the platforms.  The Internet has advanced people’s modern life, brings convenience and improved effectiveness for so many. It has fostered the e-commerce, social media, sharing economy. However, there seems to be some things not quite right.  While the internet is bringing people closer, it is also building an invisible web that captures everyone by way of personal data monetization, social credit, digital ID, banking status, etc. In other words, people are exchanging their digital lives for ‘convenience’. This situation creates a wide open door for malicious attacks, while also enabling for-profit chasing corporations to unscrupulously monetize their users without consent. We believe this is not right, and we would like to change it by leveraging DECENTRALIZATION, starting with online communication and data storage.   About the Hackathon  GOAL  To improve the private data ecosystem across both QLC Chain and Opacity, two projects that focus on user privacy and are committed to building products for the future where people can safeguard their digital content.    HACKATHON TOPICS   Bridge Confidant Account with Opacity Storage  Confidant has 20G free storage for each account holder. How would a user access Opacity Storage when using Confidant in messaging, upload files, photos, videos, and store the emails? It is up to you to create this!   Bridge Confidant Station storage to Opacity  A Confidant Station can extend up to 2TB of hardware storage. How can an owner allocate some spare space to lend to Opacity users or other Confidant users? The owner can earn OPQ or QGAS.    STAY TUNED FOR WINNING PRIZE INFORMATION!

Ahead of the QLC Chain TestNet launch as well as the wallet and explorer launch, we would like to propose to QLC holders and community members a deeper engagement with the project for the future healthy growth.     Blockchain projects are naturally decentralized by consensus and open-sourced code. Earlier this month, the QLC team handed over the working dApp, WinQ, to the community for future development. Now, we’re planning to expand the decentralized governance to the community level. Currently, we’re planning to open four categories to the community to discuss and make decisions on, they are the following:  1. Exchange Listing 2. Product Developments 3. AMA Schedule 4. Others  This is our proposal for the community governance programme.We welcome discussions around the proposal. We would love to hear your thoughts on our subreddit  QLC holders can submit a proposal from their wallet. And one account represents one identity. The QLC Wallet that was developed on WinQ will be integrated into the QLC Chain TestNet wallet. Community members can vote for or against the proposal to decide whether the QLC team or other stakeholders should execute the proposal. To avoid a spam of proposals, proposals will need to meet the requirements listed below to be eligible for the voting list. Moreover, there will be incentives for the voters to participate.  This program will help build a QLC governing system, consisting of those who frequently contribute and participate in the decision-making process.      Proposal:  Community members initiate discussions across different platforms including Telegram Group, Reddit, WeChat and Github to compose a proposal. We encourage a comprehensive proposal listing the value, reason, and feasibility.     Proposal Submission:  An eligible proposal needs to fulfill the two requirements below  1） Deposit 10,000 QLC 2） Achieve 100 transactions reception from different accounts on QLC Testnet  Vote:  A listed proposal is open for voting for 48 hours. Each voter needs to deposit 10 QLC to vote. The voting number will not be shown during this time. The deposit QLC for voting will be reserved as a rewards pool.     Voting rewards:  When the 48 hours countdown ends, and the results are announced. The party that receives the majority vote will share the rewards pool. If there is no majority, the QLC deposited for voting will be refunded back to the voter.  For example, 100 people participated in the voting (W=100 x 10=1,000QLC). There were (A): 51 votes, against the proposal (B): 49 votes, for the proposal. The 51 voters will be rewarded A/W≈19.6QLC per person.  Successful proposal: A proposal will be passed for the QLC Team or the other stakeholders to execute when received two thirds of the FOR.  The refund policy for the proposal deposit depends on the voter number, taking 67 — two thirds of 100 — as a benchmark.  1. voters < 67, 10% of the deposit (1,000 QLC) will be deducted and added to the voter’s reward pool. The remaining 90% will be returned to the member that submitted the proposal.  2. 67 ≤ voters < 100, the proposal fails. The QLC team will not execute the proposal and the member that submitted the proposal will receive a full refund for their deposit.  3. 100 ≤ voters, and the number of votes in favor < 2/3 of the total number of votes, the proposal will be considered unsuccessful. The QLC team will not execute the proposal and the member that submitted the proposal will receive a full refund for their deposit.  4. 100 ≤ number of voters, and the number of votes in favor ≥ 2/3 of the total number of votes, the proposal is successful. The QLC team will execute the proposal and the member that submitted the proposal will receive a full refund for their deposit.      QLC Governors Ranking  The QLC Team will reward active participants and recognize them as governors.  A successful member made a proposal vote weighs 10, a voter weight 1.  The ranking accumulates over time. Higher ranking governors will be rewarded and honored monthly, quarterly and annually.  Thank you for your support!",False

In June, we announced that QLC team has completed the Alpa phase of the Public Chain and successfully expanded the Block Lattice structure to the Multidimensional Block Lattice structure which supports multiple tokens. The structure will be able to support frequent transactions and various functions in the network industry, enabling decentralized Network-as-a-Service.  The completion of Alpha phase means we enabled the creation of different tokens in the Block Lattice ecosystem, similar to ERC20 and NEP5 token standards. We are the first in the Block Lattice architecture that allows users to create tokens within the ecosystem and use it for their businesses.  Later this month, we will be inviting 50 QLC holders to participate and experience our multi-token transfer on Multidimensional Block Lattice. Moreover, the selected participants will be able to experience our Wallet and Explorer first-hand.

You don’t want to miss this event, Secure your place as a participants          Hi, thank you for this question!  QLC is building the public chain for Network-as-a-Service(NaaS). It means it is the blockchain platform for network services, including but not limited to VPN, CDN, Firewall, storage, routing, name resolution etc. To decentralise this service, it means users will enjoy secure (online activity not being tracked), encrypted (a public/private key account system rather than a user name/password one), carrier independent, and on-demand network experience.  From the business perspective, it is a niche industry, true, but also the industry that underpins the modern digital life. From this point of view, I would say network is not an industry but the infrastructure for all industry. Separately, I would also like to highlight the fact that all the public chains that are under developing, they are not necessarily competing with each other but rather tackling different problems in different fields. We hope QLC Chain would eventually provide the network module for dApps, regardless which public chain it was built on.  From the technological perspective, QLC Chain is introducing the Multidimensional Block Lattice structure, which can support high TPS, scalability and achieve anti-centralization. The four function nodes pertinent to network services requires ""Shannon Consensus"" which is also introduced by the team to fairly incentives nodes. For more technical details, please refer to the articles:  https://steemit.com/qlc/@txdzhang/what-is-a-multidimensional-block-lattice-structure-1  https://steemit.com/blocklattice/@txdzhang/what-is-a-multidimensional-block-lattice-structure-2  https://steemit.com/blockchain/@txdzhang/various-consensus-and-shannon-for-network-transmission  In terms of the team, we have Allen Li as chief architect. Allen is a patent owner in wireless engineering. 7 years experience in Huawei and one of the first group of engineers deploying LTE network in Europe. Dr. Jerry Chen is our Chinese Operation Director, read more about his professional and entrepreneur experience here https://medium.com/qlc-chain/dr-chen-jinrong-onboard-qlc-chain-as-operation-director-of-china-1162dc0d5817 Dan Kowkolwitz is closely working together with the R&D team regarding enterprise level network security. Chris Zhao and Owen Wang also have rich experience in telecom industry.  QLC Chain also formed substantial industry partners, Montnets is one of the largest cloud communication provider in China with hundreds of thousands enterprise clients. QLC Chain will further develop end-to-end solutions for customers.  At last but I would also like to highlight here is the working product WinQ, which uses P2P account sharing protocol and enables peer-to-peer network transmission. I believe the product will speak for the team's developing capabilities. The user experience will keep improving and acquire more users, whether the ones who would like to monetise their network assets or those who would prefer flexible, secure network usage.

In pursuit of security and user adoption, blockchain projects are sacrificing processing speed and agility. Furthermore, it’s harder to grow user adopt as well as improve the user experience. The journey to explore blockchain applications is similar to Internet companies 20 years ago, battling and conquering. According to a report published on May 24th by Cowen, on average, experts in the field expect new technology to take 5.9 years to gain widespread adoption.  WinQ is a utility dApp developed by the QLC team for telecom asset sharing. Currently, the dApps features WiFi and VPN sharing. The platform is built on NEO public chain without a central server. Users can register their telecom asset on the blockchain, offer their services on the platform and earn tokens. The advantages of using NEO public chain is that it uses DBFT consensus and therefore resolves the issue of speed. However, there is more than just TPS as a barrier.  The dApp forms a distributed network by accumulating VPN assets and users. However, a serverless dApp does not restrict user’s activities, and they can operate freely on the platform. Imagine operating a platform like Taobao for telecom services, what mechanisms can be introduced to encourage an increase in both sellers and buyers, without Alibaba central server holding the algorithm? As a VPN sharing platform, the quality of the VPN assets is crucial for user adoption. To solve this issue, WinQ introduced a new logic to sort back-end assets. So, how does the new algorithm work?  1. Every user connected to a VPN asset is participating in the P2P network and the connection will be broadcasted on the P2P network.  2. If a connection is successful, the front-end VPN list (the one displayed on the ‘VPN’ page of the WinQ dApp) of the neighboring node will display the asset.  3. Each successful connection is a signal — available to be connected an valid within a certain period of time.  4. The back-end logic is to present assets to the user with a good rate of available assets by filtering out VPN asset with broken configuration files.  5. Users and assets can rate the listed asset without central interference.      Currently, WinQ is on the TestNet and will distribute 100 TestNet QLC for every wallet created. Therefore, users will be able to connect to VPN essentially for free. However, the dApp will be moving to the MainNet by the end of the year. In order to retain users as well as increase mass user adoption, especially users with limited exposure or experience with cryptocurrency, the team has added a feature on WinQ to allow three free VPN connections, without the need of creating a Wallet. The QLC team believes that by implementing a new back-end algorithm to rank VPN assets as well as allowing three free VPN connections they will be able to rile up enthusiasm and increase user adoption, including non-crypto users.  In 2017, ICO activities were flourishing. There were many projects dedicated to developing decentralized applications (dApp). However, it doesn’t matter how advanced the technology is or how many partners are formed. Eventually, the project has to focus on targeting the consumer market with a client facing product. There’s been plenty of discussions debating the timeline for mass adoption of dApp’s mass adoption and the future of consumers using dApps. Fred Wilson, a partner of Union Square Ventures, said: “There will be an ‘iPhone moment’ for dApps where it’s drop-dead simple and we can consume [them] in almost the same way as regular applications.”",False

We just rebranded from Qlink, a good time to Ask Me Anything!  Date: May 26, 2018 Saturday  Time: 11pm (UTC+8) Hong Kong Time  Channel: Youtube  https://goo.gl/nQfd8r  Leave your questions under this thread!  Qlink has rebranded to QLC Chain during the Consensus event (NYC) a week ago. Now that the team returned from the US, it’s time to retrospect and spend some time to answer questions.  We’ve had many fruitful talks among industry practitioners and are confident there are some solid high-end partnerships in the make.  With the rebrand we revealed with excitement about our public chain and the future. The following period, QLC Chain public chain constructing will be one of our main focus areas for the the team as well as the ecosystem building.  In case you missed the mission and the vision for QLC Chain, it is the  next generation public Blockchain for decentralized Network-as-a-Service(NaaS).  The QLC Chain and the supporting ecosystem will enable any individual, business or organization to leverage their network resources to instantly become a service provider or network operator. The mission is to bring people online through a simpler, more pleasant, and more secure way with full transparency.  With the technology we’ll deploy a multidimensional Block Lattice architecture and make use of virtual machines (VM) to manage and support integrated Smart Contract functionality. Additionally, QLC Chain will introduce an important innovation in the industry; dual consensus: Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) and Shannon Consensus. Through the use of this dual consensus protocol and multidimensional Block Lattice architecture, QLC Chain is able to perform a high number of transactions per second (TPS), provide massive scalability and an inherently decentralized environment for NaaS related decentralized applications (dApp).
