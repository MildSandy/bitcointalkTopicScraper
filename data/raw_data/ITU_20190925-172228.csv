The Problem with Digital Identities Today 1. Users do not own their data 2. Not universally discoverable 3. Google, Amazon, and Facebook know too much  What is iTrue‚Äôs Vision?  In order to address some of the aforementioned challenges, iTrue is combining blockchain and biometric technologies to improve authentication experience and enhance platform security. With iTrue, users have complete control over their confidential personal data, and biometric authentication enables secure and seamless access to digital assets and even physical facilities, like a car or house. Since iTrue gives notifications where users‚Äô data is being used, enterprises are able to integrate privacy controls into their applications, thus helping businesses comply with the European GDPR regulations.
