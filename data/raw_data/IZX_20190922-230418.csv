There is a large number of ways to earn money on the crypto market, but most of them - mining, trading, building an investment portfolio - require initial contributions. There are also ways that do not require any money such as bounty programs of ICO projects. Before disclosing this type of income, let's recall what is ICO. ICO is a new way of attracting investment to a project. In this case startup is raising funds for their idea in the form of selling their tokens. After the collection of funds the project's tokens go to the crypto market and can be exchanged for another cryptocurrency or even fiat money.  ICO projects also have bounty programs where you can earn crypto with minimum efforts needed. Bounty is translated as a ""gift"" or ""encouragement"". This is an award given by an ICO-project to those who are ready to perform certain actions for the ICO promotion. The reward is paid in the form of project’s crypto tokens.  Usually all bounty campaigns have the same tasks for participants and clear deadlines. Here are the most common of them: activity in social networks, on forums, doing translations and publications on external resources.  There is one more way of having simple earnings on the Internet in a crypto-currency field - airdrop programs. While it is necessary to make some efforts and turn on creativity in order to participate in bounty, airdrop is for those who are looking for easier ways. It is a token distribution program in exchange for doing the simplest tasks. For example, joining a telegram channel, subscribing to social networks, hitting like button etc. But today a new kind of airdrop is gaining popularity - it is about collecting tokens in Augmented Reality (AR). We are talking about the IZX company and their platform, which provides everyone an opportunity to catch tokens in the game just like pokemons in “Pokemon Go”. Just download IZX app, go outside and start catching coins with your smartphone. This kind of airdrop has more advantages than the others. Firstly, it's a game. It’s fun and you have an opportunity to explore your city while earning some valuable coins! Next, you do not have to waste your time on social networks - if for previous airdrops all your Facebook friends were bombarded with all the ICO advertisement on your page, - now you can just walk and collect tokens of various ICO projects. Finally, it's easy! You do not need to have many accounts and check them every day. IZX is not about a thousand opened bitcointalk pages - it's a lot of tokens inside one game. At the same time, you can be sure that you will receive money into your wallet, because the company carefully examines and checks all the projects, tokens of which are scattered on the map in augmented reality of the IZX app.  Start earning coins and exchanging them for real money or gifts!",False

In the main hall of the hotel Rixos speakers spoke of general trends in the development of blockchain and the prospects for regulating the market of crypto-currencies, in the business hall investors could familiarize themselves with the presentations of ICO projects.

This kind of conference was a novelty for the Kazakh public, cause Almaty is still at the very beginning of the road, as far as congress and exhibition events are concerned with the topic of blockchain. IZETEX gave a joint interview with UnicornGO on the blockchain news channel Hodlweek, a video with which will be posted on Youtube.

Let’s say a few words about what some countries stand out in their attitude to crypto-currencies.  The EU The European Court ruled that operations of exchanging bitcoins for fiat currencies are exempt from VAT.  Georgia Georgia is home to BitFury, one of the largest manufacturers of hardware and bitcoin chips. Currently BitFury stores about 15% of all bitcoins.  Iceland Thanks to inexpensive geothermal energy, Iceland has become a kind of center of companies offering cloud mining. Although the attitude to the perspective and structure of such business in the crypto-community is very ambiguous.  Sweden Sweden is the birthplace of KnCMiner, this company is located in Stockholm. Currently, KnCMiner produces about 7.5% of all bitcoins.  USA United States is home to 21 Inc., a bitcoin mining company based in California. 21 works with a large number of miners and sells its low-power miners as part of their 21 Bitcoin computer. Most of the hash power from 21 Bitcoin computers is in the 21st pool. 21 Inc. mines about 3% of all bitcoins. In general, the regulation of crypto-currencies in this country is the most bureaucratic, and tax regulation is one of the most uncomfortable in the world.  The Financial Crimes Commission under the US Treasury Department classifies bitcoins as “decentralized virtual currencies”. The Commission considers that the operations for the exchange of any crypto-currency for fiat money should be regulated in the same way as the operations for exchanging fiat money among themselves. In the autumn of 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States (SEC) filed the first-ever fraudulent case of the ICO crypto-currency.  Germany Bitcoin is recognized as a monetary unit.  Japan Bitcoin is a legal tender with a purchase tax.  Switzerland In Switzerland, the same rules apply to crypto-currencies as to foreign currencies.  Singapore The main achievement of Singapore, of course, is the fact that IZETEX company operates in the jurisdiction of this state https://izx.io/. To say seriously, Singaporean legislation is by far the most liberal and easy to understand business for thousands of technology companies from around the world.  Russia Russia has great potential to become a mining power thanks to a suitable climate and a developed energy network. In addition, Russia has a large number of highly skilled developers. Every fifth successful ICO has Russian roots nowadays. However, the adoption of fairly tough measures to regulate mining and ICO in this country is unlikely to allow Russia to become a leader.",False

Part 2    In the previous article, we examined the basic principles of blockchain technology. Today, let’s talk about the basic algorithm of its work.  How does the blockchain work?  Step 1: The user initiates the transaction.  Step 2. The transaction is sent to a peer-to-peer computer network, where all nodes are equal. This transaction is being tested for validity and, together with other current transactions, is included in the block.  Step 3. The nodes solve a complex computational task for fixing the block.  Step 4. When the problem is solved correctly, the block is confirmed by the nodes of the network and clings to the last correct block.  Step 5. Thus, the blocks are linked in a chain (that’s why the name block chain = a chain of blocks). There may be two alternative chains that differ by one last block (or even a pair). But with each next block the complexity of recounting a new chain grows exponentially from the number of blocks in it. Therefore, in the end, there will always be one true chain, after a few blocks after that in which our transaction lives. It is important to understand that this does not happen instantly, and there is always a certain period of time when there is uncertainty whether our transaction enters the block of the longest chain.  Step 6. After getting into the longest chain of blocks, the transaction is considered perfect.  Blockchain is a secure, distributed and transparent system for transferring funds between participants in a transaction without involving an intermediary.  https://medium.com/@izetex_project/what-is-blockchain-part-2-db7663364d13",False

We plan global scaling of the project — to integrate new games into IZETEX platform and to attract advertisers of the largest international businesses.  We made a decision to amend some points of the project in order to speed up the development of the platform and to facilitate understanding of the technological process for all parties.  ERC-20 IZX tokens’ holders will be able to use IZX Drive tokens for advertising in games based on our platform. Therefore, the price of the IZX Drive token must be substantially less than the price of ERC-20 token, so that advertisers can purchase enough tokens to test the platform’s work.  According to the data collected from our MVP, the average advertiser must simultaneously have hundreds of IZX Drive tokens for an effective marketing campaign. The low price of tokens will help to attract new advertisers to the testing process and to improve the beta version of the platform. Our tests show that the current price of a $ 1 token is an obstacle for many advertisers, since the budget of the trial advertising campaign will be hundreds of dollars.  In this regard, we carry out a number of changes in the structure of our token-model, which we present below:  1. Reducing the price of the IZX ERC-20 token to $ 0.01 * * For those, who bought tokens IZX ERC-20 for $ 1, the balance will be recounted and tokens will be automatically accrued in proportional amount.  2. Recounting the issue of ERC-20 tokens Now total supply is 5 000 000 000, at a price of 1 ERC-20 = 0.01 USD  3. Increasing the share of ERC-20 tokens allocated for the bounty program 21% of the total will be allocated to the bounty, and the program is extended for 35 months, with payments once a month.",False

February 5, 2017, the industrial production index Dow Jones showed a drop of 1200 points. He has never fallen so much in the history of his existence. According to Bloomberg, the 500 richest people in the world lost 114 billion of dollars in one day and all the shares in the US stock market fell on average by 10%. Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page and Sergey Brin have lost 2–3 billion dollars. Another pair of alarming indicators — the growth of the Swiss trademark, which always worries in the face of crises, and an insignificant but still rising gold rate.  What about the crypto-currency? The market of crypto-currency after the January shock therapy for traders on short positions finally went up. It is fair to assume that part of the investment from the stock market will be poured into the market for crypto-currency, for the reason that in this relatively new fast-growing sphere the blossoming is just the same. Bitcoin, despite falling more than 2 times per month, still made 400% per annum, the number of crypto-currencies on coinmarketcap exceeded 1500, there is an increasing number of promising ICO projects, like IZX https://izx.io/, the established crypto-currencies branch out on forks and overgrown with a community of enthusiasts.  The fact that the big guys of the financial market will take up the market for crypto-currency is both good and bad at the same time. It is good, because the market capitalization will increase, more interesting projects will receive financing, the Bitcoin and Ether rate will skyrocket, but not immediately. The downside is that the crypto-currencies will finally turn into a speculative instrument and a financial bubble, and their value will be little related to the practical use of the technology they carry.  Well, keep the crypto-currency — if it is, buy the crypto-currency — if it is not there. Stocking up on popcorn and watching the emergence of new large professional and regulated brokerage houses that will specialize in trading with crypto-currency.  Of course, this will be a bubble, but after the last bubble bursts, it will only be invested in canned goods and weapons.  https://medium.com/@izetex_project/the-global-financial-crisis-began-yesterday-de32ceb5c6c5",False

The new vision of Tamagotchi is an unconditional curtsey towards the creator of the Ethereum — Vitalik Buterin, who used to state “Vitalik loves kitties” at diferrent conferences, and also has image of kitties on a bag, watch and often on T-shirts.  In the first week of spreading, enthusiasts bought kittens for 2.5 million dollars, the prices for cats ranged from 0.03 ETH to 250 ETH depending on the rarity of the breed. Kittens, by the way, are even capable of interbreeding, but the most expensive are cats of first generation. They will be the subject of crypto-collecting in the future.  The world saw how simple child’s play turned into a real value. And this is only the beginning of a new vision of Tamagotchi, but not the last one. In January 2018, there was an announcement of the alleged fork of cryptokitties — UnicornGo. A new blockchain-platform will offer to get as a pet fairytale unicorns that will live in augmented reality. Unlike cryptokitties, registered in the network of blockchain, unicorns will be connected with a specific geographical place of residence. A number of game actions that can be happened to unicorns will expand, so in addition to interbreeding, unicorns can also be trained. What exactly will the mythical creatures do — is unknown before the release, but we know that unicorns will evolve as a kind of avatar of their own user. Unicorns can be trained to sing, dance, talk, and we will be able to give them their own individual traits. UnicornGo will work on the basis of the blockchain networks Universa and IZX https://izx.io/  We can assume that the creatures that are being created today will very soon become widespread and, out of almost child’s play, turn into totemic animals of their users, which can be explored in the same way as today we explore the profile of a person in social networks. The development of technologies of blockchain, augmented reality, neural networks, machine learning will give everyone the opportunity to create their own analog of the Apple’s Siri, which can be “brought up” for themselves.  Just imagine — you will be able to state standard answers to questions about yourself in Telegram or Facebook to your own virtual assistant. This will be a kind of response to the general fatigue of communication in social networks, free up time, and will also become a new round of development of boring standard chatbots.  “I’m not online but you can talk to my unicorn.” This is the message that millions of users around the world will see or some clever virtual cryptokitty.  https://medium.com/@izetex_project/new-vision-of-tamagotchi-on-blockchain-4879b9804a",False

The team, whose faces were represented on the project’s site, turned out to be non-existent people, and instead of the project site, there was a link to the white page, in the right-left corner of which was shyly written the word “penis” in fine print. The project actively advertised its own ICO, using attractive girls from the Fiverr service, who wrote with the marker the website address on their chest.  We can’t say that this event was particularly resonant, but it generally illustrates the common signs of a scam that many investors in ICO do not notice.  Unfortunately, with the growth of ICO projects, the number of scammers is also growing, and it’s becoming easy to get confused in the sea of information. The Produm project had all the signs of a scam project, the most obvious — the fake team.  The team of any ICO project should be carefully explored, there can’t be people who appeared out of nowhere and ready to go to nowhere in the team. They must have live profiles in social networks and some kind of background. The founders of “live” projects are not afraid to show their real faces: they speak at thematic conferences, it’s easy to find them and to contact. In addition, it is also necessary to pay attention to the project’s advisors. Advisors are usually public figures who are authoritative in their professional activities, acting as guarantors of the ICO project. It is always fast to find information about them on the Internet.  It is simple to verify and compare the collected and declared funds in the official ICO wallets, and this amount should approximately coincide with the numbers stated on the official website. Of course, there are cases when most of the financing is received from the investment funds, in this case, they will not be displayed on the official website.  Then you need to collect all your attention in a fist and carefully read White Paper, Terms and Conditions, to understand the legal subtleties of token possession and to understand how detailed the further development of the project and the means for achieving the public utility of this or that know-how is described in detail.  While most ICO projects are approaching the Crowd Sale stage with bare ideas, the IZETEX team https://izx.io/ has tested the viability of its own ideas by creating its own MVP game, as well as describing in detail the architecture of its own platform. These developments require large financial investments, full immersion, technical support for the development team, while the provision of work requires considerable resources, long before the first investments begin to arrive in the project.  Objective proof of the “true” project is the daily work of its developers, as well as specific results that can be seen and felt, rather than the colorful marketing activity. Be a reasonable investor who can forget about emotional and impulsive decisions, and then you will see stock Xs instead of penises on the screens of your balance.  https://medium.com/@izetex_project/how-to-avoid-becoming-a-hamster-in-the-ocean-of-ico-scam-2b45342826d4",False

You will haunt your ‘best offer’ like it is a Pokemon  As better you are at looking through your smartphone's screen, as more different tokens you might get. Searching for cryptocurrency in augmented reality application IZX was jokingly called mining on the go. What is about – project IZX? And why you should haunt for its tokens during its Pre-Sale, I asked (name and position of the official speaker)   Mr. …I am really glad that find time during your pre-sale campaign to talk to me.  Tell me about your project, pls?  I am proud of our project, and would be glad if more people get information about it. IZX is a decentralized platform for building effective interaction between advertisers, game developers and customers. It allows business to utilize augmented and virtual reality games in order to convert game players to real customers.  Sounds like a new stream in marketing.  Yes, it is. Advertising technologies require innovation more than ever. In the digital age, business entities are switching to the omnichannel model of interaction with their customers. Meanwhile the waste of user attention becomes insane and the auditory responds accordingly - more than 600 million people use ad blockers on their devices, and the number continues to grow.  Well, Facebook and Google hold about 75% of digital ads market revenues, and 99% of the entire market growth for the past years. If they don't know how to solve the problem of the waste of potentional customers attention, how you can offer a solution?  Well, we concentrate on technologies, because today cutting edge technologies bring new market opportunities. Imagine a decentralized marketing platform where the only intermediate between an advertiser and publisher is a smart contract which independently runs on a distributed blockchain network and impartially governs this business interaction. This is how we work.  Could you give some more details, examples, pls? Explain, why it will work with customers.  While advertising efficiency does not become better, the customer expectations continue skyrocketing. This trend is called the “ Amazonification of expectations”: customers expect the Amazon Prime level service in all industries. The marketing could take this challenge by utilizing the deep machine learning to analyse the big data of users behavior. This would let to target personal offers with high precision, proposing clients exactly what they need at the exact moment. Yes, I always get the right offer form them!  Great, but you and every other customer deserve even more. The problem is the data is being buried at the proprietary servers and is definitely underutilized. They say the data is new commodity. The question is, whom this commodity belongs to? In ideal World, the individual should take all control over who has access both to her personal data and her attention. There should be ways to get clear understanding of what piece of one’s personal data is being used by what company and how exactly. Today we have the inverse situation, when the control of user’s data has been stolen from her: the data locked in corporate databases, instead of serving the user’s needs.  And you will give this control back to users?  Exactly, we wish to do that. The micropayment opportunities and real-time settlement provided by blockchain network opens new market, where economic models could be built on each customer’s impression. This shifts the value from independent demand side platforms and advertising exchanges back into the edges of supply chain: advertisers, publishers and programmers.  So, due to your business model – customer is a gamer and he is haunting for the advertise instead of being it’s victim?  Imagine your advertising appear on the customer way to office in a form of treasury chest or a Cup with miraculous elixir. Customer picks it up by with gadget.  It is so easy? Like a game?  In a game form. We believe that combining the augmented and virtual reality with the decentralized applications on blockchain network and artificial intelligence will spawn the brand new paradigm of business-to-customer communication in emotional, informational and economic senses.  IZX is this kind of a project.  Yes, IZX is a decentralized monetization platform for independent game developers with elements of augmented or virtual reality. The advertising provider may choose games that will be used for its promotional events, their developers get royalties. IZX is a blockchain-based network, its code is open source, and it has no geographical boundaries.  What you offer to your pottentional clients? What is your business logic? Business logic of marketing campaigns built on IZX  platform is flexy  customizable  and managed  by  smart  contracts.  Game artifacts are tied to IZX Drive tokens which backed by special offers and discounts. The game player finds artifacts inside a game arena and receives tokens to her or his wallet.  Then personn can exchange the tokens on discounts in a place that sells product or provide services,  e.g. hotel, restaurant, clothes store or barbershop.  Today, cryptocurrency is mainly spread within certain communities, such as computer geeks (including miners). Although as far as I understand your currency will be also spread worldwide?  IZX is the first cryptocurrency that appears in wallets of a wide audience. IZX mission is to make value exchanges between business and clients clear, easy and straightforward.  So, what you have achieved at this moment?  We have 13263 active players. And every day we are bigger and bigger! People are really into all this games. We created the first game on our Platform. Now we are preparing three more to be integrated with our Platform in Spring. We collected a lot of feedback from our users to improve our product. Thus, we starting our ICO with a ready-to-scale blockchain solution.  You made tests?  We tested mechanics of token redeeming for prizes proved to be simple, quick for implementation and intuitively clear both to players and advertisers. Blockchain network in-game chips, issued by advertisers. Players hunt them in augmented or virtual reality, in order to get a prize or a discount.  And what about companies? What they get?  They get back 50% of advertising budget, spent on SEO promotion. And their pottentional customers are more loyal to the product, because they spent time with pleasure to get this discount. It is an adventure for them.  I'ev read some materials about your company, you often compare IZX games with moning.  We are sure that future belongs to the symbiosis of mining with some useful activity, and it is this characteristic that will confirm the value of the cryptocurrency. It is like Pokemon-go, but with social benefits.  How this symbiosis is working in your project?  Despite the fact that it looks just like a funny game, the cryptocurrency in it has real value in the form of prizes, discounts, or an equivalent in cryptocurrency. In general, people go around in swarms and look for these coins, earning them with their feet, that's why it was called mining on the go.  Ok, and what is yours aim on the go?  The next stage of the platform development is the integration of apps from hundreds of third-party developers. The best developers will be able to monetize their ideas. But all this after our ICO's results.  You did your pre-ICO campaign recently?  Yes, this November. Now we gave start to our Pre-Sale. It will last till the end of the December, 2017.   How much are your tokens now?  IZX tokens are crypto currency, working on the Ethereum network. It will be presented at cryptocurrency exchanges. It is used to issue game IZX Drive tokens. Now one IZX is equal to $1.  Are there special offers and bonuses for buyers?  Of course, every investor will get exclusive offer. Also we have bounty programs. In total there will be issued 50,000.000 IZX. No additional emission after the ICO. Unallocated tokens will be burnt.  You have an awesome innovative product! I wish you a good luck!  Thank you!",False

When you hear about cryptocurrency mining, you imagine, of course, long series of video cards with lights blinking or rows of servers that are eating electricity and heating the air around you like a band of dragons. It's all true, but today we are going to talk about mining that differs. And video cards have nothing to do with it.  Searching for cryptocurrency in augmented reality application IZX was jokingly called mining on the go or ""Proof of Walk"". If you don't know, it is a mobile game where you search for cryptocoins on the map like you do it with Pokemon, and then catch them to your wallet using your phone camera in the augmented reality mode.  Despite the fact that it was just a funny game, the cryptocurrency in it has real value in the form of prizes, discounts, or an equivalent in cryptocurrency. In general, people go around in swarms and look for these coins, earning them with their feet, that's why it was called mining on the go. The term ""Proof of Walk"" appeared later, it resembles the term ""Proof of Work"" in sound and meaning, for which farms with video cards are built. Just a joke or is there anything more in its meaning? Let's gain an insight!  Why do we need it?  First, let's remember why these video cards heat the air and what Proof of Work is. It is proof of work. In fact, it is an artificial barrier, so that it could be not too simple to add blocks to the chain as well as not too fast.  Miners are allowed to add a block to the block chain, only if they solve a problem first. The condition of the problem is very simple - to select a seed to calculate the hash of the block, so that first N digits were equal to zero. The higher N is, the more difficult the problem is. The condition is simple, but you cannot say the same about the problem itself. If N is high, the solution is extremely difficult and people solder special processors based on ASICS (specialized programmable chips) or deprive children of computer games, and build farms from video cards:   Children's video cards enrich the capitalists  Why is it necessary to make addition of a block to the block chain even more difficult, which in fact is not very fast? To answer this question, you must first answer the other one: what is the main problem solved by the block chain? The problem of trust without a trusted party.  Let's think it through: you must have trust in each bit of information in a network, where no participants trust each other. Part of the solution to this problem covers the use of asymmetric cryptography. We can be sure that participants do have accounts that are used to make transactions by means of verification of a digital signature pair with a public key. But the second part of the problem cannot be solved mathematically and requires some empiricism. Among such problems is protection against spending the same money twice (the so-called ""double spending problem"").    An intruder can make two blocks and include money transfer to two different recipients in each of them. At the same time, he/she will insert one block in one block chain and the other block - in another chain, for example, on different nodes of a single block chain network. This situation is called ""fork"" and the block chain network can solve it by choosing which of the chains will grow and which one should die. But there is no reason for the network itself to choose which of the chains is correct, and indeed what is ""correct"" - in this case it is a philosophical issue, rather than a mathematical one. The decision as to which block chain to choose is taken based on a ""consensus"". In other words we can say that the miner who will create (""mine"") the next block takes a decision which chain is correct. Usually it is not enough, and the chain should be continued by a few (usually 5-8) blocks to make the recipient sure that the transfer was made to him/her and no one else.  If everyone could add blocks to the chain at any speed and without cost, then it would be clear that this mechanism could not work. Indeed, to ensure that the chain cannot be faked, resources that no one else in the world has are required re-create these 5-8 blocks. Here these far-fetched problems related to hash, video cards and children without games appear.  Let's summarize: You can trust in something, on which resources were spent It is interesting that computers used for mining can be considered as a kind of a community that decides what is good and what is bad. But that's not the case, of course. In fact, computers are used by people who get financial benefits from mining, and it is financial benefits that force them, first, to mine and, most importantly, to behave ""correctly"". The network pays miners a fee for each new block and it is economically unprofitable for them not to follow the rules and look for ways to deceive the system.  It is money compensation for mining that allows to trust in a block chain. So, all of the above may seem to be a more complicated structure, and it is so. A block chain is really a difficult thing. But if you think about the complexity of the problem that it solves the problem of trust without a trusted party, then I think you will find justification for it.  You may ask why we mentioned Pokemon?  Let's have a look at IZX game from the point of view of mining. Players install the mobile application, and receive a map with the location of the nearest coins. If you approach a coin, a sight appears and the coin can be caught by the camera.       First, the player must find a coin on the map and come to it as close as possible. Usually there are not so many coins, as shown in the screenshot above, and sometimes it is not so easy to approach a coin. However, after analyzing actions of players, we see that difficulties in finding tokens stop nobody, and if the player started to look for them, he/she becomes addicted and collects, collects and collects...    Players spend time, walk or travel long distances to catch a token. It seems that the time, efforts, and, perhaps, money spent for transportation should be compensated by the pleasure of the game and the value of the prize. Let's turn to the average data that we collected in the course of several promotion events.   The table shows the average data for three different promotion events with different types of prizes offered. The first two ones were held in the city of Kazan. The average distance traveled to find one token in the city is about 2 kilometers, and it took 16 minutes for searching. The third line in the table is the event held at the premises of Innopolis, where conference ""Block Chain - New Oil of Russia"" took place. The room was rather big, in addition, some tokens were scattered across the adjoining territory. The distance traveled was much less as compared to the city, but the time to find a token was almost the same. Let's express player's costs as a sum of time and distance at some reasonable coefficients. For the purposes of calculation we assumed that 1 hour of player's ""mining"" costs 5.5 USD, and 1 kilometer passed costs 0.17 USD. The figures are based on general considerations about the cost of public transport, gasoline and the price of Uber taxi. We got the following table:   The figures do not differ much, although it is clear that it is more profitable to ""mine"" in a room.  Mining on the go  Although conditional costs of a ""miner"" per token stated above are based on the data from different promotion events, they are quite similar. Costs of players to find a token justify its value. In fact, the rate of Bitcoin and Ethereum was initially determined solely by the cost of mining, since there were no other exchange or settlement transactions by which it could be determined. While no goods in a store could be bought for the cryptocurrency, its cost was equal to the cost of electricity spent for its generation. ""Sly"" block chains increase the complexity of mining, and the rate of bitcoin ""to electricity"" is gradually growing. Well, you know what happens next - when the currency becomes payable in stores, speculators start to influence the exchange rate much more than the cost of electricity. The same situation is with IZX token, which players are looking for - initially it was evaluated according to the same principle based on mining costs. Conditionally, now it ""costs"" 1.47 USD. If you put aside the factor of pleasure from the game, then it is as profitable to buy it for this amount as ""to mine it on the go"".  Advertisers who place their promotion campaigns on IZX tokens and get new customers determine the second factor for the growth of the token value. The audience of players is growing, and advertisers are competing for the opportunity to use IZX token to attract customers. The demand factor will determine the growth of the token rate in the future, similarly to other cryptocurrencies.  Proof of Walk  IZX tokens are not just collected by players, they are properly ""mined"". Since advertisers pay for scattered tokens and get new customers and buyers, they determine which customers they need.  The fact that it was jokingly called ""Proof of Walk"" is a proof based on the player's actions that the advertiser values him/her and, therefore, he/she can compete in the game for the right to pick up his/her token.  Although it has nothing to do with the development of blocks in the block chain, but it is quite applicable to the principle of justification of trust in ""Proof of Walk"". First of all, it is the advertiser's trust in the quality of the audience, and even personally in the player. Let's remember the main conclusions that we made above by analyzing traditional mining ""Proof of Work"": You can trust in something, on which resources were spent and Money compensation for mining allows to trust in the block chain In the case with Proof of Walk, both principles are fulfilled between people in the society but not between computers connected to the network.  What are advantages of mining?  There is no applied advantage in burning electricity and considering hash useless. Therefore, all new projects of block chain platforms try to get away from this model in favor of less resource-intensive ones, such as Proof of Stake (POS). The principle of POS is that the proof of your rightness is the size of your wallet multiplied by the time of its possession. This approach, in my opinion, may imply problems.  POS equates resources to its own internal cryptocurrency when building its proof, like Munchausen, who pulls himself out of the swamp by the hair. Time will show whether this will cause real problems for POS, so far the only model that has been proved in practice is Proof of Work. The society should spend additional resources for proving trust, and this is the main benefit of mining. Perhaps, in the future mining will not be as useless as traditional Proof of Work, but it will.  A recent example of useful mining is Storj project, where you can earn currencies by providing your own disk space for storing third-party data. Another example is Golos project, in which the currency is earned by writing interesting articles.  We are sure that future belongs to the symbiosis of mining with some useful activity, and it is this characteristic that will confirm the value of the cryptocurrency.
