Our P2P marketplace will be a good place for freelancers and developers that will have the opportunity to get involved in a new form of global e-commerce based on blockchain technology. Through the platform, we want to give an additional opportunity to generate online financial revenues. It is well known that automation will drastically reduce the availability of jobs in the near future and a good solution would be to adapt to changing events, opting for new solutions via Internet and the own amateur/professional skills. We are focusing on different types of professions and this could also be a good opportunity to push new people to use the blockchain. Everyone will be able to sell freelancing services or offer self-made creative assets to consumers that will be looking for a missing piece to proceed in a project development or to acquire new skills. There will be also the opportunity to participate in events with consequent prizes in tokens, such as competitions, bounties, and the referral program. CraftR marketplace will be represented by zero-commissions for all transaction made through the cryptocurrency payment system that will allow users to have a total finance control and the possibility to buy products & services without our/third-party interferences. In the long term, we plan to bring the store into a virtual form, the VR (Virtual Reality). This latest generation technology will allow us to create an ideal virtual store for digital creative products. Another milestone is the release of a multipurpose IDE for developers, allowing users to create and publish creative assets directly inside CraftR system. As long as the store is not released, interested parties will be able to generate extra tokens through the Proof-Of-Stake (POS) phase.

The products will help anyone to complete an idea or learn new skills through the provision of freelancers who will be able to exhibit their products.  The final goal of the buyers that reach our marketplace is to find the missing piece to produce software, applications, video games, websites, movies, audio tracks, documents, or illustrations.  Regarding the payment method, customers will have to use CRAFTR token as the only constraint to obtain products for sale. While sellers will enjoy the opportunity to earn them.",False
