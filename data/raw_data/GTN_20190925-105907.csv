The project aims to build a garbage processing complex using an innovative German technology — a pyrolysis reactor. Garbage burns inside the vacuum chamber at a temperature of 3000 degrees Celsius, which allows to completely protect the external environment from interaction with combustion products. During the operation of the reactor, a synthesis gas is obtained, used to produce electricity and heat, and coke is pure carbon used to produce foam glass. Foamglass is a universal building material with such desirable qualities as durability, water resistance and heat resistance.  To ensure financing, Greentoken decided to use an extraordinary approach — electricity received from synthesis gas is used to maintain the uninterrupted operation of 6,000 crypto-maming farms. Cryptomining is a fairly popular practice that has developed over the past few years. It is a plant engaged in the production of bitcoins. The main problem is that such activities require high energy costs, so it is most common in countries with low electricity prices. However, Greentoken solves this problem — since electricity is produced at the waste processing plant, it is possible to forget about spending energy.  “Our main goal is to make the planet cleaner”. And cryptomining is the optimal solution, which allows obtaining an effective financing instrument for investors and for the project itself, helping to continue and develop the fight against pollution of the surrounding world.",False
