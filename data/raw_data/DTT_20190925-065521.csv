The presentation consisted of 2 parts. The first was devoted to the architectual peculiarities of the networks. Bohdan demonstrated how to create basic networks, told about the RNN, LSTM networks’ architectures and reviewed their components in more details. He also compared the FFN, RNN, LSTM in action. He taught his audience how to teach the networks to predict the amount of the solar energy (approximately the same models are used while trading forecasting).  Furthermore, Bohdan demonstrated the importance of understanding the gradient descent methods and the training process. Two methods that don’t have much differences, but produce such opposite results. Later on, he gave some pieces of advice on training neural networks and hardware. Of course, there’re plenty questions from the audience and a brief discussion.  We are proud that you are a part of our dream team!",False

It’s not an easy question and I always start my answer with the history of money.  First people considered beautiful shells, wool or salt, then precious stones and metals as money. Precious metals have been considered as money for a very long period of time, but this resource is impractical and limited in quantity. This is how banks and paper money were established. Gold and silver were kept in banks, and they were given papers specifying the amount of metal kept in the banks in exchange.But when the states refused to return gold to European countries after Second World War, fiat and unsecured money were created.  Finally, the world departed from the gold standard in 1971. Yes, USD is unsecured since 1971! But this is not the end of the history of money.",False

The main macroeconomic factors such as nominal and real interest rate, economic growth rates, GDP, trade balance, inflation, etc. are evaluated for the analysis of exchange rates. Adoption and real use of the technology by business and the ordinary people, legal regulation at national levels, the emergence and development of competing projects play an important role for the evaluation of crypto-currencies.

Nevertheless, the use of various methods of machine learning can partially or completely replace the role of the analyst in the fundamental analysis.

Positive news about the company’s activities (for example, the introduction of new technologies or the acquisition of competitors, or promising trends in the industry) leads to an increase in the share price of this company, while negative news reduces the cost of shares. With the development of machine learning technologies and the development of methods of deep learning (using semantic analysis, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, networks with long short-term memory, etc.), it became possible to analyze arbitrary texts by computer algorithms and transfer the obtained analysis results to forecasting modules as input layers.

Of course, this is a greatly simplified and idealized example.

These three words are the bane of Bitcoiners’ existence. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts use the acronym FUD to describe any negativity that might be swirling around the market that causes prices to drop. And the FUD was strong this week, when the whole cryptocurrency ecosphere got fucked.    What the Heck Happened to the Cryptocurrency This Week?!     Two major corrections over the last month have caused the price of bitcoin to plummet by 45 percent, and the entire cryptocurrency market has fallen with it. So, has the bubble burst? Probably not just yet. When will it? Nobody knows.  Recent Video from Gizmodo VIEW MORE >   LG's Canyon of OLEDs Is Trippy Cool 01/11/2018 All that’s certain is that people who bought in at the peak of cryptocurrency fervor are currently getting their asses handed to them. Meanwhile, reports of people taking out loans and mortgages for the privilege of getting hosed are more common than ever. Financial outlets are already charting “the rise and fall of Bitcoin,” and on January 15, the normally unflappable loyalists on Reddit were straight up admitting that doomsday had come.  Why is this happening? FUD.  Over the course of 2017, the price of one bitcoin went from around $900 to just over $19,000. This led to average Joes wondering what they were missing and trying to figure out how to buy into this whole Bitcoin thing. In a month, bitcoin’s price jumped by 200 percent, hitting yet another all-time high. It seemed like it couldn’t fall—until it did. And then it did it again.  There are a lot of factors driving fear in cryptocurrency markets at the moment, but from a big picture perspective, you can really focus on three factors: governments, whales, and ICO madness.  Governments  In 2017, none of these factors seemed to be capable of taking down Bitcoin. Governments would make a comment about reviewing potential cryptocurrency regulation, the price would dip for a day and then rocket to the moon for a week. But lately, governments have been paying a little bit too much attention for anyone to feel comfortable.  China has recently been particularly concerning to the cryptocurrency market. The country previously banned initial coin offerings and exchanges—two moves that had minor impacts on prices—China’s continued regulatory scrutiny is starting to have a more lasting effect.  This week, Chinese state media reported that authorities were broadening their crackdown and scrutinizing “exchange-like services.” Simply put, China wants to eliminate all cryptocurrency trading that’s managed to continue under the current bans. This announcement came two weeks after the country imposed new rules that will adversely affect the many cryptocurrency miners in China, who are already struggling.. Until last year, China was the most active market for cryptocurrency trading, but it’s fallen to number 18 in the world according to market tracker Coinhills. Nevertheless, China is still the home of the world’s biggest mining operations.  Since China’s participation in the market has slowed, interest in South Korea has become more intense. But that interest comes with its own set of fears. The Korean Won is now the third most traded fiat currency, and that has made the South Korean government increasingly nervous about Bitcoin and its relatives. South Korean authorities have made several market-shaking moves in recent months, and more recently, conflicting statements from Seoul have suggested that an outright cryptocurrency ban might be imminent.  On the purely speculative end, Matthew Klein advanced an intriguing theory in the Financial Times. Klein thinks its possible that South Korea and China are coordinating their crackdowns on cryptocurrency in an effort to put more financial pressure on North Korea in the ongoing standoff over its nuclear program. North Korea is believed to have a large stake in cryptocurrencies and its state-sponsored hackers are often blamed for attacks on exchanges and spreading ransomware that seeks payment through digital cash. It’s an interesting scenario, but again, speculative.  While many governments are trying to figure out what kind of limits they want to put on the market, others are introducing their own digital coins. Estonia has a coin in the works that would be used to reward foreigners who set up online businesses in the country. More disconcertingly, Venezuela and Russia have announced digital versions of their currencies in an effort that’s widely seen as a way of getting around international sanctions. In the case of government issued coins, it’s unknown if they will be a harbinger of a crackdown on non-state-sponsored cryptocurrency. In short: more FUD.  Whales  And then, there’s the phenomenon of Bitcoin “whales.” Whales are people who own a lot of bitcoin. Market researchers at AQR Capital Management estimated that just 1,000 people own 40 percent of all the bitcoin in existence, giving just a few individuals have a tremendous amount of power to manipulate the market. That happened in November, when one person moved $159 million worth of bitcoin onto an online exchange and sent analysts scrambling to guess whether or not this whale was intending to sell out while the price is right.  What’s most concerning about whales recently is the fear that some of them might be playing both sides of the field. In December, Wall Street started offering futures trading on bitcoin. Anyone can essentially place a bet on what the price of bitcoin will be by a certain date. This has led to speculation that whales could be participating in futures trading while pulling out or pumping in bitcoin to manipulate the price. On Wednesday, the first futures contract closed and those who shorted bitcoin won.  And whales aren’t the only individuals who can swing the market. A recent study published in the Journal of Monetary Economics took a look at the potential for price manipulation in the bitcoin ecosystem. It concluded that when the price of bitcoin jumped from $150 to $1000 over two months in 2013, it was all thanks to two bots named Markus and Willy that were likely controlled by a single person. The bots were capable of taking advantage of a bug on the Mt. Gox exchange that made it appear as if they were performing valid trades with lots of bitcoin that didn’t really exist.",False

An ICO is similar to the initial public offering on the stock market as well as an entrepreneur seeking venture capital funding. Someone comes up with an idea, they present a plan, and people fund it with cryptocurrency. But unlike the businesses on the stock market, an ICO can be practically anything. People have funded a single afterparty through an ICO. An ICO can also include the launch of its own branded cryptocurrency or altcoin.  Ethereum was the most important ICO pioneer. It’s a unique blockchain technology with numerous applications for businesses, and it’s a currency called ether. While Bitcoin’s price went up 1,000 percent in 2017, Ether’s price rose by 8,000 percent. This has sparked a wave of offerings and a mess of people throwing money at any of them. Prior to last year, the money raised through ICOs was extremely insignificant. But in 2017, $3.5 billion flooded the ICO space.  The ICO trend seems shady, too. It’s tough to say how many of the hundreds of ICOs out there are scams, but it’s a large number. OneCoin was a particularly prominent Ponzi scheme that bilked investors around the world out of $350 million, seems to have never issued an actual coin, and resulted in the arrest of numerous organizers. Plenty of other scam ICOs are still flying under the radar, aren’t necessarily illegal, so they will probably never amount to anything.  In the end, governments, whales, and ICO madness are just three sources of fear, uncertainty, and doubt. But there are plenty of other reasons that Bitcoin is such a risky investment. The fact is, no one on can actually give you good advice on cryptocurrencies accept the whales, and they don’t really go around broadcasting their next moves.  So for now, the FUD has people backing away, but one big swing in the other direction will have noobs coming back to the gold rush. If you’re thinking about becoming one of them, just know that the deck is stacked against you.",False

The reason why is a bit technical and complex, but if you get it, you‘ll know more about cryptocurrencies than most people do. So, let‘s try to make it as easy as possible:  To realize digital cash you need a payment network with accounts, balances, and transaction. That‘s easy to understand. One major problem every payment network has to solve is to prevent the so-called double spending: to prevent that one entity spends the same amount twice. Usually, this is done by a central server who keeps record about the balances.  In a decentralized network, you don‘t have this server. So you need every single entity of the network to do this job. Every peer in the network needs to have a list with all transactions to check if future transactions are valid or an attempt to double spend.",False

The consequences of this breakthrough are hard to overstate.""  - Marc Andreessen  From a cruising altitude, a blockchain might not look that different from things you're familiar with, say Wikipedia.  With a blockchain, many people can write entries into a record of information, and a community of users can control how the record of information is amended and updated. Likewise, Wikipedia entries are not the product of a single publisher. No one person controls the information.  Descending to ground level, however, the differences that make blockchain technology unique become more clear. While both run on distributed networks (the internet), Wikipedia is built into the World Wide Web (WWW) using a client-server network model.  A user (client) with permissions associated with its account is able to change Wikipedia entries stored on a centralized server.  Whenever a user accesses the Wikipedia page, they will get the updated version of the 'master copy' of the Wikipedia entry. Control of the database remains with Wikipedia administrators allowing for access and permissions to be maintained by a central authority.  Wikipedia's digital backbone is similar to the highly protected and centralized databases that governments or banks or insurance companies keep today. Control of centralized databases rests with their owners, including the management of updates, access and protecting against cyber-threats.  The distributed database created by blockchain technology has a fundamentally different digital backbone. This is also the most distinct and important feature of blockchain technology.  Wikipedia's 'master copy' is edited on a server and all users see the new version. In the case of a blockchain, every node in the network is coming to the same conclusion, each updating the record independently, with the most popular record becoming the de-facto official record in lieu of there being a master copy.  Transactions are broadcast, and every node is creating their own updated version of events.  It is this difference that makes blockchain technology so useful – It represents an innovation in information registration and distribution that eliminates the need for a trusted party to facilitate digital relationships.  Yet, blockchain technology, for all its merits, is not a new technology.  Rather, it is a combination of proven technologies applied in a new way. It was the particular orchestration of three technologies (the Internet, private key cryptography and a protocol governing incentivization) that made bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto's idea so useful.  The result is a system for digital interactions that does not need a trusted third party. The work of securing digital relationships is implicit — supplied by the elegant, simple, yet robust network architecture of blockchain technology itself. Defining digital trust  Trust is a risk judgement between different parties, and in the digital world, determining trust often boils down to proving identity (authentication) and proving permissions (authorization).  Put more simply, we want to know, 'Are you who you say you are?' and 'Should you be able to do what you are trying to do?'  In the case of blockchain technology, private key cryptography provides a powerful ownership tool that fulfills authentication requirements. Possession of a private key is ownership. It also spares a person from having to share more personal information than they would need to for an exchange, leaving them exposed to hackers.  Authentication is not enough. Authorization – having enough money, broadcasting the correct transaction type, etc – needs a distributed, peer-to-peer network as a starting point. A distributed network reduces the risk of centralized corruption or failure.  This distributed network must also be committed to the transaction network’s recordkeeping and security. Authorizing transactions is a result of the entire network applying the rules upon which it was designed (the blockchain’s protocol).  Authentication and authorization supplied in this way allow for interactions in the digital world without relying on (expensive) trust. Today, entrepreneurs in industries around the world have woken up to the implications of this development – unimagined, new and powerful digital relationshionships are possible. Blockchain technology is often described as the backbone for a transaction layer for the Internet, the foundation of the Internet of Value.  In fact, the idea that cryptographic keys and shared ledgers can incentivize users to secure and formalize digital relationships has imaginations running wild. Everyone from governments to IT firms to banks is seeking to build this transaction layer.  Authentication and authorization, vital to digital transactions, are established as a result of the configuration of blockchain technology.  The idea can be applied to any need for a trustworthy system of record.  Authored by Nolan Bauerle; images by Maria Kuznetsov      I looove this article about blockchain!",False

At the moment, there are several scenarios of using DTT: ● subscription payment for using the services of the system; ● subscription payment for access to the machine learning constructor, payment of the use of computing power to create and train own models; ● purchasing models and strategies developed by other participants of the system in the marketplace; ● payment of personal or collective orders. Subscription to use the services of the system  Each user should pay for subscription in order to gain access to the system’s services, screeners of financial instruments, trading strategies, ICO / IPO scoring modules, performing operations in the marketplace, etc. There will be different options for subscription, so a trader can choose the package of services that he needs. Payment for the use of machine learning constructor  If a developer or trader wants to use the DataTrading system to develop his own trading advisor, screener, scoring or forecasting model, he can purchase a subscription to access the machine learning constructor. In addition to the subscription, the user will be asked to pay for the use of computing power of the system (calculated as the number of hours spent on the calculation multiplied by the cost of one hour of calculation). The resulting training models can be used either for the user’s own trading or for sale in the marketplace. For more information on using the machine learning constructor, see Section 3.4. “Open Constructor of Machine Learning Models”. Purchasing of models and strategies developed by other system participants in the marketplace  Each user has the opportunity to purchase alternative models developed by other system participants in addition to using standard models of forecasts, scoring, and scanning available in various versions of the DataTrading subscription. Depending on the terms of use, set by the developer, the models may have: ● limitation on the maximum number of users (in order to ensure the uniqueness of the result of the forecast and, as a consequence, to limit the circle of traders who can benefit from the use of this model, thus increasing the interest of traders in this model); ● limited or unlimited time of use (the trader can either purchase the eternal right to use a model or for a certain period of time, for example, for a month with the possibility to extend the right to use in the next period)   SO this is basically how you can use DTT tokens, right?

We are using artificial neural networks,which are one of the methods of machine learning and serve to solve many tasks, such as image recognition problems, discriminant analysis, approximation, clustering methods, decision making, forecasting, etc. Artificial neural networks are built on the principle of the organization and functioning of biological neural networks (networks of nerve cells of a living organism). Neural networks can find and identify relationships between input parameters (even if these relationships are not known in advance) and make very accurate forecasts based on the found patterns. Thus, it is possible to build trading strategies based on well-trained neural networks that, in terms of their profitability, will far exceed traditional algorithmic strategies, based on the use of technical indicators. Also, neural networks can be successfully used to select investment tools from many others available on the exchange, which can bring maximum profit in the short or long term.",False

So here are his replies.    In DataTrading system we try our best to move away from the classical technical indicators, especially those in which you need to adjust the parameters. Instead, our team is using machine learning algorithms. On the one hand, we focus on neural networks, but we also know how to work with other machine learning algorithms. We plan to provide complete list of machine learning algorithms with simple and understandable interface for using them in the final product of DataTrading.   Quote from: illiki23 on November 04, 2017, 04:24:29 PM I see you address some of these things in the whitepaper.  LSTM cells would be great!   I do have a few concerns about the scope and feasibility of the project.  As it is machine learning and AI is used extensively in algorithmic trading and adapts rather fast.  You need to construct a platform which allows for quick adaptation. We are developing a model, which is capable of self-learning. Currently our team is working on the criteria for the assessment of model's learning quality with possible settings for its optimization. Thus, the flexibility of the model and the adjustment to the trader's tasks will not require a deep understanding of the learning process and will also allow the trader to  adapt model to his needs quickly and independently.   Quote from: illiki23 on November 04, 2017, 04:24:29 PM On a side note - it would be really neat to incentivize hand labeling and tagging of data points.  One problems with machine learning is a lack of labeled training data.  I like unsupervised and semi supervised learning but supervised learning is just so powerful.   Tokens could be provided to people though you would want to establish some sort of expert ranking based on how accurate they are. Yes, we agree, lack of labeled training data may be a problem in machine learning. We've setup automatic data labeling according to our profit function. We also make automatic clusterization that does not need labeling.",False

Today we are proud to announce our first demo to you. Its main idea is to give you the understanding of the future functionality of the DataTrading platform. So far, it’s only a backtesting product. You can test it here: http://demo.data-trading.com/  These are only the first steps of the Artificial intelligence learning for detecting entry point for 250 stocks on Shenzhen Exchange during 2012–2016 by DataTrading.  5 neural networks calculate expediency of going long for each stock and the aggregated score is derived. The higher the score rate is – the greater is the probability of getting the profit for more than 2% on each order during the next 10 days.  As a result, you get an aggregated heatmap for all available stocks price change and score change. The platform gives you pieces of advice where to invest and what deals to skip. In our demo, we used the past stock data of 2012 – 2016 just for the sake of proving the concept and giving you, as a user, an idea of what you will get in the the future product when you work with the real-time data.
