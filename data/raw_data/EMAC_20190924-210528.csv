First of all, we will remove bank fees and hidden commissions, but that would not be enough to be competitive with the big names in the e-commerce world. That's why we need to build better technical implementation by putting more effort in making it faster, more user-friendly while combining everything in a modern design. To achieve this we decided to use Offline First approach. What is Offline First? Imagine that you are trying to buy a product or just to check the price of it, while you are on the subway or in the mountains, or inside a building, or you are on a long trip or training in the gym (places, where the possibility to have a good Internet connection, is limited). Normally the effect is always the same: an error message, or even worse, an infinitely spinning progress indicator that never gets us anywhere. With offline first implementation, customers will be able to use the platform and to buy goods, even when you don’t have an Internet connection. The data will be stored locally on your device and will periodically try to upload and replicate the data in the cloud.  We will use AI to help us to promote you the products that you actually need based on your behavior on the site. For the sellers who are going to use our subscription-based model, we will offer them to create a 3d objects for their products. 3d objects will help them to sell much more products because the customers can see very detailed how it looks. Furthermore, it will be available to see it in VR environment.  Also, we believe that we can build faster e-commerce platform than Amazon (which currently is the fastest one). Our SEO which is our main platform architecture was part of a team that builds faster e-commerce website in Germany beating even Amazon. So we have the know-how to achieve this.",False

The subscription-based model it's for the merchants and will happen to throw smart contracts. Smart contracts will be used also in every purchase, regardless if it is done in fiat payment or EMAC. In case the buyer chooses to use fiat for purchasing, our exchange algorithm will convert it into EMAC internally and send it to the smart contract. The EMAC Token will be then halted for a certain period, before being sent to the reseller/business. The duration of this halt depends on the account and rating of the reseller/business.

We will also try to do a better technical implementation by putting more effort into making it faster, more user-friendly while combining everything in a modern design. In our team, we have developers who had works for one of the biggest retailer worldwide with more than 2 billion yearly revenue and they were a part of the team that builds the fastest site in Germany beating even Amazon. So we have the concept in our head how to handle this.  Furthermore, one of our technical decisions is the platform to be Offline First. With an offline first approach, data is written locally on your phone device and periodically trying to upload and replicated in the cloud. Imagine that you are in the mountains or in the subway where you don’t have an internet connection. Our store will be replicated to your phone (is not going to take so much space. We are talking about kilobytes). So in case when you don’t have an internet connection you can still buy the product. You will see in the front end of our website that you have bought the product. But in the backend that would happen when your device finds an internet connection and upload the purchase data to our cloud service. So instead of seeing an error message, or an infinitely spinning progress indicator that at the end never gets you anywhere.",False

A platform where neither customers nor merchants, will have to pay any commissions or registration fees.

With additional payments, they will be able to increase the visibility of the product(s) they have listed. This will be done by bumping their listings higher in the search results of customers. Having this increase in visibility will help merchants to gain more exposure, and thus, substantially increase the amount of sales they make.  Subscript ion-based The subscription-based model is aimed solely for merchants. Upon subscribing they shall receive the following benefits: promotion of their goods with better quality pictures, compressed automatically by the eMarketChain platform, along with a broader suggestion engine for the items or services they are offering; weekly suggestions on how to improve their advertisements, provided by our dedicated marketing specialists; similar to the freemium approach, the possibility to list their offers higher in the results shown to the customers; The subscription fee per month is fixed and will be between 19$ - 49$ depending on the chosen package.",False

The other 11–13% go into the pocket of the online stores like Amazon. eMarketChain will remove these unfair taxes. How will eMarketChain profit, if we remove the additional taxes? Our income will be derived mostly from our two types of business models:  Freemium — we give the opportunity for merchants to get more out of our platform. With additional payments, they will be able to increase the visibility of the product(s) they have listed. This will be done by bumping their listings higher in the search results of customers. Having this increase in visibility will help merchants to gain more exposure, and thus, substantially increase the amount of sales they make;  Subscription-based — upon subscribing they shall receive the following benefits:  promotion of their goods with better quality pictures, compressed automatically by the eMarketChain platform, along with a broader suggestion engine for the items or services they offer.  weekly suggestions on how to improve their advertisements, provided by our dedicated marketing specialists; similar to the freemium approach, the possibility to list their offers higher in the results shown to customers; The subscription fee per month is fixed and will be between 19$ — 49$ depending on the chosen package.  The models are completely optional and users will not lose any main functionality and options provided by eMarketChain.co, when using the system for free.

Just as a reference, Amazon has 14% commision. 1-3% is going to bank taxes. The other 11-13% is going into the pocket of the online stores. Our income will be mostly from our two types of business models:  Freemium - we give the opportunity for merchants to get more out of our platform. With additional payments, they will be able to increase the visibility of the product(s) they have listed. This will be done by bumping their listings higher in the search results of customers. Having this increase in visibility will help merchants to gain more exposure, and thus, potentially increasing the amount of sales they make substantially.  Subscription-based - Upon subscribing they shall receive the following benefits: promotion of their goods with better quality pictures compressed automatically by the eMarketChain platform, along with a broader suggestion engine for the items or services they are offering; weekly suggestions on how to improve their advertisements, provided by our dedicated marketing specialists; similar to the freemium approach, the possibility to list their offers higher in the results shown to customers.  The subscription fee per month is fixed and will be between 19$ - 49$ depending on the chosen package The models are completely optional and users will not lose any main functionality and options provided by eMarketChain.co, when using the system for free.

EMAC will be used in every purchase from the eMarketChain marketplace, regardless if it is done in fiat payment or EMAC. In case the buyer chooses to use fiat for purchasing, our exchange algorithm will convert it into EMAC internally and send it to the smart contract. The EMAC Token will be then halted for a certain period, before being sent to the reseller/business. The duration of this halt depends on the account and rating of the reseller/business. This is very important for the EMAC value. That means that in any certain moment there could be EMAC tokens in end-customers, merchants, exchanges or other roles with business connected to EMAC, but also a great amount will be “stocked” in smart contracts for the refund period. Higher adoption of eMarketChain.co means more purchases each day and more EMAC tokens locked in smart contracts. Having in mind that all EMACs will be created on the token sale event and no further tokens will be created ever again, that can only mean that supply will get shorter with the locked tokens. Our opinion is that such difference in supply and demand can only drive the price of EMAC up. The main thing that we are offering is 15% cheaper goods (thanks to the blockchain technology) on our e-commerce platform.

If you are referring to the value of the coin in the different stages of the ICO, then:  In the Pre-Sale 1 ETH will get you 12,000 EMAC tokens, and in the main ICO event - 1 ETH will get you between 11,500 and 10,000 depending on the stage you purchase your tokens. With regards to the long-term value of the EMAC token, we have written an article that we hope will give you a clear idea - https://medium.com/@emarketchain/emac-token-economy-and-its-core-value-9fe67bc8284  Although we are looking into cooperation with exchanges, we are waiting until the end of the ICO to announce a commitment.",False

You can check at https://emarketchain.co/emarket/ On Q3 2018 we are planning to release the first big update of the platform that includes a working checkout process.  Our platform allows using standard payment methods such as credit/debit card, PayPal, Adyen and other well-known methods.  EMAC will be used in every purchase from the eMarketChain marketplace, regardless if it is done in fiat payment, or EMAC. In case the buyer chooses to use fiat for purchasing, our exchange algorithm will convert it into EMAC internally and send it to the smart contract without losing any money. Thus, EMAC will be taken out of market circulation during the period of transaction.

And yes, you pay a hidden taxes on eBay. The price of the products include this hidden taxes, so the manufacturer's are forced to add this 12 % to the price of the product because eBay takes it from them and at the end, you get the product on higher price.

We are not only going to implement payment methods but an e-commerce platform as well. We hope people will start trusting us and will start using our platform because we are not going to have hidden commissions. I am not talking about skipping the bank and standard payment methods, because taxes from the banks are between 1-3% depending on which bank you use. For example, Amazon takes 14% commission. So the question is: where do the other 11% go if 3% goes to the bank. The answer is that they go directly into the pocket of the online stores. Therefore the main idea of our platform is not only to skip the bank and start using cryptocurrencies but also not to add additional taxes to our customers.",False
