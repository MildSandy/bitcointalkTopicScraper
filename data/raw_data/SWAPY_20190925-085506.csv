This could be attributable to the prohibitive distances that potential customers must travel to bank branches, or because such populations do not earn enough money for the banks to value them as clients. The consequence is that these individuals are excluded from the global credit ecosystem.  This is an excerpt from the whitepaper of Swapy, page 7.

Q1: As part of your use case, Swapy Network will be the facilitator between the investor and the credit company. Do you have a list of credit companies/entities that you have already talked with who are willing to participate in your network? A: We have been working close with 3 credit companies from Brazil to validate their needs while building our tool. We can not disclose their names because they are not officially our clients yet, but there is a great interest among the new digital lenders to join our network, as we can reduce their cost of funding in half.  Q2: How will Swapy network credit-score the loan applicant? Will this credit scoring be done by swapy or a 3rd party? A: We adopted an Open Innovation approach. So, Swapy Network will be the way to aggregate and share people¬¥s financial data, but the actual credit scoring for each loan will be done either by the Credit companies lending to the applicants, or by a especialized credit scoring company. We are in advanced talks with one of the biggest Alternative Credit Scoring companies in the world to join the Swapy Network and offer their model for the companies, charging for it in Swapy Tokens.

The second is Swapy Financial ID, which aims to empower people, giving them a financial identity that has the purpose to be valid anywhere in the world.  And the third is Swapy Data Market, which aims to transform users' nancial data into self-determined value through a token-based system. This suite of decentralized applications will allow the individuals to hold their own data and to choose how many tokens they receive in exchange for it, and when, and with whom they want to share.

With our first DApp (available in alpha: https://www.swapy.network) we will allow already established credit providers from emerging nations (high interest rates) to have access to capital from investors from developed nations (low interest rates) with no intermediaries, and then provide more affordable loans to underserved people contributing to financial inclusion - everything traceable, thanks to blockchain technology. This is a faster go to market strategy since they already have the distribution channels and operations established, and are also compliant with countries' regulation.   We also solve the problem of information asymmetry with two other proposed DApps: a self-sovereign identity and a p2p data market place powered by this decentralized identities. We expect that in the medium term, we will have the infrastructure (on top of Ethereum blockchain) to perform tasks such as financial data storage and processing in a decentralized manner (homomorphic encryption and data mining may help to keep the privacy). It would be a second layer network of nodes receiving rewards in SWAPY.  So, I would argue that the main difference is that we cover the pillars of the problem (high spread in emerging nations and lack of good information about the borrowers) in a whole and we are up to build something that is much more than just smart contracts, but also the needed infrastructure to accomplish our mission of Universal Access to Credit.",False

See my answer followed by our bounty rules' quotes:  1) You must create at least 21 relevant post during the whole campaign. It is not every week.  ""Write at least 21 relevant posts during the campaign period, and you will be eligible for the bounty and receive the rewards after Swapy Network Team evaluations;""  2) It depends.  a) If we are talking about relevant posts for BitcoinTalk, you will already have your signature attached to the post, so it is enough. It is important to be concise with the topic because we do not want our bounty participants to flood BitcoinTalk (and any other media) with spams. The key idea here is to inform and engage people with our goals.  ""NOTE: We will consider that posts are relevant if they: (1) Provide complete and reliable information in regard to the original posts; (2) They create interactive dialogue and discussions, but they need to be cohesive and consistent; (3) Posts must contains links with interesting and reliable sources; (4) Interesting images and videos are welcome as a compliment for the posts.""  b) If we are talking about social media or blogging (Twitter, Facebook, Medium, etc), you must provide at least one link to any Swapy's official content (website, blog, bitcointalk, etc).  ""When the tweet is created by yourself, it must contains links from us, such as official website and our username on Twitter @SwapyNetwork""  ""Contents must be unique and set up to public view, not private. The content must contain official links of Official Swapy Network Website or social media; (facebook, Twitter)""   --> Regarding our D'app download, you should have received an email with the link to download (Mac, Windows, Linux).

But also for all his support and evangelism for the blockchain technology in general. He famously predicted that Bitcoin would reach $10,000 in 2018. Which gave him the nickname of the Nostradamus of the Market. For those who do not know Tim Draper personally, he is a great mentor and business partner. His name is a beacon of trust to the world. He is always kind and available. Always knows how to encourage the entrepreneurs and advise them to think big, be bold and aim to change the world.

Thanks for your question. I am the CEO of Swapy Network, and it is a pleasure to talk.  Here are some key differences between us and the other projects:  1) The founders are from Brazil. In our country, the average loan has a 145% interest rate. We lived the problem of high cost of credit in our own skin. That is why we are so passionate to solve it and we will never give up on it.  2) We are obsessed with compliance and before proposing our solution, we consulted legal experts in three countries: Brazil, USA and Switzerland. Therefore, many other projects that depend on a pure P2P model will not work in Brazil, for example, because the legislation does not allow it.  3) We have world class investors and advisors. We have Tim Draper as our early investor and Don Tapscott as our advisor,  4) Our project is already in public Alpha. You can try it here: https://www.swapy.network/download  5) We are the one stop shop for a cheaper credit, and we work with the existing infrastructure. While some other ICO projects work providing the capital for the loans, and other work providing a credit scoring, Swapy Network is a complete solution for both problems.  6) We are Open Source. Which means that other teams from around the world can join our project and get paid to develop or improve it. We took this decision because we believe that we are #StrongerTogether!  If you have any doubt, please let us know.",False
