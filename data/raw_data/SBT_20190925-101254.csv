It was hosted by Congressman Jason Hsu, who dedicates to make Taiwan the future blockchain community center in Asia. Blockchain industry specialists around the world attended the summit to exchange technical information. Through this event, STAR BIT has absorbed abundant knowledge and techniques, while also promoted our STAR BIT Global Union project.    STAR BIT Global Union project provides decentralized exchange (DEX) services and technology transfer to build their own DEX for both software and hardware devices to DEX supporters. STAR BIT is set to have a worldwide targeting client base, which could integrate Taiwan‚Äôs blockchain community into a global scale.  Once the project is launched, all exchanges in the Union will be able to share the same order-pool. We can expect a dramatical increase in both amount and speed of transactions. Moreover, 50% of the daily trading fee will be rebated to the SBT holders as dividends. Potential counterparties include Australia, India, America, The Great Britain, Cambodia, and Hong Kong. South Korea and Thailand are under discussion with STAR BIT as well.  „Äê Photos of ABS„Äë   While Sway Tang, CEO of STAR BIT, was being interviewed by the press, Chang-Peng Zhao, Founder and CEO of Binance has also shared his thoughts towards STAR BIT and the blockchain community. Even though Mr. Zhao currently owns the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency exchange, but he remains humble and friendly. There‚Äôs a saying that goes ‚Äúpeople tend to draw close to modest people, and draw away from arrogant ones‚Äù. Perhaps, this is one of Mr. Zhao‚Äôs characteristics to make him such a successful businessman in cryptocurrency community.

The team has a very innovative and business solution-oriented culture. Most attendees of the summit are around their 30s, which allows STAR BIT to communicate with them easily by speaking their language, and to further introduce its specialties and targeting goal.     STAR BIT‚Äôs booth remains loaded of people even after the summit ends. Many institutional investors have expressed high interests in the Global Union project we proposed and stayed to learn more about further details.
