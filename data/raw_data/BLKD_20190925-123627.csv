We're very aware and are strategizing the best way(s) to create stability.  There are multiple options that we're considering.  We strongly believe in the strength of the Blinked project (with an existing product and audience of 13k already who joined while we were in dev) and itâ€™s use case, so we're confident that we'll be able to support the token value through both milestone achievements and strategy.
