Vishal Karangutkar: Prior to joining Block66 as a solidity developer, Karanguthar has worked as a principal engineer at Fidelity Investments and as a senior system engineer at Merrill Lynch.  Advisors Shingo Lavine: Lavine is the founder and CEO at Ethos. Hakim Thompson: Thompson was the vice-president at Goldman Sachsâ€™ Mortgages & Structured Products division before joining Behalf, an alternative financial provider for small to medium-sized businesses, as the director of finance. Rob Beswick: Beswick is the chief commercial officer at Virgin Mobile. Maurice Herlihy: Herlihy is a professor of computer science at Brown University and an advisor to Ethos and Algorand.  Partners Bounty0x: Bounty0x is a blockchain platform built on the 0x protocol, allowing people and companies to run bounty programs. Civic: Civic is a blockchain project which creates tools for identity protection and control.  Verdict Below is a breakdown of the risks and growth potential of Block66.  Risks     MVP will be launched Q1â€™ 2019. (-1.5)     Cryptocurrenciesâ€™ volatility is quite a big problem for lending platforms. (-1.5)  Growth Potential     Due to the money lending marketâ€™s unrealistic standards and unfair restrictions, so many peopleâ€™s demands are rejected. Once projects like Block66 earn these peopleâ€™s trust, this area will be definitely a hot one. (+2)     The presence of team members experienced in mortgage and real estate markets. (+2)     Fair token metrics. (+2)  Disposition The mortgage market is one of the biggest financial markets in the world, but due to institutional lendersâ€™ risk-averseness, many credible people and small companies are not able to get a loan even if there are smaller institutions and private lenders out there willing to make loans. Block66 is the first mortgage-focused lending and borrowing cryptocurrency project, aiming to break down this wall between these two sides. Although it is pretty much established between the cryptocurrency community that lending platforms provide an important use-case, the expected success is not met so far. Block66 has a fair shot at relative success by having team members experienced in mortgage loans and real estate. Yet, since MVP will not be released until next year, it is too early to tell. Block66 receives a 3/10.

Block66 introduces the first platform where lenders can access a marketplace of vetted borrowers looking for mortgage finance. This marketplace is public, transparent, and highly automated, so lending is streamlined, with lower costs, and lower risks. Each loan is represented as a pool of ""proof of loan"" (PoL) tokens that can be individually resold to investors, providing lenders with liquidity, and empowering a diverse pool of investors.  Block66 is building a new blockchain-enabled marketplace for mortgages. Institutional and private lenders can use the service to offer loans to a wide range of borrowers, introduced by Block66 broker partners. Through the practical use of smart contracts, loans can be taken from origination to facilitation, quickly and efficiently. All loans are also represented as tradable tokenized securities,providing a liquidity mechanism as standard. The ability to trade fractions of loans, and reduced order and issuing fees makes investing more inclusive, providing an attractive investment vehicle for all manner of investors. Thanks to the use of cryptocurrency, Block66 eliminates the need for a bank account, overcomes geographical lending restrictions and reduces counterparty risk to mere minutes. For borrowers, the transparent and competitive nature of the marketplace will benefit the consumer and give them confidence that theyâ€™re getting near enough the best offer achievable.         The Problem      The mortgage market in the USA is $9.9 trillion dollars, $32.9 trillion worldwide, and growing but risk averse institutions are reluctant to lend to many creditworthy consumers. Willing small lenders struggle to enter the space at scale. Existing processes and technology are cumbersome and siloed, compounding the problem for borrowers.       The Solution       Block66 streamlines the entire mortgage software and operations stack. For brokers, a one-stop-shop, including credit scoring, property appraisals and lender matching. For lenders of all sizes, a sustainable loan pipeline, auditing tool and mortgage securitization platform. For borrowers, a quick, hassle-free way to access the best credit opportunities.          Token Information               Roadmap           FAQ      Q: When is the B66 token sale? A: The Block66 pre-sale is being held on soon with the main-sale being held two weeks later after. Stay tuned for updates.  Q: When should I register? A: As soon as possible and as soon as registration opens. Better to be safe in case you have any KYC / AML issues which need ironing out. Keep checking back to see when registration comes online.  Q: What is the pre-sale discount? A: The pre-sale discount is 33%.  Q: Which cryptocurrencies are supported? A: You can buy B66 tokens with Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). You will be asked to provide a contribution address so we know who has transferred funds and also an address where you wish to receive your B66. When we receive payment from you we will swiftly follow up by transfering you your B66 tokens to the address you provided.
