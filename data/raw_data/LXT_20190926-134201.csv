Domain privacy and annual auto-renew is just standard at Namecheap where the domain is registered  Domain privacy is not only to hide the company who owns it which is on the website and freely available like you say but it's also to protect against spam you get from not having domain privacy   2... We haven't applied for any licenses yet. The FCA has already granted Coinbase an e-money license which is great news as it shows they are now officially granting licenses to Crypto companies   3... KYC is a must for investors to comply with the UK's AML laws. You can submit your details on our members system which you can sign up for on our site   Hope this answers all your questions and feel free to ask any others you have",False

There are now millions of ‘crypto traders’ around the world buying and selling hundreds of crypto coins/tokens every second of the day.  Current exchanges are even stopping new sign ups as they can’t handle the exponential growth the industry is seeing and customer support is being ignored.  Exchanges have been hacked and lost over a billion dollars in total of clients funds  Governments and regulation are knocking at the door  LCCX is coming  A fully regulated and insured against hacks crypto currency exchange based in London  An exchange where traders can buy and sell hundreds of different crypto coins against popular crypto’s or even popular fiat currencies like the US dollar.  A place with 24/7 customer support and live chat giving customers an industry leading user experience.  LCCX will charge low fees for traders and businesses listing their coins. All fees will be paid using a new token we are creating, The London Exchange Token or LXT for short.  There will be 100 million LXT created and we are selling 60% of them through our Initial Coin Offering (ICO)  As the exchange grows more and more users will require these tokens and we will also be using up to 25% of our profits to buy back and destroy 50m of them making the circulating supply decrease  We aim for LCCX to launch in the third quarter of this year and will be starting marketing in the second quarter. By mid 2019 our goal is to establish LCCX as the worlds most trusted crypto exchange and also one of the most used (based on daily volume).",False
