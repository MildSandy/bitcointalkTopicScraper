I'll be glad to answer any questions as best as I can. The past few months have been hectic. Apart from Remco project, we process payments for Western Union and many of the biggest money transmitters in the USA, in addition to mobile payment network we run.  Just to put Remco in context: After processing $billions in value and millions in transactions for the biggest money transmitters, interacted with senders,  recipients, and agents on a daily basis over the years, we gained useful insight into the remittance business that is not very common.  While the focus is on online /digital payments (an essential feature on Remco), the agent model is still very strong regarding the volume they bring in on a daily basis.  The agents on the hand are underpaid (low commission), and they have their own business they attend to, so sending money is not their priority in most cases.  Our non-blockchain solution was deployed early 2018, designed to cut agent time by 90%. It's was an instant hit!  The soft pilot is ongoing in the states of Illinois and Georgia on a run rate of $20m by the end of 2018. We also obtained money transmitter license in the state of Maryland in September 2018. We are not money transmitters in practice, but to demonstrate this new solution, we had to obtain the licenses.  This solution, however, is for a tiny market for now. To expand globally, the idea of leveraging blockchain was hatched, and Remco was born. We know exactly what is needed in this space and how blockchain fit into remittance.  Remittance is a very long chain of activities and each section is owned and protected by an entity including multi-jurisdictional requirements.  Therefore the blockchain solution must take all these factors into considerations to succeed.    Remco can accommodate an unlimited number of money transmitters, meaning that upon launch, global money transmitters can begin to mint tokens and distribute to senders in real-time. These tokens come with value and everything run on the blockchain.  There is an in-depth explanation of how this works in our white paper, including practical scenarios,  mathematics, and economics behind the demand for Remco token.  We believe that blockchain solution today is too difficult to use, so we designed Remco such that senders and recipients of money will not know they are using blockchain to send money. Recipients want instant access to the money to spend as they like.   How it works: When the token is used to send money, the money is deposited into the mobile wallet or bank account of the recipient in real-time in most jurisdictions. This capability is rare in the remittance blockchain model anywhere.  Also, to send $500 ($100 x 5) to five different people/relatives  today can cost up to $10 each or more= $50 fee. The token solution eliminates that because the sender only needs to activate it once and pay the activation fee which can be between $2.5-$5. After that, the sender can draw down on the entire value on the token and pay just a fraction ($0.99) or nothing depending on whether the money is deposited into a mobile wallet or bank account.  All these attributes are programmable by the remittance partners.   Finally, Remco was formed out of conviction after processing millions of transactions.  Thanks",False

Thanks for taking the time to answer our questions here. I can imagine that you are quite busy with the preparation for the ICO.  There is one thing I am still a bit confused.

Remember we are all about a practical solution that can actually work in this industry.  We have two token model: There is the utility and asset token (ERC 20) The utility is internally built, and transaction recording is on multichain.  As a money transmitter, there can be no delays, third-party verification, fluctuation in value for each transaction otherwise such blockchain solution will never work for remittance.  i.e., Bitcoin  To avoid the fate of other solutions which ultimately could not be used for real-time money transmission, we came up with Remco.

The REMCO Token Generating Platform’s APIs to allow any licensed money transmitter to mint programmable Tokens to move value and leverage distributed ledger advantages at speed and scale, while also offering innovative compensation to all transaction stakeholders. Our Token is Jurisdiction and Money Transmission Flow Agnostic. Meaning it works with the existing model.   Our parent company has Money transmitter and mobile payment licenses and has processed billions in transactions with millions of subscribers. You can read more about REMCO on our website http://www.remittancetoken.io  Why Choose Remco The REMCO Token solution is built using Multichain, and it includes a self-service B2B platform that not only allows money transmitters to enjoy the advantages of DLT using their existing cash-in networks, but to expand their networks by riding REMCOs reinvented processes for street corner agents.  PROBLEM Money transmitters have few and limited options for building and expanding their business on another’s rails.  Slow Speeds Traditional money transfer is slow for both money transmitters and their customers. New blockchain approaches are slower than many existing centralized systems.  High costs Many corridors remain very costly, and pricing for small-value transfers is foolish. Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies require miner compensation, are inefficient and can’t scale.  Vanishing commissions Stakeholders in the cash-based money transfer processes are increasingly frustrated by more work for less pay, leading to less participation and fewer consumer options.  Tough entry Conventional platforms have entry barriers that are too high for affiliate networks; REMCO addresses this shortcoming.   Unstable operation A technical failure can paralyze all affiliate networks on a centralized platform, until the cause is detected and rectified.   REMCO PLATFORM Options for money transmitters to build their business with technology that fits their use cases and addresses their pain points using programmable tokens that can run on the rails of our global platform for remittance.  Scalable REMCO uses a blockless tangle on which transactions essentially self-verify, providing the speed needed to ramp up.  Decentralized REMCO runs on a distributed ledger technology known as a Multichain blockchain.  Lower costs Our solution does not involve miners to verify transactions, and be paid. Even micropayments can be made affordably!  Security REMCO Tokens are thought to be quantum-proof, though this is subject to additional scrutiny and study.  Re-engineered Process at Cash Agents The REMCO Prepaid solution requires less time to sell than present methods, offers bonus commissions and gives tremendous control and value to the customer. Data analytics allow aggregation from multiple networks.   Remco Main Features  MULTICHAIN BLOCKCHAIN REMCO uses blockchain protocol that require no third party POW and virtually no fee. The result is unparallel speed and cost savings for users.  SUCCESSFUL AUTHORIZATIONS With over a decade’s experience connecting to receive-side payments and banking infrastructure, our platform works!  FASTER SPEED OF PAYOUT No more waiting for a batch process or other slow payout processes.  COMMISSIONS FOR AGENTS We simplify the transaction process for agents and even offer the possibility of bonus commissions based on sender preferences.  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PLUS HUMAN EXPERIENCE Elements of the platform will get smarter over time through AI and the unique platform itself is the result of over a decade’s experience building and running platforms for remittances and payments, integrating them with banks, bank switches and other infrastructure providers and complying with central banks.  Why Remittance Token (REMCO)? VTNGlobal has processed over $700,000,000 in the last 2 years and we clearly see the opportunity of process reengineering combined with distributed ledger technology to make a big impact in the industry. We have designed the REMCO Token to have tremendous utility and to be programmable, for instance in cases where a remittance partner wishes to offer a promotion.  By both creating the tech platform and offering a B2B self-service option, VTNGLOBAL believes that the REMCO Token can have transformational effects, not only for its own businesses but for partners as well.  Through this ICO we will have the necessary funds to finance our project, pay salaries, cover marketing and legal matter expenses and invest in research and development, and offer buyers of REMCO Remittance Tokens a low and discounted price.
