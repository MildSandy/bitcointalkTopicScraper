It will take time. Lots of time to dismantle a system that has been in place for centuries. The concept of bail can be traced back to 399 BC, when Plato tried to create a bond for the release of Socrates. The modern bail system evolved from a series of laws originating in the middle ages in England. Right now the plan is to disrupt the key players in the current system using innovation such as blockchain, peer-to-peer and a cryptocurrency.

Which has security, accountability, transparency in its core. We switched from Ethereum recently. Because with NEM we aren't limited to solidity and can mix match and combine many different technologies via it's REST API. Plus combining Namespaces (unique domains), Mosaics (customizable assets), 2.0 multisig contracts, and three forms of messaging give an advantage. The architecture allows us to build the platform and applications for almost every operating system and device with the same degree of decentralization and security. Compared to Ethereum, NEM can scale to hundreds of transactions per second and has already been tested privately and independently to scale to thousands of transactions per second in the Catapult release. Lastly, we can easily integrate both public and private blockchains as we partner with jails and detention centers and help them move towards blockchain technology.",False

You have to remember the person arrested hasn't been charged, so they are considered innocent. Yet, they are held in jail awaiting trial and in the meantime, they lose their job, can't pay their bills, can't take care of their family, etc. This could be someone arrested for driving with a suspended license because they forgot to notify the driver's license office of their new address.

BAIL Token is a platform for the future of bail payments that is being built on top of the NEM blockchain. It will enable peer-to-peer bail payments using a cryptocurrency token and will offer seamless integration with jail and detention center systems, bail payment kiosks, and Mainprise ambassadors.  Token holders are able to manually or automatically configure the platform to make payments based on their preferences. Payments are refunded regardless of the trial outcome and token holders earn fees based on the risk scoring of the defendants.

I'll address the various actors:  1. Tokens holders trust will be gained by the use of a risk scoring tool prior to them contributing their token for bail. And a smart contract detailing the payments, fees, etc written to the blockchain.  2. Family or friends request bail trust will be built by having open agreement on the blockchain details the fees (if any) and other details.  3. Jails and detention centers trust will be built by integrating directly with their systems for payment, providing payment via kiosk in the lobby they allow to be installed or paying at the bail windows via fiat by a Mainprise ambassador.",False

The most important is building a bail fund. This is the funding source of the bail payments. Token holders simply stake (or escrow) their tokens and the platform pays the jail or detention center fiat from the bail fund until wider acceptance is made and the jails accept BAIL Tokens. The courts refund the bail payment upon attendance of trail which goes back into the bail fund. And the tokens are release back to the token holders along with a percentage of the fee paid by the family/friend requesting a bail payment.",False
