In its simplest form basic income is a pure, unconditional income with no means test. That means its paid to you regardless of your salary, wealth and employment status.  It’s been hailed as a way to streamline social security all over the world, especially as technological advances reduce the need for human labor. There are some pilots already underway, most recently in Finland. And it’s found support among high profile business leaders such as Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg.  The idea isn’t new however. Back in the time of the American Revolution, one of the Founding Fathers - Thomas Paine — argued in favour of the idea. The 18th Century was, of course, a time of great poverty and inequality — but with both increasing today, perhaps it’s time to reconsider the idea for the (post)capitalist age.  A basic income doesn’t just free people from poverty and inequality though. What really attracted us to the idea was that it frees people from “wage slavery” — that is, being forced to work. At MyBit we believe that everyone should be able to follow their passions instead of having to work to simply survive. After all, if you are going to dedicate many hours to something at the very least it should be a passion, right?  While we can never promise that MyBit will eradicate inequality, what we can do is offer equality of opportunity. By redefining the way people generate income, MyBit offers a new way of making money. Through harnessing the power of machines and owning a share of these assets, people can open up alternate revenue streams to selling their labor alone. This extra income can give everyone the freedom to do whatever they want — and, hopefully, live a happier, freer life.  For us, this makes complete sense. Every person is empowered to develop themselves on their own terms in their own time. The effects aren’t just personal though.  Happier, healthier people can also have a huge impact on the economy. With a streamlined benefits system, the costs of social welfare will plummet. Crime will decline as people no longer have to struggle to survive. Both would be a massive boost to the economy — and that’s just the start. The full effects of a universal basic income have yet to be imagined, let alone studied.  It’s just another reason why we’re excited about the potential of this idea — and we’re keen to play a part in our own way. While a true basic income may be a long way off, all of the MyBit team are working — step by step — towards our own unique solution.",False

As a key part of our platform, it’s worth taking some time to go through exactly how this role works — and what it means in for the wider ecosystem.  First, though, what is an Asset Manager? Here at MyBit, we imagine a fully-automated, decentralized future. The problem is even autonomous machines need some human oversight. And this is where the Asset Manager comes in.  Asset Managers are the people in charge of overseeing asset deployment, maintenance, updates and repairs. They’re involved in everything. At the start, this may mean planning location, approvals, permits and marketing. Once the asset is deployed, this means maintenance and making sure it continues operating and generating revenue. It’s an incredibly important role in the MyBit ecosystem.",False

The team have had an action-packed couple of months and have a few massive updates to share. In short, we have expanded our scope from just a product company to an infrastructure focused entity. This means that outside of our internal projects of MyBit Go and MYDAX, we are open sourcing our SDKs to make it easy for anyone to build, test, deploy, and maintain a wide range of wealth management use cases on Ethereum. All powered by the MyBit Network. The MyBit Token (MYB) acts as the native token that powers all dApps built using MyBit infrastructure and we have implemented a burning functionality which constantly reduces the overall supply of the MyBit Token. This means that not only is MYB burnt for using MyBit Go and MYDAX, but also any dApp utilising the MyBit Network. We have also been working with Status.im and have made massive strides towards our vision of becoming a decentralised and automated company. Finally, we have some news about the second phase of the MyBit Token Distribution. https://medium.com/mybit-dapp/mybit-announcement-blog-october-2018-db783447030d",False

It is comprised of the MyBit Network, MyBit Whitelabel Software Development Kit (MyBit SDK), and Decentralised Development Fund (DDF). These resources enable the rapid building, testing, and deployment of wealth management applications on the Ethereum Blockchain.  In addition to infrastructure, MyBit is also developing two internal products powered by the MyBit Network. MyBit Go is an investment platform focused on the Internet of Things and MYDAX is a decentralised exchange that enables the buyinging, selling, and transferring of cryptographic assets. Both of these products allow users to transact and invest without brokers and other intermediaries as well as receive revenue in real time.

The DDF is a key part of MyBit’s move to a decentralised autonomous organisation, moving development away from the team and to the community. It rewards anyone for their contribution — from developers to designers and marketers, all over the world.  Since launching this month, we’ve had over 40 tasks completed by 10+ contributors. Major projects include the completion of the MyBit Will dApp, a new, easier way to create a will without the time and expense of a solicitor. Another was Dropzone, our latest dApp that lets you create ERC20 airdrops on the Ethereum network.  In addition, contributors have helped to develop some key functionalities for the MyBit Network: from accepting any token as payment and automatically converting it to MYB to developing voting with MYB tokens.  Marketing News This month, the team were excited to announce a collaboration with Enigma. In our MyBit + Enigma blog, we set out a proposal for combining the Enigma Protocol and the MyBit Network to provide a security layer for use cases where there are serious privacy concerns. This is essential as we build a market-leading platform for truly decentralised applications.  The team attended Devcon 4 in Prague, Czech Republic. MyBit sponsored this year’s Status hackathon, with over 500 developers in attendance. All of the team were proud to be part of the movement bringing blockchain technology to a global audience.  Team News Ian has been involved in some high-profile speaking events, including the Crypto Valley Blockchain Finance Summit and a roundtable on the future of sustainable work at Revision in Berlin this month.

Since then, we’ve been working tirelessly to build on our progress so far. And today, we’re proud to announce an exclusive partnership with Ability Concept, a smart bench and hardware sensor platform provider based in Prague.  This means we’re now partnered with smart bench providers across the Middle East and Central Europe. Two of the biggest markets for smart benches in the world right now. And we’re in prime position in both.  We’re particularly excited to be working with a smart tech company in Central Europe, especially Prague. Prague is an amazing place for crypto projects. From Trezor, the original Bitcoin hardware wallet, which was founded there, to Slush Pool, the world’s first Bitcoin mining pool. There’s also Paralelni Polis and the Institute of Cryptoanarchy, which is driving thinking in the cryptocurrency space. Right now, Prague is a hotbed for all things blockchain.

So let’s dive right in and we’ll give you the lowdown on what we’ve been up to.    We’ve been working hard on our dapp, bringing it up to date with the newest version of web3. There were a few bugs and issues with the update that meant we had to redo some of the front-end of our website to make it all run smooth.  It’s important to remember that we’re dealing with emerging technologies and so a fair amount of reworking comes with the territory. Ethereum isn’t even at 1.0 yet, and so there are constantly unexpected things popping up that our dev team have to deal with. And make no mistake, web3 is full of surprises. In the broadest sense, it’s the decentralised web; the next stage of the world wide web, if you like. The important part for MyBit is that web3 determines how smart contracts interact with the front-end website you see.  The good news is we’re expanding our dev team and deepening our expertise. We’ve got three more front-end developers and designers joining us in Berlin in July (Europe has long notice periods when it comes to moving companies). They’ll also be helping us to continuously improve the functionality of our site. And with them on board, we’ll have all the resources and manpower we need to get the dapp up to speed and, maybe even, ahead of schedule.    https://medium.com/mybit-dapp/weekly-update-w-22-6f0e3d06f254",False

We started the week with some big news: we’re now integrated with the Bancor Protocol. Basically, it’s the opposite of a centralized exchange, instead Bancor is a decentralized liquidity network. The platform offers users continuous, cross-chain liquidity, which means you’re able to convert any two tokens without a counterparty.  We want to integrate all of this functionality into our DApp. We’re going to build a one-click buy option within the DApp itself, while any token on the Bancor Network can be converted in a few simple clicks from the MyBit platform. All in a super user-friendly UI.  We’re also happy to say that MyBit is now listed on IDEX, the world’s largest decentralized exchange. IDEX is a truly revolutionary exchange. As well as being the largest of the decentralized exchanges, the platform lets users trade continuously, without having to wait for transactions to mine. For the MyBit community, it means we can now get all the benefits of a centralized exchange while trading on a decentralized platform. It’s a win-win.  We’ve also got a surprise announcement this week: we’re now listed on TOKENJAR. For the MyBit project, it’s great to be listed on yet another decentralized exchange. And the team couldn’t wait till next week to let you know all about it. We hope you’re as excited as we are.",False

It is Friday and for the first time in a long while the sun is actually shining. So what has happened this week;  The logo, colours and designs are all done which has resulted in a beautiful website we can proudly showcase to the world. The last phase of this overhaul is the animations and these are being done by an external company. As soon as these are ready the tech team will do the rest. Our realistic time indication is between the end of April (earliest) and Consensus (latest). We’ve shown the Alpha testers the new branding/website/Alpha-design for feedback and they were all very enthusiastic. MyBit is finally getting the presence it deserves and we can't wait to present all our hard work to you.  Some great reads this week! First of all, an interview where Ian and Tom talked to impakter.com about the future of technology and MyBit’s potential. Secondly our Monday blog was a great read too. Those are not even our words but Medium’s as they put our story on a prominent place on their Medium Digest list this week.  Kyle and Connor have been testing the Alpha and make improvements in the back-end where they still can. Cris is implementing Ash’s new designs to the front-end to make sure it all looks and feels great.  Our founder, CEO and office-Rambo Ian goes to Consensus and whilst in NYC he will be attending and engaging with community members at the MyBit meetup on the 15th of May. If you are in the area and love Crypto/MyBit this is certainly a Meetup you don’t want to miss out on. Invite your friends to join you via Facebook and join the pre-fun on our Discord.  Joost has rounded up his strategy and is curently building the marketing offensive to get MyBit’s story out as he is allowed to burn mark Ian when MyBit reaches a 1B marketcap. You can help him already by actively sharing MyBit’s tweets and to invite more people to our great community.  https://medium.com/mybit-dapp/weekly-update-w-15-88e42507c6b1",False

Alpine Mining is a sustainable cryptocurrency mining company based in Gondo, Switzerland, which benefits greatly from its location. Few places on earth are better suited for industrial scale mining than the Swiss Alps. Not only does political stability in Switzerland ensure mining operations go unhindered, but the region also hosts three hydroelectric power stations that provide a bountiful supply of clean and affordable energy, while cool Alpine air assists in reducing costs on cooling systems.  By partnering with Alpine Mining, MyBit is not only making significant headway building the infrastructure of the future machine economy, but we are also helping to tackle the issue of environmental sustainability regarding blockchain technology. Here’s what our CEO, Ian Worrall, has to say about the partnership:  “There’s a lot of excitement around the internet of things and blockchain right now. Globally, the market for IoT devices is projected to grow to $8.9T in 2020. Here at MyBit, we’re making buying, selling and monetising them as easy as using an app. And through our partnership with Alpine Mining, we’re bringing our tech to the mining community for the first time.” “Alpine are a 100% sustainable mining company. There has been a lot of negative coverage about the power cryptocurrency mining consumes. Alpine counters this. With their technology, every single transaction is powered by hydroelectricity alone.”  By partnering with Alpine Mining, MyBit is not only making significant headway building the infrastructure of the future machine economy, but we are also helping to tackle the issue of environmental sustainability regarding blockchain technology.

Together, MyBit and Alpine Mining are offering distributed ownership of mining operations for every budget with the ability to scale rapidly. No longer will mining be an expensive and arduous task, but an effortless pursuit for those of all financial means.  MyBit is constantly on the lookout for other companies to partner with in order to make IoT devices accessible to new audiences. Stay tuned for more updates from us in the near future.

Hi guys, we’ve got some big news to share with you all today: we’re cancelling phase two of our token sale. After internal reflection here at MyBit and talking with the community, we’re sure that this is the right way to go. We’ll get onto the precise reasons why later in this blog post.  First, a quick recap. As many of you know, we were planning to launch a second token sale in Q2/Q3 of 2018. This would have issued 2.2 million additional tokens (effectively doubling the supply to five million). We planned to use the funds raised to rapidly scale our development and business functions. In the year since we launched, we’ve realised this isn’t the right path.  We’ve always set ambitious targets for the MyBit project and, even without those extra funds, we’re on track to hit them.  For the community, cancelling the token sale means we don’t have to organize a token swap or dilute anyone’s holdings. And we can focus on the core of the MyBit project: the platform.  We have a projected runway through to 2020. If at any point the team needs additional funding, we have access to a reserve of 400,000 MyBit (or 15% of the supply) as set out in our token sale roadmap.  We’re confident that this will more than cover any future funding needs and we don’t expect it’ll be needed until beyond 2020. We have to mention we still hold the right to implement a second tokensale if we choose and issue the extra 2.2 million tokens. We do not think that will ever be necessary.  We hope this clears up any confusion around the token sale. It’s important to all of us at MyBit that we’re totally transparent with the community. This means being honest and responsible. For us, our token sale was about developing the project not raising easy money, as some projects seem to do.  As always, feel free to reach out to us on Slack or social with any questions or thoughts.  https://medium.com/mybit-dapp/mybit-caps-token-supply-at-2-8-million-no-additional-tokensale-512031e54917",False

He has a proven trackrecord in branding, (blockchain)marketing and community management and is very excited to join us on this great endeavour. Joost underlines the importance of a strong community and stays available for all your questions, advice and remarks on our official Slack.

This is fantastic news for all MYB token holders and supporters of the MyBit project.  Based in Kiev, Ukraine, Liqui was founded earlier this year and has already become home to some of the most sought after new tokens of 2017. With competition to get listed on exchanges now fiercer than ever, our addition to Liqui is worth celebrating and should bring a welcome boost to Mybit’s trading volume. This bodes well for our prospects moving into next year.  As those familiar with the project are well aware, increased liquidity is an essential part of MyBit’s plans to unlock billions of dollars in IOT revenue. Initially, MYB token holders will be eligible to receive a portion of the 2% network transaction fees from asset funding when our platform launches next year, however, we eventually want MYB tokens to be used to fund the assets themselves. This first requires MyBit’s 24-hour trading volume to rise, so the increased liquidity Liqui will provide puts us firmly on track to achieve this important milestone.  https://medium.com/mybit-dapp/mybit-token-coming-to-liqui-exchange-f38a182c3914",False

Unfortunately it appears that we may have fallen for yet another scam in this industry. We have reached out to the Liqui team on multiple channels to clarify the situation but have yet to hear back from them.  After the Liqui telegram account we were in discussions with was deleted earlier today, we began investigation the issue and it appears that someone spoofed the Liqui domain and used their known public email address as well as a full questionaire similar to Binance to verify tokens, companies involved, and data so the alleged scammers could sell paid marketing services to ""newly listed coins."" (Please see the email below , screenshot of it showing Liqui domain).  This came as a shock to us as scams are usually easy to identify, but this was very well crafted and even included a listing date after submitting the information and discussing with the alleged scammer via telegram. We will post additional information as we receive it, but wanted to keep up with our transparent company culture to make our community aware of the situation at hand and why the listing may not come into effect today. We sincerely apologize for any issues this may have caused, and are re-evaluating and structuring our company safety precautions to avoid something like this from happening again in the future.

Just a year ago mass adoption still seemed a long way off, but now people are no longer asking if this will happen, but when.  We’ve made a lot of progress during 2017. Here are our highlights from this year and our exciting plans for 2018.  Firstly, new hires. We’re happy to welcome two new members to the MyBit team. Natalia Tokar, heading up our business development, is a talented multilingual communicator, who has run several financial and investment projects in Russia, Germany, the UK, and the Middle East. You might have seen her speak at blockchain and FinTech events in 2017 in NYC, LA, Hong Kong, London or Stockholm. Natalia will be expanding our partnership network around the world.

I understand this is a new-ish coin, but I think there is a lot of low hanging fruit that I think the MyBit team can execute on, and really get this coin/token the attention it deserves..   Below are a list of question that I have for the MyBit team:  1)  When are we going to see the MyBit website updated in Coinmarketcap.com?  This should be an easy deliverable that will most likely bring more attention to MyBit.  2)  When are we going to see an updated Roadmap?  The one that is currently on MyBit.io seems stale and outdated.  I'd personally like to see how the MyBit team is tracking to getting their solar POC launched, and what are the future plans/projects there after?  What are the goals for the MyBit team beyond Jan'18?  3)  What is MyBit doing to be more engaged with their community?  Right now I see a weak Bitcoin Forum and Slack group.  There has been little communication within the community, and in a market where coins/tokens are spawning & dying left and right due to community support, I think there needs to be more communication with folks as to what MyBits plans are for the future.  KEEP EVERYONE UPDATED  4)  Is MyBit going to develop a Wallet?  If so, when is the scheduled launch?  5)  How does this wallet differ from NEO, and other crytpocurrencies that utilize smart contracts?  6)  How many exchanges do you plan for MyBit?  Again, what is your timeline?   Thank you.  Answer these questions, and you'll have yourself another investor   -E    1) Done 2) This month 3, 4, 5 and 6 you can come to the slack for more answers - (most coins are moving away from bitcointalk) slack.mybit.io  as for: ""getting this coin/token the attention"" this is not what the DEVs are after. MyB does not want to hype, they want to deliver - that is why all their energy is focused working behind the scenes on the actual platform   Quote from: Bossthirteen on September 06, 2017, 04:19:08 PM It would be nice if the dev posted updates / a newsletter, I see this coin potentially just being forgotten about and token price reflects this  Official social media channels: https://www.facebook.com/MyBitDApp/ https://twitter.com/@mybit_dapp https://steemit.com/@mybit   Quote from: TheyCalledMeDab on September 09, 2017, 09:38:09 AM ICO bounty programs are mostly a waste of time and money, most of these people cant even speak english well and will tarnish the company reputation, furthermore many will utilize bots to do their work for them, anyway just my opinion btw...no offence intended.  thank you, that is the smartest post I have read on bitcointalk  this is the reason MyB's price is temporarily down, all the tokens from bounties went straight to exchanges  at least this is a very good entry point for people that missed the ICO, once all the good news come in October we'll never see these prices again",False

I understand this is a new-ish coin, but I think there is a lot of low hanging fruit that I think the MyBit team can execute on, and really get this coin/token the attention it deserves..   Below are a list of question that I have for the MyBit team:  1)  When are we going to see the MyBit website updated in Coinmarketcap.com?  This should be an easy deliverable that will most likely bring more attention to MyBit.  2)  When are we going to see an updated Roadmap?  The one that is currently on MyBit.io seems stale and outdated.  I'd personally like to see how the MyBit team is tracking to getting their solar POC launched, and what are the future plans/projects there after?  What are the goals for the MyBit team beyond Jan'18?  3)  What is MyBit doing to be more engaged with their community?  Right now I see a weak Bitcoin Forum and Slack group.  There has been little communication within the community, and in a market where coins/tokens are spawning & dying left and right due to community support, I think there needs to be more communication with folks as to what MyBits plans are for the future.  KEEP EVERYONE UPDATED  4)  Is MyBit going to develop a Wallet?  If so, when is the scheduled launch?  5)  How does this wallet differ from NEO, and other crytpocurrencies that utilize smart contracts?  6)  How many exchanges do you plan for MyBit?  Again, what is your timeline?   Thank you.  Answer these questions, and you'll have yourself another investor   -E",False

For this reason we are closing the current crowdfund, fixing the pricing structure, and will re-open on April 27, 2017 after a successful audit has been completed.  If you have sent funds to the current contract, you will be receiving a personalized email.  Otherwise please refrain from sending any funds to the contract.  Here is the agenda leading up to re-launch:  •   Re-configure pricing tiers and publicize an updated deal sheet •   Update smart contract code to reflect these changes in pricing structure •   Smart contract audit conducted •   Re-sync contract to ICO dashboard •   Run numerous security audits on the dashboard  Pre-sale contracts with potential discounts will also be made available for anyone desiring to send a minimum of 25 ETH.

Response -  Great question. So this is only a ""potential"" short term issue.  Initially the platform will be released for consumers to register their existing assets to validate the technology, with the end goal being for companies, registrars, etc. to register the assets at the point of production so ownership is transferred upon purchase thus eliminating the need for people to register anything.  Of course this is the long-term vision as it will take a couple decades for assets to be phased out of their life cycles.  Short-term the situation you mentioned could in theory occur if someone had the unique ID of someone else's asset.  But then you need to look at incentive behind it, since it will take effort (intangible value) and a network fee (tangible value).  Someone could do this just to make someone else's life more difficult, which may occur in extremely rare circumstances, but other than that what would incentivize someone to take this action?  A sale or other distribution would still involve the delivery of a physical asset, which the seller (person who fraudulently claimed ownership) could not complete.  Any dispute that arises would be handled through a consensus protocol (planned to be similar to OpenBazaar's dispute resolution), but based on limited incentive as outlined above, this is not planned to be a major component of the platform that is used often, just implemented as a fallback for rare situations.

For this reason we are closing the current crowdfund, fixing the pricing structure, and will re-open on April 27, 2017 after a successful audit has been completed.  If you have sent funds to the current contract, you will be receiving a personalized email.  Otherwise please refrain from sending any funds to the contract.  Here is the agenda leading up to re-launch:  •   Re-configure pricing tiers and publicize an updated deal sheet •   Update smart contract code to reflect these changes in pricing structure •   Smart contract audit conducted •   Re-sync contract to ICO dashboard •   Run numerous security audits on the dashboard  Pre-sale contracts with potential discounts will also be made available for anyone desiring to send a minimum of 25 ETH.

Quote from: PikachuYou on February 21, 2017, 02:09:13 AM you really need to sort out the team section on the website.  can't fully read the bios of the team members  Will take care of it and update here once completed.   Quote from: sotisoti on February 21, 2017, 02:16:52 AM Melonport (http://www.melonport.com/) is building software for asset management on Ethereum blockchain. What's your thought on this?  Short Answer - Melonport is absolutely fantastic, but what we are doing is very different.   From what I know about Melonport, it is a digital asset management protocol for investing/portfolio management that makes it more transparent, collaborative, and efficient.  MyBit's goal in phase 1 is to enable ownership titles for physical (real-world) assets to be represented on the Blockchain such as personal electronic/IoT devices, cars, high-valued art, property, designer apparel, etc.  Then it provides the functionality to secure these assets in a virtual trust or Will governed by smart contract logic.  So whereas melonport is poised to revolutionize digital asset management from an income generating (investment perspective), MyBit focuses on physical assets and makes it easy to manage, transfer, and secure them.  Where MyBit begins to converge with Melonport in terms of concept, is phase 2 when we unveil the ability to issue fractional shares and invest in autonomous mobiles and smart home technology.  This enables MyBit users to generate substantial income from the platform (ontop of network revenue distributions).  So while Melonport focuses on the Digital Asset Market, in phase 2 we are offering a somewhat similar service for the physical asset market.   Additionally, we absolutely love the ""network effect"" Melonport discusses several times throughout their docs and videos and have plans to implement a similar strategy into the MyBit platform to create a sustainable and fast-evolving ecosystem.  I hope this short answer is sufficient.  I would be more than happy to further discuss once we enable auto sign-ups for our slack community - cheers!

I foresee some potential level of integration of MyBit into Melonport once we reach phase 2.  The Melonport platform can be a highly useful tool for determining optimal investment strategy for this new asset class we are creating with MyBit and also vastly remove friction in diversifying portfolios with our new type of investment model.",False

CHECK BRAND VIDEO   MyBit is the world's most advanced IoT investment Ecosystem. Its two flagship products include a decentralised investment platform (MyBit DApp) and the world's first decentralised IoT asset exchange (MYDAX). Powered by Ethereum.  Founded in  Switzerland by industry veterans, MyBit believes that people should be able to follow their passion instead of having to work to survive.  By redefining the way people generate income, MyBit strives to democratise financial services so everyone has equal access to investment opportunities. This becomes critical when the future machine economy automates 800 million jobs by 2030 (Mckinsey, 2017) and the average person, whose job is automated, has no ability to participate in this new economy.  MyBit provides an ecosystem for the upcoming 11.1 Trillion dollar IoT industry (Forbes, 2017), with the belief that everyone should have an equal opportunity to participate in this revolution.  Some background information about future automation: By 2030, 32% of jobs in the US, 33% in Germany and 46% of japan will become obsolete due to automation  (Mckinsey, 2017).
