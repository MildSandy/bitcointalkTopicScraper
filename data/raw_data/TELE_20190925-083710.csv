Which tokens, the ones that were bought through Fork delta for a fart of their original price?

Allowing someone - anyone to cash in on the promised rewards with tokens that have nothing to do with the initial offer (purchase tokens through ‚ÄôMiracletele‚Äôs website) is the same as spitting in the faces of all their investors who bought their tokens at full price, it means they will robe their own piggy bank until they finally die!

And he also goes against his own logic.   The company needs partners - profit is growing, we need momentum!   If the profit is growing, then you don‚Äôt need more money, what you need is people with high IQ to advance the momentum!   As we informed you earlier, the previous management department under the leadership of the former CEO Andrei Burchik miscalculated the development model and did not take into account the fact that not all of our users constantly use communication services.   This is as honest as any of them got so far.  Okay, so now you, the investors, know you dealt with complete morons.  These kangaroo-monkeys actually build up their system on the premise that anyone who would purchase their tokens would also use their phone services‚Ä¶?  How stupid is that?  Ico‚Äôs main objective is  1 ‚Äì that the company which issues the tokens gathers the needed funds for finishing their project aka turning it into a success story.  2- for the investors to get as high revenue from their purchased tokens as possible.  Not to use the investors to use the product they‚Äôre trying to put on the market.  Jesus fucking kangaroo, this is the reason why so many (9 out of 10) ICO end in disaster because they‚Äôre lead by complete brain diarrheas'.  The good news is, as it seems now they have someone on board who has at least the basic knowledge of how to run a business.  The bad news is that it might be too late. The bad rap the company got all over the Internet, the attention they already triggered by certain (don‚Äôt ask me which and where) government agencies for their behavior will make it x-times harder to get any new funds.  The idea with Israeli company Spikko Telecom is a sign of working brain of Mr. Golod.  Here‚Äôs my idea, why don‚Äôt you offer free numbers and phone calls to the biggest in the biz, like Uber, airports, shipping, train, bus companies, travel agencies, hotels‚Ä¶ anyone who offers its services all over the world.  Free numbers and free phone calls in exchange for free Miracletele commercials on their platforms.  Have you any idea, how many customers miracletele could get alone through Uber if they managed to sign a deal with them? And there‚Äôre hundreds of companies with millions of daily customers, which need reliable worldwide phone service.  Okay, a question for you‚Ä¶ how much did you invest in this hole called miracletele to receive this email?

Why should they pay out money for something that was not purchased from them?  These tokens could easily be stolen - remember what happened to Mt. Gox and the missing 650,000 Bitcoins?  Some still claim they were taken by hackers, but wait, somewhere this year there was a documentary about it which revealed two things:   A - the guy who ran this website was autistic  B ‚Äì he made this bot which solely job was to (hidden from the eyes of other users and Mt. Gox coworkers) buy Bitcoins on his platform and this way drive their price upward.  The bot went crazy buying bitcoins like nuts and no one noticed this because his maker/owner was too happy with the results/price rise of the Bitcoin. Since he was autistic he rarely communicated with his team (it is all in the documentary including his interview in which he admits it) until it was too late.

You can stack them, but they keep hanging in an endless loop‚Ä¶ maybe they still work on whatever happened on their website.  Firefox had a similar case this year:  https://www.techradar.com/news/a-technical-glitch-has-broken-everyones-firefox-extensions  Which left, over 250 million users without their favorite addons and caused the biggest tsunami of curses against Mozilla.  This MiracleTele thing looks more and more like a disastrous case of mismanagement than a preplanned scam.  We did some research (I‚Äôm trying to help a mate who was stupid enough to invest his wife‚Äôs savings into this thing) to do some math connected to MiracleTele and what should be their first-primary targets when they started this enterprise:  There are over 40,000 airports with codes given by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) with average, every day over 8 million people flying. In 2013 total passenger numbers were 3.1 billion‚Äîsurpassing the 3 billion mark for the first time ever. That number is expected to grow to 3.3 billion in 2014 (equivalent to 44% of the world‚Äôs population)  Bus - bus industry services 1.5 billion urban public transport passengers per year.  Taxi, that‚Äôs a hard one. Here‚Äôs just for the USA; transportation network companies such as Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. transported approximately 2.61 billion total U.S. passengers.  Hotels - STR Global estimates that there are worldwide 187,000 hotels, offering 17.5 million guest rooms, around the globe  Cruise ships - over 20 million people cruising each year.  And the list goes on and on‚Ä¶ and on.  These should be MiracleTele‚Äôs primary targets since day one. And what did they do? They sent some guy to a couple of seminars about blockchain and‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs it.  A year passes, millions of customers hungry for cheap worldwide phone calls, and billions of future profit lost forever.  If they invested at least five million in what you read here, they would have now a six if not a seven-figure number in paying customers.  I must retreat some things I wrote about the scam part (the blackmail stands, because it is what it is), but most of the other things are plain pure laziness and total lack of business enterprise from the Miracletele management.  They can fix it, not with hitting Africa as they plan. Yes, Africa is cheap and broke, but if they want long-term customers, then the above are their primary targets.

Check the other discussion on this platform connected to this theme, and you‚Äôll see how many different sources of income this company has.  In one of my previous posts, I‚Äôve mentioned that there‚Äôs no way they could pay their dividends to their investors with only 40,000 users‚Ä¶ seems I was wrong (Shit happens‚Ä¶ even to Santa when he‚Äôs jumped by a kangaroo.)  According to this:  ‚ÄúUS adults will spend an average of 3 hours, 35 minutes per day on mobile devices in 2018, an annual increase of more than 11 minutes.‚Äù  If this is an average, it would be more then enough for MiracleTele to pay out the bi-weekly rewards, not to mention all the other stuff they have as their income (more about it on https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5174888.100)  The token sale alone got them around 14,6 million euros. If they invested this money in bitcoin or its auto trade, they would make‚Ä¶ a shitload of money!  MiracleTele should not have any money problems, ‚Äôthey‚Äôre bathing in it‚Ä¶ that is, they would be if they invested money in promoting their business since day one and not sitting by the table and dreaming about what they will do one day when the sun seizes to shine.   If 40,000 users get them this insane amount of profit, imagine what 400,000 or 4,000.000 would do.   As I wrote, they‚Äôre allowing millions of profit to slip through their fingers‚Ä¶ every day, week by week, month by month.

Today we are bringing you a few little news items and clarifications. Please welcome.  1. Starting right now, all accruals to the old and new TELE token holders are completely back to normal. We hope you're excited about this, because we are!  2. All current withdrawal requests have been reverted to your hold balances. After September 15, 2019, they will be recalculated based on the company's actual profits and promptly paid out to you and other token holders.      3. Because of the fraud and theft attempts we recently experienced, of which we told you in our previous email, our reward rate, sadly, has gone down. The good news is that because we weathered the unfortunate event well, by responding to it quickly and decisively, we are seeing the reward rate gradually creeping back up.      4. Our call and internet features are back to normal. However, depending on the destination and the time you place your calls, some calls may cost more than 0.20 euro per call. These are market realities over which we have very little control. Sorry about that.  5. Any user who has activated his or her SIM card in their account at least once can withdraw their funds. So make sure to go and check in your account if you have done so at [link].  6. If you have NOT done so, you are entitled to ordering your free SIM card (delivered for free!) when you deposit 50 euros or their equivalent into your account. Alternatively, if this is too much for your current needs or wants, you can just buy it for 10 EUR, delivery included. This is your key to our awesome bi-weekly rewards!      As everything else we do at MiracleTele, these changes are prompted by our current business needs and the interests of you, our customers and supporters. We are just trying to balance all the various factors while being fiscally responsible and trying to serve you better.

Why should Miracle Tele give you rewards if you did not purchase their tokens through their website?  They don't have to. They offer their bi-weekly rewards for the tokens purchased through their website ‚Äì that is clearly stated in thir white paper ‚Äì black on white.  If they allowed you and others who bought these tokens outside their system to stack them and cash in on rewards, it would be the same as if they spit in the faces of all the other users who bought their tokens through Miracle Tele website.  It's plain simple, if you wanted to get the bi-weekly reward you had ‚Äìmust have purchased their tokens through their system-website.  You took a decision to buy them cheaper, outside their system; therefore, you are not entitled to the bi-weekly rewards ‚Äì period.  You have the right to keep these tokens, to sell them as it fits you on exchanges, but you and all the others who bought them this way are not entitled to the bi-weekly rewards ‚Äì that's how business works ‚Äì read the contract before you make the purchase.  You went for a quick-cheap version and now complain because the company protects their interest and true investors.  I don't like what Miracle Tele did on many other occasions, but as far this goes they're dead right and got my support.  To simplify it, let's say you bought 1,5L Coca Cola in Lidl, you decide you don't like it, or the package is damaged, or whatever, and you go to return it to Hofer because they also sell 1,5l Coca Cola. Hofer will not accept this return, they will simply forward you to the store where you purchased the Coca Cola.  It doesn't matter if it's the same item, maybe even the same price, that's the rules.  You must read the rules before you decide to purchase something.",False

No matter from which country you are, you have rights, even when it comes to ICO business.  Go to google and search for it.  If you are from the UK  https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/blog/how-to-report-scam-fraud  The USA  https://www.usa.gov/online-safety https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-fraud-schemes/internet-fraud  Yes, you saw it right, uncle FBI takes care of sob‚Äôs like these from Miracle Tele‚Ä¶. Actually, since they showcase the US flag on their website (to the morons from Miracle Tele, feel free to remove it, I already have it on over 100 screenshots of your website), I suggest we all file reports at the FBI, the more, the better. There is nothing wrong if you submit a report on multiple websites against Miracle Tele and its owners.  If you are from European union  https://www.europol.europa.eu/report-a-crime/report-cybercrime-online https://ec.europa.eu/anti-fraud/olaf-and-you/report-fraud_en  Africa  https://ispa.org.za/safety/report-cybercrime/  or my corner, Australia  https://www.afp.gov.au/what-we-do/crime-types/cyber-crime/online-fraud-and-scams and the list goes on and on.  Simply put ‚Äúhow to report internet fraud in ‚Ä¶ name of your country‚Ä¶ in Google and uncle internet will show you the right path.   Make sure you save every email you got from these SOBs, you will need it to prove to your authorities what these idiots did with your money.  For those of you who cannot find a single website for their specific country to file a report, you can use this  https://www.cryptopolice.com/  And there are others, you must search for them.",False

You might ask‚Ä¶ wait, if we do this they will simply run away with our money? Seriously, do you think there is enough money left there for you all?  There are two ways this can go, either they run away and force-burn their names and faces on the lists of the most wanted internet fraudsters for life!!... or they will be forced to remove the usage of their shitty sim cards to have access to your legally owned funds on their website.  It is up to them.

If you check your profile on their website, you will see they have implemented other changes, among them throwing tokens out of stack and this way forcing users to stack them manually (god knows what lies behind that).  Their goal is clear, they want to cash in again, and this way raise the number of their users which they have now glued to their shitty business for the next 4-5 years.  The question is what will you do, wait for 4-5 years to get at least some of your money back, and at the same time pay abnormally high fees for your phone number and calls which can/will change as these SOBs fits, or will you step into action.  Remember, WW2 was not won because people stayed at home and saluted to the Nazis, it was won because people sacrificed everything to abolish the nemesis.  Miracle Tele is cancerous, can it be healed depends on our actions.  Doing nothing and sitting home whining after your money is the worst of them all.  Please spread this to any platform you have available, Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, Telegram‚Ä¶ Let people know what options they have available. From numerous posts here I see that many of them are clueless of what to do next, what are their rights and legal protection.",False

As from today/yesterday, we can confirm that our dear darling, Miracle Tele is a scam!  You all received their last email (I will split this in 2-3 parts):  ‚ÄúToday we are bringing you a few little news items and clarifications.Because of the fraud and theft attempts we recently experienced, of which we told you in our previous email, our reward rate, sadly, has gone down.""  That is a complete lie and a scam. They were the ones who dropped their tokens on exchanges, forcing their worth to plummet to almost zero. Just a lie, nothing more than a lie.  ‚ÄúThe good news is that because we weathered the unfortunate event well, by responding to it quickly and decisively, we are seeing the reward rate gradually creeping back up.‚Äù   Another lie, yesterday the reward was 0,48‚Ç¨, today it is 0,41‚Ç¨, and it will drop in the future because more and more people see this company for what it is, a scam, and are running away from its platform.  ‚ÄúOur call and internet features are back to normal. However, depending on the destination and the time you place your calls, some calls may cost more than 0.20 euro per call. These are market realities over which we have very little control. Sorry about that.""   ‚ÄúSorry?‚Äù Sorry, my ass! This is nothing more than a scam. Their white paper guarantees calls of 0,2‚Ç¨ per minute, nowhere do they mention any other possibilities. What they wrote here means that they can change the call rate as it fits them without forewarnings or any kind of notification ‚Äì a scam!  ‚ÄúAny user who has activated his or her SIM card in their account at least once can withdraw their funds. So make sure to go and check in your account if you have done so‚Ä¶   Scam number three ‚Äì nowhere in their white paper (contract to which you/we all had to agree when you signed up to their platform) do they mention this. It is optional to order and use their sim card, but let‚Äôs be honest, most of you joined this to earn rewards, not for their sim cards, therefore, another scam!  ‚ÄúIf you have NOT done so, you are entitled to ordering your free SIM card (delivered for free!) when you deposit 50 euros or their equivalent into your account.""   Scam number four!! Are these guys complete morons? Now they want to force users to deposit 50‚Ç¨!! To gain access to funds that are ours in the first place. This is where the boys in blue (police) step in.   ‚ÄúAlternatively, if this is too much for your current needs or wants, you can just buy it for 10 EUR, delivery included. This is your key to our awesome bi-weekly rewards!""   Scam number five and a clear showcase of what kind of morons we are dealing here with (if this is too much for you??) Only an idiot can build a company on such premise.  To sum it up, if you want your money you must ‚Äì must buy their card, activate and use it, but buyer beware‚Ä¶ their card comes with a hidden cost, a well-hidden cost, a monthly fee for the number you pick which is up to 16‚Ç¨... per month!  Let‚Äôs clarify this a bit ‚Äì if you want your money/investment back, which by the way it will now take 4-5 years to get at the current reward rate, you are forced to use their stinking sim card, paying them monthly fees for the number and unknown call rates which could, would change as these SOBs fits. (SOBs ‚Äì sons of bitches)  Their goal here is clear, if they get their 70,000 users/idiots to pay them 50‚Ç¨ per head, they end up with‚Ä¶ 3,5 million euros!!! Out of your pocket. Or if you order it for 10‚Ç¨, we come to 700,000 euros‚Ä¶ out of our pockets.  What to do now you ask? Those of you who are with this shit hole of a company from the start had probably already got even, got their investment back, but most of us joined this shit hole in the last 6-8 months when they sold the most of their tokens‚Ä¶ more in part 2",False

This groundbreaking SIM makes it possible for you to retain your privacy rights and earn biweekly rewards thanks to the tokenization of the company‚Äôs assets.    Miracle Tele is set to change the way the conventional telecom market works through the creation of a transparent and agile digital ecosystem that fuses an MVN model together with blockchain technology.  This way, we will connect millions of consumers around the world seeking to access a quality and bureaucracy-free mobile and traffic services, at the same time rewarding them thanks to the use of Ethereum blockchain.    Monopolization of the global telecom industry and its control by several giant players has made it extremely difficult for small companies with distinctive ideas and new tools to enter the market. This is why international calls and traffic services are currently overpriced, forcing users to put up with tricky rates, unknown quality, and lack of privacy from mobile telecom companies.  In most countries, it‚Äôs necessary to provide an ID or even sign a contract with strict terms in order to get a SIM card. This, in turn, creates unnecessary bureaucracy, opening the door for large mobile operators to take advantage of their clients and offering sub-par services.     Miracle Tele is a virtual mobile network operator that has signed dozens of contracts with trustworthy local mobile operators for purchase of their surplus calltime and traffic, therefore making it possible to provide users with lower rates and predictably high quality of services.   * of the net profit of Miracle Tele paid to token holders in rewards every two weeks  Purchasing of surplus calltime and traffic also means that Miracle Tele does not need to spend massive amounts of money on infrastructure development, equipment maintenance, and branding or provide unnecessary additional services that make the company‚Äôs operations less efficient and more costly.  Another feature of an MVN model is that the customers do not need to sign contracts or deal with paperwork, disclose their private information, and upload their IDs in order to use Miracle Tele services.  On top of the MVNO infrastructure, we have deployed a blockchain powered grid that secures all transactions within the system using smart contracts and lets the customers purchase our Ethereum based tokens, TELE, to exchange for Miracle Tele services or simply store them and receive rewards thanks to the telco network growth.  Leveraging an emerging technology and collaborative economy, we let every member of our community participate in our project and then get their stake in return.     Global mobile phone market in 2016: 4.6 bln users  International tourism market in 2016: 1.2 bln tourists     We believe that a mobile operator should not only provide its customers freedom of access to information over the Internet and complete privacy, but also offer them free access to  financial tools via cryptocurrency.  Among new features to be added in the near future are VPN services that will come together with all SIM card plans, free messenger use, one free website/service a month, free virtual numbers from any country, voice change, and so on.  Apart from it, we are particularly interested in Internet of Things (IoT), which can be used together with AI algorithms in order to extend the range of use cases of the company‚Äôs services by incorporating them into home automation systems.  Our 2020 goal is to reach at least 100,000 active customers and launch new blockchain based telco tools like a proprietary wallet with integrated prepaid debit cards.
