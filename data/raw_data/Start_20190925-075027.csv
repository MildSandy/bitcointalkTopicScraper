Even if @xiangbobotadie is only speculating, he have right to do that.  Anyway, it is good to explain (to those who don't get it), that success of this project does not depend on the price at which the buyback will be made, but from development of startups that are in Starta portfolio. I will try to explain it to you, in two lessons.  Lesson first:  The most imortant is that after each buyback tokens are burned. Lets take as an example that in buyback #4 will be $100k  Situation 1 when the price is $0.50 100000/0.5=200k tokens - this amount is burned  Situation 2 when the price is $2 100000/2=50k tokens - this amount is burned  So which price is better for buyback? When total supply decreses more, or when price is going up?  Answer to this question is your homework for weekend my friends",False

Sorry, for delay, but I decided to wait to the end of buyback #3.  Earlier, I wanted to answer that it does not matter at what price the tokens will be bought back, because it really depends on the success of startups supported by the Starta accelerator. However, if we want to earn big money on STA, it is definitely better if at this stage the buyback will be held at the lowest possible price. Simply, the more tokens is collected and burned now, the faster their price will rise in the future. In other words, tokens will stay only in hands of real believers and they will not sell them for $1 or $5.. i belive it can be even $50 or more..

You can trade STA tokens at tidex.com or wavesplatform.com  1.2 When are you going to add other exchanges?  Cross Coin Ltd team receives a lot of requests to list STA in various exchanges (over 150 exchanges ). CC team acts primarily in the interests of tokenholders. The first priority is the absence of risks, including legal ones. Often, the proposals and requirements of exchanges do not fully meet the criteria for security, transparency, reliability, which in turn may negatively affect investors. CC team, compliance officer and its law firm carefully study and discuss terms with new exchanges to choose the most reliable exchange partner for STA. At this moment CC temporarily paused the process of listing STA on other exchanges. As for now the decision is made in favor of business development, and not spending time and funds on exchange listings. However we DO NOT reject listing on other exchanges, this issue is just on pause.  STA is currently listed at Tidex and Waves DEX. A lot of tokens are traded on one or two exchanges, there is no cause for concern. The main reason for not adding more exchanges is to avoid risks for our holders, including legal ones!  1.3 What is that on Hit BTC? Starta Accelerator and Cross Coin management did not authorize anything on HitBTC.  1.4 Where can I find STA token price history?  You can find STA token price history here www.coinmarketcap.com/currencies/starta/  2.Were there any STA buybacks yet?  Yes, the first buyback (dec 19 - dec 25) resulted in: total number of purchased STA tokens - 30 897( which is 100% aimed at buying back funds). These tokens were successfully burned.  2.1 How can I check if the tokens were burned?  Check “total supply” on open sources (such as https://coinmarketcap.com). Total supply before STA buyback1 - 5 324 245 STA---30 897 STA burned---Total supply now - 5,293,348 STA  2.2  When can we expect the next buyback? We are expecting a token distribution from 2 of our portfolio companies Cindicator (CND)  Anryze (RYZ) We expected this distribution in January, but due to some technical and legal issues the distribution is being delayed by our counterparty. As soon as these issues clear up we will proceed with the buybacks.  2.3 What are the buyback parametres? Teams announce details on each buyback mechanism. Previous buyback https://www.facebook.com/startaico/posts/1724121770966246  2.4  Why are you guys taking so long? We understand your concern. All processes are either newly created, or made by only a few teams and, as a rule, have their own peculiarities. Especially legal issues. In any case, Starta and CC teams abide by the road map.  3. What’s the basic returns model?    Acceleration vehicle and the EE market allow to enter companies at lower valuations than U.S. market. • Valuation at entry - up to $2 M • Targeted exit @$10 - $50 M (projected average 10X return per company)  3.1  Where can I see the list of the companies Starta has invested in?  Startaico.com  3.2 How much does Starta Accelerator invest in each company?  Starta Invests 130k for 7% equity. Some companies get additional 20k for an additional 1% equity after the acceleration. STA backers finance 33% of each of these types of transactions  4. What is TokenRockets? TR is a subproject included in the Starta Accelerator’s infrastructure. TR specializes in accelerating blockchain projects. So far, only one company has participated- Snovio. We are expecting up to 10 companies in the next 18 months. 33% of the profits from TR companies go to the STA backers, which is the same as regular Starta Accelerator companies. There are differences in the  financial model of TR and Starta Accelerator. More info about the conditions of participating in TR can be found at www.tokenrockets.com  5.Valuations of existing projects We are allowed to disclose only the nominal value of the companies and the information and evaluation they made public. Such information is provided in our quarterly reports.",False

There is a lot of negativity surrounding it, but the potential is really huge. I invested into Starta at ICO and will hold through the exits. With 70 potential exits on the table, it is only a matter of time before the market price is strong. Some of you who are trading early on these early 70% and near 90% swings should really consider holding out. This early on it's negatively impacting the value for such small gains. Do us all a favor, hold. Let the buyback process happen. If anything we should be demanding they open up on other exchanges before making volume trades. Stick with it, this one is the only ICO of it's kind in the startup space. There is a huge diverse portfolio of companies and even though they do a crappy job of communicating, I do believe they are all working very hard. Case-in-point, we are already seeing some buybacks and the potential the currency has. To a degree, they are sticking to their commitment which is what most important.  If I had another 25k - 50k on hand, I would buy more now. Focus on the push for more exposure, and demand we get to larger exchanges. Here are their email addresses, start lighting fires.  Starta:  support@startaico.com ico@startaico.com info@startaico.com hello@startaventures.com kd@startaventures.com  If we don't get anywhere in the next 30 days, I will post email addresses and personal contact info for Starta employees and 147 contacts of their startups they have invested in.

By the way, the last thing I heard was that Starta did receive quite some tokens from the Snovio ICO, but none of those were shared with the investors. Well, good on the team, Snovio made x50 already.",False

In proportion to the Sta tokens one holds. I dont see any sense in selling the Snovio tokens after the x50 (besides of more money for the Starta project) and then telling us that there is a token buyback, because this buyback doesnt reflect on the price of STA and therefore wont benefit us as holders. I guess as soon as the buyback drives the price up a bit, people will start to sell to get their initial investment out again, then price will drop again and so most of STA holders wont benefit at all from the Snovio tokens in the end.

However, we are working hard to improve and  hope that you give us a chance to redeem ourselves in this letter.  It's been almost 6 months since Cross Coin launched StartaICO, almost 2.5k of our backers received STA tokens and joined the venture community. As could be seen from the STA exchange rate dynamics, the nature of our STA token is somewhat different from the majority of other cryptocurrencies. Despite the fact that in the last 6 months STA didn't not provide for outstanding speculative possibilities, we should not forget that it has been gradually increasing its potential for mid-term growth and more than that, it is backed by real assets with strong upside potential.  We would like to share with you what has been done in order to secure further growth of the STA token.  In addition to the 21 companies in our portfolio we have signed 10 more. On December 15, these companies successfully presented their projects in front of an audience full of investors. As you can see, 31 companies have already tested their abilities in the United States and got their opportunity to become global leaders in their field. We have worked hard and still are to help them make further steps in the right direction.  During the months of fall we have been interviewing and selecting new startup companies to join us in our accelerator program as Batch 5. We have elected 15 projects, the best of the best from all of Europe, and we are currently working on bringing them to New York and signing contracts with them. These companies will be able to start their acceleration program as soon as January 2018, expanding our portfolio to 46 companies! As you can see, we are upholding the promises given in our whitepaper. Our new batch will be announced on December 26.  As part of the acceleration programme for blockchain companies Starta helped Snov.io hold their  tokensale, which resulted in $2.1M in collected funds. Part of the payment received for the consulting services for this project will also be distributed to the STA backers. Buyback information and details could be found here.  Also, during the months of December, 2017 and January, 2018 we are expecting a token distribution from 2 of our portfolio companies Cindicator (CND) (~ 20 000 000 tokens) и Anryze (RYZ) (~ 1 000 000 tokens).   We would also like to clarify certain points regarding our further strategy and development.    Given the constant changes in the current regulations, we are not yet planning on adding new exchanges, the STA token can be traded on the the Dex or Tidex exchanges.   According to the common practice, we have developed communication guidelines for our community, you could get yourself acquainted with them here.   In the last 6 months the ICO market has had a strong influence on the venture market. The changes in modern tendencies and trends stimulate our growth and development in new directions . We have presented our vision on the future of the ICO market and its further development and collaboration with the venture field in our report , “Hybrid Capital: The Future of Venture in the ICO Era”. Especially for you we have created a promo code “StartaICO” for a free download of this report at our website www.startaventures.com. It is also available in the e-pub format at Amazon  We should not forget that the fast growth rate of the cryptocurrencies in which the funds for StartaICO were collected is expanding our investment abilities and could benefit the growth of the STA token exchange rate. In January we will present an updated roadmap from the CrossCoin team which will include our investment strategy, towards, among other things, the assets exceeding those needed for creating a portfolio of 70 companies.  The  StartaICO website was updated last week.  We added all the relevant information and communication channels. Please take into your consideration that the new website was created under the post-ICO model, and some of its features were  altered. We would like to remind you that all the information regarding your balance and transactions could always be found in your personal wave wallets.  Should you have any further questions please contact support@startaico.com  We would like to thank you once more for your support and patience.

They will probably offer larger returns at a greater degree of risk.  Exchanges drive price in the short term, utility drives it in the long term.

Information from telegram is as follows:   Dear All! Cross Coin and Starta Accelerator to pioneer new VC tools with first STA token buyback following Cindicator tokensale  7 September 2017 New York – Singapore  Funds raised through a tokensale by one the project’s portfolio companies will be used to deliver value to Starta token holders  Throughout the month of September, hi-tech startup Cindicator (CND), which is part of the Starta Accelerator portfolio, will be selling cryptographic tokens in two successive rounds. A proportion of the new tokens will be transferred through Starta Accelerator to Cross Coin, the company through which $5 million was crowdfunded for investment in Starta Accelerator’s portfolio. Holders of Starta tokens (STA) released by Cross Coin will, for the first time, benefit indirectly from the distribution of the portfolio companies’ tokens. Cross Coin will repurchase STA tokens from the open market using proceeds from the sale of its share of CND tokens.  In accordance with Cindicator’s terms of placement, 18% of CND tokens released will be distributed to the company’s shareholders. Around 5% of these, or approximately 0.9% of the total number of new tokens, will be distributed to Starta Accelerator, one of the shareholders. In turn, Starta Accelerator will send a third of the received tokens to Cross Coin Pte, a Singapore-based company, in proportion to its share in the SPV ‘Starta Accelerator 16/17’.  Cross Coin intends to sell the CND tokens received from Starta Accelerator to a strategic investor – taking into consideration the conditions of the one year vesting imposed on these tokens – and to use the entirety of the proceeds to buy Starta (STA) tokens.  ‘This is a new mechanism developed by us specifically for participants of venture-based token sales and providing an opportunity to participate in the portfolio’s startup businesses. Participants of Cross Coin’s token sale will be able not only to expect profits from startups’ exits, but also to participate in intermediate buybacks by passing through all stages of growth for each of the 21 startups in the investment pool and new startups, which will enter the accelerator portfolio in the future,’ comments Alexey Girin, co-founder of Starta Accelerator and the Starta Capital VC Fund.  STA tokens will be bought back from the market in WAVES and BTC. Starta tokens will be repurchased at a market price, within one month from the date of funds from the sale of Cindicator tokens being credited to the Cross Coin wallet designated for the buyback procedure. The technical possibility of transferring CND tokens from Cross Coin to the buyer’s (strategic investor’s) wallet will be possible only after vesting, with a period of one year applied on these tokens.  At the same time, Starta Accelerator will maintain a share in Vote Inc, a shareholder of Cindicator, and expects to continue receiving profits as far as Cindicator develops. CND tokens are infrastructure tokens for the Cindicator technological ecosystem. The distribution of tokens should be considered as a ‘bonus’, rather than an exit from the Cindicator project.  The process of buying STA tokens back is carried out on the initiative of Starta Accelerator. Cindicator does not have any obligations to owners of STA tokens or to Cross Coin Pte. CND tokens are not a type of security, and they are prohibited for sale or transfer to citizens or residents of the USA, Singapore and a number of other countries.",False

This is not a network coin where the value will go up with more users/exchanges and it never claimed to be. But I will say this coin is trading well below its book value right now and it's due to the fact of having little exposure and ICO investors having no idea what they bought in this offering and selling in an illiquid market. I'm not sure about the exact buyback times, but I think you may be correct that they will occur every quarter but only AFTER exits from their portfolio companies and this will most likely take another year for the first exit, if not multiple years.  As investors, we can look forward to possible bonus buybacks and/or tokens in the meantime. I know CND has a vesting period of 1 year, but the other ICO tokens may not have vesting periods and we may get distributions and/or buybacks sooner. We have to await the news for each specific ICO. The team updates in telegram from time to time. You can look at this token as a small hedge to a cryptocurrency portfolio as it has real world crossover (dealing with fiat money).

It will probably be a similar timeframe for other tokens that STA receives. So expect one year from ICO dates of those companies in STA portfolio to sell and have cross coin buy back STA on the open market.  This only covers the tokens received from the ICOs. These serve as a 'bonus' so to speak. STA, and crosscoin, still own a percentage of each of these companies too and will make exits further along. I think 3-4 years is a bit much in the crypto world, but we should expect at least 2 years for their exits from the companies that are successful in obtaining 10+ million valuations. It will be at this time that they receive funds to buy back STA on the open market as well.  There is little news from STA at the moment due to the fact there is little to discuss. VC companies like this just fire away at different companies that have potential and hope at least a few hit it big. They then sell their positions years later. That is how this game is played. Anyone buying the STA token should know this as well. We can look forward to buybacks on STA from the proceeds of any ICO coins that Starta Holdings owns within maybe a year, but any holders of STA need to be patient for the actual exits from the successful companies in the portfolio. These exits will take many years.  This is a long term play. Perhaps Starta Holdings even holds a few of these companies to a 50+ million valuation if they see a lot of momentum. Seeing as they own I think around 7% of these companies and cross coin owns 1/3 of the 7% (around 2-2.5%), if they sold their position in one of these companies at that valuation, that'd be 1+ million buy pressure on STA trading around a 2-3 million valuation currently. That buy pressure alone would catapult prices massively.",False

Cross Coin and Starta Accelerator to pioneer new VC tools with first STA token buyback following Cindicator tokensale  8 September 2017 New York – Singapore  Funds raised through a tokensale by one the project’s portfolio companies will be used to deliver value to Starta token holders  Throughout the month of September, hi-tech startup Cindicator (CND), which is part of the Starta Accelerator portfolio, will be selling cryptographic tokens in two successive rounds. A proportion of the new tokens will be transferred through Starta Accelerator to Cross Coin, the company through which $5 million was crowdfunded for investment in Starta Accelerator’s portfolio. Holders of Starta tokens (STA) released by Cross Coin will, for the first time, benefit indirectly from the distribution of the portfolio companies’ tokens. Cross Coin will repurchase STA tokens from the open market using proceeds from the sale of its share of CND tokens.  In accordance with Cindicator’s terms of placement, 18% of CND tokens released will be distributed to the company’s shareholders. Around 5% of these, or approximately 0.9% of the total number of new tokens, will be distributed to Starta Accelerator, one of the shareholders. In turn, Starta Accelerator will send a third of the received tokens to Cross Coin Pte, a Singapore-based company, in proportion to its share in the SPV ‘Starta Accelerator 16/17’.  Cross Coin intends to sell the CND tokens received from Starta Accelerator to a strategic investor – taking into consideration the conditions of the one year vesting imposed on these tokens – and to use the entirety of the proceeds to buy Starta (STA) tokens.  ‘This is a new mechanism developed by us specifically for participants of venture-based token sales and providing an opportunity to participate in the portfolio’s startup businesses. Participants of Cross Coin’s token sale will be able not only to expect profits from startups’ exits, but also to participate in intermediate buybacks by passing through all stages of growth for each of the 21 startups in the investment pool and new startups, which will enter the accelerator portfolio in the future,’ comments Alexey Girin, co-founder of Starta Accelerator and the Starta Capital VC Fund.  STA tokens will be bought back from the market in WAVES and BTC. Starta tokens will be repurchased at a market price, within one month from the date of funds from the sale of Cindicator tokens being credited to the Cross Coin wallet designated for the buyback procedure. The technical possibility of transferring CND tokens from Cross Coin to the buyer’s (strategic investor’s) wallet will be possible only after vesting, with a period of one year applied on these tokens.  At the same time, Starta Accelerator will maintain a share in Vote Inc, a shareholder of Cindicator, and expects to continue receiving profits as far as Cindicator develops. CND tokens are infrastructure tokens for the Cindicator technological ecosystem. The distribution of tokens should be considered as a ‘bonus’, rather than an exit from the Cindicator project.  The process of buying STA tokens back is carried out on the initiative of Starta Accelerator. Cindicator does not have any obligations to owners of STA tokens or to Cross Coin Pte. CND tokens are not a type of security, and they are prohibited for sale or transfer to citizens or residents of the USA, Singapore and a number of other countries.",False

Based on: - 5,058,033 raised (of which I'm assuming 250k gone in paying crosscoin their 5% ico fee) leaves capital of 4,805,131.35  - 1.5m allocated to phase 3 start ups on a pro-rata basis across 21 startups ( 71,428.57 tokens /USD per startup) for 33% of the original accelerator investments  - this is an auto loss of 600k ish (paying 1.5m for 33% stake that cost approx 900k) - but thats the premium we pay to enter at the level we do (which is a very attractive level to enter)  - factoring in the estimated valuation of suretly based on their current ICO. Currently raise 1.9m USD for 15% of assets so approx company valuation of 12m USD  SO.......  1STA (with just the suretly adj) should be valued at approx 0.90 USD  Do not sell your STA for anything less than this!!!  An approx valuation 0.90 USD is also a very very very conservative valuation of 1 STA, due to the fact that I'm valuing all other 20 startups at their 1.9m ICO est valuation.  More than happy to produce an ongoing 1 STA valuation (and share calculations), but need the STARTA team to share a bit more information about current valuation of underlying assets.",False

Further query on one point, you say:  ""Also, if startups from the portfolio issue their own tokens and distribute them among the team, shareholders and so on, then a part of the issued tokens will also be distributed to the holders of Starta tokens""  So back to suretly - they are issuing tokens - does this mean that Starta token holders will be allocated SUR.  Also reading their whitepaper and their financial plan, Suretly will make a quarterly payment to SURcoin, ie the company that is running the current ICO for 15% stake. Is there any dividend/distribution for Starta or other pre-existing capital partners?  And if so, how will this be split and distributed to token holders.  More questions - the starta token holding community now effectively have a stake in each of these 21 companies. Who represents us and our interests with each of these companies? Will the community have the opportunity to vote on anything that would need to be run by the shareholders of each of these 21 companies. The decision to raise more capital by (venture or ICO) would be something you would expect a shareholder vote on for example. Who represents the starta token holder community in these votes?",False

I invested because I felt there was a clear investment to growth opportunity here. Very few ICO's come to market with a working product, much less a hand in multiple working products and many others on the cusp.  There is a clamor for exchange this, exchange that... madness  The truth is nobody can accurately value the token without an understanding of what the underlying investment is worth. So the exchange valuation (good or bad) is worthless. Without info the token is figurative at best (if i was an auditor I would take a dim view of not being able to quantify the estimate cost of your assets, very dim).   Twice when asked (3 time if I'm not being charitable) you guys have not disclosed the impact of an ongoing ICO in an underlying holding may have on the starta token holders.  Can you please explain how the suretly (1.8 USD raise and counting) impacts our holdings???  From their whitepaper: ""Suretly is planning to raise between $1.5 - $10 million USD in the next round of financing by selling 15% of its shares""  Soooooo that values a 7% stake (the starta stake in the company per the starta webpage) at 800,000k. Given 1.5 mil to the 21 initial incubator companies is a return of over 10x  ((1,800,000/15*7))/(1,500,000*7%)) = (current ICO/capital offered * capital held) / capital advanced   from the previous dismissive response ""projected average 10 X return per company""  Funny: guy who backed up this dismissive post didn't even blink at the idea that 21* starta holdings were $1.9 million each, as suggested by the response (""go look at the website"" I was told). Again I'll leave up to calculator kids to see how ludicrous this is (and how fucking stupid this supporter was) give the 21 * initial investments only accounts for 1.5 mil of the 5 mil raised at token sale. **clue** if the 1.9 valuations per investment were correct you FOMOs would be half way to the moon and  and not worrying about the next sig to display.   It is actually baffling to me that nobody else is asking these questions about underlying assets and are all fixated with bounty and exchange - true target audience should have been holders with sense, the could have been utilized to vote on future offerings, but no, they all seem to be pump and dumpers.  not a single question about valuation of underlying assets not a single question about the ""returns model"" as described by the white paper  Just a shed load of bounty and exchange questions from people too stupid to see that sale of one of the 21 seed companies and a return to investors would benefit the value of their investment more than any listing on polo et al.   It actually pains me that there is so many FOMO and, to coin a new one, ""No Understanding of the Investment Made"" (FOMO + NUIM= worst people ever) folks that will benefit x times over my investment if this all pans out well",False

It's just that most people get somewhat reassured by it, but you will have to keep it up or trust will fade. I do think it's natural to want it. I just believe there isn't much information that can be shared with this type of project and a monthly report (asset valuation/new startups) should do. A monthly report like that would give a sense of the progress and potential ROI that could drive the price, not ""we have talked with party x about y"". The latter is mostly hype to increase value temporarily. Which is a good thing if you are an ICO flipper instead of an investor.   Anytime question is ask...... you get copy and past of what is writen on website.  What are evidence that this step are been taken? Any meet up or conference taking place? Once all tokens are distributed and nobody comes on here to ask questions, this thread is as good as dead.  You get a copy/paste of the the answer/a link to the anwer. I don't know what you would want to see as ""evidence"". I don't know what kind of conference you are thinking of? I just think they have a selection process of startups and hope they are working on increasing their portfolio.  You can also see Starta at the Suretly ICO which at the least confirms the connection.  Quote from: fachant on July 18, 2017, 04:34:06 AM Sorry to say that, but with every day and comment of support (that bring nothing) i'm almost sure that this is just fake project.

Quote from: Naficopa on July 18, 2017, 06:40:27 AM We are not talking about other projects but just about this one. If we confirm that it is a scam it would help to close the topic and stop spamming the forum.  I'm really wondering how someone is going to confirm this is a scam.  It all boils down on it being a scam or not, but I don't think you will know absolutely sure until the first dividends are payed via buyback, which might occur in 2-3 years or sooner.

Suretly is currently having an ICO, last time I checked it had raised 1M+.  Please explain where this money sits in relation to the Starta capital.  - Is it being raised to pay off venture capital like starta - How much of the capital will it account for? if the ICO represents  a sale of 30% of the company for we can speculate the overall value, and hence the true current market value of the starta investment, and thus inform ourselves on the valuation of the investment.

Will wait for the final terms, but so far this does not seem attractive to a crypto holder right now.  You predict 10x exit, which is a bit of an overreach. Your 2014 fund 1 has a TVPI of 2.9. Average angel exit is 2.5x after 5 years of investment*. I will assume that the 2016/2017 batch will have an exit of 2.5x in 2021.  Currently, your SPV is valued at 3 million. By selling 1/3 of the SPV for 1.5 mil, you effectively value the SPV at 4.5 mil. In the average scenario, your fund will be worth 3*2.5 = 7.5 million in 2021. You will return a third of it to the cross-coin investors, or 2.5 mil. Thus, in five years your crosscoin investors will make 2.5/1.5=1.66 return or just 11% year interest rate. You incorporate a token firm in Singapore with no legal obligation to repay anonymous investors. 11% yearly is simply too little interest for such high amount of risk.  Furthermore, your token will be effectively tied to the USD rate in the first year. You collect approximately 1.5 mil worth of Ethereum/Bitcoin, and you need to buy the tokens back. Say you did not sell your ETH or BTC proceeds, and ETH and BTC appreciate in value. Now you can buy back all the tokens at a reduced rate, and still have some crypto's in your wallet.  This project is great for your VC fund - it improves short-term cash flow and reduces your downside risk. For ICO-investors - not so attractive. This is equivalent of investors holding a cash position in USD.  This ICO concept that you propose works great for shares, but not for debt. For individual start-up investments, but not for a portfolio of 21 start-ups. This is why I think it may work well for your startup Suretly. For Suretly, an investors expected return is still 11% per year, but the possible upside is much higher than in a portfolio of 21 start-ups.  *source: https://angelresourceinstitute.org",False

Good estimations, I'd say not very pessimistic, but I either can't say ours are very optimistic too.  Probably 2,5X average angel exit is based on early stage angel investments. But in the case of Starta portfolio you are investing in 21 tech startups with a traction made in the USA and some of them have already raised further rounds of investment at higher valuations than nominal portfolio value. It reduces risks of investments and increases a probability of profit gain.  And that's why Starta Accelerator partners don't agree on a nominal SPV valuation, now it's should be valued at a hire price.  Also, your assumptions are based on 5-year return expectations, but the first exit of any of startups can take place at any time, even during this year, don't forget that it's a venture business.  After every exit Starta Accelerator 16/17 will distribute a profit to limited partners, including Cross Coin, wich will distribute it through a token buyback at a market price. As you understand, in this case, a token price will rise significantly and token holders will be able to gain profit from it. After that, the number of tokens on a market will reduce after a buyback ant this will help to support the token value.  Do you think it's not interesting for crypto holders and traders?  Quote Furthermore, your token will be effectively tied to the USD rate in the first year. You collect approximately 1.5 mil worth of Ethereum/Bitcoin, and you need to buy the tokens back. Say you did not sell your ETH or BTC proceeds, and ETH and BTC appreciate in value. Now you can buy back all the tokens at a reduced rate, and still have some crypto's in your wallet.  I agree that many crypto holders prefer cryptocurrencies only and it's ok. But many of others are looking for alternative investments including in non-crypto assets to diversify their portfolio. In this case, I think venture investments are more attractive because of potential upside.  Cross Coin committed investing a raised amount in Starta portfolio and will do it.  Quote This project is great for your VC fund - it improves short-term cash flow and reduces your downside risk. For ICO-investors - not so attractive. This is equivalent of investors holding a cash position in USD.  This ICO is good for Starta Accelerator, it's true, just like for many companies launching ICO here. But it's also good for token investors and I explained why. Also is good for a crypto economy, because, in a case of liquidity events, Cross Coin will bring more cash from a fiat economy.  Quote This ICO concept that you propose works great for shares, but not for debt. For individual start-up investments, but not for a portfolio of 21 start-ups. This is why I think it may work well for your startup Suretly. For Suretly, an investors expected return is still 11% per year, but the possible upside is much higher than in a portfolio of 21 start-ups.  You are absolutely right - equity investments are more interesting in a venture business because of potential upside. And in a case of this ICO, Cross Coin is investing in the equity of 21 startups, including mentioned Suretly (Starta Accelerator portfolio company). After any of exits with potentially high valuation, Cross Coin will receive its fair share of profit and utilize it to a token buyback where smart token holders will earn an additional profit on a price volatility.  Thanks for questions again.  If something is still unclear, please don't hesitate to ask again, it will help us to prepare a list of FAQs.  ",False
