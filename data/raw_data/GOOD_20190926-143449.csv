Those are great features but what we are doing is actually creating a Charitable Economy with our digital currency called the Good Token - The Currency of Good  We reward people for doing charitable acts like volunteering, donating, delivering items and our marketplace pays the charities a transaction fee for each purchase. Creating a Charitable Economy is something that's never been accomplished and will be a paradigm shift for the way we interact with charities - this would only be possible through the blockchain and our Good Token.

The current model is not working - just look at any village, town, city, and country - poverty is screaming through the people that are suffering.  We are not seeking a 'greed for gain' type scenario, what we are creating is a Charitable Economy that provides an incentive for doing good. So many people around the globe have never experienced the feeling and reward that truly comes from helping someone in need - no amount of money can change that but until we can encourage more people to help we will keep the current system.

Many are quite true to their word and often dispense the funds received in a judicious, honest and expedient manner; however, I'd prefer not to put my trust and safety of my funds in centralized and trust-dependent organisations like those we currently have. This for me is one of the attractions of blockchain technology and solutions- a means to remove trust totally from the equation.

Firstly, the MVP for the Commit Good Ecosystem is already in development and is scheduled for release in the fourth Quarter (Q4) of 2018. Follow our channels on social media to keep in touch and get up- to- date news of events of Commit Good.  Secondly, as to the question of how end-users can make donations, the technology is fairly straight forward. All donation making and receiving happens on the Commit Good ecosystem.  1.   When an organization applies to receive donations for charity, he goes through an onboarding and verification process and when approved can create a donation order, this order is added to the order book on the blockchain via smart contract. 2.   Third party users who wish to make donations will be required to sign into the Commit Good app (via mobile or web) and make donations to charities of their choice with all information available via the donation order book. 3.   Donations are sent into the unique contract of each donation recipient and withdrawn by the donation order creator or specified contract owner.  All transactions history will be equally shared, shared with others upon approval or be made public.",True

Yes, our goal is to be one of the best platform in the cryptocurrency by using GOOD TOKEN. We mostly solve the online dispute transaction and reward 3 GOOD TOKENS who helps to solve the problem. For Example:  Most bank transactions are properly made following the instructions of the account holder - and are completed successfully without any problems. However, sometimes things can go wrong. This is often because the consumer disputes having made or authorized the transaction.  Sometimes the problem is that the consumer agrees they made the transaction, but says that it was not correctly carried out or recorded. An example would be where the consumer went to make a withdrawal from a cash machine, but says the money was not dispensed by the cash machine even though it was debited to their account.",True
