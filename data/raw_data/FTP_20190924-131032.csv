It makes possible creating decentralized apps where users control their data, can share and monetize it. Like traditional NoSQL database, Fluence allows to execute data queries, update or delete data.  READ BUSINESS WHITEPAPER  READ TECHNICAL WHITEPAPER    MAIN FEATURES  - Fault tolerance and censorship resistance. Due to decentralized nature, Fluence guarantees maximum uptime and no possibility for data regulation. It automatically balances data replication to keep all data online at any moment. - Privacy. Data is split into chunks, encrypted and stored on different nodes that controlled by different hands. There is no way for node owner to spy data or steal it until data owner disclosure the private key to the public. - Low cost. Utilization of currently unused storage space brings oceans of capacities to market, decreasing price for storage down. Fluence gives an opportunity for hardware owners to monetize their power similar to Bitcoin. - Access management. Fluence provides flexible permissions management model based on proxy re-encryption technology. It allows meeting compliance with HIPAA, GDPR, HITECH, PCI and other regulations.   ECOSYSTEM  DECENTRALIZED DATABASE Structured data storage allows to execute data queries on the nodes making it easy to use by decentralized apps developers.  TOKENIZED DATA ECONOMY Data owners can set a fine grained data access control to the part of their data using proxy re-encryption and get profits with smart contracts.  STORAGE MARKET Storage owners willing to monetize unused hardware resources can be connected with data owners looking to store data in the reliable encrypted p2p cloud.
