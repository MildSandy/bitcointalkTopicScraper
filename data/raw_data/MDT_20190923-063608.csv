In order to create a more efficient decentralized ecosystem for its blockchain community, token holders should be fully informed of all changes regarding the operations, development, and important decisions of the community in order to cast their vote for a final decision. However, the traditional way of community decision is not cost-effective and fair anymore. That’s why recently some new public blockchains like EOS and TRON are trying to create new norms to ensure a more efficient governed community by electing some major members to represent the whole community.  According to TRON’s official announcement, a Super Representatives would play a key role in governing the TRON community by ensuring basic functions, such as block generation and bookkeeping, and obtain corresponding earnings. But it will only be elected through voting by all token holders.  The first Super Representatives(SR) Election will start June 26th, 2018, where 27 SRs will be elected, laying the foundation for a self-governed community with a general election.  As a decentralized data exchange ecosystem which rewards users for sharing anonymous big data, MDT believes that a self-governed community is the future for most blockchains. We are happy to support one of the early adopters of this innovative way for self-governance like TRON.  Details on how to support MDT as a Super Representatives(SR) for TRON will be announced soon. Please stay tuned!  About MDT Measurable Data Token (MDT) is a decentralized data exchange economy connecting users, data providers, and data buyers and denominates the value of data. MDT compensates users for sharing anonymous big data while providing data buyers and providers with a more efficient and impartial trading model. The team previously built MailTime, an email app with over 5 million users, which is also the first use case of MDT ecosystem. MDT is now listed on OKEx, Gate.io and Bancor Network.

What is MDT  We started MailTime four years ago to redesign email for the mobile era. Throughout the years, we keep updating the app and have now won over 5 million users globally.   However, this is not good enough.  We realized that even though we are offering great service to users, we are not literally engaging them in our ecosystem. In other words, we are only selling the app to users, but never really appreciated users’ participation.  That’s why MailTime embraces a new economy called MDT where users are getting rewarded for what they do and create. We believe it’s going to disrupt the status quo that most companies take users’ trust and participation for granted. Plus it’s all based on blockchain, an exciting new technology which ensures all transactions and records are never rewritten.  Introducing MyMDT   MailTime is one of the first adopters of the MDT ecosystem. This means YOU will also be the first group of users in this new economy as well. To make this happen, we have been working really hard on a big new feature of MailTime — MyMDT. The MyMDT feature basically allows users to earn rewards by finishing specific tasks while using the MailTime app. It will be found in a future version of the MailTime app.   Introducing the MyMDT Closed Beta Testing Program  To test out this new feature and to get users’ feedback, we are planning to give access to a limited number of beta testers.In total, 200 beta testers will be selected to try out this new feature first! Here is a general timeline and more details about the close beta testing program:  June 19 — July 6 Sign Up  We are sending out messages to recruit beta testers across all platforms. If you are interested in signing up, please fill out this form.  July 16 — August 1 Closed Beta Testing  We will pre-select our beta testers and send out confirmation emails to qualified participants. On July 16, the closed beta testing begins. Participants will receive another email on how to download the closed beta version of MailTime.  Participants are encouraged to explore the new feature as much as possible. Since MyMDT is a reward system, beta testers can earn as many rewards as they can. By the end of the testing, each participant can receive up to 500 $MDT* (or cash rewards**) for the participation.  In addition, we will send out a survey to each participant which takes about 30 mins to complete. If you finish the survey, you will first earn additional 150 $MDT* (or cash rewards**), and also have chance to win a [Nintendo Switch] in a raffle.  If you participate in a user interview, you will earn another 1000 $MDT* (or cash rewards**)!  The signup period ends soon on July 5, so if you’re interested.  Sign up Now.  Reward Distribution  The closed beta version of “MyMDT” runs on Testnet (a testing net, which is normally used to test products on the blockchain). This means that all the $MDT or any cryptocurrency earned during the closed beta are not supposed to have any value. They are only test credits. You might see an interface in the beta version which allows you to “transfer to an address”. When you do that in the closed beta version on the testnet, you might be able to click the button, but in reality the transaction will never go through.  At the end of the testing, we will examine the $MDT you earned within the beta version and send you the actual rewards 1:1, with a max CAP of 500 $MDT.  You can choose to get the $MDT rewards to your own cryptocurrency wallet, or have them sent to your “MyMDT” account when it officially goes live.  **You can also choose to get cash rewards rather than $MDT, note that we calculate cash rewards as only 70% of the $MDT at the average market price. In addition, cash reward is only available for users located in U.S. and China.  *$MDT is a cryptocurrency that facilitates this new user reward economy, which will also be the currency you will mostly use within the MailTime app.  1$MDT = 0.03 USD, the value will fluctuate with the exchange rate. You can refer to CoinMarketCap https://[Suspicious link removed]/b6nbbW for real-time exchange rate.  Legal Notes  You should be 21 years of age and older if you wish to be eligible to participate in this Beta Testing Program.  If you are selected to participate in the beta testing, you will see a Beta Participant Agreement (“BPA”) when entering MyMDT. Proceed only if you agree with the BPA; if not, you should quit the app immediately.  The personal information and user behavior data we collected in the beta testing process are strictly for research purposes and will be deleted when the official version is released publicly. If you do not agree to the collection and processing of the above information, you can always quit the testing program from any time by informing us. If you wish to have them deleted before the official version is released publicly, you can email users@mailtime.com  Participants should be liable of their own conduct; MailTime (Mobile Internet Limited) reserves all rights.  If the MDT team suspects any misconduct or illegal activities, the MDT team reserves the right to force-stop the software service, freeze or delete suspicious accounts.",False

Measurable Data Token is a decentralized, transparent data exchange economy, based on blockchain. It connects users, data providers, and data buyers and denominates the value of data. MDT compensates users for sharing anonymous data points while providing data buyers and providers with a more efficient trading model.    Problem:   Today, most service providers collect users’ data with no intention to disclose the reason and the intrinsic economic value, meanwhile, users trade their data unconsciously in exchange for a free app or service.  What if you yourself could control your data and be rewarded accurately for the value it creates?    How it works?   The era of trading data without user consent is over. Users are now incentivized with MDT for the actual data points exchanged. By offering more transparent knowledge of each data exchange for all parties, users will also be more motivated to join this initiative.  On the other hand, buyers are also provided with a more efficient exchange model where all transactions are strictly enforced with cryptographically secure smart contracts and traceable on the blockchain. In traditional closed data exchanges, buyers used to be at risk of buying invalid or fake data without any ways to verify. In this new open model, buyers also participate in the validation process of each transaction which ensures they will receive a more trustworthy and risk-free deal.  Example:  Bill has been a user of a game app called GAME for years, GAME recently decided to join the MDT ecosystem for more transparent data exchange. Bill selects to opt in MDT as well, and has been receiving respective MDT tokens as rewards for contributing his behavior/purchase data on GAME.     Where are we?   The first component of this ecosystem is Open Messenger(previously known as MailTime), a messenger app based on the email protocol and connects users with a smooth communication experience.  MailTime owns over 5 Million users on mobile and are now partnering with 7 smartphone manufacturers to replace its default email solutions.  Measurable is a big data product the team has been building since 2016, which analyzes up to 15 billion email data of online shoppers collecting from business partners and the service MailTime. By scanning and identifying actual online spender’s email receipts, Measurable transforms them into valuable insights, which updates daily right after the purchases happen. Measurable now sells its big data product to different merchants, game companies, investors and hedge-funds.    We are excited to discuss with you about MDT!

The Bounty Program consist of Two Parts:  The Bounty Campaign The Bounty Lottery  90% of the 1,000,000 MDT will be distributed to Bounty Campaign, and 10% will be used for a Bounty Lottery which all participants who successfully earn stakes in the Bounty Campaigns are eligible to participate in.  The MDT Bounty Campaign falls into 4 categories:  1. Telegram Group 2. Translation of the Whitepaper 3. Bitcointalk Signature campaign 4. Write Blogs or create Youtube videos   The MDT Bounty Lottery consists of 2 Stages:  The Grand Prize Lottery The Lucky Prize Lottery  No individual can claim more than 5% of an entire bounty pot in the Bounty Campaign. This provision is to ensure the continued value of the token for all token holders. All additional tokens left over from the bounty campaigns which are not allocated will be returned to Measurable Foundation’s User Growth Pool (See Whitepaper).  DISTRIBUTION  The Bounty Program rewards will be accounted and distributed after the whole Token Sale (the Token Distribution Event) is over.  [Important] Every participant needs to fill in a final form to claim all of the stakes he/she earns from the Bounty Campaign before we distribute the MDT tokens to the Bounty community. Participants who fail to fill in the form before the distribution can not claim the stakes he/she earns from the Bounty Program.

Please do not use any exchange wallet address (such as Coinbase/GDAX, Bitstamp, Kraken, Bittrex, Bitfinex, Poloniex and etc.) as you don't hold the private keys to your wallet on an exchange. MyEtherWallet is highly recommended.  It is also very important to always keep your private keys secure by never giving away to an untrustworthy site or third party. MDT team will never ask for your private keys.  Please review carefully the Bounty Program terms before you start. Measurable Foundation Ltd. reserves the right to change these terms or rules at any time, and you agree to abide by the most recent version of this.  THE BOUNTY CAMPAIGN  A Stake System:  The Bounty Campaign will operate as a stake system. Please see an example of how stake system works:  At the end of the Bounty Campaign there are 100 people participating in the Bounty Campaign. At the end these 100 people claimed a total of 200 stakes. In this example the Bounty Campaign has totally 200,000 MDT allocated to it.  User A finishes 2 translations, and owns 2 stakes. User B finishes 6 translations, and owns 6 stakes.  This means a total of 8 stakes will be distributed to User A and User B.  User A will receive 1% (2/200) of the 200,000 MDT, i.e. 2,000 MDT. User B will receive 3% (6/200) of the 200,000 MDT, i.e. 6,000 MDT.  [End of example]   TELEGRAM GROUP   Telegram is our primary online community for MDT.

It helps you go through what MDT does in 1 minute.  Also this example can help too:  Satoshi has been a user of an app called GAME for years. GAME sells user behavior data to a partner called BUYER monthly for extra revenues. GAME and BUYER recently joined the MDT ecosystem for more transparent data exchange.  Satoshi selects to opt in as well, and starts to receive respective MDT tokens as rewards for contributing data points. GAME and BUYER both save time and money on endless negotiation and verification.",False

Let's take Google as an example, when you sign up for its service, whether it's Gmail or Maps, you might find advertising that are only related to you in your feed (Google knows what kinds of ads might be interested to you based on your data, those you create while you play with an app that Google provides or the information you fill in when you sign up for the service).  No only Google, in today's digital market, it has become the norm for companies to offer users a product for free in exchange for having their data collected and sold to marketers. So, is this a bad thing? Contributing anonymous data to the industry definitely is not bad, it helps our technology learns more about you thus it can serve better for you.  However, if this is *your* data that is being sold/or used for revenues,  shouldn't you also be getting a cut of the profits?  This is the core philosophy which leads to the development of Measurable Data Token(MDT). MDT is a new ecosystem which rewards users with cryptocurrency based on the anonymous data they contribute to the ecosystem through service providers connected to the MDT ecosystem.  Currently, companies which are providing services which are nearly essential for functioning in today's society are reaping massive profits from your data. We believe that some of the value you are generating should come back to you.  I can't post images yet with this account, but here's a text version of the flow chart on one single transaction from the MDT ecosystem:  Example Use-cases:  Open Messenger is an email messenger app that helps users manage their email as simply as messaging on mobile. As a data provider, it collects and analyzes users’ anonymous email receipt data, and transforms it into valuable business insights, which updates daily right after the purchases happen.  Gaming company J is a data buyer, who constantly look for competitors’ sales trends for decision making. They discover that Open Messenger has published a new data dashboard product called “Sales Trends for Game P and Game C in 2016” that they are interested in purchasing.  After Company J clicks the Purchase button on Open Messenger’s website, this request notifies both the Open Messenger and the Measurable Platform.  Thereafter, Measurable Platform constructs a Smart Contract which includes:  Public User Key, which means all the invoked data points and the respective public user key User reward percentage: u % Data Dimensions:  iTunes email receipts, quantity... Transaction Price：Va  MDT Transaction Condition: Accepts deal within y hours  Data Buyer sends Va MDT to the contract address and then gets the preview access to the product requested.  According to the conditions in the smart contract, Company J needs to decide if they accept the deal within y hours. Within y hours, J believes that the data is valid and the deal is accepted. After the acceptance, the Smart Contract executes, and simultaneously J gets the full access to the product.  Measurable Platform gets calculation fee:  Vm = Va * x% User reward total is Vu = (Va-Vm) * u%, each user’s reward varies depending  on their contributing points amount Open Messenger as a Data Provider gets the remainder  Vo = Va - Vm - Vu  If J does not accept the deal in this case, and believes that the data is invalid or problematic, the transaction will automatically go through arbitration on the Measurable Platform. If the arbitration result is deal accepted, the Smart Contract executes. If the result is deal failed, Company J still needs to pay x% calculation fee to the Measurable Platform, and the balance returns to the J Company. It is very likely that for any early adopter, the number of data points being invoked is not large enough to get considerable rewards.For some users, it may take longer time to reach the amount other users only take several days to achieve. After all, the data points every user creates are different.  To solve the potential issue of micropayment and delay in transaction confirmation times (for example, when the rewarded MDT is too small that it fails to cover the cost of Ethereum transaction), MDT will first introduces a reward deposit pool where it stores users’ micro-rewards until the quantity reaches an appropriate threshold to be sent to the user.  Users will be notified in their wallet about the number of contributed data points and the amount of reward earned. Only once the rewarded MDT reaches a validated amount will the wallet be activated to use. Users can transparently check reward income and data points in real time to monitor their status in the MDT ecosystem.  For example, User F downloads the Open Messenger app and opts in to join the MDT data exchange ecosystem. In the first week, his email receipt data is invoked so his wallet displays the current rewarded MDT amount and the data points he has shared so far. The number is below the threshold to activate his wallet, but three months later, the number reaches the verified amount and User F is able to withdraw, make purchases, and transfer his MDT.",False
