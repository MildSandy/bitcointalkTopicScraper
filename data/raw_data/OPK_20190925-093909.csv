This creates a platform for seamless, transparent interaction between buyers and sellers, effectively combining all the verticals involved in the filling business in a market where demand meets supply and vice versa. The project aims to become a public digital book for the filling industry, in which the parties demonstrate transparency and trust due to the integrity of the system. This guarantees the sellers of seriously interested buyers, better payment terms, reliable demand forecasts and good prices for their products, while buyers are guaranteed high quality materials delivered in good conditions and on time.  There are many market segments in the filling industry, which today are fundamentally unstable. Thus, a prospectus is created in which all the components of the market and supply chains are combined on one platform, which allows manufacturers to find a buyer. Supply chain participants also have the tools to interact with each other to effectively deliver services.

Almost a decade has passed since bitcoin and its underlying distributed registry technology, or blockchain, appeared, but the real cryptocurrency boom began only in 2017.  Blockchain allows to register transactions without centralized regulators. Theoretically, with the help of the blockchain, any process that involves the interaction of various parties and intermediaries can be made much more efficient. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are trying to become such a solution in the market for mutual settlements, but this is just one of many possible applications of technology.  How to bet on blockchain  In essence, for an investor who wants to bet on the blockchain, there are two main options. You can invest in the purchase of cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin or ether. The cost of bitcoin in 2017 has risen from about $ 1,000 to more than $ 13,000. Dollars. The rate of air for the same time increased from $ 10 to more than $ 700.

One of the features of potentially successful ICO is the ability of a project in question to address an issue and offer a realistic solution. Below, we will talk about how ONP Platform tackles one of the biggest pains of packaging industry: payment issues.  As of today, a lot of people across the world realize the value of packaging industry, its impact on economy and society and its transformative potential. The global Packaging Industry is a $900 Billion business, involved in nearly all production and manufacturing operations around the globe. The sector is now a pioneer in adopting global mega trends - green packaging and the emerging technologies of the 4th Industrial Era: 3-D printing, robotics and IoT.  What non-insiders are seldom aware of is the fact that packaging industry is continuously being plagued my a number of problems that are capable of bringing forth lots of complications and challenges and, ultimately, could result in revenue losses, especially for SMB companies. These major problems are :  - Demand Forecasting for manufacturers;  - Quality and Accuracy; - Transparency and Trust; - Low Credit Facilities; - Sustainable Packaging;  and, last but not least, payment issues.  Here’s what OPN Whitepaper says, regarding continuous payment delays most small and medium packaging companies are experiencing on a regular basis:  No matter the internal or external cause, indeed, late payments are the main cause for poor supplier performance, deteriorating business and personal relationships and increasing prices. Except for dramatic circumstances — that are often about less than the 2% of the cases — it’s merely a matter of disrespect: “live-with-it-if-you-want-to-keep-on-doing-business-with-us” is the underlying policy of many big buyers, that tend to stretch the payments as long as possible to improve their cash flow and have more bargain power, without bearing in mind that this is the first cause of disruption in the supply chain system, above all for medium and small sized companies, that will be devoid of cash for a long period of time.  Industry insiders may only shrug their shoulders – that’s the way thing always were and, probably, will be. But not with OPN.

At the same time, supply chain companies must deal with the fact that trends never last for a long time and that anticipating demands for new products, satisfying fast-changing market requests helps in the short term but can be risky in the long term.  The market is not even a united entity, on the contrary! It can be better represented as a sum of fragmented components at the mercy of global changes or enclosed crisis that, according to economists, tend to a natural equilibrium between what providers supply and what consumers demand. Technological innovation and wars, competitors’ strengths or weaknesses and natural disasters, exchange rates and elections make the market go up and down.  Overcoming such challenge is not easy, neither for the most experienced experts in the field and the most renewed brands in the market. But keeping the control of costs, market fluctuation, transportation and materials prices and much more is crucial.  image But once again Blockchain technology comes to an aid!  This is how the technology we choose for our innovative project is able to guarantee it in a global digital market where buyers invest their money to buy aleatory products and services from distributors and other intermediaries they will never see in the eyes:  5. Eliminate intermediaries  6. Control raw materials fluctuations  7. Assure compliance to the rules  8. Demand forecasting  Loss of information, distances, barriers, the impossibility to evaluate the true cost of a product, to identify if an actor of the chain is conducting illegal activities (such as keeping workers in slavery or in inhumane work conditions, funding criminal activities or war, exploiting child labour, damaging the environment and exploiting raw materials) call for more social responsibility of enterprises in the so-called “hidden actions”, the ones that the companies don’t have an insight Into. Blockchain can improve the visibility to the supply chain as each side is able to know where exactly the product is. Sharing this information makes the planning process easier and buyers/sellers can predict lead times better and make accurate order counts.  Moreover, each ring of the chain has on hand all the information he needs to ensure the well-being of the transaction, which leads to higher productivity and quality. This is not only a plus value for customers, but also for small companies and global brands, that can ultimately fulfil the expectations of their clients, which results in higher levels of trust. Transparency is indeed the most important driver of creating trust, that in turn generates reliability, long-term business relationships, clients satisfaction and creates a “digital” environment on the where discussion, collaboration and innovation can thrive. We take cyber-security seriously. That’s why we are working every day to implement all best-practice security measures to thwart potential attacks and build transparent, trusty and trackable policies.

Stability in the package remains a mystery. Sustainable packaging is not in short supply, and there is no shortage of demand, but it is essentiaI. It manifests itself in many different materials, suitable for a variety of applications and popular with a broad demographic, but still not considered commercial. So, what is the problem?  The plastic issue  Some forms of packaging appear resistant to sustainable change. The one element which is hard to fix is plastic. While it is lightweight, it helps reduce carbon emissions, and plays an important role in decreasing food waste by keeping food fresher for longe.  However, it is not about waste. Reducing carbon emissions is important to companies and brands, with an indirect influence on transportation, just as crucial as direct energy use or footprints for production.  The rise of e-commerce makes diagrams for distribution is even more important, with failure to seize-optimize packaging producing alarming results. It does not play any role that the package is sustainable when most of its contents are in the air.  Reusable solutions In the waste and resource hierarchy, reusable solutions score even better than renewable or recyclable.  For almost a decade more and more people tend to consume coffee from reusable coffee cups, but the infrastructure is still too complicated and fragmented. Without regulatory changes, such as happened with plastic bags, it will remain in silos with the percentage of society who are both well informed and personally compelled to seek a better solution.  For the future of packaging, it is just possible the answer to the sustainability riddle is in fact not procurement or process.  However, thanks to new technologies, particularly blockchain, sustainable packaging can boost its development.  Open Packaging Network, as the name implies, aims to provide an open ecosystem for various stakeholders to interact with each other without problems.  Problems that Open Network Packaging deals with:  SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING  There is a risk with packaging. New technologies, such as 3D shapers for paper packaging, are increasing the pressure on the packaging industry, turning it into a more sustainable industry.  FORECASTING DEMAND FOR MANUFACTURERS  Manufacturers are always unsure of demand. The problem arises when buyers want their orders to be delivered as soon as possible. Buyers complain that suppliers never deliver products on time. Thus, there is a problem to be solved.  PAYMENT QUESTION  The basis of any business transaction is a financial transaction that occurs before or after the goods are sent from the manufacturer to the buyer. Typically, buyers want to increase payments over longer periods of time in order to increase their cash flow. In this regard, larger buyers are likely to have a greater trading ability. However, this is a disadvantage for small suppliers.  TRANSPARENCY AND CONFIDENCE  One of the main problems faced by the manufacturer with distributors and other intermediaries in the network is that they do not have full transparency. Therefore, manufacturers must rely on the limited data available to make strategic decisions.  QUALITY AND ACCURACY  Delivery quality is another important aspect of supplier-buyer relationships. Without high-quality products delivered, relationships will not last long. A defective product or the wrong product is a problem for buyers because they lose valuable time waiting for the right product. Since time is money, time spent is equivalent to losing business for both the buyer and the supplier. Therefore, it is very important that suppliers deliver goods to the buyer in a timely manner.

In a number of countries, operations with cryptocurrencies are officially authorized. Usually they are treated as a commodity or investment asset and for tax purposes are subject to the relevant legislation. Sometimes Bitcoin is recognized as a settlement currency (for example, in Germany and Japan). In other countries (for example, in China), operations with digital assets are prohibited for banks, but allowed for individuals, while China is the leader in the field of mining due to the presence of the greatest production capacity. In Switzerland, cryptocurrencies are subject to the same rules as foreign currencies, and this country is one of the most favorable jurisdictions for Bitcoin startups and public blockchains. There are no restrictions on the use of Bitcoin in Russia for 2017.   European Union  On October 22, 2015, the European Court of Justice ruled that exchanging bitcoins for fiat currencies is exempt from VAT. The court decision states that the VAT law applies to the supply of goods and the provision of services. Transactions in bitcoins were classified as payment transactions with currencies, coins and banknotes, and therefore are not subject to VAT. The court recommended that all EU member countries exclude cryptocurrencies from the number of assets subject to taxation.  Germany  At the end of August 2013, the Ministry of Finance of Germany made a statement that Bitcoin could not be classified as electronic or foreign currency, but rather the definition of private money, through which multilateral clearing operations can be performed.

This is largely due to the fact that in general terms the two procedures are quite similar in terms of the layman. However, they differ in many parameters and this comparison is largely inaccurate. First you need to decide what is ICO and IPO.  What is ICO?  ICO is a tool by which young developing companies can sell digital tokens to finance their business processes and achieve other goals.  To run an ICO, a startup prepares a special document - white paper. It regulates the main details of the project, indicates the intermediate goals that need to be achieved, determines the number of tokens issued for fundraising, and describes what percentage of assets the creators plan to keep.  What is an IPO?  An IPO is a tool that allows companies to sell their securities to the public for the first time. Despite the fact that they mostly sell shares through IPOs, companies can also distribute other securities: bonds, futures, warrants, etc.  To run an IPO, a company usually hires several investment banks (underwriters). Further, these underwriters work with the company to understand which securities to sell and how much investment it will attract.  The purpose of an investment bank is to prepare a preliminary prospectus. This document provides investors with information about the company, including the following: a description of the business plan, ownership structure and management; financial documents and strategic initiatives.  After further processing and revision, this preliminary document becomes the final prospectus, which will later be submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), where the IPO application will be formed.

Here are the main trends in the industry for 2019.  Formats  The current trend is small packaging or single-portion packaging. This is due to social and demographic factors: an increase in the number of single and elderly people, single-parent families, as well as a reduction in the time spent in the modern world on cooking. The volume of shipping and handling is constantly increasing due to the fact that the consumer prefers small packaging of end products of all industries: food, including chilled products, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and others.  Openness  The consumer wants more and more information about the products he consumes, based on ethical considerations and health safety. Consequently, now trademarks have to find an unmistakable balance between the required information and the attractiveness of the packaging, which can cause consumer demand. Indeed, 67% of purchasing decisions are dictated by the emotional aspect.  Electronic / Mobile Commerce  In this area, the main guiding principles of consumer demand motivation are price, comfort, time saving and home delivery. Packaging performs more than just a protective function. Technologies such as a bar code, radio frequency identification (RFID) or a QR code provide the ability to trace the origin of goods and allow you to detect a fake to protect the interests of brands and consumers.

CMR will be an indispensable document to our delivery agents most especially, and to suppliers, buyers, and all OPN platform users in general.  CMR shipping document is an official document / convention for international carriage formed by the United Nations which is used by all the EU member countries and some additional ones.

The document can be requested when there is a police check or a customs check and the driver needs to carry it with him until the final delivery destination. The document is filled in either by the seller or the forwarder. Usually in full truck loads it is filled in by the seller and in less than full truck loads by the forwarder (especially when the truck that will pick up the order is not the truck that will deliver it).  The document is written usually in two languages and has standard fields labeled with numbers. Each number corresponds to specific information that need to be written inside.

However, it may be difficult to coordinate the transportation of the shipment unit through the various logistics service provider transportation networks. Moreover, if there are special handling requirements for transporting the shipment unit, it may be difficult to ensure that the special handling requirements are carried through by each of the various logistics service providers that may assist in transporting the shipment unit.”  This is what is read in a note, published last Thursday by the US Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO), which explains the decision of the delivery giant to switch to Blockchain and DLT (distributed ledger technology) to route packages throughout an international supply chain that may include multiple carriers.  United Parcel Service (UPS) is a Georgia based multinational package delivery and supply chain management company, founded way back in 1907 — when deliveries still were made on foot and, only for longer trips, on bicycles — which now counts almost 440,000 employees worldwide, over 105,000 vehicles, a revenue of 65.872 billion (2017) and three main divisions and subsidiaries, its cargo airline (UPS Airlines), freight-based trucking operation (UPS Freight, formerly Overnite Transportation), and retail-based packing and shipping centers (The UPS Store).   But why a century-old authority in the logistic system decided to change course and rely on the disrupting power of blockchain technology?  The main answer is probably that, within the current system it is still difficult to coordinate logistics for shipments that involve more than one logistics service provider transportation network: the patent application, which UPS originally filed on Feb. 16, could help streamline package delivery logistics across a global supply chain. While shipping logistics providers have, indeed, become quite adept at optimizing package routing to increase efficiency and minimize costs, UPS aims to tackle this problem with an autonomous system that, in some embodiments, uses an immutable blockchain ledger to automatically route packages through multiple logistics service provider networks.

Buzzwords apart, data show how this brand new hot topic in the financial sector really has the potential to change the whole industry system for years to come.  With a global Blockchain market expected to grow over $60 billion by 2024 many well-known brands and industry titans, as well as new ventures and startups out there have decided to explore and adopt its distributed ledger technology to solve market inefficiencies, benefit from the advantages of its innovations, experiment the potentiality of its tokenized economy, rely on its data storage encryption processes, use its faster transactions system.  Is all this something we really can rely (or invest) on?  There’s an economic theory by Jens Beckert called “Imagined Futures”, which says people often make decisions based not on what history or data prove is true but on what they own believe will come true in the future. Those visions could be so strong to coordinate groups of people toward the creation of something tangible and grounded, something to materialize and bring to life, something that can also have a great value: is not just about creating a technology, but opening the doors to a new future, which come true because they believe it can.

Consumers are always more shopping online while seeking out for more sustainability. Seem to love all this brand new smart packaging stuffs, while choosing products with those old-fashioned and vintage labels. Look for the best price, while don’t want to renounce to quality. Assert they don’t want packaging anymore while seeking for wrappings that extend food freshness, preserve ingredient fortification, and ensure safe delivery.  How can the sector stand up to all those pressures, to the new consumers’ requests, to the disruption of the whole industry system? And, more important, why have those challenges became so urgent now and how can we face them? Well, let us proceed in order. Packaging has always been ubiquitous but overlooked at the same time: customers’ demand changing, sustainability issues, the rise of e-commerce and IoT technologies, brands’ requests for packages to play a more active role in marketing their products, raw market fluctuations are squeezing out industry professional and imposing pressures both from above and below.  1) Packaging Vs New Shopping Methods  One has always been used to look at packages on the good old store shelves, side by side with their competitors in a limited space. Now, with the growth of e-commerce, packages have to grab consumers attention on a huge, overcrowded market where packaging is only apparently useless: brands could make their products more appealing by showing them unwrapped, or by using photos to show shoppers the products’ natural ingredients or other unique features, but they actually keep on using the packages for attracting new buyers.

Blocksmatter, a leading platform for tokenized asset management, conducts independent ICO assessment and research reports, in order to provide a professional and independent business review for expert investors in this rather new investment space. Assessments and ratings are performed bottom-up along a sophisticated methodology with different weightings of the categories: Blocksmatter typically conducts its assessments and research by in-depth analysis of the whitepaper, additional information material provided by the company, direct interviews with the management and key employees as well as market research. The team members have a long track record in the space of venture capital and private equity investments, financial research, audit, and advisory as well as technology.  Even if the platform isn’t able to predict how the crypto market will further develop under ongoing regulatory developments, which may affect investments directly or indirectly, they provide an independent second opinion, adding a solid value to make the crypto-investment space more transparent and attractive for investors.  Here at OPN Platform we believe that a professional and independent ICO assessment is highly useful, in order to understand the quality of the venture and the team behind, the value and the benefit of a token and consequently the upside potential of an investment and to get interested potential investors a better insight in this specific case through an in-depth analysis and assessment.  https://medium.com/@openpackaging/opn-ico-assestment-report-by-blocksmatter-attests-platform-potencial-140ad01e361b",False

The ETF world launched the trend and everybody else asked himself “Why don’t putting money in there too?”. Ultimately, Blockchain is the last and biggest disruptor to the managed investment industry since the personal computing in the 1980s, Internet in the 1990s, mobile in the 2000s, and social in the 2010s and, bearing in mind that if one would have put some money in that now would be a (m/b) illionair, it worth to spend a bit of time understanding how all this works. With cryptocurrencies, the most direct way to invest, the risk is betting not only on the success of technology but also on a valid business model. But with tokens, you’re also betting that they won’t get hacked, tricked, blackmailed, or subpoenaed.  Basically, you’re making a Wall Street joke, so the best option would probably be buying different coins across different platforms, putting them in your wallet and waiting (and hoping) to find them redoubled in about ten years. With tokens, you send some money to a project or company and get tokens return, like a kind of profit shared with other contributors. The startup world is filled with them: more than $800,000,000 worth of Tokens were bought in September 2017 and new cryptocurrencies are being issued every day. Tokens are just a Smart Contract, a piece of code issued on Ethereum platform which stores a list of people wallet addresses and their balance of that token. Once someone is transferring the token the sender’s balance is reduced and receivers increased. Then, the transaction is recorded in the Smart Contract storage. Anybody can create a new Token, issue it, share it or sell it. They are, basically, a promise of profit: once the platform is ready and profitable, the team will start distributing profits to its token holders (security tokens). Other tokens (utility token) are, instead, a promise of a future use within the platform. But why should token demand increase over time?  Well, cryptopreneurs are creating various ways to integrate their token into their platform, so that the demand of a token would increase with a success of the project and this would lead to a huge price increase above all for early token holders. This is a key point: Token total supply cap should always be defined!",False

If they has zero knowledge about this forum, then why they hire you to attend to their thread on this forum? It can only means they do know something about bitcointalk, even if just a tiny bit. Further, if they know (even for little to none) about this forum, and they can help answering things that community manager can not, then why not joining?  Switzerland invitation; I'm very flattered, thank you, but as I said, some discussion are better be held here, so people can also follow the topic, gain info, and take decisions based on what they found on the QnA. This opportunity might be lost or slightly distorted if the discussion happen on a less open place like telegram or a coffee talk",False
