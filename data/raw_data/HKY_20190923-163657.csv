I think it's pretty interesting. I'm very impressed you have a former Tinder executive on your team. I imagine you will be able to utilize his experience to get this off the ground. What is one thing you have learned from him to improve this product?,False

I am unable to get on Telegram at work but I'll note it for when I'm home.  In glancing over the whitepaper, I saw that Hicky provides some pretty neat features that incentivize good behavior and therefore keep users happy. I particularly thought the ""date deposit"" was a unique idea that does not appear to be in any other dating app I've seen. I think a video on the entire scenario of the date would be a cool marketing idea that could show potential users how unique Hicky is.",False
