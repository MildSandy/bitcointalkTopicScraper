Just think about a scenario when a collector has some models or some things or versions of these things he collects but couldn't get his hands on it because of the item being phased out by the xompany. What then will he do to get some? He will obviously go to extensive efforts in looking for people who have the stuff he needs and make offers. This is where fair ninja comes in. When there are owners or people that have collectibles and don't want them  anymore or need a few extra buck, they can use this platform to sell theur items and the collectors will be able to bud in that specific object and complete his collection or at keast increase the number. This platform will really be doing a lot in changing the way collectors hunt for their favorite items. Thus push better mass adoption.",False

If this different online marketplace has already succeeded, I am sure that this will also happen with Fair Ninja. First, Fair Ninja runs on blockchain Technology, and cryptocurrencies will be used to pay instead of fiat money. This will be a new experience for buyers and sellers. Secondly, the Smart contract and security policies of Fair Ninja will surely attract more customers since everyone don't want to experience being scammed.

Once they are set up, they will be partnering up with other classifieds worldwide with initial focus on European countries then Asian countries probably, it's like introducing crypto currency in a new classifieds platform. For me, the disadvantage is that there are restrictions with regards to the crypto currency industry, resulting in potential investors from US and China to not be able to participate in the ICO.

By using the brand name of the product, that was already illegal. Authentic items should be sold on Fair Ninja.

Bounty details coming tomorrow and yes,there will be translation bounties aswell!  Our project has high ambitions and we want to create a marketplace where people can finally find cryptocurrency spendable and usable. As we feel that we can simplify , make faster and make better the process of buying/selling goods and services between two people. Especially if you already own cryptocurrency,the process is long and complicated. Sell crypto to fiat->transfer to bank->calculate saving for taxes->buy. We sometimes forget that cryptocurrency is cryptoCURRENCY . We tapped into the world of cryptocurrency with idea to change the usual classifieds system by using the blockchain technology.  Our team isn't complete,and we will expand,that means also advisors needed to reach our goals. We are every aware of the potential of our project ",False

And maybe getting branded items at a much cheaper price because it's second-hand already. But what I'm wondering is the shipping fee. Sometimes the shipping fee incurs higher cost than the cost of the item itself. Even purchasing in ali express, alibaba, amazon, etc. has really high shipping fee that sometimes you will end up buying the goods locally. So what are your suggestions on this or you have the solution for this problem already?",False

Classifieds and selling of second hand goods is a multi-billion dollar industry. I havent seen any ICO explore classifieds in the past and so Fair Ninja could have a first mover advantage in this segment.

I feel it can do very well in the Blockchain and cryptocurrency space. The company needs to get more advisors onboard and also reason out the need for Reserve funds.",False
