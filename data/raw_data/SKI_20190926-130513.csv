The intention is to arrive at the last stage with a functioning product, ready for the market.  We believe that you are the beating heart of the Skillchain project, which is why we would like to provide you with updates on the progress of partnerships, developments and the work in progress:     ✅ Partnerships and Agreements: We already have three partnerships with large and famous universities: two in Italy (one in Lombardy and one in Lazio), and one overseas (in the area of Rhode Island). We have others in the pipeline and as soon as possible we will officially share with you the names of these institutions.     ✅  Development and SKI Community Contest: We are excited to tell you that after arduous work on the development of the Skillchain application…we will soon release version 0.1 for those who have already participated in the project! 🙌🙌🙌      In the following days, we will launch a CONTEST on this first version, which will allow all those who took part in the previous phases to start a real certification process of their skills. You will share with the Skillchain Team documents 📃  (diplomas, certificates, etc.) and we will begin requesting authorization from everyone you report to us. Once the process ends, you will have timely communications on the progress of your certifications.  We have also thought about those who have not yet had the opportunity to participate actively in our project 🎁 : a trial version of Skillchain will be offered, with temporary and limited availability.       ✅  Development: In the meantime, we are working on the second part of Skillchain, the service platform that will support the skills validation process.  We want to offer you a 💯% complete and functional tool, Skillchain will be enhanced with a section where you can print, export, and convert your certificates into various formats. There will also be one where you can match candidates/headhunters/companies that are looking for professionals.  ✅ Work In Progress: We are proceeding to customize what has been developed so far to meet the needs of the various institutions which we have already partnered with, always making Skillchain increasingly attractive to the HR world.       📌 Since we want to maintain a consistent line of communication, we have not yet set the dates. The amount of work is very high and we are receiving many requests from potential collaborators.  At the moment, we know that:  ✅  we will reopen a phase to the public between q3 and q4    ✅  we will be listed on the exchange - we are also making agreements with the most famous - by the end of the year (or at the latest the beginning of 2019).

The intention is to arrive at the last stage with a functioning product, ready for the market.   We believe that you are the beating heart of the Skillchain project, which is why we would like to provide you with updates on the progress of partnerships, developments and the work in progress:      ✅ Partnerships and Agreements: We already have three partnerships with large and famous universities: two in Italy (one in Lombardy and one in Lazio), and one overseas (in the area of Rhode Island). We have others in the pipeline and as soon as possible we will officially share with you the names of these institutions.      ✅  Development and SKI Community Contest: We are excited to tell you that after arduous work on the development of the Skillchain application…we will soon release version 0.1 for those who have already participated in the project! 🙌🙌🙌     In the following days, we will launch a CONTEST on this first version, which will allow all those who took part in the previous phases to start a real certification process of their skills. You will share with the Skillchain Team documents 📃  (diplomas, certificates, etc.) and we will begin requesting authorization from everyone you report to us. Once the process ends, you will have timely communications on the progress of your certifications.  We have also thought about those who have not yet had the opportunity to participate actively in our project 🎁 : a trial version of Skillchain will be offered, with temporary and limited availability.      ✅  Development: In the meantime, we are working on the second part of Skillchain, the service platform that will support the skills validation process.  We want to offer you a 💯% complete and functional tool, Skillchain will be enhanced with a section where you can print, export, and convert your certificates into various formats. There will also be one where you can match candidates/headhunters/companies that are looking for professionals.  ✅ Work In Progress: We are proceeding to customize what has been developed so far to meet the needs of the various institutions which we have already partnered with, always making Skillchain increasingly attractive to the HR world.        📌 Since we want to maintain a consistent line of communication, we have not yet set the dates. The amount of work is very high and we are receiving many requests from potential collaborators.   At the moment, we know that:   ✅  we will reopen a phase to the public between q3 and q4   ✅  we will be listed on the exchange - we are also making agreements with the most famous - by the end of the year (or at the latest the beginning of 2019).      For those who have already participated: Keep Calm & Certify your Skills! You will receive all the tokens that are due to you at the end of the ICO phase.    Phase 1 happening 6th April.

Skillchain is the definitive protocol where universities, companies and non-academic training companies meet to immutably certify your skills and competencies.   TODAY Companies spend millions of dollars in search of the best talent, but this search does not always bring certainty.  Universities Formal institutions of higher learning want the best positions for their students and to stand out amongst their competition for their admission rates.  Professionals Talented individuals seeking opportunities are often sidelined by those who have a “little help"".  Non-formal education Everyone knows that a single college degree can't define the worth or merit of a candidate.  Not every skill can be mastered in college, and there isn't a singular failproof way to validate all non-formal education courses. Anyone can embellish his resume with countless courses without having even taken one.   A Skillchain-powered FUTURE  Companies They'll hire the best talent, without needing to spend all that time and money on verification and checks on candidates. Every resume in Skillchain is 100% verified, we do all the dirty stuff for you.   Universities Fake degrees will be a thing of the past, giving way to those who actually completed the courses and degrees they say they did. Universities will be able to help place their bright sparks in the best positions amongst the workforce, and optimise their admission procedures.  Professionals Individuals will finally be evaluated for competencies they gained from their experience and hard work. Not for the words they string together on a piece of paper.   Non-formal Education Certifications will be verified on the blockchain, ensuring zero room for forgery. Our platform will give course-goers a heightened sense of security with every step they take toward self-enrichment.
