Dicha cooperación posibilitará que los titulares de tokens, puedan ver, votar, financiar y respaldar sus proyectos preferidos de los medios, en un ecosistema y mercado descentralizados.  SPOKKKZ permite al espectador decidir qué contenido le agrada y a qué precio, permitiéndole acceder a un ecosistema y mercado descentralizados. A través de la financiación colectiva, colaborando en la promoción de cine y programas de televisión, las comunidades de espectadores estarán en estrecha conexión con productores, creadores de contenido, distribuidores, estrellas y anunciantes, todos ellos como grupos de interés en condiciones ecuánimes.  Dicha colaboración está sustentada sobre un negocio establecido y en rápido crecimiento, el cual permitirá una implementación a mayor escala, gracias a la vanguardista plataforma de Zilliqa. Esto supondrá una revolución para nuestra comunidad, nuestros socios de contenido y el espacio de blockchain en general, afirma Subin Subaiah, Director Ejecutivo de Spokkz.  Spokkz es una iniciativa de Spuul que aspira a romper con el estándar tradicional del sector de los medios de comunicación. Desde 2012, Spuul ha liderado la provisión de contenido de video retransmitido a lo largo de 180 países, contando ya con una base de usuarios existente que supera los 57 Millones de usuarios. Ha generado 15 millones de dólares en ingresos el pasado 2017, y estimamos que será duplicado anualmente, durante los tres años siguientes.  Zilliqa se ha diseñado, partiendo de un alto nivel de rendimiento y seguridad, en mente. La cooperación entre Spokkz-Zilliqa será un referente de escalabilidad de elitista en el entorno blockchain, afirma Juzar Motiwalla, Presidente de Zilliqa.  Zilliqa es la primera plataforma blockchain pública de alto rendimiento del mundo, diseñada para permitir un escalado a miles de transacciones por segundo. Dicha plataforma se respalda en tecnología de sharding (pequeños fragmentos), moldeando con ella un protocolo innovador, que incrementa su velocidad de transacción mientras su red va expandiéndose. La plataforma está lista para acoger aplicaciones seguras, donde los datos tienen una sustancial relevancia, descentralizadas y estructuradas para permitir el escalado.  Ambos, Spokkz y Zilliqa han sido establecidos en Singapur.

Los coordinadores tecnológicos de ambas organizaciones presentaron la visión general de su diseño, mientras los altos ejecutivos debatieron respecto de los modelos de colaboración más adecuados a la cabeza del negocio. En dicha reunión se congregarón Xinshu Dong, CEO, Amrit Kumar, Coordinador de Investigación, Juzar Motiwalla, Presidente y En Hui Ong, Coordinador de Desarrollo de Negocio.  Los directores técnicos de Spokkz, Daniel Muller y Srihari Y., expusieron en primera instancia una descripción generalizada de Spuul (Empresa matriz de Spokkz). Ambas empresas, -Spokkz y Spuul-, emplean en la actualidad el archiconocido marco de Amazon Web Services. Con el propósito de mejorar la oferta de servicios de Spokkz, se ha propuesto la transferencia de sus soluciones de negocio existentes al blockchain.  El coordinador de investigación de Zilliqa, Amrit Kumar, expuso posteriormente una descripción general técnica de su innovadora plataforma de blockchain, con amplias posibilidades en cuanto a incremento de escala. De acuerdo a Kumar, Zilliqa alcanza un elevado rendimiento gracias al uso eficaz de la fragmentación -aparte de otras tecnologías-, dirigido por un comité de Servicio de Directorio, el cual delega la responsabilidad de computación, sobre el respectivo clúster de nodos de fragmentación. La consecuencia principal, es que a mayor cantidad de nodos en la red de Zilliqa, mayor eficiencia presentará el sistema.  Tras concluir las presentaciones técnicas, ambos equipos debatieron acerca de cómo el blockchain podría enriquecer los servicios de Spuul. Las alternativas potenciales se enfocaban básicamente: por un lado en contar con la plataforma de blockchain de Zilliqa que facilite el esfuerzo de financiación colectiva orientada a la producción de contenidos, por otro lado, incluir un programa de fidelización de Spuul. Seguidamente ambos equipos concretaron los plazos para sincronizar sus respectivos hitos.  Finalizada la reunión, ambos equipos permanecieron en la oficina de Spokkz desarrollando una breve sesión de trabajo en red, además de jugar unas partidas al futbolín. ¡Estamos entusiasmados con los resultados de una colaboración emocionante y productiva!

La innovación forma un elemento esencial para Spuul, ya que además de ser absolutamente imprescindible, marca la notoria diferencia entre la vida y la muerte empresarial. Para Spuul, cada cliente representa a un usuario único, con sus respectivas preferencias en cuanto a idioma, dispositivo, tipo de contenido, formas de pago, capacidad de atención, preferencias de género, etc.  En un principio, Spuul surgió como un servicio de video a la carta (SVOD), gracias al cual los suscriptores podían visualizar las películas del catálogo ofertado por Spuul. No obstante, mientras se ha ido expandiendo el servicio a más países, la demanda de televisión lineal ha ido experimentando un incremento en diversas regiones del mundo, de modo que esto se escapaba de un procesamiento a escala doméstica. De ahí, la necesidad de la asociación con AWS.  La decisión de asociarse con AWS por parte de Spuul, era ideal para el negocio. Gracias a AWS, Spuul fue capaz de transformarse desde una solución de alto coste, hacia una solución más económica. Las actualizaciones de implementación, podían desplegarse incluso antes de que el cliente se diera cuenta. De mayor importancia aún, la potencial escalabilidad dotada por AWS y que iba en consonancia con los cambios. Abarcando 150 territorios a nivel mundial, la gestión eficaz del tráfico y la fiabilidad, eran dos áreas cruciales gestionadas por AWS.  Del mismo modo que para Amazon, Spuul es una compañía que se esfuerza para reducir los costes en que incurren sus clientes. El coste es un factor esencial para empresas con pequeño margen comercial. El cliente paga exclusivamente por lo consumido y se prescinde de gastos por adelantado, derivados de la entrega de más de 200 canales de televisión lineales. AWS brindaba una solución más económica que la provista por Spuul al tener que operar por sí mismo, donde se evidencia que la experiencia supone un coste de lujo.  Para Spuul, el poder contar con AWS le ha reportado mayor involucración del cliente, además de incrementarse la confianza del mismo. La relación efectiva con el cliente es posible gracias a AWS. Las actualizaciones y los nuevos lanzamientos, así como las consultas de los clientes pueden resolverse inmediatamente. El trabajo conjunto del equipo, donde prima una colaboración eficaz, es parte intrínseca de AWS. La asociación de Spuul con AWS ha sido la base de vínculos exitosos de cara al largo plazo, respaldados por la satisfacción del cliente, el cual se beneficia doblemente, ¡por contar con una experiencia maravillosa, y a un menor coste!

Se ha publicado un artículo interesante en Recode, ""Here's who owns everything in Big Media today"", el cual pone de manifiesto una visión general del paradigma de los medios de comunicación. Empresas conglomeradas como AT&T, Comcast, Verizon, Disney y Netflix han estado monopolizando en su posición hegemónica, el sector de los medios de comunicación, cada una con una capitalización de mercado de más de $150 billones.  Actualmente, dichas grandes empresas de medios de comunicación acaparan no solo la mayor parte de la cuota de mercado, sino también la titularidad de la mayoría de las empresas de la industria del entretenimiento -Ej.: estudios de producción, empresas cinematográficas, cines, televisión por cable, etc-. Teniendo en cuenta la influencia y el poder de control ejercido por varias organizaciones en el entorno de los medios de comunicación, se evidencia cierta preocupación respecto la perspectiva de dicho sector. A continuación destacamos las consecuencias potenciales derivadas de dicha monopolización.  1. Barreras de entrada al sector de los medios de comunicación  El negocio de los medios de comunicación siempre ha tenido la consideración de oligopolio. Las grandes empresas de medios de comunicación se han pasado años invirtiendo en propiedad intelectual de calidad, contenidos, marcas y capacidad de distribución, lo cual posibilitara su consolidación en dicha industria. Una vez alcanzadas dichas posiciones de liderazgo, están en disposición de alcanzar mayor ventaja competitiva en torno a una mayor cuota de mercado. Esto queda básicamente fuera del alcance de los directores y productores independientes, lo cual les supone una gran pérdida.  2. Privación de innovación en la producción de contenido cinematográfico  Contar con un presupuesto limitado, supone todo un reto para cualquier director y productor independiente, lo cual limita de sobre manera las opciones para demostrar su talento en dicha materia. A pesar de disponer del potencial para crear contenidos innovadores, el carecer de financiación, les ha privado de los recursos requeridos para dar vida a su creatividad en este entorno. La causa de ello, radica en que la mayor parte del presupuesto se asigna a distribuidores, empresas de marketing e intermediarios en otros canales, que promocionen sus películas. Evidentemente, dicha situación dificulta el crecimiento y desarrollo de la industria cinematográfica, lo cual deriva en la atrofia de la industria.  3. Falta de diversidad de contenidos en el espacio de los medios de comunicación   La consolidación de los medios ha supuesto una transformación del panorama de la industria, orientada esencialmente a la comercialización en vez de a su premisa original, el entretenimiento. La mayoría de los conglomerados de medios, se orientan exclusivamente a beneficios, en aquellos casos en que exista intereses contrapuestos de los distintos grupos de interés dentro de la empresa, respecto del interés público. La industria se ha estancado en una crisis derivada de la monotonía. La producción de cine, se erige de modo que parecen aumentar solo los ingresos, en vez del desarrollo general del sector del entretenimiento. En consecuencia, la selección de contenidos y películas por parte del público, deja de ser relevante, ya que la propiedad de los medios de comunicación se concentra bajo el yugo del conglomerado de empresas dominantes del sector.  Spokkz empodera a las comunidades de espectadores   De acuerdo a las manifiestas deficiencias existentes en la industria tradicional de medios cinematográficos, Spuul ha lanzado su propia plataforma en blockchain, denominada Spokkz, un mecanismo de financiación colectiva, el cual posibilita que sea la comunidad quien decida y financie el contenido de los proyectos a ser retransmitidos. El equipo tras la iniciativa Spokkz se ha comprometido a moldear un ecosistema descentralizado, el cual fomente y facilite la participación comunitaria de las distintas partes del mercado. Precisamente ese, será el siguiente paso en la dirección de la revolución del panorama tradicional de los medios de comunicación. Spokkz retoma los derechos y el acceso que los grupos de interés se merecen, participando de esta manera en el entorno de los medios de comunicación. Hoy en día, estas empresas conglomeradas de medios de comunicación han acaparado un poder tan grande, que no toman en cuenta la presencia y las opiniones de los agentes más pequeños del mercado. ¿No debería preocuparnos a todos, que el destino de los medios de comunicación, sea decisión exclusiva de un reducido conjunto de gigantes empresariales?

Comprando tokens de Spokkz para usar en la plataforma de retransmisión de contenido de Spuul, ya tienes muchas más opciones que simplemente limitarte a ver una peli.  Financia tu contenido favorito - incluso antes de su creación  Participa de forma directa en dicho proceso de creación de contenido como grupo de interés a tener en cuenta, y presta tu apoyo incondicional a tus creadores favoritos de contenido. Pagando con tus tokens de Spokkz, podrás ver contenido, o financiar el que aún se encuentra en fase de producción. Sin tu ayuda - ¡no existirá el contenido!  Benefíciate con un bonus cuando el contenido financiado por ti, sea bien acogido por el mercado  Como parte interesada, obtendrás beneficios si la película que ayudaste a financiar, acaba resultando ser un éxito. ¡Se trata de una estrategia WIN-WIN, donde ambas partes ganan!  Recibe recompensas por compartir tus películas favoritas o interactuar con otros usuarios que retransmitan contenido  Spuul tiene alta estima por aquellos entusiastas del cine, los más habladores y amigables, los cuales siembran el buen rollo en la comunidad Spuul, conformando una comunidad vibrante y cohesionada. ¡""Involucrarte con la comunidad"" te reportará tokens Spokkz!  Conviértete en un híbrido de retransmisor de contenidos y trader de criptomonedas en los exchanges  Con Spokkz, aquellos que retransmiten video desde la comodidad de su sofá, ahora pueden convertirse en traders de criptomonedas, negociando tokens de Spokkz por otras criptomonedas o fiat.

Innovation is a core part of Spuul, not only is it absolutely necessary but it is the difference between life and death for the business.  To Spuul, every customer is a unique user with different preferences in language, device, kind of content, payment methods, attention span, genre preferences, etc.  Originally, Spuul was based on a subscription video on demand (SVOD) based, whereby subscribers would watch movies from a catalogue that Spuul had in its portfolio.  However, as the service expanded to more countries, demands for linear TV watching increased in different regions of the world and this was not longer possible to accomplish in house.  Therefore, a partnership with AWS was needed.  When Spuul chose to partner up with AWS, it made good business sense.  Utilizing AWS, Spuul was able to transition from a high-cost solution to a low-cost solution.  Deployment upgrades were able to be implemented before the customer even noticed.  Most importantly, AWS brought scalability that was also responsive to change.  With over 150 jurisdictions worldwide, effective traffic management and reliability were 2 huge areas AWS addressed.  Similar to Amazon, Spuul is a company that works hard to charge less.  Cost is a key factor for a small margin business.  Customers pay for what they consume and there are no upfront costs for delivery of over 200 linear TV channels.  AWS provided a solution that was cheaper than Spuul doing it themselves since expertise is a luxury cost.  Spuul’s use of AWS has lead to increased customer engagement that also boosts customer confidence.  Effective customer relationship is possible with AWS.  Upgrades and new launches can be instantly fulfilled.  Customer queries can immediately be resolved.  Integrated teamwork, effective collaboration, is built into AWS.  Spuul’s partnership with AWS has successfully built long-term relationships with customers that creates a wonderful experience for them and charges them less for it!

Technical leads from both organizations presented overviews of their architecture and senior management from both sides also discussed collaboration models on the business front. Attendees from Zilliqa present at the meeting were Xinshu Dong, CEO, Amrit Kumar, Head of Research, Juzar Motiwalla, Chairman and En Hui Ong, Head of Business Development.  Spokkz technical leads, Daniel Muller and Srihari Y. presented first with an in-depth overview of Spuul’s (Spokkz’s parent company) architecture. Both Spokkz and Spuul currently make effective use of the popular Amazon Web Services framework. To enhance Spokkz’s service offerings, they envision transferring some of their existing business solutions to the blockchain.  Zilliqa’s head of research, Amrit Kumar, presented next with a technical overview of their innovative, highly scalable, blockchain platform. According to Kumar, high throughput is achieved in Zilliqa via the effective use of sharding among other techniques, which is orchestrated by a Directory Service committee which delegates computational responsibility to the respective shard node cluster. Essentially, the more nodes there are in the Zilliqa network, the more efficient the system becomes.  After the technical presentations, both teams discussed how the blockchain could further enhance Spuul’s services. Two potential possibilities are to use Zilliqa’s blockchain platform to aid with crowdfunding efforts for content production and also for Spuul’s loyalty program. Both teams then discussed timelines for synchronisation of milestones.  Following the discussion, both teams had a short networking session at the Spokkz office and engaged in a quick game of foosball. We look forward to an exciting and productive collaboration!

Technical leads from both organizations presented overviews of their architecture and senior management from both sides also discussed collaboration models on the business front. Attendees from Ontology present at the meeting were Xinshu Dong, CEO, Amrit Kumar, Head of Research, Juzar Motiwalla, Chairman and En Hui Ong, Head of Business Development.  Spokkz technical leads, Daniel Muller and Srihari Y. presented first with an in-depth overview of Spuul’s (Spokkz’s parent company) architecture. Both Spokkz and Spuul currently make effective use of the popular Amazon Web Services framework. To enhance Spokkz’s service offerings, they envision transferring some of their existing business solutions to the blockchain.  Ontology’s head of research, Amrit Kumar, presented next with a technical overview of their innovative, highly scalable, blockchain platform. According to Kumar, high throughput is achieved in Ontology via the effective use of sharding among other techniques, which is orchestrated by a Directory Service committee which delegates computational responsibility to the respective shard node cluster. Essentially, the more nodes there are in the Ontology network, the more efficient the system becomes.  After the technical presentations, both teams discussed how the blockchain could further enhance Spuul’s services. Two potential possibilities are to use Ontology’s blockchain platform to aid with crowdfunding efforts for content production and also for Spuul’s loyalty program. Both teams then discussed timelines for synchronisation of milestones.  Following the discussion, both teams had a short networking session at the Spokkz office and engaged in a quick game of foosball. We look forward to an exciting and productive collaboration!

Innovation is a core part of Spuul, not only is it absolutely necessary but it is the difference between life and death for the business.  To Spuul, every customer is a unique user with different preferences in language, device, kind of content, payment methods, attention span, genre preferences, etc.  Originally, Spuul was based on a subscription video on demand (SVOD) based, whereby subscribers would watch movies from a catalogue that Spuul had in its portfolio.  However, as the service expanded to more countries, demands for linear TV watching increased in different regions of the world and this was not longer possible to accomplish in house.  Therefore, a partnership with AWS was needed.  When Spuul chose to partner up with AWS, it made good business sense.  Utilizing AWS, Spuul was able to transition from a high-cost solution to a low-cost solution.  Deployment upgrades were able to be implemented before the customer even noticed.  Most importantly, AWS brought scalability that was also responsive to change.  With over 150 jurisdictions worldwide, effective traffic management and reliability were 2 huge areas AWS addressed.  Similar to Amazon, Spuul is a company that works hard to charge less.  Cost is a key factor for a small margin business.  Customers pay for what they consume and there are no upfront costs for delivery of over 200 linear TV channels.  AWS provided a solution that was cheaper than Spuul doing it themselves since expertise is a luxury cost.  Spuul’s use of AWS has lead to increased customer engagement that also boosts customer confidence.  Effective customer relationship is possible with AWS.  Upgrades and new launches can be instantly fulfilled.  Customer queries can immediately be resolved.  Integrated teamwork, effective collaboration, is built into AWS.  Spuul’s partnership with AWS has successfully built long-term relationships with customers that creates a wonderful experience for them and charges them less for it!

An interesting article from Recode, ‘’Here’s who owns everything in Big Media today’’, show an overview of the media landscape. Conglomerate firms like AT&T, Comcast, Verizon, Disney and Netflix have monopolised the media industry, each with a market cap of more than USD $150 billion.  Presently, these big media companies control most of the market share and own majority of the businesses in the entertainment industry, be it production studios, film enterprises, cinemas, cable TVs, etc. Therefore, considering the influence and control exercise by a few big organisations in the media space, many are concerned regarding the outlook of the media industry. The following are potential consequences due to monopolisation.  1.   Barrier to entry in the media industry  The media business has always been characterised as an oligopoly. Large media firms have spent years investing in quality Intellectual Property (IP), content, brands and distribution capacity to establish a presence in the industry. Using these dominant positions acquired, they can generate a competitive edge toward gaining a larger market share. This is essentially what independent filmmakers and producers lack access to and eventually lose out.  2.   Deprived of innovation in film production  Budget constraint is a major challenge for independent filmmakers and producers to showcase talent in the media industry. Although they possess the potential to create innovative content, but the lack of funding has deprived them the resources needed to exhibit creativity in the media space. This is because a large portion of the budget is being allocated to distributors, marketing companies and other intermediary channels to promote films. Such situation evidently hinders media growth and development, creating stagnation in the industry.  3.   Lack of content diversity in the media space   Media consolidation has changed the landscape of the industry toward commercialisation rather than entertainment. Most media conglomerates are profit driven where stakeholder interests come before public interests. The industry has been subjected to crisis due to monotony. Film making is structured in a way to increase revenue rather than the overall development of the entertainment industry. Hence, the audience choice of content and movie selections are not significant anymore due to that fact that concentration of media ownership is in the hands of these conglomerate firms.  Spokkz empowering viewer communities   In view of these pre-existing problems encountered in the traditional media industry, Spuul has launched its own blockchain platform called Spokkz, a crowdfunding mechanism that allow the community to select and fund streaming content projects. The team behind the Spokkz initiative is committed toward creating a decentralised ecosystem that can promote and facilitate community engagement between different stakeholders in the marketplace. This will be the next step toward disrupting the traditional media landscape. Spokkz is regaining the rights and access that stakeholders should have to engage in the media space. Currently, these conglomerate media firms are in control to an extent neglecting the presence and opinions of smaller players in the market. If the fate of the media industry gets to be decided by just a few large media organisations, shouldn’t we all be concerned?
