We are very proud of this event because in this cryonization we have fulfilled our obligations for the first investor of our ICO CryoGen.  The fact is that last October, when we started ICO CryoGen, almost immediately the first investor came to us - let's call him A. He was interested in the big discount that we gave to the first investors of our ICO. His mother was sick with cancer, and, unfortunately, the prognosis was disappointing. Since then, we have attracted a fairly large number of funds for our project but always recalled with gratitude our first investor.  Unfortunately, after 2 months his mother's condition seriously deteriorated. We were informed about this in advance, and the worsening of her condition dramatically progressed during the New Year holidays. This is a very difficult time for cryonics, like any weekend. Nevertheless, we did everything we could and were completely ready. When the situation became more difficult, we were constantly in touch with her son and monitoring the patient's condition. And on January 8 at 2:00 am, we received a signal that everything is very bad, and at 3:15 the mom of our first investor died.  By that time, the patient's apartment had been provided with ice for primary cooling. He was also very close to the apartment of one of our volunteers, for safety. Ice could be needed a lot, the usual freezer was not enough.  In the end, everything turned out the way we wanted. Despite this delay, when we started perfusing our patient - 15 hours after death - the condition of the circulatory system was very good. No blood clots. This was due to the fact that from the very beginning the body of the woman and, of course, the head was subjected to intensive cooling. And also the fact that during the treatment she received heparin, a blood-thinning drug.  As a result of this whole difficult operation, we performed a perfect cryopatient's brain perfusion and is in the cryo-storage now. In conclusion, we can affirm that our cryopreservation turned out at a fairly high level.  This situation gave us a new experience, made it possible to test our team for perseverance and ability to solve complex issues. We are proud of our results and our employees. Also, during this perfusion, for the first time in the role of the chief surgeon, the deputy director of OOO ""CryoRus"" Ivan Stepin was involved. He studied the surgical part of perfusion for 2 years, and he was the one who has perfectly made the necessary operation to connect to the circulatory system in this case.  We are also thankful to the relatives of our cryopatient for their psychological stamina in a difficult situation. Another life has a chance of salvation, another person has a chance to avoid death, which previously seemed inevitable. But, this case also has one more aspect. Since we fulfilled our obligations under the contract, which was concluded within the framework of the CryoGen projects, we can state that ICO CryoGen fulfills its obligations and benefits investors even being in the Pre-ICO stage.  So, we can conclude that ""CryoRus"" made cryo-preservation in a difficult situation, in which many would not have coped. We are proud of this and will continue to fight for the lives of people.  We hope that, when our investor will take a rest after a difficult situation, he will give us an interview and tell, in more detail, both his investments in ICO and his attitude to cryonics, ICO CryoGen, and KrioRus. The only thing we can say about him at the moment is that A. Russian is a businessman, specialist in the field of artificial intelligence and he has his company in the Silicon Valley in the United States.  Write back soon!

Ageing as a biologically irreversible process Every day around the world more than 150 000 people will die, some from currently incurable diseases, some by mishap from external causation, but most from the one hundred percent fatal pandemic degenerative condition simply known as ageing. 2. Absence of donor organs cryobanks Now there is no technology for prolonged cryopreservation of donor organs and, accordingly, the problem of creating cryobanks of donor organs has not been solved, because of the logistics that will be need to support the collection, conservation and transplantation processes. It is necessary to create medical cryonics center, which combine both clinical and scientific units. In such centers, there may be cryonics storages for people in a state of cryogenic suspended animation. 3. Insufficient financing of fundamental research Studies that have confirmed their relevance often do not continue due to a lack of adequate funding. For this reason, cryonics organizations are not sufficiently engaged in the research and development of cryonics, while in their practice they use the experience gained in the 90s of the last century and in the early 2000s. 4. Low life expectancy Modern medicine, despite its achievements, is not able to cure all diseases. Only 50% of patients are cured of oncology. Mortality rate from strokes and cardiovascular diseases is high. In addition, because of the short period of donor organs storage, only one out of every four people that can be saved is saved. 5. Space travel Humanity grapples with the challenges of ever-longer duration space travel. However, clearly, the life support and provisions of space travelers with nutrition during long space voyages related to huge expenses. Thus, it is necessary to create technologies for space suspended animation to make ultra-long space travel possible.   SOLUTIONS ______________   CryoGen, which is created and managed by the leading cryonics company of Eurasia — KrioRus, is aimed at the large-scale development of cryonics. Cryonics is a technology of conservation of people and animals in the state of deep cooling in the hope that in the future they can be revitalized and, if necessary, cured. This technology will also be used for reversible freezing of donor organs. In the future, cryonics will allow us to immerse astronauts in the anabiosis if there is a long voyage ahead of them. The project uses the most advanced scientific achievements  HOW IT WORKS ______________   Cryopreservation Over the last 50 years scientist around the world has been developing and improving the technique of the cryopreservation of tissues, organs, the brain and whole organisms to make the future revival possible.  There are two kinds of cryopreservation:    •   Neuropreservation, when only the brain is placed into cryonics storage.    •   Whole body preservation, when the entire organism, human or animal is preserved.  Cryonics makes it possible to maintain the human body intact until scientists discover the ideal way to restore and return the patient to life and to full health. Nowadays, there is a serious theoretical and experimental evidentiary support for the possibility of restoring biological organism and significantly prolonging a patient’s life in a relatively near future. The funds raised under the CryoGen project will be used for the development, testing and implementation of the technology for the reversible freezing of human organs and small vertebrates in 5 or 7 years and amniotes and humans in the near future. Feasibility is corroborated in experiments with fragments of animal organs. In February 2017, a fragment of a pig’s heart was reversibly cryopreserved, perfectly. When this technology is fully developed, an ideal biological recovery of the body after freezing and the continuation of its vital activity will become possible.  CryoGen team has the intention of developing and implementation of:    •   Vitrification (deep cooling which solidifies tissues without ice formation). We are planning to perform vitrification by means of ultra-fast cooling using cold gas blown through the whole body;    •   Ultra-fast and even rewarming with the use of cryoprotectants with nanoparticles;    •   New nontoxic cryoprotectants based on inert gases.  Space travel Cryonics is our chance to get to remote planets and star systems. Human life will inevitably spread beyond the Earth to inhabit the space. The CryoGen project has all chances to become a leading project, which provides services for space anabiosis; soon our technologies can be used for space flights over long distances. So, the first step toward it has already been made.  Introduction Video   GOAL ______________   The goal of the CryoGen project is to attract the attention of the world scientific community to this technology, to stimulate fundamental research of creating a completely safe thawing technology. Our activity will boost studies and researches in this field. The results obtained during our work can be used to improve dramatically the quality and longevity of people around the world.  .

Zamir Akimov Advisor   Svirin Ilya Advisor   Sergey Evfratov Head of Kriorus perfusion lab   Alberto Sarmentero Advisor   COMPANY KRIORUS ______________  In 2014, the management of famous Russian cryonics company KrioRus (http://kriorus.com/) – CryoGen project leader, at the invitation of the Government of Switzerland, visited six cantons and presented its project to open the first cryonics center in this progressive country with the aim of incorporating the company CryoGen under Swiss jurisdiction. The Ministries of Economy of three cantons became interested in the possibility of building a cryonics center in Switzerland and offered mutually beneficial terms of cooperation. Today, we enter the last stage of coordination of the creation of a European cryonics provider headquartered in Switzerland, vital to the development of cryonics in Europe, along with DNA preservation, organ cryobanking, the inauguration of a genetic archive, and more. In Switzerland, many like-minded people and colleagues join us. We have thoroughly studied the commercial real estate market in Switzerland and plan to acquire the best price and quality location for a cryonics center, for example, a decommissioned military base in the Alps. KrioRus owns several cryonics storage facilities in Russia, where we have mastered the installation and transfer of dewars and cryostats (up to 1.8 tons in empty weight). In the same locations, we have completely established the entire process of cryonics storage for human and animal cryonics patients and DNA samples.  KrioRus is the only company outside of the United States that produces cryostats of large volume for the preservation of patients’ bodies. We are proud of our own Anabiosis. For the preservation and storage of small animals, it is possible to use industrially produced dewars of small volume, but for the preservation of the human body it is necessary to use special design dewars that are produced only in the USA and by KrioRus.  We have representative offices in: USA (New York), Italy (Mirandola), Russia (St. Petersburg). Our company has arrangements with funeral service providers in Riga (Latvia), London (UK), Kiev (Ukraine), Chelyabinsk, Izhevsk, doctors and hospitals in Minsk (Republic of Belarus), Volgograd, Samara and other cities.   We have mastered all cryonics technologies and are successfully practicing them. Cryonists from around the world flock to Moscow in order to come and study at KrioRus. KrioRus is the only cryonics provider in Europe and Asia that has its own cryonics storage for conservation and long-term storage of cryonics patients, with specialized scientific laboratories and qualified staff.   There are 58 cryonics patients and 23 preserved animals in cryonics storage at KrioRus. To date, more than 400 contracts have been concluded for the future cryopreservation of humans and animals.
