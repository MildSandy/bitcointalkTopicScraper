Connect with AUTORIZE  WEBSITE | TELEGRAM | TWITTER | MEDIUM | WHITEPAPER    The autorize protocol uses the power of blockchain technology to simplify, regulate, and automate the sharing of movable goods,  paving the way for the next generation of sharing platforms.  We are building a decentralized ecosystem that enables seamless and trustless sharing of movable goods like cars, yachts, or planes. The protocol supports a community of service providers (arbiters and event supporters) and end users (movable goods owners and renters).  Effective community arbitration and growth is established through a system of reputation and rewards, with an economy based on the ATR token. Movable goods are digitalized using non-fungible tokens, which allows their use to be regulated with smart contracts.  The autorize protocol runs on the Ethereum network and is accessed through an Application Program Interface (API) and a decentralized application (DAPP).  Proof-of-concept was established with our prototype partner, FurlanTech Supercarshare. This use case demonstrates the value of autorize as a facilitator enabling super cars to easily be shared with confidence and without the need for trust.  Connect with COMMUNITY  EMAIL",False

But early arbiters will have more opportunity to get higher rewards and to build their reputation faster. Early arbiters will be encouraged by access to bounty pool rewards ( 150.000.000 ATR tokens ). Later on, after bounty pool will be drained, reward will be lower but we believe that arbiters will be incentivized by receiving 10% of total rent event price ( reward is splitted between more arbiters ) .  Arbiters with more reputation will be able to access more data. Number of arbiters per case is limited to 7 and we believe everybody will work in their own best interest. Every time an arbiter makes a wrong choice, they can lose part of their stake and their reputation is affected as well. Arbitration event can be finished after 7-21 arbiters send their votes. It is true that more arbiters would mean more chance that their judgment is more correct, but then reward per arbiter would be much lower. We believe that 7 arbiters with staked tokens and good reputation will give the correct answers.  If the required consensus is not reached or a dispute is raised by any party involved in the event, it will be settled by community members with  dispute arbiter status ( top 1% of all arbiters).     Video? Are you going to install cameras inside/outside of the car? What about privacy? I doubt many people will rent a car if they will be filmed the entire time.  It is true that many drivers who rent a car don‚Äôt want to be monitored. But in case that they will drive as it is agreed within the contract the camera won‚Äôt turn on.   I think the community should put some work too in reviewing and helping to spread the word. We cannot just wait and let the devs with all the work.  We are building foundations for strong and big community. Inside community everybody is able to monitor the progress of the project and to speak their mind of how the protocol should work.
