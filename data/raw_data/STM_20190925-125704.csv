The team had taken into account all the functional and non-functional requirements during the development. NEO smart contract allows to block the currencies NEO, GAS inside StreamDesk system, with the subsequent unlocking and sending to the address in NEO network. The smart contract has functions of storing the status of transactions and blocking tokens at its address in NEO network. The transactions structure in a smart contract has a status, a buyer, a seller and a commission, with the ability to lock tokens until it is needed to transfer them to the buyer’s address or to the seller’s address in case of a transaction cancellation.  This means that you can buy / sell not just Ethereum for fiat money but also NEO and GAS at Streamdesk platform, absolutely quickly and safely.  When selling NEO, a commission is taken in GAS, but a buyer does not pay the commission when he buys NEO. It means that a seller should have GAS in the wallet.  Why does Streamity choose NEO  In our opinion, NEO surpasses Ethereum in several parameters:  - NEO transaction speed is 1000 times faster than Ethereum. - GAS and NEO separation. There are huge advantages of using two different tokens when working with PoS protocol. - Low transactions commissions. NEO smart contract at StreamDesk is developed in such a way that we don’t charge any commissions for operations with NEO. It means that it is possible to use our platform with no commission, even with no commission in GAS - NEO can not produce fork which is an important parameter for being accepted by a real world economy. - NEO supports many encoding languages. - NEO has a more efficient and faster way to fulfil smart contracts than Ethereum.  “I consider that NEO has much more opportunities for growth and development than Ethereum. Now we can see the influx of ICOs and applications being developed on the basis of NEO. And this trend will just grow further. And as this trend grows, a need for NEO and GAS will grow with it. So now it is easy to exchange NEO and GAS for fiat using StreamDesk platform.  It is important to add that Chinese market which is about 1,4 billion people has not been mastered yet. Just imagine the excitement around NEO platform after removing ICO and cryptocurrency restrictions in China, as China prefers to use its own products and business innovations. One of NEO’s benefits is that the platform is aimed to meet regulatory requirements for the platform suitable for a smart economy. Thus, we can confidently say that adding NEO and GAS into StreamDesk is Streamity’s first step to the Chinese market development.”  Vladislav Kuznetsov, CEO Streamity Streamity team’s plans for the near future  In addition to NEO and GAS, in September we plan to launch a decentralized Bitcoin trade in an absolutely innovative way, with the help of a smart contract of another blockchain. Also the team has already begun to develop atomic transactions between NEO and Ethereum networks, but we will tell you about it a little later.  And we are glad to inform you that we are going to launch our first course for cryptotraders , which incorporated all the most important and necessary information for people who want to successfully start crypto trading.",False

This is a great opportunity to sum up some intermediate results and tell about the work that has been done and what goals have been achieved since the launch of the project!  We have not just closed the Soft cap of the project for 500 000 USD, but also collected more than 4 400 000 USD and sold more than 21 million tokens! In total, our project was supported by more than 3,200 people.  Even before the end of the ICO, we have conducted extensive work and not just implemented our idea, but also presented our users a working product - beta version of the P2P platform StreamDesk for the exchange of cryptocurrency for Fiat money. Now you can complete transactions on the website https://beta.streamdesk.io/dashboard  Most of the raised funds will be spent on further product improvement – hiring of high-class specialists and purchase of missing equipment.  Besides, marketing will become a significant expense of STREAMITY after the end of sale, because for success it is important not only to create a high-quality and valuable product but also to bring information about IT to the target audience of the project, to establish a continuous two-way communication with customers, to form and develop our own brand. These activities will make the service even better! We are also planning to create a reserve fund, from which, if necessary, such costs as obtaining licenses and permits which may be required in a number of jurisdictions and the audit will be financed.  Those, who have not become a part of our project yet, still have an opportunity to join the number of STREAMITY token holders now, receiving a 20% bonus!  https://streamity.org",False

This is the region where three-quarters of all new bitcoins of the world are mined (according to Liao Xiang, the head of Lightningasic). And miners are willing to invest coins in interesting ICO projects. In China people are particularly interested in any technological innovation and we just had to tell them about our project and show them STREAMDESK platform.   The team of STREAMITY has already convinced of the loyalty and engagement of Asian potential investors! On July 21 and 22, as a part of our Asian crypto tour, we already held the first meetings with the community and received a feedback. We have seen from our own experience that personal meetings of the project team with Chinese investors give an excellent result!   As Tony Ling, the co - founder of BitBlock Capital Fund (over $100 million investment in ICO), said- there are several million retail investors in China. Going on an Asian crypto tour, we expect to interest those who want to meet us and learn more about STREAMITY!   We remind you that the ICO of the project will be completed on August 6, 2018 and until this moment we will have time to visit Beijing and Shanghai!

Over time, STM will be able to compete with currencies from the top ten crypto currencies. The popularization of the crypto should be accompanied by a simplification of its use, as well as an increase in the security of exchanges. All transactions should be decentralized and not depend on third parties.  Along with the growing number of users of crypto currency, the number of Streamity supporters will grow.

The growth in this area can be about 6000%. He cites the following statistics: in the world less than 1% of population own cryptocurrency and 63% have smartphones. At the same time, today a huge number of people already know about the digital economy and digital assets, and  developers of applications for mobile devices are actively integrating functions of buying or selling cryptocurrencies. Thus, smartphone becomes kind of a door to the crypto world.  Srinivasan made his prediction based on the results of a research conducted by Finder among 2000 thousand Americans. Its results showed that about 8% of Americans own cryptocurrencies, and in the whole world this figure is below 1%. At the same time, users who are not ready to buy cryptocurrencies in the near future admitted that they simply do not feel the need for digital currencies, are afraid of high risks, frequent fraud and difficulties in the process of buying and selling.

We expect that after the launch of the platform, the number of its users will be constantly growing - this will be promoted by the convenience of STREAMDESK, favorable rate, transparency... And the more users are - the higher will be the demand for STM tokens, because the increase in demand always leads to an increase in the token rate!  ☑️ Some more important facts about STM tokens:  ▪️ Credit/debit of traditional money to exchanges will be more profitable through STREAMDESK service due to convenience, low fees and the market rate of the token.  ▪️ Number of the tokens STM is extremely limited and is 180,000,000. In the future STM will not be released.  ▪️ We plan to create a reserve fund in STM tokens, as well as in the main cryptocurrency and in Fiat currency to maintain liquidity on the service.  ▪️ Each token holder, starting from 1250 STM, will receive a set of privileges and reduced commissions on the STREAMDESK platform.  🔺And the main question-why is it profitable to buy tokens now?  Because now users receive STM tokens at a price much lower than at the time of the service launch, which gives them significant savings when using STREAMITY service.  The cost of one token is set at $0.2 per token, the minimum transaction is 0.1 ETH!  ▶️ You can buy tokens on the project website https://streamity.org",False

If you are reading this post, then you are a part of the cryptocurrency society. You know what Bitcoin and Ethereum are; you may be a NEO or DASH holder; and you definitely are interested in STM tokens and STREAMITY project. Perhaps, you don't quite understand how our platform plans to reform the crypto-market. Now we will tell you!  So, imagine that you need to withdraw ETH and exchange it for dollars. What are the options?  - Use the services of crypto-exchange. But it is important to remember that crypto-exchange trading terminals support the trading function only in the browser window. The terminals themselves are unreliable and do not have enough effective protection against hacking. It is unlikely that you want to be among those who lost their money on exchanges. In addition, with a large load, the terminal may hang and not allow to enter the market. There are also fees for transactions ranging from 0.2 percent to 2 – 3 or even more.  - Withdraw money through the exchange service. It's easier, although the service of exchangers is built on trust – you bring money to the wallet service, it sends us Fiat. The exchange rate is usually not beneficial, and the commission on exchange reach 20 percent. There are also mechanisms for repeatedly charging fees: many platforms for exchanging cryptocurrencies carry out transfers between cryptocurrencies through bitcoin or ether. That is, to exchange NEM for NEO, you will have to buy bitcoin for NEM and only then buy NEO for bitcoin. Commission will be charged on each transaction.  - Use the services of a person who exchange cryptocurrency. Commissions are minimal in this case, but reliability tends to zero… STREAMITY project will change the approach to cryptocurrency exchange! We want to make the process of withdrawal and purchase of cryptocurrencies faster, more convenient and transparent. For this we create a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange platform without intermediaries STREAMDESK. It allows to instantly produce a secure exchange of main cryptocurrencies.  The rate of transactions is based on the analysis of information from the main crypto-exchanges. Thus, STREAMDESK platform provides users with operations at a rate very close to the exchange rate. The security of transactions is provided by smart contracts. Clear and transparent operation of the platform distinguishes it from crypto-exchanges and exchange services.  ☑️ Within the project STREAMITY there will be not only the site STREAMDESK but also some other useful resources from cryptocurrency management's point of view(information-analytical, educational and investment). We do not just want to give the market a tool for convenient withdrawal and input of cryptocurrency – we want to help novice traders to make a profit.  https://streamity.org",False

Today, cryptocurrencies are firmly entering our lives and their use along with Fiat money ceases to be something out of the ordinary. But at the same time there is a problem: where and how to exchange cryptocurrency quickly, simply and most importantly safely?  ☑️ This problem is just solved by StreamDesk.  How often do we hear that one crypto-exchanger deceived its users, the other closed, and the third requires huge interest for the exchange?  Often enough! That is why the project team Streamity has decided to develop StreamDesk which is the world's first decentralized platform to exchange cryptocurrency at any price without intermediaries!  P2P platform with the use of a distributed database for exchange of cryptocurrencies for Fiat money guarantees fair transactions and security with the help of smart contracts architecture and payment systems API.  🔺 But what are the other benefits of StreamDesk? They are:  - minimum commission-0-2% - fixed cryptocurrency exchange rate-price is fixed - freedom of the crypto community-money is not blocked, the exchange takes place directly between a seller and a buyer.  And most important, the security and transparency of transactions is due to the smart contract-it provides maximum protection for sellers and buyers.  ☑️ Are you interested?

Millions of dollars have been accumulated on cryptocurrency exchanges. It is not surprising that they become targets of hacker attacks, and some companies do not intentionally fulfill their obligations.  Another difficulty is that the cryptocurrency market is extremely unstable and the exchange service with small fees is quite a risky venture. Companies minimize risks by putting them in the value of the cryptocurrency or in commissions.  The implementation of the project STREAMITY will solve these problems. The idea is to create a p2p-platform, where users find each other and agree on an exchange.

Great question! First one is that the process Of Buying/Selling Cryptocurrencies is complicated Most P2P platforms work only with BTC and ETH. When buying/selling other cryptocurrencies, first thing to be done is to exchange them for BTC or ETH, and then exchange for fiat money. At each stage user loses funds while paying fees (which can meet the threshold of 10%). The second market problem is that only a Small Number of Cryptocurrencies is Represented on P2P platforms Most P2P platforms accept only ETH and BTC, which prevents the user from quickly creating the desired portfolio of cryptocurrencies. And last one - that Fees are very high when Exchanging Cryptocurrencies for Fiat Money Users all over the world lose up to $ 2.5 billion daily when exchanging crypto-currency for fiat money.

A first - Streamity is not an internal trading platform. It is powerful informational portal, which includes educational, information-analytical and investment resources,within this project we develop a decentralized P2P platform for cryptocurrency exchange. About payment methods: We have our token (STM) - which you can purchase in BTC, LTC, ETH, ETC, USD, EUR, RUB STREAMITY token (STM) is the key element of the STREAMITY ecosystem. STM constitutes the internal currency of the STREAMITY project. This means that payment for all project services will be made in STMs.  The second question - could you detailed it? What do you mean under ""bonus"" ? If you participate in the second stage of ico you will get 10% bonus... BONUSPROGRAM STREAMITY offers special discounts depending on the timeliness of the buyer's entrance when purchasing STM. During the pre-ICO, STM will be discounted by 30%. Afterwards, the ICO will consist of two phases: phase one and two. On the first day of phase one, STM will be discounted by 20%. After the first day, phase one, STM will be discounted by 15%. STM will be discounted by 10% during phase two. Furthermore, by purchasing at least 1,250 STM at the pre-ICO, or on the first day of phase one of the ICO, purchasers will receive the STREAMDESK service, provided that purchasers maintain a certain minimum balance in their accounts. For example, if a purchaser invests 1,250 STM at the pre-ICO stage, or on the first day of phase one of the ICO, and keeps 1,250 STEM in their account, the purchaser receives the Platinum package, giving them the right to exchange on the STREAMDESK platform at a 0.5% commission. Similarly, if a purchaser invests 7,500 STM, the purchaser receives the Brilliant package. For a 25,000 STM investment, the purchaser receives the Unlimited package. However if you are meant that you can earn ""Bonus"" in the ""token meaning"" - you can do simple tasks, which you will find at the streamity platform - and earn tokens)) If you will write blogs and articles, do some translation and going to be usefull for the community - you will get your tokens for your work!

The mechanism for purchase and sale is similar. OAuth means open protocol of authorization. This allows granting limited access to user's protected resources to a third party without needing to transfer a login and password to the third party.  Using Yandex.Money's API for applications, we can obtain payment statuses from the Yandex.Money server and save users' data for future payments. Under this scenario, payments may be accepted in two ways: from Yandex.Money wallet or from any bank card. Request creation 1) A purchase or sale request is created on STREAMDESK. 2) The request may be created by unauthorized users; however, they will automatically go through an authorization process. 3) The following fields must be filled out for a purchase request: selecting the payment method, and entering the wallet number. If the user is not authorized, the application will show a registration form with the following parameters: name, telephone, e-mail, and an agreement for personal data processing. 4) After the request is created, the request obtains a BUY status and displayed on the STREAMDESK main page.  Request acceptance 1) Other users may accept the request as a Seller or Buyer depending on the request type. 2) The following fields must be filled out in the purchase request: selecting the listed payment method and entering the wallet number. If the user is not authorized, the application will show the registration form with the following parameters to the user: name, telephone, e-mail, and an agreement for personal data processing. 3) After the request is accepted, it obtains a PENDING CONFIRMATION status. 4) The Seller receives a notice that he/she may sell the cryptocurrency.  Confirmation and smart contract creation 1) Having obtained the notice, the Seller must confirm the request again. 2) After the request is confirmed, it obtains the PENDING SMART CONTRACT CREATION status. 3) The system checks parameters and availability of funds in the Seller’s account, and creates a smart contract. The cryptocurrency attached to the smart contract is written off from the Seller’s account. The request then obtains the PENDING PAYMENT status. 4) The cryptocurrency is locked in the smart contract (automatically according to its terms and conditions) until notice that the corresponding fiat money has been credited to the Seller’s account is verified. The request for the smart contract performance is then complete. 5) The smart contract request expires (this occurs when the current time exceeds the valid term of the smart contract, which is three hours). 6) After the request obtains the PENDING PAYMENT status, the Buyer receives a notice with a payment link.  Payment 1) Payment may be made through Yandex.Money, PayPal, Qiwi or other services. (depending on what the user selected). 2) The STREAMDESK application works with payment services through the HTTPS safe protocol. 3) The STREAMDESK application requests for a right to make a one-time payment to the Seller’s wallet. 3.1) The Buyer logs into the payment service server through OAuth2 secure protocol and authorizes the one-time payment of the amount specified in the request. 3.2) OAuth2 protocol makes the authorization secure and convenient. 4) For transfer of funds, the payment service may charge a commission. The commission is calculated and indicated when the request is created. 5) After the payment authorization is obtained, the STREAMDESK application tries to make the payment. 5.1) If the payment service prohibits the payment, the user receives a proposal to authorize the payment again. 5.2) In case of repeated rejection of payments, the STREAMDESK application assigns a CANCELLED status to the request.  Smart Contract Performance If the payment is successful (the payment service will indicate a successful transfer of funds), the STREAMDESK application performs the smart contract and assigns the FULFILLED status to the request. The cryptocurrency is then transferred to the Buyer’s account.",False

Our competitors - Local Bitcoins, Challengy, Qvolta - Lets explain the differ from them:  Local Bitcoins is a bulletin board that matches interested parties in a specific country. This service supports only bitcoins  and exchange rates are set by the users of the platform. And there is a lack of secure transactions.  Changelly is a platform that supports a few dozens of cryptocurrencies.  But users can buy cryptocurrency for US dollars, they are not allowed to sell cryptocurrency for fiat money.  About security: the security of a deal is guaranteed only by the credibility of the team. This assurance is suspect, as the security technology is not transparent. Qvolta is a new service created in 2017 and have raised its funds via an ICO. To date, this platform is still in a “test mode”. Although this service states that customers can use different payment methods, it only supports Bitcoin and Ethereum. They claims that their security system will protect its accounts and transactions. However, the development of this platform is still in progress.

Changelly is a platform that supports a few dozens of cryptocurrencies. But users can buy cryptocurrency for US dollars, they are not allowed to sell cryptocurrency for fiat money. Security: the security of a deal is guaranteed only by the credibility of the team. This assurance is suspect, as the security technology is not transparent.  Qvolta is a new service created in 2017 and have raised its funds via an ICO. To date, this platform is still in a “test mode”. Although this service states that customers can use different payment methods, it only supports Bitcoin and Ethereum. Qvolta claims that their security system will protect its accounts and transactions. However, the development of this platform is still in progress.

Thank you for a Great question! First of all, StreamDesk is P2P cryptocurrency exchange services. So i will provide you our unique features which made us stand out from other P2P solutions   here we go: - Local Bitcoins is a bulletin board that matches interested parties in a specific country. First, this service supports only bitcoins; second, exchange rates are set by the users of the platform; and lastly, but most important - there is a lack of secure transactions!  - Changelly is a platform that supports a few dozens of cryptocurrencies. First - users can buy cryptocurrency for US dollars, but cant sell cryptocurrency for fiat money. Second, the security of a deal is guaranteed only by the credibility of the team. (its mean that the security) technology is not transparent.  - Qvolta is a new service created in 2017 and have raised its funds via an ICO. To date, this platform is still in a “test mode”. This service states that customers can use different payment methods (nowadays supports only Bitcoin and Ethereum). Qvolta claims that their security system will protect its accounts and transactions. However, the development of this platform is still in progress. It is unclear how smart-contracts will be used within this platform, as there is a lack of technical description of its processes.  In contrast to our competitors, STREAMITY is the first P2P platform ready to protect transactions with smart-contracts.  - Smart-contracts provide additional security to the cryptocurrency exchange process, in addition to the verification of users. - Fair cryptocurrency pricing is an integral part of STREAMITY's services. Rates are calculated in real time, aggregating the average weighted price from major cryptocurrency exchanges. - Users can confidently and securely exchange cryptocurrencies at fair market value. - Services allow users to enter the world of cryptocurrency investments seamlessly. - We expect the majority of our customers to be active users of on-line payments systems. - Although these users are generally familiar with on-line payment systems and cryptocurrencies, they require a higher standard for security than initial cryptocurrency enthusiasts.  As the cryptocurrency markets expand, platforms, such as STREAMITY, are poised to service the next wave of cryptocurrency users. Enjoy your reading!",False

Moreover, they are complicated, illegal and set huge commissions. Streamity is aiming to resolve it. The Streamity project consists of two main components: – StreamDesk This is a P2P platform for smart contract cryptocurrency exchange managed with a decentralized application developed by Streamity. The platform provides the service of fast and secure cryptocurrency-to-fiat exchange with minimal commissions (from 0% to 2%). What is important – the operations will be performed without the need for a centralized third party. Currently most of exchange operations are conducted on centralized exchanges which may lead to issues with regulatory authorities and blocking users’ accounts. The P2P technology eliminates suchlike situations. – A free portal about cryptocurrency The portal will provide lots of information about cryptocurrency - analytical, educational and investment resources, including market review, news, ideas, blogs, articles, knowledge base, investment statistics, ICO recommendations. The portal will be made by community and for the community, and it will be free of charge. Streamity token (STM) is an ERC-20 token that will be used within the entire ecosystem as a payment method for all services offered by the project, including the P2P cryptocurrency exchange. The full supply of tokens is limited to 186 million, 100 million tokens will be sold on the ICO. On the first day of the ICO you will get 20% discount, days 2-14 – 15% discount, and 10% - during phase 2 of the ICO. Token distribution – 70% for ICO, 25% for the team, 3% for the rewards program, and 2% for the advisors and partners.  Team The team consists of 16 specialists, most of which are experienced software developers. Add here professionals in blockchain technology, marketing, traders, investors, and Streamity’s CEO Vladislav Kuznetsov who has more than 10 years of experience in business and asset management at the stock market. And they are still looking for new members in the team. The team doesn’t look very experienced in cryptocurrency market and blockchain, they are rather excellent specialists in other spheres who were inspired by the blockchain technology. This is partly compensated by advisors, more experienced in blockchain. All in all they have 10 advisors and one company-partner (BBS PTE, Best Business Solutions).  Summary The idea is pretty good, since the market still needs a cryptocurrency exchange that could be fast, secure, reliable, cheap, and independent from third parties. Though the project is still in its beginning, it seems that Streamity has all the necessary ingredients to bring it to success – a good idea, inspired team, clear whitepaper, and desire to make the cryptocurrency market a bit better and more comfortable. Anyway, don’t forget about other ICOs trying to achieve the same goal, because this project is not the first attempt to improve cryptocurrency exchanges.  Yet another attempt to resolve old shortcomings of today’s cryptocurrency exchanges – slow and expensive transactions, and necessity to include third parties in the processes. Add here a pleasant bonus in the form of free informational portal for the community and you’ll get the picture of Streamity.",False
