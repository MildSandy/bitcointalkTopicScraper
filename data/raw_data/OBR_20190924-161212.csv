Even one of the community manager said: `I didn't get any info from dev side since their stop the comunity manager. Obviously they are big scam!` The problem with scammers is, they not care about the feelings or hardship of their investors. They not react even if you threaten them. Most scammers even enjoy toying with their victims or stalling them. I now that because it is not the first scam i got into    For vietnamese investors who lost money it is more easy to report the scam. For investors outside from vietnam it is obviously more difficult.  I hope some vietnamese investors are taking steps and reporting them. It would be great, if they could post any steps they have taken.   Everyone who wants to write to the obirum admin (probably he will ignore you): He changed his username on telegram to @tomcrypt  Edit: Many messages i post on the obirum telegram channel get deleted.

Someone could take legal action against them for fraud and making false pretences in Vietnam:  1. They listed a lot of exchanges and press partners on their website. Most of them never heard of obirum. That is making false pretences to lure more investors in.  2. They said: `DDEX and HitBTC have accepted listing OBR token after token sale` Later they said HitBTC listening was to expensive. You can not say that HitBTC have accepted listening OBR tokens and later contradict your statement. Also another method to get more investors in who believed their lies.  3. The most important lie. They ensured their investors several times that they would continue the development of the project despite not reaching softcap only to lure more investors in. Now they stopped the project and deleted the social media channels ... . Obirum admin statement regarding to the question what happens when softcap is not reached: `We will continue development project and use fund of angel investors` This and similar statements are stated several times on telegram.  4. Not a lie, but shady. They deleted their team members on their website.  I really hope someone reports the scammers in vietnam for fraud. Maybe some angry vietnames investors who lost money and live in Hanoi. The team is actually known. The team seems to be real and not fake. The facebook profiles have a long history. Also Phùng Văn Luân post on his twitter account about obirum and his account was opened in 2011 means the account is real.  Hope everyone not lost to much in this scam.  Best wishes",False
