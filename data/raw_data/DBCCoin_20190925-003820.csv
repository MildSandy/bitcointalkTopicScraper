DataBlockChain.io is a revolutionary data platform that stands to disrupt the way that companies and individuals gather premium data. Our product will democratize data, making it more readily available and less expensive than the current methods of data gathering and vetting. The result is that clients can access specific data sets in a cost-effective and transparent way, collecting exactly what they need without paying for extraneous data.      Our Main Objective To empower Data Source Providers to provide access to their data and monetize it. To provide full transparency, traceability, and auditability to the data providers. To build confidence between the end user and data sources. To give Businesses and Consumers quality verified data. To give End Users a simplified easy-to-use interface with a quick payment system.    How It Works       Blockchain Intergration DataBlockChain.io utilizes the Ethereum Blockchain and Smart Contracts for all transactions and payments. The blockchain is a secure transaction ledger database that is shared across a distributed network of computers. Blockchain uses state-of-the-art cryptography to keep transactions secure. The ledger stores immutable records and cannot be hacked. The blockchain adds trust across transactions.   THE DBC WALLET MAKES A COMPLEX PROCESS SIMPLE DBCWallet is a browser extension that allows the user to store DBCCoins and use them to purchase services on DataBlockChain.io with a few clicks.   TOKEN MECHANISM DBCCoin is an ERC-20 Token (with ERC-667 functionality) that is implemented on the Ethereum blockchain. DataBlockChain.io utilizes Smart Contracts written in Solidity for transactions, auditing and payments. The DBCCoin tokens will be used for transactions on DataBlockChain.io and be used to remunerate Data Providers. The DBCCoin tokens will be used for transactions on DataBlockChain.io and be used to remunerate Data Providers. The DBCCoin token will also function as an essential marketing tool for DataBlockChain.io as it will serve as the basis for the Rewards Program as well as incentivizing partners through a Promotion Program. These functionalities will be fully supported in the Smart Contract using Solidity.   TOKEN DISTRIBUTION To obtain the resources required to make DBCCoin a reality, DataBlockChain.io is launching a token sale in Q2 2018. Twenty five percent of the supply (870 million DBCCoin) will be reserved for the developers, team, advisors, and founders. During the initial stage of active DBCCoin development, at least 10 percent of the entire supply will be retained by the DBCCoin Reserve to protect the nascent cryptocurrency from speculative trading and to maintain flexibility at early stages of the evolution of the product.  The remaining sixty-five percent (565 million DBCCoin) will be sold during Pre ICO and ICO. A bulk private sale of DBCCoin to a group of investors for a fiat currency is possible under the average price per token or higher, depending on the volume of the transaction.
