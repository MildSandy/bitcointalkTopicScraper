Helix [HLX]  The World’s First Cognitive Distributed Ledger for Everyone and Everything  Fully Decentralized - Directed Acyclic Graph - Infinite Scalability - No Miners - No Fees - Responsive Masternodes - Cognitive Smartnodes   Latest Whitepaper Official Website     What is Helix ?  Helix Cognitive Computing GmbH is a Berlin-based strategic tech company, dedicated to creating a cutting-edge digital ecosystem for interconnecting Everyone and Everything.  Helix aims to challenge the status quo by eliminating the need for intermediaries and central authorities, at virtually no cost.   For more information you can visit our website at www.hlx.ai.     What problem is Helix solving?  Helix solves problems associated with centralized systems and management.    Rather than blindly relying on third party promises, Helix builds trust by adopting public consensus mechanisms. Thus, it fosters the creation of endless new relationships and businesses that are more ‚direct‘ in nature.    Helix enables the use of end-to-end encryption to emit secured data streams, implying that you can fully control which parties are authorized to access your messages or data.   By eliminating intermediaries, Helix enables trustless transactions.    It is no longer required to blindly trust any intermediary, whether it is a storage or financial service provider, such as banks.   An example includes the creation of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) that are direct, peer-to-peer and organize their company through digital voting systems.    This could be achieved for any organization using the HelixFramework involving no payment fees to Helix.    The Helix Consensus Protocol is leveraged to achieve data integrity i.e. transactions that have reached  agreement are serialized to the ledger and are immutable.      What makes Helix different to others?  HelixFoundation We have a community service, the HelixFoundation. The HelixFoundation assures the sustainability of the HelixNetwork. Further, the HelixFoundation is dedicated to create educational workshops     in the realm of Distributed Ledger Technologies,     as we feel a great need of educating interested people and promote young talents  HelixNetwork    The HelixNetwork consists of Nodes (Computers) executing HCP and overlay networks    (such as Flash and MAM),  that are leveraged to achieve greater scalability and privacy.    HelixComposer We are building an application by the name of HelixComposer. Helix assigns great importance to usability and accessibility by providing an interface for people who do not have prior knowledge  in cryptocurrencies or computer sciences.   The HelixComposer and its graphical user interface provide the middle layer or rather the “interaction layer” between users and the network infrastructure. It enables interactive guidance and tools to designing own decentralized applications and defining smart contracts.   Helix Consensus Protocol (HCP) The Helix Consensus Protocol (HCP) enables efficient and secure transaction processing at virtually no cost, opposed to legacy blockchains.      What is HLX?  HLX is the cryptocurrency developed by Helix Cognitive Computing.     Why is HLX called ""Cognitive Cryptocurrency“?  Every transaction initiated in the HelixTangle results from the process of cognition.  Helix uses cognitive scientific methods for purposes of security and validation in the network.   For example, in order to approve or validate a transaction, Helix introduces the first ever transaction ledger in the crypto world, which secures transactions using artificial intelligence techniques such as decentralized deep learning, a unique ability to understand, reason and learn about cyber-attacks and threats.

The Whitepaper provides a great insight into the underlying technology behind Helix and what we are looking to achieve.  The total amount of HLX coins was set in advance by a human council and with the following formula : 2^44 *244.  Obviously this amount of coins is immense, that's why we count in millions of HLX, also know as mHLX (MegaHelix) which then gives approximately an amount of 4.3 Billions mHLX.",False

""Reserved for more details ?""  Yes, we reserved these posts for further development (probably for tech and download links)   "" what is the way of coin distribution? ""  A new document will come soon and the whitepaper will be updated about coin distribution if this is what you mean about ""coin distribution"" or did you mean how are people getting the HLX?",False
