Every one can use an ethereum smart contrat and make an ICO just like every one can develop a money transfer service  but  you cannot trust all smartcontracts just like you cannot trust all money transfer service   Why a founder will prefer LOLIGO to start his ICO ? - To run the ICO campaign in few minutes using graphical wizard - To have a ligit project and attract investors - To reach new investors (huge number) having doubt on the ICO investment due to scammers - To follow the market warranty level, Investors will prefer LOLIGO ICOs and it will become the standard - To be able to launch it's ICO following the laws of each country - To be protected against any Blockchain flow or hack - To avoid network load - To get free vote cost ...

The reached caps depend on many parameters: market, buzz, news ...

Several projects have raised their funds during many parts like eos. on the other hand, some projects having raised their softcap have disappeared  As long as the utility of the token is current, the fundraiser can continue.

This hasn’t stopped with the major institutions and multinationals that have been created, managed and led through large capitalization; it has exceeded this to become the standard for all startups and medium projects, even individual ones.  The need for capitalization made businesses directly dependent on conventional financing: personal resources, banks, capital sales and business angels. The Internet revolution has enabled project sponsors to implement new ways to raise funds, and a new concept has been born: crowdfunding.  Crowdfunding is a process generally organized through a website and promoted through various social networks. It allows entrepreneurs to raise funds for projects by collecting investments directly from individuals. In return, benefits, discounts or contributions to share capital are offered. With banks no longer the only masters of funds and capital, projects are likely to be conducted more freely. In practice, this happens through platforms or trusted third parties such as Kickstarter, which is responsible for collecting the funds and guaranteeing the obligations of the various parties.  With the arrival of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, crowdfunding has taken on a new format: the ICO (Initial Coin Offering). An ICO is a fundraising method that involves the issuance of tokens on a blockchain independently of a trusted third party. In this case the buyer does not hold a stake in the company, but a token that will allow him to use the service once the final product is developed, with the hope that its value will increase due to demand. This collection has several indisputable risks, however; in addition to any technical flaws, the company may be incompetent or fictitious. The project itself is not immune to a future shutdown or bad management.  Loligo is a decentralized launching platform for ICOs that is fair, peer-to-peer and blockchain-based. Blockchain implements smart contracts permitting a phased release of funds collected for the ICO while, at the same time, a collective right of withdrawal. The token is both mineable and environmentally friendly, consuming little energy thanks to dual mining. Miners can sell the tokens on recognized exchanges, and individuals will be able to use them to participate in fundraising, including those affiliated with the ICOSafe program. A range of services is available to facilitate governmental adoption of ICOs. The platform is open source and free.",False
