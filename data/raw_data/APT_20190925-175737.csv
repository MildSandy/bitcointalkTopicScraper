The Pro in ArtPro stands for provenance, referring to the ‘chain of title’. To explain this term for a non-art audience, this is the record of documentation which supports the origins, ownership and authenticity of any piece of artwork. Since the blockchain is an immutable, unchangeable ledger, it lends itself perfectly to store this kind of information, ensuring prospective buyers that the chain and record have not been altered. It is imperative, therefore, that the information which finds its way onto the blockchain ledger is accurate in the first place.  For this to happen, three things must be confirmed: the identity of the seller, the authenticity of the piece, and that the piece in question is the same as the one recorded on the blockchain. So let’s look at how ArtPro can achieve these three things.  https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-artpro-separates-real-art-from-fake-oliver-hams/",False

We also recognise, however, that tokenizing the platform does not automatically make the APT token a good investment.  To make this project as successful as possible, we knew we had to create a token that captures the value created by our product. From the very start, we recognised the importance of developing a strong token economic model to ensure that a) the APT token captures as much of the value created by the platform as possible and b) our incentives as a team are aligned with those of investors.  In this post, we’ll take you through our rationale behind the various token model design choices we made. We’ll start by providing a short introduction to token economics before outlining the model we’ve selected for the APT token. We appreciate there’s a lot to take in here, but if you get lost along the way, jump to the conclusion for a tl;dr on the APT token.  https://medium.com/artproplatform/artpros-token-model-how-we-maximize-value-for-token-holders-863d38ed1d85",False

Welcome to ArtPro, a platform that promises to be many things for many people. Upon its launch, ArtPro will variously be:  ● A go-to marketplace for private dealers and contemporary artists  ● A system to connect artists and buyers that eliminates intermediaries  ● A modern system for valuing, authenticating, and acquiring art  ● A solution to the provenance problem that combines blockchain technology with the wisdom of real-world experts  ● A means for newcomers to invest in collectible art with minimal entry requirements  ● The platform that drags the old-fashioned art world into the 21st century  There’s more — lots more — but that’s enough to be going on with. In the run-up to our token sale, we’ll be delving into each element of the project in detail and explaining the reasoning behind each component.  Essentially, ArtPro aims to become the go-to marketplace for buying and selling art. Whether that’s to hang in your front room or to keep in a secure vault is your prerogative. If it’s the latter, we’ll provide you with the tools to do so, including a turnkey service through one of our fully insured custodial partners. If it’s the former, ditto: we’ll make the process as seamless as possible, including tools such as augmented reality (AR) to help you visualize artworks before you buy them, so you can find the perfect piece for your home.  And, underpinning it all, will be a dual token model that utilizes the attributes for which blockchain technology is renowned: ERC721 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to represent and track every artwork listed on the ArtPro platform, and as the ArtPro Token APT, an ERC20 token that serves as the native currency and incentivization mechanism within the ArtPro ecosystem, which includes a desktop platform, mobile dApp, and eventually various third party integrations.  https://medium.com/artproplatform/an-introduction-to-artpro-the-art-of-blockchain-8999ed832bb8",False
