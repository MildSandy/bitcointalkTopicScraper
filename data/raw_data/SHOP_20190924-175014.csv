Every time a shopper pays with SHOP Tokens in an online transaction, they grant a brand some level of access to their personal data and are rewarded by the brand accordingly with discounts or other rewards perks. In this way, SHOP functions as a sort of loyalty/rewards points system for brands focused on empowering shoppers to monetize their personal data.",False

SHOP has aimed to create a token sale that promotes fairness, equitability, and transparency in a field crowded with misleading and fraudulent activity. From the onset, our core goal has been to create value and utility for SHOP Co-Op members, and we initially created a token sale structure we thought best reflected this. As SHOP continues to grow as a company, we have studied the token sales of notable peers to better understand the prevailing sentiments behind equitable releases with appropriate levels of governance.  Through this, we have noted several key desires from SAFT investors and ecosystem participants, including:  Clarity into initial token prices in terms of fiat and cryptocurrencies Incentives for early adoption Price levels encouraging token sale SAFT investments while empowering ecosystem participation Clear insight into post-sale use of SAFT investment funds and token sale proceeds    After review, we have concluded that our original token sale structure insufficiently matched the desires of SHOP and those of SAFT investors and ecosystem participants. To maintain our core tenets and better align with the current ecosystem, the reverse dutch auction originally scheduled for the SHOP Token Public Sale is no longer the best vehicle with which to operate.  We are transitioning from an auction-style sale of the tokens into a more conventional pricing approach involving a hard cap. We are releasing the SHOP Token equal to $0.50, setting the hard cap of the private and public sale to $50 million USD. The differences between the old and new format are illustrated below.    We believe that by adopting this format, we can best support market desires, while maintaining our core values for a fair, equitable, and transparent token sale. In this new model, Token sale participants will have clearer insight into the value of their purchase; SAFT investors will be able to actively engage without eroding ecosystem participation; and SHOP will be able to reflect use of funds to dollar amounts for all parties. We believe that this transition is to the benefit of SHOP, SAFT investors, and ecosystem participants. As we prepare to launch with direct utility for our token, this adjustment will further facilitate growth and stability in the weeks, months, and years to come.  —  John Wantz, CEO | SHOP  Please let us know what you think on our telegram: https://t.me/shoppersshop",False

One of the differences, however, is that some key information is maintained securely on the blockchain. To start, this allows users to share certain private data with brands/advertisers in exchange for incentives like shopping discounts and cryptocurrency. This improves the irresponsible privacy model of other marketplaces, while creating value for shoppers and brands alike in a fair and transparent way. The use of a blockchain also allows other key supply chain data to be securely held while remaining accessible to involved parties. This ability to host a common source for shared data breaks down the barrier that can cause information imbalance in a business relationship. Having information be secure, immutable, yet open to all privileged parties, can reduce supply chain overhead costs and create efficiencies that were previously impossible. These efficiencies turn into profits for brands, and competitive prices for shoppers.",False

You're exactly right though! We are releasing a decentralized protocol that allows mainstream brands to organize their entire supply chain, from production to shipping and shopping, in a decentralized way so that there is more freedom for brands and shoppers alike to transact openly and fairly. Brands get access to customer data directly, without needing to pay ad and data networks to broker it and charge for it, and for the first time shoppers get paid directly for sharing that information if they decide to. By cutting out middlemen at every level of the supply chain, brands and shoppers alike benefit. And the entire network is a co-op, so brands and shoppers own the network itself!  You can get a sneak peak to one of the very first marketplace DApps running on the SHOP Protocol by checking out Kanga: https://www.kangashop.com/.

Almost half of our tokens are being allocated strictly for incentivizing 1) brands to join our platform and 2) consumers to use the platform. Because SHOP functions as a legal cooperative, all users, whether they are businesses or consumers, own the platform, decide how the platform should function, and benefit from its success.  We already have a number of partnerships with well known businesses to begin using our platform, and we are very excited to announce them in the coming days and weeks.

First, users get paid if they choose to share their personal data, because we believe that it is completely irresponsible to use technology just to increase corporate profits and not develop the digital sovereignty of users.  Further important differences are that SHOP already has a large codebase, owns key technology patents, and has already made a number of key corporate and IP acquisitions to extend and build upon the SHOP Protocol infrastructure. This means we are not building from scratch, but instead are in a position to take functioning ecommerce solutions and upgrade them to the decentralized Web 3.0. We have an impressive head start in the industry.  We will also have a number of brands active on the marketplace from the very first day the platform goes live in the next few months. Our team has a spectacular and unique track record of working with large brands and businesses, and this extremely diverse network of relationships with traditional brands, as well as the many decade long set of experiences working with multi-billion dollar companies means SHOP is completely without competition in the space in critical ways. We already have extensive, functioning, open sourced code (see our GitHub: http://www.github.com/shoppersshop, and our API documentation: https://developers.shoppers.shop/) , and very soon we will be launching the SHOP Protocol so that anyone, whether an independent shopper or a billion dollar brand, can quickly get up and running and benefit from a decentralized retail platform. Few blockchain projects can claim this, though our entire team is incredibly inspired by all of the innovative visions in the distributed technology space.  We also have an incredible plan to utilize almost half of our entire token supply to incentivize developers, brands, and shoppers to build on and make use of the SHOP Protocol. This plan was formed with the intention of making SHOP not only the first decentralized, mainstream eCommerce platform, but making it extremely easy and exciting to participate in the development and use of. Having worked with well known, successful, international companies means our entire team knows what an effective platform looks like, and exactly how to get people engaged and eager to participate in it.  SHOP is also structured as a legal cooperative, so unlike many projects where the only way to be a part of the economic and governance model is to own tokens or be an employee, every single user of the SHOP Protocol is a co-owner and shares in the success of the platform. It is a completely open and flat structure where every member, be they a huge retail conglomerate or a single consumer gets an equivalent vote. The only way to have a bigger voice in the discussion is to write code and build on the platform.  In short, the SHOP Protocol is not just a P2P marketplace for people who appreciate their own data security and impressive technology. SHOP is building something everyone, including multi-billion dollar brands, will want to use. We are not aiming at a niche use case, but have the plans in place to be the global open standard for digital commerce. We are building something not just for enthusiasts and cypherpunks, but something that all people will be a part of, and all brands will build on, because it will simply be better than anything else.  Our main competitor is Amazon, and they have already proven they have no respect for user privacy, and at this point their track record is so tarnished there is no way they will ever be able to catch up with us. SHOP will be a marketplace where the user is not just another product in the eyes of the company. With SHOP, every person is an owner of the platform itself, and the relationship of all parties, from shoppers to brands and developers is transparent, open, and balanced. We are building not just a prototype of what the future of ecommerce should be, we are building the fully functioning, mainstream paradigm for the next step in selling, shopping, and transacting.",False

Kanga and FoxCommerce will be the first apps to run on SHOP's Blockchain protocol, giving shoppers across each platform access to the SHOP Token. SHOP is spearheaded by former Target retail innovation lead John Wantz and former Nike, Disney and Radio Shack marketing consultant and co-founder of art publication, Juxtapoz, Jamie OShea.  John Wantz is a serial entrepreneur that recently served in a leadership position within the innovation group at Target. Wantz believes that the future of consumer commerce will be won by protecting the direct relationships of Brands & Shoppers within a decentralized retail structure.  SHOP is the second startup founded & led by Wantz. His previous venture, Comr.se (now part of SHOP) was a pioneer in Social Commerce, powering patented transactable commerce experiences on Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest, enabling brands to connect directly with shoppers across the discovery funnel.  Jamie OShea began his professional life as a co-founder of influential countercultural art publication Juxtapoz before moving into the world of marketing to help brands better connect with youth culture, including Nike, Lance Armstrong’s Livestrong foundation, Coca-Cola, Levi’s, Radio Shack, and Johnson & Johnson. In 2010, OShea teamed up with Wantz to launch a digital agency that developed technology platforms and marketing initiatives for clients like Experian and Disney before the pair set aside the agency world to better serve brands through the development of new retail-centric tech platforms Comrse & SHOP.  SHOP CEO John Wantz says, “We’re laser-focused on shopping and powering experiences that enhance the direct relationships between brands and shoppers. SHOP is establishing a decentralized retail ecosystem where brands and shoppers have the power to dictate how value will be exchanged amongst themselves based on shopper-controlled access to their own personal data and appropriate rewards given by brands in return.”  Shoppers receive SHOP tokens from brands in exchange for sharing information such as consumer preferences, style profile, and purchase history. Tokens can then be used in return for discounts or other incentives. This allows shoppers to control their data and be directly rewarded for brokering it to brands during transactions. SHOP has scheduled a public sale of 100 million SHOP Tokens between May 14, 2018 – June 13, 2018.  SHOP CMO, Jamie OShea explains, “The SHOP token has been designed to support an ‘information marketplace’ that continually increases the amount of personal consumer data being shared between shoppers and brands. This equitable exchange helps brands deliver more meaningful retail experiences to shoppers while returning greater savings to them in the process. For shoppers, this is the first tool that empowers them to own and monetize their personal data, shifting that control out of the hands of third-party retailers like Amazon.”  The SHOP Wallet, which will be used to store/spend tokens and control brand access to shoppers’ personal data on various platforms across the SHOP landscape, is now live and available for use in conjunction with the Kanga platform. Kanga is a millennial-targeted online retail apparel startup, whose focus is on omnichannel and social integrations. FoxCommerce is an API-first retail platform providing scalable, flexible customization tools to market products. FoxCommerce was funded by notable VCs such as RoundCapital and SUSA. Comrse is an omnichannel retail platform that enables brands to move their eCommerce store into external environments like social posts. As part of their service neither Kanga or FoxCommerce accept merchant fees.  “Blockchain technology has the power to greatly improve many industries, and retail is chief among them,” explains FoxCommerce and Modcloth founder Adil Wali. “SHOP is well positioned to be a large part of the meteoric rise of decentralized technology. I'm very excited to work with the talented SHOP team to make retail more frictionless for shoppers and retailers alike.”  ABOUT SHOP SHOP is a decentralized blockchain-enabled retail data marketplace that establishes a tokenized free market commerce landscape. SHOP lessens the grasp of third-party marketplaces by returning control of personal data to shoppers, reconnecting brands with their customers, and encouraging innovation.",False

In San Francisco, circa 1992, the term cypherpunks was coined by a group of digital anarchists led by Eric Hughes, Timothy C. May, and John Gilmore. The term was an amalgamation of the words “cypher” and “cyberpunk,” and a few months after the Cypherpunks mailing list was launched, Eric Hughes published his seminal book, “A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto”.  How is all of this relevant to today’s decentralized world of digital assets, ICO’s and cryptocurrencies? John Wantz, the Co-Founder & CEO of a forthcoming blockchain-based eComm ecosystem and utility token SHOP, remains heavily influenced by the cypherpunk movement, revealing in a recent interview that his company’s principles are firmly rooted in a quote from Eric Hughes’ notorious book:  “Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn’t want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn’t want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.” – Cypherpunk Manifesto  In Wantz’s words, “being a Cypherpunk means being an enlightened individual who understands that privacy and control are the core tenets of living a freedom-based lifestyle, which is something I’m afraid we’re losing sight of rapidly today.” He went on to share concerns about how we’ve allowed major data centralizers, such as Amazon, Walmart, Facebook and Google, to collect our data—and by extension, us, “to an extent that would have been considered criminal only a generation ago.”  So what is SHOP all about, and how are they committed to implementing their core principles of decentralization and fairness in an industry that is sorely lacking both?  “SHOP, in contrast,” explains Wantz, “is a consortium of Brands and Shoppers formed with a goal of decentralizing the control of consumer data by reinstating default privacy and control of data and the principles of pseudonymous reputation systems.”   SHOP is an entirely new retail operating system for apps and storefronts alike, built atop the Ethereum Blockchain, which will ensure that the permissioning and data storage is always committed to decentralization. Their native SHOP Token will enable fair and transparent value exchange between parties, which in turn will give Shoppers complete control over their data and how it’s shared. As Wantz went on to say, “this way, Shoppers always have control over something Brands want and need, and Brands are always incentivized to reward Shoppers in the form of savings and rewards to access it.”  In addition, the SHOP ecosystem will be rooted in a democratic co-op model, giving every Shopper a direct say in the future of the platform. When asked why SHOP chose this model, Wantz explained that a co-op, “was the most logical organizational model for us because it reinforces our principles around creating a decentralized retail structure that’s truly owned and controlled by Brands and Shoppers.”  SHOP is kickstarting their ecosystem with a millennial-focused online apparel store named KangaShop.com. The SHOP token is being used as the closed-loop currency within the ecosystem, and any brand that desires to extract a Shopper’s data will be able to provide them with SHOP tokens as a reward for doing so. Wantz had this to say in regards to launching with this particular store: “KangaShop serves as a utopian example of how a retail environment can operate fairly and equitably within our ecosystem. There’s no fees for Brands that sell through Kanga, and Shoppers retain all of their data.”  All things considered, where does Wantz see the SHOP co-op in 10 years time? “Staging a hostile takeover of Amazon.” He went on to explain that they don’t plan on launching direct attacks against Amazon’s existing stronghold over brands, as that would be an expensive and grueling process. “Rather, we want to create a new system of supply and demand within infinite other consumer touchpoints where Brands & Shoppers can move freely without being leveraged and centralized.”  For more information visit www.shoppers.shop and connect with SHOP on Telegram: t.me/shoppersshop",False

In conjunction with discovery environments like Google and Facebook, these firms have built retail empires around hoarding consumer data and blocking its exchange within the Brand/Shopper relationship. SHOP is a decentralized blockchain-enabled retail data marketplace that establishes a truly democratized free market commerce landscape focused on reconnecting Brands & Shoppers through transparent new tokenized value exchanges.  The SHOP Protocol is a brand/shopper consortium that operates as a member-led democracy with a mission to decentralize the shopping experience onto Ethereum's blockchain. SHOP threatens the grasp of third party marketplaces by giving shoppers control of their data, re-connecting brands with their customers, and encouraging innovation.     The SHOP Protocol supports equitable value exchanges across the Retail, Grocery, and Services landscape. At initial launch, the CO-OP is focusing on direct-to-consumer Retail as it holds the greatest opportunity for disruption, with specific attention to digital commerce, a market set to be worth $16 billion by 2020. The SHOP Protocol enables users to control who sees their data and how much of it is shared. The more users share, the greater the savings. Brands get direct access to information about their customers and increased profits from transactions.    CURRENT INTEGRATIONS SHOP has already open-sourced numerous APIs to connect existing platforms (Shopify, Stripe, UPS, and more) to the Ethereum blockchain, and provides a new framework for shopping & selling digitally with tokenized value exchanges across decentralized networks. The SHOP protocol is open, transparent, and bridges the gap between the current system of eCommerce and the P2P future.    ROADMAP      TEAM LEADERSHIP   John Wantz, CEO A serial retail technology entrepreneur and former Target Innovation group team leader, John Wantz is focused on the development and implementation of decentralized, blockchain-based retail solutions that facilitate tokenized, trustless new value exchanges.   Jeff Mataya, CTO Having worked at the intersection of eCommerce and enterprise SaaS as Co-Founder and CTO at FoxCommerce, Jeff is an experienced and visionary technologist, product leader, & entrepreneur who leads technical execution of the SHOP Protocol.  Jonathan Gagliardoni, CPO A  proven retail and eCommerce tech innovator/educator with a history of leading product development & management for software and physical goods in early stage and enterprise retail companies, Jonathan Gagliardoni facilitates product strategy around the execution of tokenized value exchanges between Brands and Shoppers.

As you probably understand at this point, our mission is to decentralize retail information to be used more efficiently and effectively by Brands and Shoppers.  We know this is an idea with far-reaching ramifications. Our drive has been fueled by the number of incredible partners and team and community members who have joined the cause. Our growing leadership team and advisors have a depth and breadth of experience we could have only hoped for when we started a year ago. We’ve accepted invitations to present at ShopTalk (the largest retail convention in the world) and SXSW (the launching pad of companies like Twitter and Foursquare) in March.  Thank you all for joining us as we plan and execute against the potential market impact, growing constituent base, and the scale of execution that is ahead of us. As the team and community expand, we’re rearchitecting our timeline to apply the skill and experience coming around the table to our considerable development efforts. In accommodation, we have moved the public launch of the SHOP Protocol and the public sale of SHOP Tokens to May 14, 2018.  We’re already on our way to Day One utility and network usefulness, and through significant independent protocol development are creating an original platform with long-term value. The SHOP team is working to reshape and redefine at-scale retail, and launch the Co-Op of Brands & Shoppers. This is a long-term vision, and to scale the value of the network we need to start with a powerful foundation. To build and maintain this groundwork we’re announcing the launch of the SHOP Token Public Pre-Sale, live now through April 29.  The engagement we’ve received from blockchain users and developers, as well as retail and legal leadership, has been happening at a rate we find encouraging. We’re very excited to begin expanding the scope of our partnerships through our public fundraising with partners who qualify as accredited investors.  Here:(http://www.shoppers.shop/) is more information on SHOP and our active public pre-sale open to accredited US investors and all other international investors (excluding residents of OFAC countries).
