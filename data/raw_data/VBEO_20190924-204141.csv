You are totally wrong and I actually feel your post is offending to all my team who are working very hard on this project. We are indeed 15 people and the team will grow to 22 in the coming weeks. Let me answer your points:  -I invite you to contact each member of the team through LinkedIn to verify if they are working on Vibeo. -Most of the team are from Bulgaria, except me, I am from Canada with grand parents from Bulgaria so I know this country very well. I ll be soon leaving Canada to take care of my team full time, our CCO Mira is also from bulgaria but she is actually living in USA. All my advisors are from different country except Kalin which is also from Bulgaria. I invite you to check my twitter feed, and you will see I am travelling a lot, even to personally meet with my advisors (actually very few people does that in the ICO field!). -I don't have any dev from Russia, you are talking about Mikhail, he is not a dev but our sys admin, taking care of the entire infrastructure, I know him for many years and this is someone I trust, he is 100% part of Vibeo team. -We have indeed 2 offices, one is the main office and one is the development office, we partnered with LimeChain in Sofia. Some people are working remotely but all from Bulgaria. We will have everybody in the same office after the ICO. -I haven't registered my domain on the website you've mentionned, we own different domain for vibeo including vibeo.net, vibeo.ca and vibeo.com (highly valuable domain) but only vibeo.io is active and linked to vibeo app project. -Rest assure that if you want to invest in vibeo you are investing in a good ico, we already have a minimal version of vibeo app available on AppStore and Google Play, we will soon announce our first partnership, our team is fantastic, so do your own due diligence Max but I ll ask you to stop spreading false information about my company otherwise I ll contact the moderator.

Thanks for sharing it! Actually they did a very good job, pretty much accurate, however on the weakness I'd like to clarify few points:  -There is no detailed financial plan: Well there is a summary on the whitepaper (page 17), it also depends on the money we will be able to raise. It won't be the same financial plan if we only reach softcap and if we go all the way to the hardcap. We will adjust the financial report after the ICO and make it public. -The project is not popular on social networks: This is true, we are working on it actually, we were too much focus on releasing our MVP before the ICO launch. -The project is not widely discussed on blockchain news resources: This is true, we are also working on it. -The project founders do not have experience implementing a successful business in the project field: Well I disagree, I have managed an incubator and helped many startups and young entrepreneurs, I have successfully released different SaaS platforms. We have some of the best tech in this industry in our team, Ben our iOS developer is one of the best chat/im expert. Blockchain is a new technology so nobody can claimed to be an expert, but we have certainly some of the best developers out there with LimeChain team as partners. We also have Kalin and Amarpreet Singh as Advisors, I would highly recommand to check Amar's LinkedIn profile for more information.  Overhaul a very nice report, lot of work and deep analysis has been done. Awesome job! thanks to DigRate!   Eric-Sebastien",False

The app incorporates a geo-localised map feature where you can discover a fully decentralised economy; each vibeo member will have its very own ERC-20 wallet; which will allow to find merchants and other Vibeo users in your locality and offer the possibility to engage with them.  This motivates users and merchants alike to exchange currency, exchange ideas and even render services within the platform thus helping the movement for decentralisation grow more.  The Vibeo API allows potential partners or merchants to easily get their services listed/added on the vibeo interactive map.  The protocol also incorporates key security features, not only within the app's technology, but also in its application, to ensure that users can be safe both within the app and in real life.  There are infinite possibilities in the use of the Vibeo app for both merchants, and users. In exploiting the unique features that the application offers, users can build a decentralised community with unlimited social and economic benefits.   I hope that answers your question.
