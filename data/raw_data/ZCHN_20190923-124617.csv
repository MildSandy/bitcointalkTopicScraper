Traditionally I come with a strong enterprise apps background where 15 to 20 yrs back the team responsible for development of a product has nothing to do with the operations. I have seen this leading to a mentality of not caring much about the performance of the product or it’s operational cost even among people making high level strategic decisions. As SAAS became mainstream, the companies responsible for building the products also are responsible for hosting them and that required careful planning of the product from an operational perspective as well. As IT moved not just standard applications like HR and CRM but also their internal applications to the cloud, it became imperative that those who are responsible for developing those products are also responsible for hosting and operating them. At minimum, the developers need to fully understand the kind of tech stack they are dealing with which is largely based on several well integrated micro-services. https://medium.com/0chain/0chain-devops-234963df63a1",False

But say you have 20 miners on average per chain, then you can have 50 chains to reach 1000.  Depends on how the governance protocol is structured but we intend to ask 50% of existing top miners to commit to a new chain for a certain period before they get replaced by other miners.  However each chain needs to have a good reason to exist and would need stakeholder approval.  Regarding fork, I mean there is a self-forking protocol to fork a new chain that is approved by stakeholders.  Different applications or verticals have different needs.  Banks that do credit card and micropayment may want super-fast finality. High value transactions can be slower and may want a stricter consensus.  Analytics or AI applications may want higher block time in minutes so that it enables computations to be completed.  IoT applications want superfast finality because that data is then fed to the next code that creates a notification or averaging or AI response.",False

In the creation phase, stakeholders need to debate those issues and vote.  But in the event a chain gets less transaction or blocks created, the miners/sharders won't be affected because they get a token payout regardless, and their infrastructure is a sunk cost.  So if they want more traffic/blocks created, they would need to lower their prices, and the economics would be similar to the infrastructure upgrade cycle process in any cloud infra today.  If you're talking about consensus getting weaker, that will not happen because its decoupled from traffic/storage, and is based on the consensus parameter for that particular chain.  Additionally if miners are involved in other chains, their combined reputation would be affected by anything they do malicious in the weaker chain, such as collude to pass a bad transaction.",False

Today majority of DApps have almost all their code execution and data storage on a centralized cloud such as AWS. 0chain aims to fill this void and provide a free scalable cloud for DApps to become completely decentralized. DApps can move their off-chain smart contract and data on to our platform, and provide their customers with assured decentralized service, but conserve capital and focus their spend on developing their business.  The Technology  Our blockchain is designed to execute a smart contract in sub-second deterministic time, so that one piece of smart contract does not have to wait minutes or an hour for the result of the next one. Our speed is the result of an efficient consensus set made up of 3 primary miners, 6 secondary miners, and 6 bench miners to make sure we have an honest consensus that needs at least 5/9 honest miners, and allow for network disruption, malicious attacks, data withholding, and data manipulation.  And because we have parallel chains, concurrent threads, and an efficient consensus, we can theoretically have infinite transactions .  We also have a notion of self-forking for an evolution toward chains tweaked for specific verticals, applications, or geo location, because we understand that the parameters of one chain cannot satisfy every vertical or application.  In fact, one parameter that is bound to change is the block time, which stipulates finality in a sub-second or minutes depending on the application. Buying coffee, receiving a token for a post, and other micro-payments can be transacted on a sub-second chain, while analytics, image processing for IoT, AI apps may need to be on a separate 2-minute chain. The self-forking aspect allows for new chains to evolve decoupled from the network token value.  Another reason to self-fork could be the consensus parameter of 5/9 which is fine for IoT applications, but a banking institution may need a 8/9 quorum for higher security.  Token Economy  To provide a free scalable cloud, we need to control the inflation rate of tokens to the miners. To achieve this we have a cost-efficient consensus, computing, and storage schemes. We divide the infrastructure scheme up into CPU, RAM, and SSD component needs and designate different duties to miners, sharders, and blobbers. Miners generate and validate blocks. Sharders store blocks. Blobbers store data.  Additionally, we split our genesis chain into smart contract and data chains at the onset. This will allow Miners and Sharders to use different equipment for a data chain and smart contract chain, and charge different prices to the network. The smart contract chain is stateful and so will need higher RAM servers. The miners, sharders, blobbers will need to offer pricing comparable to a traditional cloud at their own fiat currency, and 0chain will adjust token payout based on a daily exchange rate.  Apart from having a fair miner price, we need the DApps to hold tokens based on an expected computational and storage need that they would pay a traditional cloud annually, except that they just need to hold it like a bank. There are no fees. And if the DApp happens to hold enough tokens initially, and the token value increases, then they have a free scalable cloud for years to come without buying any additional tokens. This holding rate is adjusted on a regular basis to control the inflation rate, and these adjustments are done such that the reward pool lasts at least 100 years.

But you can fork a different chain with more miners.  The consensus is set at 5/9 but is configurable and can be 8/9 for a bank-grade chain.  Point is you need to balance the mining cost with practical usage.  Our initial chain would be better than anything that DApps use today (AWS, state channels, etc.) in terms of security and cost.",False
