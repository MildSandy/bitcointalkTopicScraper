Here are a couple of points  1) We are focused on meaningful use of the data. More specifically, lowering the prevalence of the top 5 chronic diseases that burden healthcare. Others are more focused on recreating the systems, which will in turn create a similar problem around data portability. 2) We are not looking to disrupt healthcare, we want to integrate and enhance how the data is used. If we can change the foundation and not change the interface to the system, we believe we have a higher probability of success. Companies spent billions of dollars to convert to digital systems, they won‚Äôt be willing to change the entire system again for another 10 years. 3) We are leveraging IoT and patient portal integration to verify that progress has been made towards a goal, not simply using the honor system or just the activity performed. By focusing on the consumer, we can offer value in parallel to other systems which can lead to a foundation change, not a complete swap. 4) We have one of the best Advisor teams when it comes to variety of experience across healthcare. Among them is Abhishek Punia who is a crypto analyst with Draper Associates. This is invaluable and very unique 5) We are located in Boston, MA which is the central hub for all things healthcare in the US.

Helix3 is the first platform plan with a vision that puts the patient first. Most other companies are focused on how they can get free access to your data for their profit.

We will be the first to integrate patient portal, activity, and IoMT data into a data exchange and rewards platform, which we believe will spark a tremendous amount of innovation in precision preventative medicine and healthcare in general.  We are located in Boston, MA with strong connections into many facets of healthcare. Boston is a hub for healthcare innovation and practice in the US.  One of our founders is American, with many experiences in the US system and selling to healthcare. The other is an internet trailblazer from Canada, who experience a very different approach to healthcare. which has a very different approach to healthcare. We believe this gives us a unique combined perspective on how to solve healthcare challenges.  Lastly, we have one of the best teams available. Everyone believes in what is possible and is working towards a common goal. There are too many to list here, but you can see them on our website (http://helix3.co).

Why? this leads to the 2nd point - The team seems very solid to me, experienced people with lot of backgrounds and connections. Advisors look good too - Bonus during sales: corrects (not too much that would devaluate token price later on) - Supply: total of 888M for 0.08$ expected, that would represents a reachable goal - Tokens will be used to reward people reaching their goals, to make transactions easier (through the system) and also insurance's / programme incentives.  I have only personnal issue: the power of insurances on our datas. The team answered me on telegram (very good support guys) and told me people could decide which datas would be shared. Also developping (i quote) ""a claims module that will proxy the information ensuring the insurance company doesn‚Äôt even need to see the data... just the result that a valid procedure was executed for a verified member with coverage""  For all these reasons, i have a very good feeling about this project and i will keep an eye on it.

Helix3 is a next-gen healthcare platform that rewards members for consolidating data and achieving health and wellness goals. We bring meaningful use to the members data through various modules designed to improve patient value, security and access control. By bringing together secure and connected data, a goal achievement system, and a marketplace for healthcare products and services, we are creating the foundation of a new and improved healthcare ecosystem.  Our secure platform, built on blockchain technology, ensures data breaches are a thing of the past by using advanced encryption, cryptography, and de-identifying techniques. This enables the consolidation of health data (patient partials, fit devices, medical devices) that will be leveraged for support AI, deep learning, and other innovations. It also shrinks the scope of an attack to a single record, significantly lowering the target value.  The  goal achievement system is powered by FitFlows, which have a defined goal, activities to achieve the goal, and different milestones to measure goal progress. The achievement of each milestone is rewarded with tokens that can be spent in the the Helix3 healthcare marketplace, or at the healthcare provider much like a loyalty rewards program.  Members can get support building their FitFlows from healthcare providers that can help support the successful achievement of the goals by defining activities, milestones, and funding rewards. Members can view FitFlow provider ratings, reviews, and an automatically calculated goal achievement rating, and eventually be guided to better health through personal recommendations and FitFlows.  In the Helix app, users can use their health and activity data to earn rewards from goal sponsors and FitFlow providers. Rewards are provided in Helix Tokens (HLX) and can be spent on health related products and services in our marketplace.     At the center of the platform is the ever growing Helix Twin. The Helix Twin consolidates health information including EMR data, activity records and 3rd party verified measurement into a single pane of glass that is used to create optimal FitFlows, personalized for our members. Helix Twin organizes and automatically updates its record through our integration framework. This enables seamless interoperability between all parties interested in lowering the risk and cost of poor health.  Our mission is to bring the healthcare industry together in a meaningful way, creating more patient value across the healthcare ecosystem which provides better care to billions of people around the world. By improving overall health and bringing automation and improved controls to health management,  Helix3 aims to reduce the trillions of dollars in healthcare waste globally and improve quality of life.",False
