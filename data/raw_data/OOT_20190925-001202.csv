What if you had a “playbook” of all the most trusted, legitimate, and carefully reviewed upcoming opportunities… whether ICO, funds, already circulating currencies, etc.?  And what if the source of this information was a transparent, highly-trusted community of members with supporting Artificial Intelligence?  This is what are we building at Utrum  It’s About Trust  As lucrative and outlandishly profitable as cryptocurrency investing and trading can be, it is arguably the highest risk investment due to a gap between our centralized culture and the nature of decentralization.  When investors who are used to trusting a centralized, regulated system are presented with decentralized and sometimes secret projects or investment opportunities, it can be all too easy to apply the same approach to trust. Often this leads to being fooled by slick websites, clever code, and skilled sales pitches.  Many well-meaning investors have lost entire life savings due to this gap in understanding and the lack of a reliable and trusted source of analytics, reviews, and verification of potential investments.  Our goal at Utrum is to bridge this gap, using some of the most potent decentralized tools available.  Read more  https://cryptocoremedia.com/pr10455/",False

This is beyond childish. You posted a negative review, which literally anyone can do without it being true whatsoever. 2. You then screenshotted your own review and use it as an argument, I don't even want to start on this. 3. I have absolutely no connection to Ambisafe whatsoever. 4. To date my team has distributed over $15.000.000 in Bounties, what have you done? 5. I have paid participants from my own pocket countless times when ICOs refused to do so. You got it mate. I'm paying people myself because I'm a scam. Too bad there's no clap emoticon on btctalk. 6. I had run Worldcore Bounty more than 3 months ago and did it so at the request of the team. Everyone was paid. And besides, they only worked with Ambisafe for a short amount of time, until they fired them to work with us(just in case you don't see the flaw in your logic here)   Now, leaving all of those things aside, you tried to pull this thing again a few months ago when you gave me a review from one of your other accounts ""IconFirm"" - to which I responded and it is why that account is now red-trusted.  So then you went and created a new account and gave over 200 bad reviews to random people for bogus reasons.  Now you come and accuse me with over 36+ green trust of another bogus invented thing. You are ludicrous mate. Also, since we're making photos anyway.   First, the red trust ratings you have on this account:   Second, the red trust ratings you have on the old account:   Now, besides the fact that you literally positive trusted your own accounts and it is so obvious that even a toddler could realize it.  Let's look at my trust ratings. Let's completely drop the fact that I have a +36 green trust rating and you have -2 red rating on most accounts  In all my history I have received 3 bad reviews. 2 of them are from your accounts(Iconfirm and this) and the third one is from a newbie with literally 0 posts on the forum, received more than 6 months ago.  However, there's quite some people who offered a positive feedback. With risked money and references. From trusted users of the forum. Several times.

We are utrum.io team. Please let us know if you have any questions.  What is DICO?  DICO - Decentralized ICO is the first of it's kind tokensale offered by Komodo Platform  Komodo dICO is a Hack-Proof ICO process. In a dICO, the sale is performed within the AtomicDex exchange app using electrum servers. The sale process is completely decentralized without any point of failure. Every contribution is performed “wallet-to-wallet”. Vulnerabilities such as a Smart Contract being hacked; an attacker changing the Contract address on a website; and other attacks Ethereum ICOs have suffered, are eliminated. This is because everything happens on the blockchain using Atomic Swaps. When an individual invests in the dICO, the transaction occurs between the utrum (ticker OOT) Blockchain and the Blockchain they are buying from (e.g. BTC, KMD, BCH, etc) and is performed direct from the buyers wallet.  https://komodoplatform.com/faqs/#faq/what-is-a-decentralized-ico-a-k-a-dico-arent-all-ico-platforms-decentralized  Telegram - https://t.me/utrumdotio  Twitter - https://twitter.com/utrumdotio  Blog- https://medium.com/utrum  Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/utrumdotio/  Utrum Slack - http://slackinvite.utrum.io/  Komodo Slack - Channel #utrum https://komodoplatform.com/",False

It was good. Here are our comments about weakness  Weakness - The competitive landscape and the project's competitive advantages are not sufficiently defined  Agree with you, we will address this. Coming to our competition - We would compete with Revain for Reviews, Steemit for Analysis and Cindicator for Predictions.  We have a unique feature ""Crypto Fundamentals"" where we list every Project, Team, financials and related details. Reviews, Analysis and Predictions will be linked to this database.  We have fixed fraudulent practices with our machine learning algo ""Trust Factor""  We have fixed upvote trending posts with blindfold rating  Weakness - There is no detailed financial plan  We do have and listed our plans to sustain utrum platform  The $OOT Utility Token Revenue Model  Utrum is a unique blend of crypto and traditional business models which operates as freemium. It is a revolutionary approach where we share platform revenues with the user community. $OOT is the utility token of Utrum Platform.          The platform will earn premium subscription revenues from institutional investors.        The Platform will earn revenues from Crypto and ICO developers to access premium features.        The Platform marketplace for buying and selling crypto related services will earn 1% transaction fee from buyer and seller.        5% APR reward for token holders will reduce inflation to some extent.        15% of the platform monthly revenues will be burnt to reduce inflation.
