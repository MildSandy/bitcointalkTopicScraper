Is there a specific strategy to increase user interest in your products? Our plan is provide users with products they can actually use and benefit from on a regular basis. These will lead to increased adoption of Gigzi Black users.  Few examples: 1. a multi-currency wallet application secured with iris recognition technology is something many can use even without having to invest in Gigzi crypto-assets. It will support major cryptocurrencies like ETH and BTC. By making the Gigzi Wallet application inter-operable, there will be more chance that users will be drawn to trade Gigzi Black as it has many unique features.  2. Gigzi Metal, stable metal backed crypto-assets can be used to hedge against the volatility risk of any cryptocurrency including Gigzi Black. It allows traders to ride the bull runs then instantly convert to Gigzi Metal for the protection of those profits. Creating a safe-haven for user funds whilst still in the crypto space. One of the benefits for trading on Gigzi Black is that users earn Gold Rewards!  3. Making precious metals accessible for all users worldwide. Anyone can now anonymously own precious metals and have them secure using their iris. Another unique feature is the next of kin, which allows secondary users iris to be registered on the same account. Giving peace of mind that should the worst happen the stored wealth can still be accessible by a trusted friend or family member.  Everything we are creating is designed for the benefit of the user. If the user finds our solution safe, convenient and efficient to manage their wealth and be rewarded while doing it, then we have done our part  Quote from: Dorbaraco on October 11, 2018, 01:45:32 PM I'm Interested in your products. Now I want to understand the use of the gold card in the private Gigzi network. What will be available to me on your network? A debit card that can be loaded directly from the wallet. It is not a Visa or Mastercard. Loading and spending is being done with Gigzi Gold. No conversions, no high fees, no transfers. Just load the card and tap to make payments as you usually would  Quote from: Chatelleyma on October 11, 2018, 01:52:02 PM 60% of all transaction fees are paid to Gigzi Gold users.
