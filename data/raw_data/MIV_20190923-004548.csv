We have tested it out. If You have this issue, it's because at the moment our Blockchain is ""stopped"", no one is mining.  By the way IF you have some Active connections, you won't have any problems when we will send MIV to you for bounties and Crowdfunding.  If you don't have active connections try do add these nodes:  146.185.145.221 188.226.133.21 128.199.55.91  Let me know if you have any questions or Problem:  PM us or write on Telegram/Slack [/quote",False
