[ANN] en Français  The Translation Bounty post  Organisator and Influencers Bounty Post   _______________________________________________________________________________ _  ENZYM? What is it? _______________________________________________________________________________ _  Enzym is a gamified and local social network based on the blockchain technology and favoring real-life interactions. The purpose of Enzym is to inject simplicity, ease and casualness back into our nights out.   _______________________________________________________________________________ _  Why would I use it? _______________________________________________________________________________ _   Real-life interactions are bugged. Enzym is a fix. It is designed to take people where they are talking there language and bring them back to the real-life teaching them how it works. Most young people are now used to or even addicted to instantness and gaming.   We believe that face-to-face human interactions are valuable and irreplaceable. We believe that real and virtual interactions should complement rather than compete with each other. We note that real-life interactions have become tricky and we remark that virtual spaces could be used to make reality attractive and get people back to it. Our purpose is to make it easy again for people who don’t know each other to have friendly spontaneous exchanges.  In order to execute this mission we will build a venue-based social network which will facilitate get-togethers and foster local instantaneous meetings with new people.   The obligation of physical presence and the reputation system will protect users from scams and bad behaviors. The application will firmly secure the users' data to ensure the respect of their privacy and the confidentiality of their interactions. The platform as a whole will evolve towards maximal decentralization and transparency thanks to technologies such as the Ethereum blockchain.   This application will be a game, and as such it will harness the full power of gamification with accomplishments, rewards, creativity incentives, constraints and a scoring system, to cultivate social boldness and make physical spaces more appealing. The user will use all the application’s features without spending a dime. He will, however, need to spend ZYMs – ERC20 tokens – which he’ll acquire through local interactions ruled by smart contracts.  _______________________________________________________________________________ _  What for the future? _______________________________________________________________________________ _    _______________________________________________________________________________ _  The Trailers (you need to turn the subtitles on) _______________________________________________________________________________ _      _______________________________________________________________________________ _  The Token? _______________________________________________________________________________ _  ZYM tokens will be required for the use of the Enzym application. Any interaction with strangers will cost some ZYMs to at least one of the participants and others may be rewarded. Venue owners will be able to buy ZYMs easily from their accounts on our dedicated website. They will also be able to fine-tune how and when these tokens are distributed to their customers.  As part of its business model the Enzym platform will charge a 2% transaction fee to every ZYM transaction.    _______________________________________________________________________________ _  To play and to be safe _______________________________________________________________________________ _  As an exemple here is how the “treasure hunt” challenge works. A user asks or is offered to participate in a treasure hunt. Another user nearby is contacted and offered to be the treasure in question. If he or she accepts, the hunter then receives a picture of him or her, or some informations, and the name of the place he or she is at. The hunter then has to go to said place, find the treasure and prove he found it with NFC or by scanning a QR code on the treasure's smartphone. Tokens and loots are won by all and a friendly encounter just happened. They may as well have a drink and a chat while they're here.      But your safety is always guaranteed by :  The use of a strong cryptography : It will ensure the safety of users data and the confidentiality of their exchanges. Chat messages will be readable only by their recipient. Quantum-proof encryption algorithms, which are still in development, will be used as soon as a reliable standard emerges Anonymous metadata : The Enzym team will only be able to access anonymous metadata, most of which will be public. Transparancy : Each user will have complete control over his personal data. He will choose what he shares publicly at any moment  _______________________________________________________________________________ _  Token Allocation _______________________________________________________________________________ _                                  _______________________________________________________________________________ _  The Team _______________________________________________________________________________ _                                          _______________________________________________________________________________ _  The advisors _______________________________________________________________________________ _        _______________________________________________________________________________ _  ICO Information _______________________________________________________________________________ _  Under reconstruction   ---------------------------------------------------------------------                    ",False

Like when you need to do a raid in Pokemon Go except that for Enzym, this is the main puprose : making people going out and meet in safe places. They'll also know if the other is trustable and so they'll be able to avoid scams, fake profiles, bad behavior, etc.  I hope I answered correctly to your question =)",False

I hope (and I'm quite sure) people will use it. It is really important right now.  When I walk around, I see people into the bus, the subway, walking, ... with facebook into their hands. Just scrolling !  I think that this App will be perfect to not confuse them : they'll still have their smartphone BUT to meet people.  It is not too late to come back to real socialization ! =)",False
