The first Staking rewards distribution starts on December 31st, 2018 and reoccurs every 90 days until we have 450 million of the total 500 million tokens in circulation.       WHAT IS STAKING AND HOW DOES IT WORK? In the world of crypto, staking refers to the reward you receive for supporting a token by holding the token. There are many ways in which staking can be implemented. With CoinMarketAlert, we’ve decided to tie in staking with the CMA Price Alerts platform.  Staking CMA tokens will not only grant you unlimited access to our premium account features but also enable you to earn staking rewards.  In order to stake your CMA, you’ll need to deposit your token into an ERC20 compliant wallet such as Mist, Metamask, and MyEtherwallet. Note: CMA tokens which are sitting on an exchange will not receive staking rewards.  CMA tokens can be purchased on IDEX, Coinplace, and Token Store with more exchanges coming very soon.    HOW MUCH CAN I EARN FROM STAKING CMA? In order to calculate individual staking rewards, we have implemented a tiered staking system that is meant to encourage users to stake more CMA. The tier determines the rate at which you earn CMA, and are determined by the amount of CMA that you are staking. You will need a minimum of 100 CMA tokens in order to receive staking rewards. CMA Staking rewards will be distributed every 90 days and starting on 31 December 2018, so start acquiring and staking you CMA now.     The chart below outlines CMA staking reward tiers CMA Staking Rewards chart  https://i.imgur.com/EO4zGpS.png      STAKING REWARDS EXAMPLE: A wallet with 9,999 CMA  earns 300 additional CMA tokens yearly A wallet with 499,999 CMA earns 25,000 additional CMA tokens yearly A wallet with 999,999 CMA earns 80,000 additional CMA tokens yearly A wallet with +5,000,000 CMA receives 500,000 additional CMA tokens yearly          COINMARKETALERT UNLIMITED PREMIUM ACCESS    In order to have unlimited access to premium features on CoinMarketAlert, you must have a verified wallet that holds a minimum balance of 600 CMA tokens. In order for us to verify your wallet balance and grant you access to CMA premium features, we will periodically scan your wallet.

We will post updates on additional exchanges shortly. In the meanwhile, you will be able to buy CMA tokens on the token.store exchange from August 1, 2018.

The 50 million is the reserve amount to support for the 95million tokens allotted to the Alerts token distribution pool.  Every user who creates a price alert on CMA, also receives CMA tokens.  As our user base continues to grow, the initial 95 million tokens could be depleted.  Therefore, we set aside another 50Million tokens for this mainly this case.  Also, there is no longer a CMA public sale as we decided to put CMA on the exchange directly after the pre-sale which ends today and allow the open market to buy the tokens instead of focusing on a restricted ICO and focus on delivering additional and better products for our users and customers.  Our pre-sale ends today (so there is still time if you would like to buy at the pre-sale discount) and tomorrow CMA will start trading on the Token.Store exchange.         ",False

Crypto is still a nascent industry that’s highly speculative with little to no regulation. As a result, it’s susceptible to manipulation tactics such as pump & dump schemes, spoofing and wash trading. Moreover, reports have shown that only a tiny fraction of individuals hold the lion share of crypto currencies. For example, the top 4% of Bitcoin owners own more than 95% of the Bitcoin. This further exacerbates the market volatility as a small number of large players can easily move the market. In light of the risks and reward at stake, we believe it’s imperative to have timely reliable objective data in order to increase the odds of being a successful crypto trader and protecting you crypto investments.  What is CoinMarketAlert?:  CoinMarketAlert.com is a cyptocurrency price alert system. It can issue email and push notifications to connected devices on over 1,400 cryptocurrencies dependent on parameters set by users. It comes out of the box with various levels and types of alerts. It can also notify users of changes on the value of their portfolio. Our alert system pulls data from CoinMarketCap’s API, a platform that aggregates coin prices from major crypto exchanges around the world. Launched to the public in Jan 2018, CoinMarketAlert currently helps almost 10,000 customers protect their crypto currency investments. We are currently sending our over 70,000 Alerts per day.  What tools are available to help to protect your crypto investments?: CoinMarketAlert has unique features that allow for call-back/webhook notification on Discord, Telegram messenger or Telegram group alert. CoinMarketAlert provides users with two levels of alerts: The Free Alerts, and the Advanced Alerts.  CoinMarketAlert Free Alerts:    CoinMarketAlert Advanced Alerts (7-Day Free Trial):           CoinMarketAlert Token:  CoinMarketAlert offers a ERC20 utility rewards token called “CMA” which power the CoinMarketAlert platform. The Token is designed to be used by members of the CoinMarketAlert for member subscriptions, and services and to unlock access to smart alerts and dashboards within the Alerts Pool when released. Users will be able to create customized   alerts,  dashboards   and   kpi's and  sell access to their customized alerts to other members and users of CoinMarketAlert in exchange for CMA tokens.  CMA tokens are distributed to users when they create their favorite price alerts on CoinMarketAlert. Users with Premium accounts will receive 0.01 CMA Tokens, while users with Free accounts will receive 0.001 CMA Tokens per price alert created, up to a max of 20 per day for all members.
