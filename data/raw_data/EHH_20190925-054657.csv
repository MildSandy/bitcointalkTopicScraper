People have been engaged in agriculture to feed their animals, to feed snow, to store winter supplies with the first person. The steady decline in the number of people living in villages and agricultural areas has led to a decline in the number of producers of agricultural products. Moreover, according to the results of the scientific research done, the number of farmers dealing with agriculture is decreasing day by day. The most important reason for this is the gradual decrease in farming profitability. Increasing world population requires more food production. The biggest problem here is that it is very cheaply bought by the intermediaries of the products produced by the wheelers, and then converted into fruits and vegetables by the commissioners and from there the markets receive these products to the customers. In this process, while the greatest economic loss is seen by farmers, we are obliged to consume four to five times more expensive food than our normal price as a consumer. More than 60% of the world's food is produced by small farmers. Interestingly, 90% of these foods are carried by independent truckers. It is foreseen that the agricultural sector will reach a $ 2 trillion market by 2019, but unfortunately it is also known that farmers who need to earn real money in this profitable sector receive little from this profitability. As a solution to these problems, the EHarvestHub approach has emerged as a platform to enable small farmers to communicate directly with retailers and to deliver accessible fresh food at affordable prices to consumers. In this approach, By bringing together producers and individual carriers under the roof of the block chain, consumers can reach both fast and inexpensive fresh foodstuffs. The use of the block chain to make this process transparent with smart contracts will make it much more profitable to deal with this sector and agriculture. The goal of EHarvestHub will be to increase profits while helping small farmers and truckers from all over the world participate and join together to make food more accessible and cheaper. In the process, the intermediaries will be removed and consumers will be directly contributed to the small farmers around the world by using the HarvestHub platform and the crypto currency. In short, EHarvestHub, It focuses on solving this problem globally by reducing both profits of small and medium sized producers and independent truckers, removing intermediaries that control fresh food sales and transportation, eliminating inventory shortages, providing direct access to marketing funds and trucks. The Platform EHarvestHub suggests the EHH token to power the ecosystem. The platform offers the opportunity to get rid of traditional bank transfers that require high commissions and long transaction times, providing a very fast, secure, economical and transparent solution for cross-currency transactions.
