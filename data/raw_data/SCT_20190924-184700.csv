Their initial aim was to act as a social marketplace, so there will be other products as well.

There are 2.6 million tokens on cryptopies and until this exchange opens, no one will pull the price up. On latoken no liquidity and trading. This exchange is washing up the volume. I am surprised why you do not see it!? On this exchange, there were never purchase orders for 0.00021 ETH. If you pay attention then the maximum is 0.00016 eth. The exchange artificially shows a rise in price, but there are no buy orders. I do not know how to explain this to you because English is not my native language.   The difference between buying and selling is doubled. The exchange buys orders from itself by 0.000011btc and thus shows that the price is rising. The next day they sell at 0.000005 and show that the price falls.

Yes, we have an internal currency, but that's not even the most exciting aspect. It's just a tool to drive the overall ecosystem. One component.  We know that our SCT holders are primarily interested in the token and its value, but hear us out. Most tokens have zero value. People just don't realize it yet. SCT will have zero value if we don't build a business model that catches on. And if we do build a business model that catches on, SCT will have tremendous value because of its constrained supply.  SOMA is holding large amounts of SCT strategically to distribute to partners. This is part of our growth strategy. In the long run, what's good for SOMA is good for investors. Most tokens will go to zero because they won't find adoption. SOMA is already finding adoption, and this distribution strategy is a key part of our roadmap forward.",False

Up until now, our ‘vibe’ has been that of one of a scrappy, albeit promising, cryptocurrency/blockchain project. Among many scrappy crypto projects. And our branding has worked for that. But — let’s be honest — it doesn’t exactly scream ‘enterprise-grade tracking and logistics protocol.’ Nor ‘next-gen peer-to-peer social ecommerce platform.’ Nor ‘the hottest new site for luxury goods.’  Because SOMA will be all of those things and more. We have the momentum. We have the funding. And now we need the branding to accompany these objectives. SOMA not a cryptocurrency  We have a cryptocurrency (SCT), and it serves very specific purposes in the SOMA tech stack. But SOMA is so much more than just another ‘altcoin.’ You might even say that the crypto part is one of the least revolutionary aspects of SOMA. The evolution of ecommerce  SOMA is a hybrid-tech solution that unites the best of blockchain, ecommerce, social media, and existing tech stacks.  Yes, we are built on blockchain.Yes, blockchain is central to our model. But it’s time to get out of the cryptosphere and compete in the real world.

SOMA does not condone or endorse in any way the participation in market manipulation, pump and dump groups, or any other unethical or illegal activity.  So, why is SOMA associating itself with Gat?  Simple: we believe in second chances. Gat made a mistake and has admitted as much. He did not instigate the activity, and has an otherwise stellar reputation in the cryptosphere. These facts lead us to believe that this was an isolated indiscretion. If we believed otherwise, we would not associate the SOMA brand with him.  Gat has been a tireless proponent of cryptocurrency technology and has given away his considerable knowledge to others in his his free Telegram groups and via his YouTube channel. Members of the SOMA team have followed him long before the recent scandal and have observed him to be a selfless and aboveboard person.

But on sct case, the high volume can not be achieved or at least it would be hard to get there (and thus, it can't be listed on third exchange due to their criteria is not fulfilled) because soma gave a ""lockdown rule"" for their airdrop which, unfortunately, also supported by our recent condition where the only working exchange is ED. This will make people think they better hold their token due to the lack of decent exchange in hope to gain profit on the airdrop or until the third exchange announced.  Now, because most people will hold their coin until a better exchange come, there will be a low trading volume. While at the same time, the third exchange is also waiting for a decent volume to give a go. Unless one party decide to give in, we're stuck here.  Thus, I propose that soma can devise a plan to break this situation by revising their rule of airdrop, where the token ""lockdown"" will be effective from, like, one more week or anything. This will hopefully create a huge demand as strong investors would start bidding to gather more coin while weak hand will let their coins go because they get a decent price.  Those who want to sell quick will be happy because they can sell.  Those who want to hold more will be happy because they get their wishes.  Volume will increase and we'll meet the third exchange.  Everyone is happy",False

Initially, they planned to unfreeze the contract once they finished distributing bounties, which was planned (if I remember correctly) to be done around the 20-ish of November, but it seems due to the large participants, they got delayed and up until today (again, if I am not mistaken) there are several bounty hunters that is yet to receive their payment.  Hence, maybe the reason of locking was because they want everybody get a fair chance of dumping their coin at the best rate (we know some will dump) instead of having to sell at the post-mayhem due to receiving their payment late. This is a good strategy too, actually. I remember that there was this waves token bounty that had to experienced a rather rough path of being dumped several times because they separate their bounty payment into certain phases. This way, we only have to face one (and probably a big one) dump then we can stsrt recovering and stabilizing our rate.   I wonder if we can get hitbtc soon?

But I personally don't think that's logical. If anyone can be considered eligible for the airdrop by buying and transferring their amount to a wallet, what stopped someone from buying at day -1 or week -1, then hold it on a relatively short amount of time if compared to other people who had hold theirs for months.  Unless there is a certain period of ""lock-down"", like anyone who buy before December ends and lock their tokens ever since.

Users that were chosen by the item owner to engage in its promotion will, after a successful transaction, be rewarded with SCT by the seller. Please note that SCTs for prizes will come from the owner’s wallet. This means that item owner will need to have SCT on his account to make his product promotable.

What would be a simple real life example?  I hope I got it right. You buy something on the marketplace and the informations about this will be saved in the IIC. So, if an item will get sold and bought on the marketplace, everytime the information will be saved on the IIC, and can be tracked back to when it first got sold there.

What would be a simple real life example?  El IIC is a virtual document in the blockchain that will store all the information of an item, including how many times it was bought, it's like a history of the item, so when you buy it inside the platform, you know what the particular item has been through, the downside is that the history starts when the item enters the ecosystem, before that, you will only know the information that the seller fills in, so if it was actually bought 3 times, the first time it may actually say 1, that will depend of the veracity of the seller, of course, if it's found out that the information is false, the seller and item lose credibility, thus reducing the chances of it being bought; its a fantastic feature, and once the platform becomes mainstream, it will become essential.  I'm having a hard time understanding exactly how this if going to work... But I'm definitely curious.",False

In the Soma, the contribution to the social capital in terms of value creation is materialized through User Rewarding System (URS).  URS is based on Soma Community Token (SCT), which is an ERC20 Token that is allocated inside the platform in relation to a user’s contribution individually, thus making Soma a ”perfect meritocracy” – a model which excludes the need for third parties and provides the most efficient distribution of wealth.  The rewarding system in Soma is by nature two-fold. First, it must be recognized that every time user adds value to the community it should be rewarded for its actions. Second, the compensation must be attributed in the proportion of the value created. In Soma, this becomes reality by providing an environment that enables the exchange of social capital to SCT in the course of a bargaining at the free markets. Thus, Soma provides the ability and incentive for its users to engage in such conduct and the market mechanism ensures perfect pricing in the community.  SCT will be designed to satisfy both of these underlying ”Community Principles”.''",False

Therefore, an extra 10% of tokens will only lower the price of all tokens. A compromise option might be that the extra 10% of the tokens will be sold at a price higher than the ICO. But we must take into account that this price will be the ceiling for the price of tokens in the market. Now the token costs 0.002222 .... ETH. If the developers set a firm price for an extra 10% of tokens at 0.02ETH, then there will be no significant drop in the market price. But on the other hand, tokens on the site are unlikely to be bought, as the price will be lower on exchanges. However, in the unlikely liquidity crisis, these tokens on the site will be bought at a high price.

There were a lot of questions about the tokens and what will be burned and what not. We told we would hold a liquidity reserve to support the smooth functioning of the SOMA platform. We were thinking about 10% of the unsold tokens.  For the moment nothing is created, so there is no liquidity reserve. We think this reserve would help any liquidity problems with the SCT to support smooth fuctioning of the SOMA platform. If investors hold on there SCT we think there should be a problem with the liquidity. So with this reserve, users can still buy SCT after ICO to be used on the platform, this will not be at ICO price.  The devs have decided to listen to our great community. We will consider based on the feedback if the liquidity reserve will be created or not.  So please give us a well argumented feedback on what you think its best for SOMA and his future.

The point i agree 100% with:  Quote In short, Soma wants to bring back the trust factor in marketplaces by adding in the social dimension. And all this is done by giving users an incentive for being more social. The fact that the platform is built on the Ethereum blockchain also makes it easier to facilitate payments through either Ether or Bitcoin, and the company is also planning to facilitate payments through cards, fiat currency and PayPal.  “The vision of the Soma community is to provide a platform that sets up a true freedom of trade, without any redundant actors that do not increase any value in the chain of transactions,” says Soma co-founder Jukka Hilmola, stressing that such a marketplace can help ensure better value and liquidity for producers and traders across the globe.",False

""The unsold tokens will be burnt, expect the 10% liquidity reserve, which will only exist if the the ICO will not reach the hard cap.

I was just reading about the interactive item card they are implementing, users increase the value of their published IIC’s by gaining social acceptance inside the platform.  They are also stating:  Through the social interactions known from the traditional social media platforms such as likes and followings, the “social value” of the IIC is increased. Thus, users are incentivized to create high-quality content on the platform as they get rewarded for doing so. IIC contains information inserted by the users in a chronological chain about the particular physical item, such as ownership data and the condition rating. IIC transforms information of the item on a transaction-by-transaction basis. IIC will facilitate the information flow between the users, promote transparency and increase the overall trust of the community.

However, I have some reservations regarding the use of IIC's brought up in the whitepaper. IIC or Interactive Item Card is used when a seller in SOMA will register his object (to be sold of course in the market), every registered object will have their own IIC, so when it is sold to the new owner, the new owner will have the IIC of that said object. Now, let's say the owner will use the object for quite some time let's say in a year, and that owner decided to sell it in SOMA again, that object still has the previous IIC. So the challenge now is the recognition of that product. SOMA team proposes using computer vision technology to compare new item photos with older photos to confirm that the item is the same and that it hasn’t been damaged. Any changes in the item’s appearance or quality is recorded on the IIC. However, how sure are we in that computer vision tech that they will arrive on? How accurate, secure and trustworthy is that tech? What are the effects it has for the buyers? What if this tech made a mistake? There are so many questions. I think this tech is still speculative.

I havent heard of this computer vision tech before, but I have to tell you, I don't have much faith in this tech you are talking about, because it still leaves too many possibilities for a mistake or misinformation in the platform.   There may not be any visual damage on the product, but it may still be damaged, for an example: tv not working.  Maybe this tech could work for electronics that are smart, that would run hardware checks and save this data in the IIC.

So I still have to see it to believe it.  However, I think I have a solution. Maybe they already have a prototype there already, but I doubt that it's already intelligent enough to be able to accomplish the feat they want to accomplish in my previous comment. But I think it will work just fine if, instead of just having one IIC per object regardless of it's age or owners, (because, I just can really imagine how hard will the IIC be able to keep track what's what, especially for identical objects right?) why not give a unique IIC every time someone will offer his object for sale in SOMA, eventhough it was sold before?

You can see the effect of too little communication even in this thread. I have been quite cynical because there have been no answers to the questions raised in here.

After consulting with our advisors, we decided to extend our ICO.  SCT Now Listed On Exchanges  SCT is now listed on exchanges, such as Yobit and Etherdelta and we are in the final stages of negotiating more. Availability on exchanges is critical for everyone participating in ICOs. Extending the sale an additional 2,5 weeks will allow us to finalize more exchanges, providing additional confidence for our contributors.  New Advisors and Marketing Team  A major part of why we did the ICO was to hire a new team. We are pleased to share three new advisors who will lead our marketing.  David Passiak is the former Head of Innovation for dubizzle, the largest P2P marketplace in the Middle East where our advisor Arto Joensuu served as CEO. Arto introduced us to David, and David brought in his team of Chelsea Rustrum and Riku Luukkonen.  David and Chelsea hosted a webinar for us this past week - check out the recording - and we negotiated for them to lead our marketing moving forward. They are three of the top marketers in the world and experts in blockchain and social marketplaces.  Increased Traction and Detailed Roadmap  Our new marketing leads had a major impact in just one week. Our Telegram group grew by 400 people, we increased weekly sales transactions by 350% and website visits by 20%, and received some great media coverage including an article on Soma in Forbes  Soma have an excellent alpha product for Ios that you can test here, detailed roadmap, and with our new marketing team a solid plan on how to execute the beta launch in Q1 2018. We would love the opportunity to tell you more next week in a webinar.  David Passiak will interview our founders, followed by a live Q&A. Learn our story, vision, product roadmap. We will follow-up with an invitation to the webinar.  More Big News Coming Soon  We hope you understand the reasons why we extended the sale and look forward to answering any questions next week in our webinar. Thanks for your continued support and being with us on our journey to revolutionize how we buy and sell items.  With gratitude, The Soma Team",False

Soma also had a minor pre-sale with a very limited publicity, mainly to have a proof of concept in the ICO markets.  We have closed two funding rounds from Finnish angel investors before our ICO. With this capital, we were able to deliver our iOS-application for testing, and very soon we are releasing a new updated version of it. This new version will include core features that are crucial for a C2C-platform. Blockchain related features are designed to be released on our MVP according to our roadmap.  We decided not include soft cap as we were already backed up by angel investments before the ICO round and ICO is a complementary round to develop our software further.

For example, traditional classifieds players still operate under the same business rules as they have for the last 15 years. They are struggling to embrace new and innovative technologies and despite their massive budgets, they have yet to truly evolve their business models and are pretty much attempting to adapt a “one-size-fits-all” approach across the globe.""  Pretty confident words by the SOMA devs, lets see if they can make it happen  Devs really believe in there project and they sould. When they are convienced that it will work then the chance of its succeeding is more likely because they just dont give up.  SOMA is a strong project with great potential. They already raised a lot so devs will make this huge together with the community.  I think that SOMA shows how confidence they are about their project, thats good for their reputation. Hopefully they will raise enough money for their platform. Thanx for the link to the article.  Project is good for sure, my only doubt is about the future value of SCT tokens amd how they will be used. But I explained what I think many times and I'n not write it one more time  the more successful the project is, the higher the value of the token. in that case everyone will want a piece of the action. A problem is that nearly all last ICOs were traded on exchanges under ICO price I don't understand these guys participating in an ICO and immediately after the ICO they sell their coins. That's a common thing for a project that reached their hardcap or maybe nearly reached it. It happens because of the Bounty Hunter.",False

Actually, the app is looking worse than I expected (my expectation can be high though). But still it is a start, and probably will much better till release.  It's an alpha release mate what did you expect? It's looking good imo. Geolocation is good, if you want to buy a byke (because, why not?) I'm expecting to buy one near me yeah, Interesting interface.. I think it will look decent after full development of the application, and after testing. looking forward to the version for android too  in my opinion the app is quite nice for a alpha version. BUT i found out that the features are really circumstanced due to the fact that you cant connect it to facebook (the one screenshot with the facebook header) the header says that you cant connect to facebook because the app is under development.  but a thin which is nice is that whenever you open a item for sellin there is a picture of the geolocation underneath the pictures which makes it easy to think about shipping costs and so on if you by big items. i hope that there is a soon connection to facebook availible that i can keep you guys in touch  You think it's only for let you sign in with your facebook account or it will also share your friend list over Soma?

Obviously, if the crowd sale will reach the maximum cap it will decrease the amount of time to get Soma expanded across the globe in different markets since we can allocate more resources towards it from the beginning. Soma has raised capital already from the traditional funding sources and the next version of the application will be released soon for testing on our website. Thus, the capital raised from the ICO is mainly allocated to implementation of blockchain-related features of the platform and mainstreaming Soma for the large masses. The cap of 120,000 ETH is a calculated theoretical maximum which enhances the expansion of Soma and ensures the wide adoption in the beginning.",False
