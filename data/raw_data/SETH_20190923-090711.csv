Also only two team members mention AI experience (one of those two has only 3-4 month experience mentioned on linkedin) and this is is the ""core"" part of the ""product""...

Will this project be open sourced or is the solution proprietary ?? edit 2: did anyone saw the technology landscape or architecture itself? I didn't find any information in the whitepaper.

Can you point me in the direction where it says AI is a ""core"" part of the ""product""? I don't see how AI is relevant to many of the use cases mentioned in the white paper, although every company seems to chuck 'AI' into their sales pitch these days, but to Sether's credit I don't find it anywhere in their whitepaper, and certainly not presented as a ""core"" feature...

Also, as you very eloquently put it, the demo MUST pin point the ""selling"" points... in the demo I don't care about searches, I don't care about logging in, etc. I want to see how did you ""envision"" the solution could look like in far future (hopefully not too different )  AI is mentioned on the first page of the web site (part IV). Unfortunately it is not described inside the whitepaper (this is the part that I consider the brain of the operation because anyone can write Web Service calls to Social networks and extract data). Behavior analysis is just shortly described in whitepaper.  Now also, a question pops ups, is this AI opensource or not because that part obviously won't be run on the blockchain (I assume?)...  As I pointed out in my first post, there is no info about possible partnership... if there is no information about that, how did they come up with the pricing sheme? It is described in chapter 7. Prices can only be determined after you analyse the market...  At this time, I would assume that it is ""all dev's on deck"" time...or in other words ""you don't eat, sleep, drink until we launch..."" and there is no activity on GIT for a whole month or more... I also didn't find the demo on the git - but this is maybe my fault I lost motivation to go through all of the folders  Until I get more detailed information, this looks like it could have used a couple of months more to prepare... ""polish"" the demo, create some video, get some ""partner"" names, fill whitepaper with relevant information because, although I have DEV background, I have no intention of reading each API method that Tweeter, Facebook or any other social network exposes...the only thing I care to see regarding that part is ""what will they track""/""which data"" - I really don't care using which API method they get it (unless I want to see ""why"" is something slow) - but currently I am looking it through eyes of an innocent bystander    If I skipped any of your question, please let me know...",False

And we have quite a few in discussions. There are permanent communication with them, live demos of our technology and so on. This is a business to business platform and a company with a serious approach and a large investment by itself.  We decided to let everybody in the pre-ico without having a cap of minimum investment, because some of our experienced friends in the blockchain ecosystem considered and advised us to democratize the participation, to let everybody benefit in the same conditions as the investors. And we have done this. We are going to have the progressed announced periodically in the crowdsale period as it is normal to be.  If you do not believe in the product or the company than it is better not to invest. Just as an advise, do not invest based on how much money others pretend they raised, or how many people are on BitcoinTalk or Telegram or how many banners some ICOs have or how many influencers.  This is how scams appeared... a lot of money in promotion, fake news, etc. Do your research, study well before investing and take your own decision. The future belongs to the ICOs which are doing real business on blockchain and to the ICOs that have a real company behind, acting like a company, with business experience.  In the end, thank you for supporting us or investing in us or following us. We treasure each and everyone of you.  Kind regards,  Ovidiu Oancea Founder and CEO Sether",False

Sether acts as a 3-rd party AI regulator between the agency and the client, monitoring and analyzing the performance of an advertising campaign, then distributing the advertising budget according to the registered performance.  How  Sether  works  Any brand can independently contract the services of an online advertising agency, and then run and monitor the entire process through the platform, from the creative process to the actual results of the campaign.  The client and the agency agree to the project deliverables and choose a set of key performance indicators to reflect the performance of the campaign. To correctly compensate campaign efficiency, Sether introduces a set of payment levels for rewarding the performance of the agency according to the results of the campaign and based on the agreed performance indicators.      The Advertiser and the Agency agree to these levels, then the Advertiser loads the funds for the project on the Blockchain, where they are secured by a Smart Contract for the duration or the project. The Blockchain acts as an Escrow account, holding the funds, then automatically distributing them to the Agency, depending on the performance of the campaign.
