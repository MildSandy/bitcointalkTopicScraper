Available on Apple and Android  Leap With Alice A Tool For The Passionate Educator    Leap With Alice empowers educators on a global scale, utilizing emerging technologies to reimagine the outdated education system. Providing a variety of EdTech tools, Leap With Alice enhances education with augmented reality, secures users with blockchain technology, and incentivizes activity through cryptocurrency. Leap With Alice creates a world where students learn through innovation and educators earn through imagination.  Attacking problems that have plagued education for decades, Leap With Alice facilitates the transformation of an ordinary classroom into an immersive learning experience. The ALICE token represents an ecosystem where the quality efforts of educators are not just encouraged, they are rewarded. An incentivize based structure utilizes a reward pool of ALICE tokens, driving attention to quality content. When an educator creates content for the ALICE Exchange, “likes” or shares content, or writes a thoughtful review, these positive contributions are rewarded. The ALICE Exchange facilitates a decentralized P2P marketplace where content creators can avoid the heavy fees and commissions of centralized models. Further, the security provided by blockchain technology allows teachers and students to secure their most valuable resource, their personal data.  https://image.ibb.co/cNNEJU/Screen_Shot_2018_08_24_at_10_54_16_AM.png  What is inside the aliceSuite™?  ● aliceLabs™   Easily create free educational content, enhanced by AR.  ● aliceLens™   View augmented creations and rediscover the world.  ● aliceExchange™   Sell creations on an incentive driven Educator-to-Educator marketplace.  ● aliceClassroom™   Dashboard detailing KPI's such as student growth and engagement.   The ALICE Token   Dual Token Structure  Adapting to the evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency space, Leap With Alice will offer two tokens. The ALICE token serves as the native currency for the Alice Exchange, providing users a larger percentage of sales vs. fiat, while acting as an incentive for the creation and curation of content. The LWA token is designed to represent a tokenized security, where the owner grants the anticipation of future profits in the form of dividends, revenue share and/or price appreciation. The LWA token will be available as a mechanism to raise funds to further the development of the platform. Once Leap With Alice is fully functional, the ALICE token will become available to the general public.  The ALICE Utility Token   ● Minimizes transaction fees ● Returns a higher percentage of sales, compared to Fiat ● Facilitates the execution of smart contract ● Represents transferable value for buying/selling on the Alice Exchange ● Incentivizes quality contributions throughout the experience    The LWA Security Token   ● Tracking security holders of a specific security ● P/L distribution and allocation for security holders ● Easier transfer of securities ● Increased liquidation of securities  The ALICE Exchange  The ALICE Exchange creates an ecosystem where educators can take control of their passion. Establishing a global community, the ALICE Exchange is a peer-to-peer digital marketplace with the capacity to buy and sell original educational content, transacting with the ALICE token. Teachers may browse specific topics that target unique abilities, providing the most personalized lesson possible. If a more collaborative environment is the goal, interactive lesson plans can be created that bring the entire class together for an immersive learning experience. The time and effort spent creating a unique lesson plan are no longer confined to a single classroom, it can span the globe and impact students everywhere. The ALICE Exchange facilitates the distribution of enhanced educational content on a global scale.   Reputation Building  When a transaction is conducted using the ALICE token, buyers can leave feedback for the seller about that transaction. Consisting of ratings and comments, all feedback is stored on the Ethereum blockchain and impacts each user’s reputation. Linking the feedback to the transaction, a detailed history of quality and trust is created. Thanks to the open and public nature of the Ethereum blockchain, anyone is able to view this history. Each user’s reputation is created by the accumulation of feedback received attention to content and transaction history.  Incentives  ALICE is designed to decentralize the buying, selling and rewarding of positive contributions by removing the “trusted third party”. Quality content is what will drive new users to Leap With Alice while maintaining the activity level of existing users. The users who generate this valuable content are algorithmically rewarded from the Incentive Pool in ALICE token. This method of distribution spreads the ALICE token to users on a larger scale, targeting those that bring value to the platform. Additionally, those that contribute by curating content (evaluating, reviewing, commenting, sharing) also play a pivotal role in the proper distribution of the Incentive Pool. These users who create impact through curation are also rewarded with ALICE token.  https://preview.ibb.co/ddQmvo/Token_Incentivization_Copy.png  Creators  Content creators are the backbone of Leap With Alice. They will be given every opportunity to flourish and incentivized around every corner. When a content creator generates education material using ALICE Labs and places it on the ALICE Exchange, they create a supplemental stream of value. As sales receive positive feedback, the creator is rewarded with ALICE token (from the Incentive Pool), based on the level of their reputation. As a user’s reputation grows, the percentage level of reward increases. Additionally, content creators have the ability to receive “tips” in ALICE token from other users, pushing the incentive to create quality content.  Consumers  For every purchase made on the ALICE Exchange, the buyer receives ALICE tokens (from the Incentive Pool) as a reward for contributing to the Leap With Alice community. Purchase history plays a large role in a user’s reputation. This results in an increased incentive for purchasing content as a reputation grows. As more ALICE tokens are exchanged for content, the more a user receives reward tokens back, as a “thank you.""  Curators  In an effort to ensure that the best content rises above the rest, users who remain active in the practice of rating, reviewing, and sharing quality content are rewarded in ALICE token (from the Incentive Pool). The level at which they are rewarded is also dependent on their reputation. Furthering the incentive to curate, content creators also have the ability to send tips to users who provide thoughtful feedback.  Campaigns  Approaches to learning vary across the globe. On a smaller scale, every classroom is a unique learning environment. There may be a time when the content that a user desires is not readily available. These users are able to initiate bounty programs. Offering an incentive from their wallet (defined by a number of ALICE tokens), users can request specific content. Once another user has created the content and submitted it into the ALICE Exchange (confirmed by the user who initiated the bounty), they receive the ALICE tokens that were offered as a reward.
