Since there is no broker mediation, the standard broker’s commission (15–25%) will be awarded to the client in the form of VRN. The Client can choose to exchange the VRN for fiat money or to keep it and later purchase a new insurance with a significant discount.  The system will offer special type of smart contracts, guaranteeing that when a defined set of events occurs, the client will automatically be compensated with a certain amount of VRN’s. This will make Vernam the game changer who dared to digitalize the insurance market! Vernam will also be the safest and the cheapest tool to purchase insurance.",False

In order to prevent possible attacks of wallets during the campaign, we introduced another token in our smart contracts — it is called VCT — Vernam Crowdsale Token.  VCT is what everyone will be getting during the campaign. The only purpose of this token is to guarantee that after the end of the campaign you will be able to convert it in VRN token. It can’t be transferred and you can’t use it for anything else.  This is why it won’t be interesting for hackers to try to steal it.  But how do I know I’ll get my real VRN tokens after the crowdsale? Everything about our token sale is transparent and so are our smart contracts — You can check them on GitHub.  You will see that the two tokens are identical, but the VCT one is of no use other than to be converted to VRN after the crowd sale and if KYC is passed.  https://medium.com/@vernam.official/how-to-buy-vrn-tokens-with-40-discount-97aacd8785fa",False

We are so excited to have you onboard and become part of the future of insurance. There were over 37,000 on the waiting list and the competition was furious, so don’t worry if you have missed the chance to participate in the hot three hours. Until 23.05 you have chance to buy VRN tokens with 20% discount. Anyway, as our Token Sale is gaining popularity and our group is nearing 40,000 people, scammers are sneaking in, thinking of all kinds of dirty tricks to fool people and steal their money. This is why we decided to write a guide how to detect scammers and how to fight them. We are showing examples from the Vernam Telegram channel, but they are applicable to any group. When you join a Telegram group, always start by reading the pinned message. Sometimes it may be boring, but usually you will see all the important ant up-to-date information there.  Most Telegram groups list their admins on the pinned message. Always check the usernames of the admins in the pinned message and whenever you doubt you are chatting with an admin, check their nickname on the profile info.  Real Bob vs. Fake Bob and how to spot them Why admins will never DM you first?  Definitely scam Vernam group’s admins and most Telegram group admins are forbidden to write directly to the members of the group. It is a measure against scammers and it is what scammers usually do. The typical scammer will mimic admin’s profile and hit random members of the group on DM, trying to convince them to make transactions to different addresses. Admins will never ask you personal data on Telegram, also ask you for wallet addresses and similar Remember, if you are interested in the project, the only way we will collect your data is through our dashboard. All admins can help you with on the group is: Instructions Brief info about the project, the dashboard, the bounty program, etc. What to do if you spot a scammer? If you spot a scammer, pretend you trust him and act cool. Make screenshots and send to real admins, so that they can take proper measures and kick him out of the group. Questions? Join other nearly 40,000 supporters on our Telegram Group! Our administrators will be online 24/7 answering important questions regarding the token sale and Vernam, so please do not hesitate to ask! At Vernam, we’ve beyond excited to start revolutionizing insurance. Will you join us and help make transparent, secure, automated insurance a reality?",False

In order to prevent possible attacks of wallets during the campaign, we introduced another token in our smart contracts — it is called VCT — Vernam Crowdsale Token.  VCT is what everyone will be getting during the campaign. The only purpose of this token is to guarantee that after the end of the campaign you will be able to convert it in VRN token. It can’t be transferred and you can’t use it for anything else.  This is why it won’t be interesting for hackers to try to steal it.  But how do I know I’ll get my real VRN tokens after the crowdsale? Everything about our token sale is transparent and so are our smart contracts — You can check them on GitHub.  You will see that the two tokens are identical, but the VCT one is of no use other than to be converted to VRN after the crowd sale and if KYC is passed.  https://medium.com/@vernam.official/how-to-buy-vrn-tokens-with-40-discount-97aacd8785fa",False

Besides the platform itself, a proprietary off-chain market place will use the Vernam token (VRN) — an Ethereum-based ERC 20 standard crypto token — to take full advantage of the platform’s functionality. In other words, when a contract between a client and an insurance provider is signed on Vernam, it will be denominated in VRN. Since there is no broker mediation, the standard broker’s commission (15–25%) will be awarded to the client in the form of VRN. The Client can choose to exchange the VRN for fiat money or to keep it and later purchase a new insurance with a significant discount. The system will offer special type of smart contracts, guaranteeing that when a defined set of events occurs, the client will automatically be compensated with a certain amount of VRN’s. This will make Vernam the game changer who dared to digitalize the insurance market! Vernam will also be the safest and the cheapest tool to purchase insurance.",False

You will see the corresponding amount of VCT tokens in your wallet: https://s7.postimg.cc/j3vqstg3f/image.jpg  The VCT token in MyEtherWallet VCT — our anti-fraud guarantee for you during the campaign As you already know, the Vernam token is called VRN. In order to prevent possible attacks of wallets during the campaign, we introduced another token in our smart contracts — it is called VCT — Vernam Crowdsale Token.  VCT is what everyone will be getting during the campaign. The only purpose of this token is to guarantee that after the end of the campaign you will be able to convert it in VRN token. It can’t be transferred and you can’t use it for anything else.  This is why it won’t be interesting for hackers to try to steal it.  But how do I know I’ll get my real VRN tokens after the crowdsale? Everything about our token sale is transparent and so are our smart contracts — You can check them on GitHub.  You will see that the two tokens are identical, but the VCT one is of no use other than to be converted to VRN after the crowd sale and if KYC is passed.  https://medium.com/@vernam.official/how-to-buy-vrn-tokens-with-40-discount-97aacd8785fa [/quote]  Is there any restriction for the ico?

Sales and claim compensations will be covered through the platform, while risk analysis, claim adjustment and examination will be provided by the insurance company. Communication between Vernam and the insurer will be real-time and completely automated.  Purchasing process will start with a request from the customer. The platform will return quotes from participating brokers and insurance companies, which will be denominated in Vernam tokens. If accepted, depending on the availability of VRN in the customer’s wallet, either the quoted amount will be transferred to Vernam / third party broker, or the required VRN tokens will be purchased from a digital exchange. An insurance contract will be created, where information will be retrieved from the shared ledger, or provided / updated from the client.  When insurance products are purchased through our dedicated broker network, clients will receive a VRN-denominated incentive, approximately equal to the standard broker commission for the specific type of insurance (typically, around 20%). A minor share will be retained for platform maintenance and to cover additional operating costs. This will increase the appeal of the Vernam platform to potential customers, thus creating a positive network effect. The Vernam tokens could be exchanged for fiat money, or kept for future VRN-denominated purchases. As discussed earlier, direct purchase of insurance products in Vernam tokens will be cheaper by an amount, equal to the abovementioned incentive, which will also stimulate the development of the platform and its tokenized economy. When a client signs an insurance contract on the platform a small floating fee* will be deducted from the reward for the operation. The revenue from this fee collection and advertising will be used to run the business and cover operational costs.",False

Nevertheless, to stimulate platform development and customer adoption, we would develop our own broker network, guaranteeing control over the complete insurance contracting process.  Two strategies are possible – the establishment of brand new broker companies, or the acquisition of existing ones. The first path is cheaper, but might require a longer planning horizon, as many licensing and legal steps might take a significant amount of time. Acquiring an existing broker is more expensive, but has the added benefits of inheriting the existing relationships with insurers and with clients. While the latter is important, we believe that releasing the value-added back to end customers (through the return of the “traditional” brokerage commission) would stimulate client adoption – especially in an industry where customer loyalty is not very high. Therefore, a good marketing strategy and an effective and intensive promotional campaign will be more important than acquiring an existing broker’s client portfolio. Acquiring the relationship between brokers and insurers, on the other hand, is of primary importance, as it will allow a faster and more efficient operations roll-out. Our interviews with industry experts have confirmed that setting up the documentary and administrative relationship for a new broker might take up to a year.",False

In order to prevent possible attacks of wallets during the campaign, we introduced another token in our smart contracts — it is called VCT — Vernam Crowdsale Token.  VCT is what everyone will be getting during the campaign. The only purpose of this token is to guarantee that after the end of the campaign you will be able to convert it in VRN token. It can’t be transferred and you can’t use it for anything else.  This is why it won’t be interesting for hackers to try to steal it.  But how do I know I’ll get my real VRN tokens after the crowdsale? Everything about our token sale is transparent and so are our smart contracts — You can check them on GitHub.  You will see that the two tokens are identical, but the VCT one is of no use other than to be converted to VRN after the crowd sale and if KYC is passed.  https://medium.com/@vernam.official/how-to-buy-vrn-tokens-with-40-discount-97aacd8785fa [/quote]  Is there any restriction for the ico?

It will also be used for payments in our smart contracts to create a tamper-free, perpetual record of clients’ insurance history, which can be used by insurers to optimize risk assessment.Through our concept, Vernam will solve one of the hardest issues to tackle in the current state of the industry — the loss of trust between end customers, insurance providers and intermediaries (brokers and agents), resulting from the speculative value of the middlemen’s services (for which they receive generous commissions)and the “hidden” information regarding the exact percentage offered to them as a reward by the different insurers — information which reveals why a client might be offered to accept an insurance proposal which does not suits best his needs.  When the middleman is out of the game, his commission (an average of 15–20% of the overall insurance cost) will be returned to the client in the form of Vernam tokens as an incentive for using the platform. This means Insurance will become much cheaper and the clients will always get the best proposal for them.",False

In order to prevent possible attacks of wallets during the campaign, we introduced another token in our smart contracts — it is called VCT — Vernam Crowdsale Token.

With so many ICOs on the market, you have to pick and choose which ones to back carefully. And the most important question to ask is this: Does this ICO provide real, lasting value?  There’s no question about it — Vernam definitely does. Insurers agree that insurance is facing huge changes — there’s a real mismatch between how the insurance industry operates and the amazing potential offered by new technological capabilities. But while many InsurTechs are focusing on expanding the insurance value chain, Vernam is here to disrupt it entirely.  And this kind of big-picture thinking is what’s badly needed.  Insurance is plagued by a few main issues, and Vernam solves all of these: slow processes involving too many intermediaries, lack of freedom of choice because of barriers to transparent product information, painstaking personal information verification, high costs due to the general inefficiency built into the system.  By leveraging blockchain, the insuring process will see huge benefits in terms of time & effort involvement. Private data will be secure and more quickly available, which will not only speed up insurance purchases, but also claims and payout.  And more than that, when insurers have access to verified, detailed, and personalized data, they’ll be able to offer more relevant and tailored products for their clients. It’s a win-win for both insurers and regular people who need insurance.  You’ll save big on commission fees — because there aren’t any.  Intermediaries like brokers and agents typically take big commissions — up to 30% — on every policy they sell. With Vernam, we take these intermediaries out of the equation completely and that cost goes down to 0%. It’s that simple.  Participants in the marketplace receive a bonus with every policy purchase.  Every policy purchased will include a bonus of up to 30% of your policy premium distributed in VRN.  Where does this come from and why? See point 2 above. We’d like to reward the end-clients instead of agents and brokers, and incentivize everyone to jump bravely into the future of insurance.  Beyond financial rewards, as a purchaser of insurance you’ll also gain another important thing — agency. We connect end-customers directly with insurers, meaning that if you’re looking to buy insurance, you’ll have unprecedented access to review and choose the best policy for your needs.  The VRN token has a built-in value appreciation mechanism. All insurance transactions on the Vernam platform operate with VRN tokens. To make this happen, the Vernam team will be buying VRN tokens from the market.  And by buying tokens from the participating exchanges in order to reward clients, we will create a constant demand for the VRN token.  Vernam will launch an innovative crypto insurance product, Crypto Safe (CS), thus providing a future-thinking alternative to traditional insurance.  While disrupting the structure of insurance is no small feat, at Vernam, we’re thinking big and not stopping there. We’ll partner with insurance providers across national borders to provide our own unique crypto insurance product, with our goal being to up the game even more.  What’s new with Crypto Safe?  End-to-end digital process — fast & automated Smart contract — guaranteed correctness towards the client Transparent premiums and coverage policy When no damage is claimed, the CS smart contract will return a defined percentage of the premium to the client in VRN tokens Not only is Crypto Safe offering a smoother, faster, more transparent experience for the end-clients, it’s also incentivizing prevention of accidents & claims.",False

Besides the platform itself, a proprietary off-chain market place will use the Vernam token (VRN) — an Ethereum-based ERC 20 standard crypto token — to take full advantage of the platform’s functionality.  In other words, when a contract between a client and an insurance provider is signed on Vernam, it will be denominated in VRN. Since there is no broker mediation, the standard broker’s commission (15–25%) will be awarded to the client in the form of VRN. The Client can choose to exchange the VRN for fiat money or to keep it and later purchase a new insurance with a significant discount.  The system will offer special type of smart contracts, guaranteeing that when a defined set of events occurs, the client will automatically be compensated with a certain amount of VRN’s. This will make Vernam the game changer who dared to digitalize the insurance market! Vernam will also be the safest and the cheapest tool to purchase insurance.  Given the lack of transparency and the resulting misinformation, or loss of trust between end customers, insurance providers, and intermediaries, such as brokers and agents, we are confident that the decentralized nature of the blockchain technology will help to recover the lost balance and will provide a platform, driven by shared data and mutual trust, while at the same time the clients may benefit from reducing administrative cost of the insurance products.   The blockchain sub-system of Vernam, is system of inter-related smart contracts.  It has two main purposes:  • Create Insurance Smart Contracts as a proof of the issuance of insurance and its details  • Transfer a commission back in the form of VRN Tokens  Read detailed description of the implementation of blockchain on the Vernam platform in our whitepaper: https://www.vernam.com/assets/uploads/Whitepaper_Beta_v015.pdf",False

I want to add a new information about the project: Vernam partnering with MM Broker — one of the biggest insurance brokers in Bulgaria We are already working hard on the Vernam platform, so the know-how of innovative Bulgarian broker company with 20 years of experience will help us build the platform in the best possible way  https://s7.postimg.cc/t1w17dja3/1_Vxym56r_i_NBX0h_DWUJ6afg.jpgpic upload  Vernam CEO Roman Angelov cealing partnership with MM auto’s CEO Svetlana Garcheva InsurTech is changing $4.73 billion insurance industry and the Vernam project will contribute to this better future. Our intention is nothing less but revolutionize the industry and will use blockchain technology to make the insurance process less costly, fully transparent and much more convenient!  Since we announced the project, we have attracted the attention of thousand of supporters all over the world. We managed to secure our soft cap at a Pprivate Pre-sale and there are 25, 000 waiting to contribute on our Public Pre-Sale starting on May 15th.  It is really important that we are attracting important partnerships too. Last week we sealed a contract with Indacoin — a crypto startup making it possible for everyone to contribute to our Pre-Sale using Visa and Mastercard.  Today we welcome MM Broker The best way to change something is to know really good how it works. Besides the insurance experts in our team, we will be relying on our newest partner, MM broker, to identify the weak spots of the industry and build a model to heal them.  MM Broker is one of the biggest insurance broker companies in Bulgaria, part of the MM Group.  20, 856 insurances, 1,25 Billion Euro managed insurance interests and more than 9,000 clients Numbers speak for themselves. For 18 years MM broker has built a reputation as one of the best insurance brokers in Bulgaria, managing the insurance interests of thousands of people.  “But why are you partnering with a broker?” Developing an insurance broker company for such a long time, MM broker has experienced the inefficiencies and problems of the industry very well and now they are looking into the future.  When we shared with them our idea, they were truly amazed by its potential and said that they can’t miss the chance to become part of our revolution.  For us it is an honour to attract the attention and energy of successful and experienced professionals to the Vernam project and we will be happy to work together on refining the Vernam platform.  At Vernam, we’ve beyond excited to start revolutionizing insurance. Will you join us and help make transparent, secure, automated insurance a reality?

Vernam is a project aiming to introduce serious digitalization in the insurance sector. It is an online platform which will allow the end clients to inquire, receive and contract the most suitable insurance proposal for them through a user friendly interface and without the need of a third party broker, which will dramatically lower the cost of insurance services while making the business way more efficient not only for the clients, but for the insurance providers as well.  Technologically, Vernam is decentralized online platform, based on blockchain technology which creates the right conditions for clients and insurance providers to do business in an easy, safe and cost-efficient way. Besides the platform itself, a proprietary off-chain market place will use the Vernam token (VRN) — an Ethereum-based ERC 20 standard crypto token — to take full advantage of the platform’s functionality.  In other words, when a contract between a client and an insurance provider is signed on Vernam, it will be denominated in VRN. Since there is no broker mediation, the standard broker’s commission (15–25%) will be awarded to the client in the form of VRN. The Client can choose to exchange the VRN for fiat money or to keep it and later purchase a new insurance with a significant discount.  The system will offer special type of smart contracts, guaranteeing that when a defined set of events occurs, the client will automatically be compensated with a certain amount of VRN’s. This will make Vernam the game changer who dared to digitalize the insurance market! Vernam will also be the safest and the cheapest tool to purchase insurance.  Given the lack of transparency and the resulting misinformation, or loss of trust between end customers, insurance providers, and intermediaries, such as brokers and agents, we are confident that the decentralized nature of the blockchain technology will help to recover the lost balance and will provide a platform, driven by shared data and mutual trust, while at the same time the clients may benefit from reducing administrative cost of the insurance products.   The blockchain sub-system of Vernam, is system of inter-related smart contracts.  It has two main purposes:  • Create Insurance Smart Contracts as a proof of the issuance of insurance and its details  • Transfer a commission back in the form of VRN Tokens  Read detailed description of the implementation of blockchain on the Vernam platform in our whitepaper.  Through our concept, Vernam will solve one of the hardest issues to tackle in the current state of the industry — the loss of trust between end customers, insurance providers and intermediaries (brokers and agents), resulting from the speculative value of the middlemen’s services (for which they receive generous commissions)and the “hidden” information regarding the exact percentage offered to them as a reward by the different insurers — information which reveals why a client might be offered to accept an insurance proposal which does not suits best his needs.  When the middleman is out of the game, his commission (an average of 15–20% of the overall insurance cost) will be returned to the client in the form of Vernam tokens as an incentive for using the platform.

Therefore 25% of the token sale funds will be directed to cover such expenses. The remaining 20% will be used for network development (i.e. negotiating initial broker collaboration, potential acquisitions and other equipment / physical asset costs).

In early May CEO Roman Angelov and co-founder Dimitar Mitrev were guests on the AIM Summit in Abu Dhabi.  Today our marketing expert Ivan is landing in Limassol, Cyprus where he will be representing the Vernam project in front of blockchain advocates, investors and professionals.  But do not imagine the standard crypto conference where people enjoy short speeches and chat around the venue, because this one will be much different. The battle for $250,000  Vernam will be joining a pitch competition with 15 other ICOs. Ivan will present the Vernam project in front of investors. We keep our fingers crossed, Ivan!  If you are attending the iCoinSummit and are interested in the Vernam project, do not hesitate to contact Ivan or our advisor Yagub Rahimov.

In early May CEO Roman Angelov and co-founder Dimitar Mitrev were guests on the AIM Summit in Abu Dhabi.  Today our marketing expert Ivan is landing in Limassol, Cyprus where he will be representing the Vernam project in front of blockchain advocates, investors and professionals.  But do not imagine the standard crypto conference where people enjoy short speeches and chat around the venue, because this one will be much different.  The battle for $250,000 Vernam will be joining a pitch competition with 15 other ICOs. Ivan will present the Vernam project in front of investors. We keep our fingers crossed, Ivan!  If you are attending the iCoinSummit and are interested in the Vernam project, do not hesitate to contact Ivan or our advisor Yagub Rahimov.

It’s become stale and stagnant. With technological innovation taking the world by storm, though, insurance can’t hide forever. And Vernam is making sure insurance doesn’t lag behind, but rather jumps ahead of the curve.  Our goal is to revolutionize insurance by providing a decentralized blockchain-based insurance marketplace. When end-clients and insurers can meet in a transparent, secure, and efficient platform, the world will finally unlock the true potential of blockchain for insurance and we’ll all reap the benefits.  Vernam’s coin is already in PreSale, and you shouldn’t miss out on backing this InsurTech startup! Here’s why.  1. Vernam will transform insurance into a transparent, efficient, and accessible playing field. With so many ICOs on the market, you have to pick and choose which ones to back carefully. And the most important question to ask is this: Does this ICO provide real, lasting value?  There’s no question about it — Vernam definitely does. Insurers agree that insurance is facing huge changes — there’s a real mismatch between how the insurance industry operates and the amazing potential offered by new technological capabilities. But while many InsurTechs are focusing on expanding the insurance value chain, Vernam is here to disrupt it entirely.  And this kind of big-picture thinking is what’s badly needed.  Insurance is plagued by a few main issues, and Vernam solves all of these: slow processes involving too many intermediaries, lack of freedom of choice because of barriers to transparent product information, painstaking personal information verification, high costs due to the general inefficiency built into the system.  By leveraging blockchain, the insuring process will see huge benefits in terms of time & effort involvement. Private data will be secure and more quickly available, which will not only speed up insurance purchases, but also claims and payout.  And more than that, when insurers have access to verified, detailed, and personalized data, they’ll be able to offer more relevant and tailored products for their clients. It’s a win-win for both insurers and regular people who need insurance.  2. You’ll save big on commission fees — because there aren’t any.  Intermediaries like brokers and agents typically take big commissions — up to 30% — on every policy they sell. With Vernam, we take these intermediaries out of the equation completely and that cost goes down to 0%. It’s that simple.  3. Participants in the marketplace receive a bonus with every policy purchase.  Every policy purchased will include a bonus of up to 30% of your policy premium distributed in VRN.  Where does this come from and why? See point 2 above. We’d like to reward the end-clients instead of agents and brokers, and incentivize everyone to jump bravely into the future of insurance.  Beyond financial rewards, as a purchaser of insurance you’ll also gain another important thing — agency. We connect end-customers directly with insurers, meaning that if you’re looking to buy insurance, you’ll have unprecedented access to review and choose the best policy for your needs.  4. The VRN token has a built-in value appreciation mechanism. All insurance transactions on the Vernam platform operate with VRN tokens. To make this happen, the Vernam team will be buying VRN tokens from the market.  And by buying tokens from the participating exchanges in order to reward clients, we will create a constant demand for the VRN token.  5. Vernam will launch an innovative crypto insurance product, Crypto Safe (CS), thus providing a future-thinking alternative to traditional insurance.  While disrupting the structure of insurance is no small feat, at Vernam, we’re thinking big and not stopping there. We’ll partner with insurance providers across national borders to provide our own unique crypto insurance product, with our goal being to up the game even more.  What’s new with Crypto Safe?  End-to-end digital process — fast & automated Smart contract — guaranteed correctness towards the client Transparent premiums and coverage policy When no damage is claimed, the CS smart contract will return a defined percentage of the premium to the client in VRN tokens Not only is Crypto Safe offering a smoother, faster, more transparent experience for the end-clients, it’s also incentivizing prevention of accidents & claims.  6. The Vernam Project is led by a talented team dedicated to making this vision a reality.  Our team of over 20 experts is headed by a trifecta of talented co-founders including:  Roman Angelov is our CEO and Co-Founder.  CEO of DIMIROMA GROUP, a leading Bulgarian consulting, IT, and digitization company. Awarded Digital News Innovation (DNI) funding by Google.  Ivan Georgiev is our COO and Co-Founder.  Member of the board of directors of one of the biggest holdings in Bulgaria. Founder and manager of a successful mobile app development company.  Dimitar Mitrev is our CBDO and Co-Founder.  PhD Student. Dipl. Eng. Experienced in creating and managing different B2B IT projects. CEO of DEAFOR. Member of the Bulgarian Association of Information Technologies (BAIT).  7. Right now is the best time to buy VRN tokens.The price is set to go up from here on out.  We’re rewarding early contributors with huge discounts, so the earlier you contribute to Vernam, the better your future ROI. So why wait?  Are you ready to join the insurance revolution? We’d love your support and can’t wait to welcome you to the team.",False

Nevertheless, to stimulate platform development and customer adoption, we would develop our own broker network, guaranteeing control over the complete insurance contracting process.  Two strategies are possible – the establishment of brand new broker companies, or the acquisition of existing ones. The first path is cheaper, but might require a longer planning horizon, as many licensing and legal steps might take a significant amount of time. Acquiring an existing broker is more expensive, but has the added benefits of inheriting the existing relationships with insurers and with clients. While the latter is important, we believe that releasing the value-added back to end customers (through the return of the “traditional” brokerage commission) would stimulate client adoption – especially in an industry where customer loyalty is not very high. Therefore, a good marketing strategy and an effective and intensive promotional campaign will be more important than acquiring an existing broker’s client portfolio.  Acquiring the relationship between brokers and insurers, on the other hand, is of primary importance, as it will allow a faster and more efficient operations roll-out. Our interviews with industry experts have confirmed that setting up the documentary and administrative relationship for a new broker might take up to a year.",False

How and why we'll use blockchain?   Given the lack of transparency and the resulting misinformation, or loss of trust between end customers, insurance providers, and intermediaries, such as brokers and agents, we are confident that the decentralized nature of the blockchain technology will help to recover the lost balance and will provide a platform, driven by shared data and mutual trust, while at the same time the clients may benefit from reducing administrative cost of the insurance products.  The blockchain sub-system of Vernam, is system of inter-related smart contracts.  It has two main purposes:  • Create Insurance Smart Contracts as a proof of the issuance of insurance and its details  • Transfer a commission back in the form of VRN Tokens  Read detailed description of the implementation of blockchain on the Vernam platform in our whitepaper.

InsurePal is a wonderful ICO in the field of insurance and it surely was inspiration for us. We are going to be targeting countries where the brokers have the highest commissions.

Our main goal is ""0% commission"" which I don't see in PolicyPal.

Thank you for the questions! Let me try to answer you.  1. Exchanges are a critical part of our business model and we’ll rely on them. That is why listing our project on credible exchanges is essential. We are actually negotiating with  some of top 10 crypto exchanges in the world and our top priority for the exchanges we’ll choose is security and good reputation. Hopefully soon we will be able to announce more news around this. 2. As you know, there are three parties in the insurance process - brokers, insurers and the client. It’s not easy to partner with brokers, since we are sort of going against their commissions. Anyway, there are smart brokers who are already working towards reshaping the brokers’ model and we are working closely with them on our model. Insurance companies on the other side have been accepting our project really good. We are closing a partnership with few big names on the insurance market which we will announce shortly before our pre-ICO. 3. Sure! We are planning on visiting 1-2 major blockchain/ICO events in the following month and we are also considering setting up local meetups with our growing community around Europe. We will announce dates soon.  I am really excited that you like our project and if there’s something I can help with, please let me know.

The Digrate analysis is interesting indeed.  The reviewers have pointed out lots of strength points:  - The team has studied the competitive landscape and described the project's competitive advantages - Blockchain technology is necessary for the project - The team described in detail the business model of the project - There is a clear roadmap - The issuance of tokens is limited - The legal structure of the company is transparent - The founders and leaders of the project are recognized professionals in their fields and in the blockchain industry - The project team has extensive experience and a strong track record - The project has a strong advisory board - The project founders have experience of implementing a successful business in the project field - The source code of the project is published on GitHub.  There are only three weakness points described and good thing is that we can and we will improve them all:  - There is no detailed financial plan. we are now preparing a detailed business plan we will soon open to the public - The project is not popular on social networks and in thematic communities - it is popular actually. We have more than 37,000 people on Telegram, more than 30,000 followers on Facebook and more than 14,000 on Twitter. We are lagging just a little on thematic communities, that's true.

Your interest to the project  is appreciated. Your comments, too.  Let us try to answer your remarks:  1. Vernam platform will connect end-customers and the insurance brokers providing services on a current local market. The platform will be initially operated by Vernam itself. Vernam will register its own insurance broker and   The benefit for the brokers will be that Vernam will deploy insurance companies’ and their applicable policies’ data to the Blockchain where such data will be accessible to the public. Thus any broker intending to enter and explore new markets will be able to easily research and later on operate the insurance policies offered by the different insurance companies providing services on the current market. Vernam will update such data step by step on the basis of the relations it enters into with the different insurance companies operating on the different markets.  The benefit for the end-customers will be obtaining insurance services commission-less.     On the other side the insurance companies will have more sales channels offering their products.  You can read more about the Vernam blockchain platform on page 24 and even about how we will comply with national insurance registries and incorporate them in our platform on page 32.  2. Our goal is to build the platform and enter into new markets on a step by step basis. We are very responsible towards our contributors and take Vernam project very seriously. Therefore we should consider scalability matters as well. This is why we intend to initially start targeting EU countries only. Also because we are situated in a EU country and this will give Vernam advantage to grow quickly and build strong foundations for the business worldwide.  3. About the German health law - I suppose there might be some misunderstanding. Vernam does not plan to have health or life insurance products on the early stages of our platform.  We believe that with the exponential development of technology, the  disruption of the insurance market is inevitable and it's just a matter of time. The potential of Blockchain adoption in the Insurance market is tremendous and Vernam aims to provide solutions to the public accordingly.",False
