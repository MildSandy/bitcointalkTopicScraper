Let me remind in Europe the cost of a developer hour is $ 30-40 per hour, $ 25k / $ 40 (per hour) = this is 625 hours of development (at least 5 people should participate in the development - a designer, a manager, 3-5 developers, depending on the development period. Not taking into account the additional time spent).  Nobody from scratch for such an EXTREMELY LOW COST of developing this will not make for you a fully working platform with future support. We have a base (foundation) for creating such an addition to the platform (The Social Exchange). Therefore, we are ready to take on this project. Also thanks to the new integration on the platform:  1) Liquidity will rise on the platform at the expense of the new service  2) Site traffic will be increased, due to ads placed on the platform.  You get almost 50% of the profit for contribution to the development of The Social Exchange worth $ 25k  PS: Initially, we had an idea to create a new token for this. But we went to the side of investors, and decided that we would share our team tokens as a bonus. I understand your interests, but we consider this in the long term, and we do what is in your interests, this is the creation of the value of the token itself!  Thank you for understanding",False

It serves basically as collateral during exchanges. PayFair is a decentralized, Peer to peer, crypto to fiat (and vice versa) exchange.

Exchange listing for HitBTC – Crowdfunding  Over the past 2 months, PayFair has exploded with growth, far more than we originally anticipated. It has been amazing to see the flood of new supporters and PayFair advocates. However, there has been a growing demand from the community to have PFR listed on larger, easier to use, exchange. As many of you will know, our primary exchange IDEX has been suffering from technical difficulties the last few days and has made PFR extremely hard to buy or sell.  As such, we have been in contact with several exchanges. We have decided on HitBTC as our first listing as the pairing is permanent and they do not have any trading volume requirements. HitBTC (https://hitbtc.com/) has a trading volume of over 270 million dollars daily volume and will provide PFR with an excellent opportunity to grow.  This is where we need your help! We are launching a crowdfunding campaign to help us raise the funds to list on this exchange as our remaining ICO income needs to be reserved for the platform marketing. We will be taking 300k PFR (soft cap) to 500k PFR (hard cap) out of the team allocation to support this campaign. Please note: the PFR you are buying is FROZEN, meaning token distribution will be on the date of unfreezing (1st December 2018).  Crowdfunding details:  Soft Cap = $30,000 (40 ETH) Hard Cap = $50,000 (66.66 ETH) PFR Rate = 1 PFR/$0.10 Payment in ETH = 1 PFR = 0.000133333 ETH, or 1 ETH = 7500 PFR Duration of crowdfunding = 30 days or until hard cap is reached, whichever is sooner  ALL funds will be used ONLY for exchange listings, starting with HitBTC. Should we not reach soft cap ALL funds will be returned, as such, PLEASE DO NOT SEND FROM AN EXCHANGE.  There will be full transparency throughout this crowdfunding, including where we apply to, the cost and what is remaining in the fund.  Q: Why is the team selling PFR so cheap? A: We are looking to encourage investors to buy PFR at a discounted rate,  much lower than what any exchange currently offers. But investors are unable to liquidate the crowdfunded PFR because it's frozen. So with the extra risk that investors are taking, the cheaper price is justified.  Would you like to participate?  Simply send ETH ONLY to: 0xCACD481f092CC7041296a003Fd3eb8436a74339a  We will log all incoming ETH transactions and PFR will be deposited to the sender address on the 1st December 2018. Reminder: Should we not reach soft cap ALL funds will be returned, as such, PLEASE DO NOT SEND FROM AN EXCHANGE.",False

PFR Exchange Update  It has become quite clear that the community, both on Reddit and Telegram,  find HitBTC an unfavorable choice in regards to exchanges. The initial intention was to negotiate lower rates; however, it seems the best solution may be to explore other avenues.  At this time, we are in talks with two additional exchanges that have both a positive reputation, low fees and daily transactional volumes between 15-25 million dollars. Due to the nature of the discussions, non-disclosure agreements are in place, and we sadly cannot go public with names at this time. Should terms be reached, the community will be informed immediately, but please be aware these discussions can take up to two weeks!  These two exchanges are by no means are only options. The community has been very vocal in regards to where they would like to be able to trade PFR. As such, and as promised, we would like the communities input on who they would like to see us approach.  We have created a Reddit thread here for your thoughts:  https://www.reddit.com/r/Payfair/comments/8i8nb4/payfair_exchange_suggestions_thread/  Please note: should an exchange be the most voted, it is no guarantee that we will be able to list.

For any exchange over 50M USD, the listing fees range from 100,000 USD – 800,000 USD. Free exchanges also require tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of legal documentation that takes months to pull together.  FatBTC is not the last exchange for PayFair to be listed on, but for now, full focus can return to the platform, referral programmes, and marketing.  Remaining funds will be used as a promotional activity to boost marketing and PFR liquidity. Full news will come out in the next few days!",False

Only accredited investors will be accepted at this point of time.  Advisory firm https://www.adviserinfo.sec.gov/IAPD/IAPDFirmSummary.aspx?ORG_PK=286399  Brochures of the fund, advisory firm and its owners  https://www.adviserinfo.sec.gov/IAPD/Part2Brochures.aspx?ORG_PK=286399  We have also proof of concept and proof of accept, but they are available only for accredited investors. https://www.investor.gov/additional-resources/general-resources/glossary/rule-506-regulation-d  The founder of Multifire Token Fund wants to show an example of how we are doing things right and and staying away from corruption by keeping it at arm's length distance.  Even accepting funds from a third party before a KYC/AML process can be deemed as money laundering.  We will ask investors BEFOREHAND to prove that the funds that they are investing are WHITE money.  We are only interested in those assets that the investor wants to invest in our ICO. If the investor has other assets that are illegal, we can't control that.  Some people could think that this is way too strict, but we want the highest quality assurance without being too perfectionists. Some day that can be done once a single immutable currency smart contract blockchain is fully adopted. The best way to invest in our ICO is a domestic or overseas bank to U.S. bank transfer or use the following methods: 1) Have a bank account 2) Transfer US dollars from the bank account to Coinbase/Bitstamp/Kraken 3) Make a USD-ETH transfer 4) Create an Ethereum wallet and transfer your ETH there 5) Transfer your ETH to our ETH wallet or 1) Have a bank account 2) Use PayFair.io    3) Transfer funds to our ETH wallet  PayFair.io is pretty cool. It's transparent, convenient and saves time (no third-parties or bureaucracy) and makes it easier to prove the legality of the funds according to their whitepaper and their already published demo of their service  is working on ropsten.com according to Payfair.io own statement.  If PayFair does all that it promises in its whitepaper (https://payfair.io/whitepapers/full_PF.pdf) (Page 2/15) we are probably suggesting investors to use it as a part of our soon forthcoming ICO in accordance with Regulation D rule 506. If someone wants to convert token ZYX or other accepted cryptocurrencies to ETH we recommend using EtherDelta. Even though their ICO has a bad reputation I have read their whitepaper and made my own conclusions of their competitive edge in the fight against black money.   (Transparency )  I have invested in EtherDelta's ICO because I am not a U.S green card holder or a U.S. resident.   DISCLAIMER: I own and manage a considerable amount of PayFair tokens and a small amount of EtherDelta tokens, but this is NOT an advice to buy or sell either of them.

At the moment to become a trust node, the owner must have tokens equal to $ 200. The escrow node must have at least $ 250 tokens. We will decide the future of trust nodes though. Perhaps there can be a fixed priced of tokens for a trust node. We will decide this via voting.  Trust-nodes support the price of the token, they make it stable and resistant to dramatic changes. The main pecularity of a trust node is that they are awarded for their participation in the system. Trust nodes receive commission fees for every succesful trade or deal on the platform.  Escrow-nodes ensure the integrity of a trade between parties (buyer and seller) Guarantor nodes are secured by PFR tokens, every decision in the ecosystem is ensured by value, hence the platform gets rid of bad actors.",False

Key advantages of a decentralized escrow:  1 Transparency of all the trades and transactions — the whole chain of transactions is copied in an encrypted way to every participant. You can't fake it, because every participant always has information about every step of partners.  2 High level of cryptographic resistance. It is sufficient to store personal and finanical data safely.  3 The flow of payments can happen in any place of the world without third parties, but with low fees and instant execution.  4 Technological advantage.  5 There are no age or any other restrictions or problems with signing up. To start working you just need to have an internet connection and nothing else.  6 The service doesn't depend on central banks, local laws, religion, politicians and other parties that can intrude and limit your trades. Even sanctions aren't helpful.  7 There is no financial censorship.  8 New opportunuties for business deals.  https://payfair.io  P.S.  - Work on the Payfair platform continues, soon we will publish another report on the work done.  - We updated the logo of the platform",False

The main objective of the guarantor is to ensure the fairness of the transaction.  Let's analyze point by point how it works (step-by-step sequence of actions):  1. Using the framework of our platform, the Buyer invites the Seller (or Vice versa) via a unique link. Using this link, you can track the current state of the application and manage it.  2. Further, the Buyer gives all the details and conditions of transaction and exposes them to the seller (or Vice versa).  3. The Seller negotiates with all the details and conditions of transaction with the Buyer (or Vice versa), and gives his(her) consent.  4. Once the buyer and seller have agreed on the terms, the seller sets the transaction state to ""requirements were met"".  5. If the buyer is satisfied with the conditions, he confirms the conditions. Funds from the Deposit are transferred to the seller. The transaction is considered completed.  6. If one of the parties (buyer or seller) was unhappy with the deal - requirements were not met, for example, they can dispute the transaction and they have the right to call for the GUARANTOR.  7. The guarantor is required to observe the rules of the transaction, monitor compliance with regulations on the part of the parties to the transaction. The main purpose of the guarantor is to settle disputes between Buyer and Seller and to exclude all possible risks that may arise in the transaction process.  8. Details of the work of the guarantor: to support the deal 3 independent guarantors are called, who evaluate the terms of the transaction, listen to the arguments of both the parties involved in the transaction, trying to find a compromise, to make amends to the deal for the subsequent unanimous, positive and correct decisions, thereby put an end to the dispute and proceed the transaction or its cancellation. If 3 guarantors can't find a common consensus for a certain transaction, the next chain of guarantors will step, also trying to come to any decision on the transaction, until the chain of (""3 in a sequence"") decisions is looped and the consensus is found.  https://payfair.io",False
