Triip Protocol Building the first blockchain-powered sustainable economy for 1.2b travelers  Triip Protocol is created by Triip Pte. Ltd - the pioneer blockchain firm active in Asia. The profitable travel blockchain startup licensed by Singapore Tourism Board was founded in 2014 and has since taken in $835,000 in venture capital funding and enjoyed nearly 400 percent in year-over-year growth. Triip has grown a global brand that travellers and respectable publishers like The Wall Street Journal, CNN, TheNextWeb, Forbes, Al Jazeera, and Thomson Reuters all love. Triip is also a board member at the Pacific Asia Travel Association and the official member of World Committee on Tourism Ethics - an program by United Nation World Travel Organization. Triip’s CSR project SaveYourOcean.com to reduce the use of plastic bottles to save the ocean has won top prize at Sustainable Development Goal Challenge 2017 by United Nation Development Program in Vietnam.  Triip Protocol: Answer the hardest questions in Travel Industry: Who will travel to Where and When? How to reduce the Advertsing Fee to almost zero? How to reduce Customer Acquisition cost?  TriipMiles is the main utility token in the Triip Protocol. It’s used to exchange data and value between Triip Protocol smart contracts, travel businesses, travellers and locals with a network of partnerships in 229 countries. TriipMiles (TIIM) can then be used to reserve 28,859,813 listings include 5,539,347 listings of homes, apartments and other unique places to stay, and get a 5% rebate in 137,678 destinations in 229 countries and territories. In additional, travellers can use TIIM to buy one of the 6,000 one-of-a-kind tours in 100 countries, global wifi data in 131 countries or purchase in-room entertainment as well as book local transportation and get other local services.  How does it work? 1. User Flow for Booking Travel Services: For Traveler: A. Register Account B. Travel mining with travel plan submission: Traveler can create travel plans within Triip Protocol app. For each travel plan submitted, user will receive 88 TIIM, equal to US$ 1, into their wallet. C. Booking Travel services: Traveler can browse all the tours, travel services, and promotions in Triip Protocol app. She can pay for tour booking with both TIIM and fiat. And when choose to pay with TriipMiles, the price is always 10% lower when pay with fiat. D. Post-trip activities: After finished the tour, traveler can rate, and review the services she used. She will receive incentive with TIIM for her reviews. By sharing and referring friends, she can earn additional TIIM with every succesful booking. These rewards are funded by Triip Protocol incentive pool   For Business: All businesses must be verified (KYC) by Triip Protocol. After completing all the business information, business owner can list his products and services on Triip Protocol apps. To start using Triip Protocol for Business, partner must top up into their wallet with both fiat or TIIM.  Business partner can use the matching feature of Triip Protocol for Business to create targeted discount for traveler based on their travel plan data. Once approval, their offers will be shown in Traveler's app according to their travel plan.  Triip Protocol Business app uses cost-per-booking model. Business partners only pay for successful bookings.  With our 2-way review system, partner can give feedback to rate and review the travelers. By reviewing the traveler, partner will receive 0.5% of the total transaction value (from incentive pool).   2. User Flow for Booking Accomodation: When booking accomodations, traveler will deposit the amount to the booking price with TIIM.  The Triip Protocol ensures that travelers will fulfill their bookings through the deposits and by rewarding them with TIIM sent to their electronic wallet app for hotel booking fulfillment. They can also pay with fiat at hotel and receive full money while checkout, plus an additional 5% of their total booking in TIIM straight to their wallet.  This mechanism will create a small the booking cancel rate compared to Booking.com and other accommodations booking services.   What is our unfair advantages? First to market: Bhutan, Type-A Retreat, Global Travel Entrepreneur Challenge (GTEC 2016) Technology: Our backend is Ruby on Rail with ready API allowing flexible upgrades and integrations to other system. Operation Efficiencyriip has been extremely capital efficient, leveraging on our core team and just US$34K in ads spend to achieve US$1.2M in revenue in 4 years. Lowest Fee: With Triip Protocol, Triip will give 100% of the TriipMiles listed on tour from travellers to local tour guides via TriipMiles, thanks to smart contracts automating transactions that bypass commission-based platforms, financial institutions, and currency denominations. We only charge 3.5% service fees from the traveller. Huge Inventory: Through our partnership with Booking.com, Triip traveler can book a stay and get 5% TIIM rebate at  28,875,236 listings include 5,782,338 listings of homes, apartments and other unique places to stay, and are located in 145,362 destinations in 228 countries and territories.

The Token TIIM is released based on the issue of the booking platform: Tour Approval and Dispute settlement:  Inefficient process. Like Airbnb, Uber, Grab .. Triip became the bottle neck to approve new tour listing.. A $31B giant like Airbnb still approves new homes and experiences manually. Everytime, there is a dispute, the company has to rely on expensive full-time staffs to resolve. Airbnb is struggling to add new local experiences due to their costly process. Traditional method like tour guide license from tourism board may qualify a person knowledge but not their quality of service.    Customer Acquisition: Monopolized by inefficient middlemen. We either have to wait for months or even years to be listed on TripAdvisor or pay thousands of dollars on Google Ads to be seen by travellers. It increases the cost of customers acquisition for tour operator, local guides,hotel owners…  reducing transparency and generating fraudulent transactions.  Cross-border payment : Still no massified and costly. Current we can’t pay our local guides in 100 different countries instantly. A significant margin is being taken by payment processors and other fintech middlemen. Our 3-day-after-tour escrow model ensures quality of service but it is not the best option for local tour guides  And why TriipMiles can handle it: A decentralized approval and arbitration system that approves new local tour guides, verify travellers and resolves user disputes. This system utilizes trusted digital fingerprint protocol on the Ethereum blockchain, with a rating determined by immutable review and scoring interchange between P2P entities (such as local and travellers).      A P2P Referral protocol guarantees not only that the travellers view tours and accomodation but that they actually book those products from suppliers. Hotel owners, local guides can pay directly to users that bring them real booking from real customers. The money saved by hotel owners, local guides is used to award users with TriipMiles token. The value of Triip ecosystem will grow when users using their earned TriipMiles or by purchasing them through exchanges.  A secure cross-border payment that allows two authenticated P2P entities to send and receive money that gets held in TriipMiles Tokens until after a successful exchange of services between the two entities    ",False
