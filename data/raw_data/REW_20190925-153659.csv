That is correct - there are project working on either online reviews (Revain, Lina.Review, BobsRepair) and those working on market research (Insights Network, Datareum).  Review.Network recognized reviews and market research to both be mechanisms of business-consumer communication, and integrated them in a sustainable tokenized system with balanced community and corporate activities.  As for our MVP - yes - a few days ago we released two apps that show the functioning of our platform. A very important thing to note is that both apps are decentralized - meaning that they directly communicate with the Ethereum Rinkeby testnet and use IPFS so store data. This was very important to us, since we've seen many projects that release their MVPs which have absolutely no blockchain integration. This way we show our ability to deliver and create decentralized systems. Of course, there is a lot more to do before we can release our public Beta (end of 2018), and then main net release (mid 2019). But we are pumped about releasing our MVP for everyone to try out, and are continuing to push hard on the development front!  1.

If they decide to shut down their services tomorrow, all useful insights would be lost. That is why it's important to have decentralized systems, where community owns data and processes.  At the moment, we cannot say how the token price will fluctuate, or will it fluctuate, in future, but what we can say is that Review.Network's tokenomics is balanced in a way that the demand comes from companies that want to perform market research, and token rewards are distributed to users, who can use those tokens for demographic review filtering or C2C surveys. That way, there is the constant flow of tokens throughout the system.",False

Of Blockchain” Secures $1.4M Seed Investment to Improve Broken Review Industry https://bitcoingarden.org/yelp-of-blockchain-secures-1-4m-seed-investment-to-improve-broken-review-industry/  Review.Network, a blockchain startup improving the review and market research industries that has been referred to as “the Yelp! Of Blockchain,” announced today that is has secured $1.4 million (USD) in Seed Funding. The funding, which includes investments from private investors, is being used to help grow the team and further the development of the platform. The company, which amassed 100,000 beta users and boasts a team with deep experience in tech, academia and financing, is also announcing that it will have an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) on Sept. 1, 2018.  “Worldwide, consumers often form opinions and make decisions — like where to eat, sleep, drink, play and even work — based on online reviews,” said Filip Karaicic, CEO and Co-Founder of Review Network. “However, as it stands today, there are two major problems with the review industry – efficacy and transparency. Reports and data have proven people are more inclined to leave reviews when there is a negative experience, which means there is not an accurate representation of all experiences; and that many reviews are often fake. However, thanks to distributed ledger and AI [artificial intelligence] technologies, we have figured out a way to incentivize reviews – positive and negative – and ensure their accuracy. We also figured out a way to allow brands to tap into our validated reviewer base for market research. This funding, which we’re thrilled to announce, validates our approach and will help us develop this event even faster.”  Review Network’s platform, which is outlined in great detail in the company’s whitepaper, improves the efficacy and transparency in two basic ways. First, they have a well-designed token economics system that provides monetary incentives to those who contribute in a way that benefits the community as a whole and punishes those who do not. Second, the platform has a decentralized community consensus system in which the community self regulates. For example, when someone writes a review, it is then validated by chosen community members....",False

A very insightful question! We are aware that point, and that's why we intend to totally separate all monetization from reviews. The way the tokenomics of Review.Network work is that monetization happens on the market research part. Companies use tokens to pay for market research and run campaigns, and those tokens are distributed between the users who provide answers, the Review Rewards Token Pool (from which the review rewards are paid out), and Review.Network Service Fee Token Pool (which we use to pay for the use decentralized services and other fees). So the market research activity as a whole powers the community review rewards, creating a sustainable system. Of course, at the beginning Review.Network will pre-fill those token pool to jump-start the functioning of the platform (you can read more about it in our white paper).",False

Thanks for the feedback - that is a great question. Incentivized systems can be very efficient in increasing engagement, but if you don't combine positive incentives with negative ones, than the system won't be stable. If you are only rewarding people, they will naturally try to use the system to their advantage. So what you need is a way of either making ""cheating"" behaviour very expensive or punishing those who don't play by the rules. The design of such a system is challenging, but also very exciting - it combines the knowledge of token models, mechanism design, blockchain technology and economy.  Here's a few words about how Review.Network's token economy works in that regard:  - Review are not validated based on sentiment. This means that a positive and negative reviews are treated the same. - To write a review, the user must stake a certain amount of tokens, as a way to show guarantees that what he's writing is correct. If a review is approved by the process of community validation, the writer (as well as the validators) get his stake back, plus a reward. If it's rejected, the writer loses his stake and it goes back into the platform's Review Rewards Pool (a token pool from which the rewards are distributed). - Also, to reach a decision weather or not a review should pass validation, a consensus among the validators must be formed. This means that those who are in the majority get a token reward, while those who are in minority lose their stake. The process of voting is blind, meaning that validators don't know how other validators voted until all of them have voted. - The validators will also be ""validated"", by the system automatically generating reviews that it knows if they should pass the validation or not, and then punishing the validators who are clearly cheating. - On the side of market research surveys, companies will get an automatic risk assessment for each completed one. The risk assessment is generated based on statistical models, and includes things like answering differently formulated question asking the same thing inconsistently, or detecting common non-attention patterns like straight line or zig-zag answers, as well as other well known psychometry methods.  In short - token rewards make users want to use the system, but the risk of losing their staked tokens if they cheat keeps them honest.",False

If it is right, how do you plan to fight against people who just complete surveys randomly, without having any real opinion? We know this kind of people exist, who usually just complete surveys at random just to get free coins/money/etc...  And another question: Will the companies who ask for a market research be anonymous? I think it will be very useful for both parties because:  1. The company who does the research will get biased answers (if, somehow, you manage to fix the problem from the first question) so fan boys couldn't spam the system with bullshit.  2. People who do reviews can't be influenced or paid to post only positive comments.",False

Here's how it works:     Exactly! We are very aware of this, as it is a big problem in any kind of quantitive research. We will use the tried and true ways of dealing with it, while using the blockchain for settlement.  Review.Network will provide advanced survey creation tools to companies that will allow them to create statistically sound surveys. One of those methods consists of adding the same question to a survey asked in different ways, so you can easily spot the inconsistencies. In case a company receives answers to a survey that contain inconsistencies, it will be able to ""challenge"" the user on it, who may lose his staked tokens if this kind of behaviour is proven. Of course, this may also open users to the attack of a company denying them payout even if they completed a survey correctly, so the companies will also be required to have a stake of tokens in the system. On the other hand, it would be quite tedious for a company to have to check each survey for validity manually, which is why this will be a semi automatic process implemented by the client side application (as survey answers come in, they will be analyzed for validity and any suspicious activity will be presented to the company to approve the act of challenging users who misbehaved).  Some of our team members are experts in psychology and statistics and they are helping us shape the solutions to this challenge.   And another question: Will the companies who ask for a market research be anonymous?  This is a very, very good point. Privacy in market research is important for multiple reasons - bias minimization, preventing competitors from learning about your activities if you are a company, keeping submitted answers secret if you are a user...  We are going to implement the privacy of data on multiple levels in regards to market research (reviews on the other hand will be publicly accessible to anyone). First, companies will have a choice of being anonymous or not. Next, surveys they create will be encrypted and only users matching the demographic targeting will be able to decrypt them. Once users submit their answers, they will also be encrypted so that only the company who created the survey can read them.  ",False

Using blockchain and AI technologies, we’re building the world’s fastest, most trusted and intelligent company-user feedback loop to the Online Review and Market Research Industries!  Review.Network directly connects companies and consumers, providing high quality top-tier market research feedback removing the middlemen, and directly rewarding users for their time and engagement. Further, users can earn tokens by creating and engaging with quality reviews across the Review.Network. Our smart recommendation system will allow users to find the best products and services quickly and easy.  https://i.imgur.com/nIxuVCQ.jpg  More than 100,000 Users Signed-up for Beta  We are incredibly thankful for the interest we’ve received from our community, more than 100,000 users pre-registered for the Beta version of the platform. The Review.Network Public Beta will be released by the end of 2018. and will allow users and companies to cooperate in order to bring better products and customer experiences to everyone.  Our goal is to build a strong community of Beta users, which will help us become a defacto Market Research and Review platform in the very near future.  https://i.imgur.com/WRYlchn.png  Solving Industry Problems  Market research  Under the current industry structure, market research is a long and expensive process for companies. The biggest problem is that market research companies face difficulties in adapting to the latest technologies such as Artificial Intelligence. Further, due to a lack of monetary incentives for people, companies experience low response rates and low-quality feedback.   Reaching the right demographic and cognitive bias effects are huge issues.  Online Reviews  The heart of the problem lies with fake reviews. Online reviews are systematically biased due to the lack of individual decision making and social influence. At present, data is centralized and stored behind closed doors without any visibility to the outside world. Further, users have no monetary incentive to put time and effort into giving the feedback that’s truly necessary for decisions large and small. Consequently, reviews often lack detail and can be disingenuous. Existing online review platforms do not provide detailed demographic filtering, which would positively impact consumers’ perceived online trust.  https://i.imgur.com/W8tEz9N.jpg  Review.Network is a Gamechanger  Review.Network is making market research faster, more user-friendly, cheaper and most importantly, providing direct, up to the second real data. Our main competitive edge in the market research space is that we provide live results and forecast research outcomes (hence, business decisions), as well as  using artificial intelligence by guaranteeing statistical accuracy. Review.Network has developed a unique token reward system (REW token), incentivizing users for (i) participating in surveys, (ii) sharing accurate and honest information, and (iii) responding to surveys in a timely manner. Review.Network will immediately help companies bring their market research to the next level, saving money, time, and directly tapping into the minds of the community.  Review.Network’s community provides a global online review platform for products and services across a myriad of industries, which makes finding the information you need to know fast and easy. Recent studies done by the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Chicago support our token-based reward system (REW token), which offers solutions to the selection bias problem and incentivizes review writers to submit more comprehensive and high-quality reporting. Our demographic filtering system saves time for online review readers, increases perceived trust and leads to better decision making.  https://i.imgur.com/U2Cpv2R.jpg  Earn Tokens for your Data  Under Review.Network’s model, rewarding users for their information is of the utmost importance. We value people’s time, and in order to be able to understand behaviors, and allow for the most realistic insight, we felt it necessary to reward our network with our native token, The REW.  How does the REW ecosystem work?  Users earn REW tokens in many ways, such as writing online reviews, submitting market research surveys and acting as a validator on our platform. There are also plenty of opportunities to use the REW token on our platform. Just to name a few:  • By using tokens to stake their reviews, users can earn even more REW tokens.  • Users can use their REW tokens to apply demographic filtering for finding customized reviews and information quickly - that saves time and avoids disappointments.  • And when you need help? Just ask our community by publishing a personal mini-survey! Select your target group, receive answers and information, and reward the people who help you.  https://i.imgur.com/ToB2jse.jpg  Review.Network App  For Users - We have created a mobile app for users, where they can write and validate reviews, answer surveys, and check the balance on their REW wallet. iOS and Android apps are fully decentralized, and operate on the Ethereum testnet.  For Companies - Our web app will give companies the ability to register, request test tokens, create and send surveys, and check response rates and stats, as well as receiving detailed campaign reports. The web app is also fully decentralized and operates on Ethereum testnet.  https://i.imgur.com/3Ij8K4o.jpg  The Team  https://i.imgur.com/lYm8Ahu.png  Vuk Popovic, Managing partner & Co-founder - LinkedIn Filip Karaicic, CEO & Co-founder - LinkedIn Reinhard Fellmann, CFO & Partner - LinkedIn Matt Yanofsky, CMO - LinkedIn Petar Slovic, COO & Co-founder - LinkedIn Ivan Ciric, CTO & Co-founder - LinkedIn  Advisors  We are proud to have these renowned experts advising our team.  https://i.imgur.com/bS4F4Nh.png  ElectriCChain, Blockchain Advisors - Wikipedia Ivan Bjelajac, Asset Tokenization Advisor - LinkedIn Timo Trippler, ICO Advisor - LinkedIn Malisa Pusonja, Blockchain Architecture Advisor - LinkedIn Bradley Zarich, Blockchain Business Development Advisor - LinkedIn  https://i.imgur.com/xCsao8j.png  Robert Golladay, Business Development Advisor & Partner - LinkedIn Christoph Irmer, Market Research Advisor - LinkedIn Patrick Haller, Financial Advisor - LinkedIn Kendall Herbert, People and Performance Advisor - LinkedIn Gerard Agimatagi, Operations & Enablement Advisor - LinkedIn Cris Misa, Strategy & Operations Advisor - LinkedIn Teigan Murphy, Talent Advisor - LinkedIn Mladen Dulanovic, Product Management Advisor - LinkedIn Ivan Goloskokovic, Machine Learning Advisor - LinkedIn  Media  https://i.imgur.com/PTyojQ7.jpg    https://i.imgur.com/pdZoCaf.jpg  https://i.imgur.com/Pc7kbz8.jpg    https://i.imgur.com/bngQKHg.jpg  https://i.imgur.com/fFCIakh.jpg    https://i.imgur.com/gvfWa48.jpg  https://i.imgur.com/lz8GzAe.jpg    https://i.imgur.com/rAjGQVq.jpg  https://i.imgur.com/LFujR68.jpg    https://i.imgur.com/w3sr18B.jpg  https://i.imgur.com/KrcQyd3.jpg Review.Network was presented with the  “Best Blockchain Product Of The Year” award at the iBlockchain Summit in Shenzhen.

The main difference is that Revain is focusing on online reviews (just ICO & crypto reviews currently), whereas Review.Network is a full-fledged Market Research platform. We focus not only on reviews, but on market quantitative analysis too (in form of research surveys). The important thing to note is that both market research surveys and user reviews are ways of communication between brands and consumers, and that is what we're trying to improve, making Review.Network a global market feedback loop.  Now, if we talk about online reviews specifically, Revain has a good system and solid token economics. But we wanted to do things a bit differently from them. In Revian, companies buy credit in their tokens, which are then spent anytime someone leaves a review about that company. Our focus was to take out the companies completely from online reviews, creating a transparent, non-censorable, community-governed part of the platform where people can discuss products in a safe way.  Companies can participate in Review.Network through market research surveys.  ""But if companies don't pay for reviews, where do the rewards for review writers and validators come from then?"" - Here's how it works - the main monetization method of Review.Network is actually market research. Companies buy tokens and use them to conduct research. When you answer a survey, a big chunk of those tokens goes directly to you, but the rest is distributed between special token pools, mainly Review Rewards Pool. The users who write reviews that are valuable to the community get their token rewards from the Review Rewards Pool. Review Rewards Pool is initially filled with tokens and able to start rewarding users right away. But then as time goes by and the platform gets used, it is refilled through market research activity. We put a lot of thought into this token model, especially to make it self-sustainable over time.  If you'd like to learn more, we're always happy to answer questions, and you can also refer to our whitepaper",False
