We call the BrainerZ platform a “skills-based playground,” where winning depends on knowledge, skills, and curiosity.  BrainerZ will create a new way for people to use their cryptocurrencies, letting crypto-gamers use their mental abilities to gain and expand their crypto-holdings in an online knowledgebased playground full of top-notch crypto-games.  The BrainerZ platform uses an interactive feed with a range of social games designed for groups, individuals, and peer-to-peer competitors. It allows users to play high-level games involving skills, strategy, knowledge and gives them the opportunity to gain BRNZ tokens – the cryptocurrency fueling the BrainerZ platform.  As a first step, we have built the BrainerZ platform on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing the generation of BRNZ as a standard ERC20 token.  We are presenting BrainerZ as a blockchain-gaming platform aiming to disrupt the knowledge-based gaming industry, from the classic trivia we all love to today’s games on web and mobile platforms. Blockchain supports the BrainerZ platform and experience with the trust, transparency, and value that the crypto-community expects.  Our whitepaper also presents our vision, mission, and long-term plan for making BrainerZ a leading online game platform and a pioneer in the world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.",True
