Quote from: CoinAx on November 08, 2017, 11:08:01 PM Who is the customer? Who want to buy VPN if there is free VPN? Privatix is not a just VPN, but an open source marketplace platform with own crypto-economy and POC products, where everyone can sell or buy related things.  But if we talk about vpn, so i can say that the problem of centralized VPN is DPI-based blockers (utilized in China) and data server’s IP’s that detect when you use a VPN. VPNs based on the Privatix Network will allow you to surf between millions of exit nodes at the best available speed and use advanced modified VPN connections that are undetectable by DPIs. If you choose to be a peer in the network, you will be able to pay for it by sharing your traffic with other users. If you get more traffic than you give you will have to pay the difference. Vice versa the difference will be paid to you.  Additional, you can check this post on Medium: https://medium.com/privatix/why-do-we-need-privatix-1213483c4139",True

And the bandwidth marketplace as an integral part of it. In order to involve more Agents in the network — they will need to be incentivized. The huge difference between the two of us is that we at Privatix do not believe that a consumer VPN alone can create enough demand for Agent’s bandwidth and therefore ensure good prices. Privatix will not only work on network and supported software, it will also create proof-of-concept products that will be built on the Privatix Network and will create a DEMAND for Agent’s bandwidth.

Obfuscation will allow us to mask all network participants. Our own token is not just for accounting purposes, but also to enable us to migrate with the token to another blockchain if necessary. If we rely only on ETH or BTC, we can’t do this, and as soon as something happens to Ethereum — we’re broke. And there are many technical risks out there as well.
