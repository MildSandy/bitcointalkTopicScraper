Especially our ""Authorized Dealer"" & ""Original Product"" badges will not only be stored in the blockchain and thus enable a full product life-cycle track & trace option through the supply and ownership chain, they will also be generated individually for each authorized retailer and each original product - shaped like unique fingerprints.  With a global trade in fake goods worth nearly half a trillion dollars a year (according to the OECD) we are convinced that our holistic solution will have an impact in the fight against counterfeits – the feedback was already great!  To support global brand protection efforts as well as to foster collaboration between brands and service providers, we also launched the Brand Protection Alliance the same day. Again, the feedback was great and we’re already busy onboarding the first members.  During the two-day event we successfully closed more exciting partnerships and acquired more customers, which will become visible as soon as the onboarding is complete, and the badge-snippets are implemented in the respective online shops. Currently we’re also running a pilot regarding the authorization of 3 local stores.  The authorization app is in closed beta, but will be fully released within the next week – along with bug & marketing bounty campaigns. A mobile app will follow in July. Press releases are being sent this week, blog posts, videos and articles will follow shortly. Additionally, we’ll be supported by our marketing partners.  We will inform you when the app is fully released, and we’re looking forward to your feedback then!
