As previously stated in this series, paper certainly resolves some of the most pressing issues with today’s outdated voting machines but a regression to exclusively paper ballots will do harm to the voting public our civic infrastructure is designed to serve.  Accessibility: Traditional polling places are an archetypal image in what we associate with our elections. Long lines around the corner, happy voters wearing “I Voted” stickers on their lapel; the image is repeated virtually every election season. This image, however, casts voters of different abilities out completely.  The Government Accountability Office (GAO) conducted a study of 178 polling places spread across the United States during the 2016 elections. According to the GAO, ⅔ of the polling places, both for early voting and during election day, had some sort of impediment for voters with disabilities. That number was up from ½ of polling places during the 2008 study. According to the results of the study, published as part Pew’s “Stateline” series, impediments ranged from lack of wheelchair access to a polling place to special machines equipped with earphones and other modifications that weren’t even powered on the day of the election. As sobering as these figures are, things would get worse if there were to be a mass regression towards paper. Traditional paper-based voting systems have little to no accommodations for the visually impaired or hard of hearing. Furthermore, the traditional locales where paper balloting often do not meet minimum requirements for accessibility as determined by the United States Access Board.",True
