How will we use Blockchain Technology in Real Estate?  Blockchain has become a mainstream buzzword in 2017. Many industries including real estate are trying to figure out how to capitalize on distributed ledgers, decentralized networks, and digital currencies that blockchain enables. One of the first ways that the real estate industry has engaged with blockchain tech is via sellers and developers accepting cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, at settlement. Going forward, a number of ground-breaking new projects are connecting every aspect of the real estate to blockchain tech in deeper and more novel ways.  How Does this apply to the Real Estate Industry?  The world is moving from the traditional closed storage systems where data sits in silos, to a world of open shared ecosystems. Think of the traditional model in which data is disseminated from the few-to-the many business models. In this new era, data will be disseminated from the many to many. Real estate will be ground zero for this disruption. The days of giving listing data to the central portal and having it sold back to us will soon be in the rear-view.  Just one example: you’re a producer in your region and generate high volumes of web traffic to your listing pages. You can sell ad slots and collect the revenue. These transactions can be done through automated smart contracts giving the list or new income channels.

The long anticipated CryptoNationZ ICO Pre-Sale was recently announced and sent shockwaves through the global real estate market. This project will set a new paradigm in the way real estate investing is approached. The use of blockchain technology and crypto currency will be integrated into the entire project concept. A fully functional Crypto Mega-Exchange will be onsite and available around the clock. The project’s token, CNZ, will be the currency used for all functions of the project and can be traded on the exchanges for fiat currency at the end of the ICO.  During a recent press conference, a company spokesperson made these comments: ”Building a crypto residency is our first and most important plan in CryptoNationZ. Initially, we will focus our efforts on buying and developing properties. Ultra-luxurious houses with a sense of finality in luxury and opulence. Once the properties are purchased, each unit will be hardwired with internet access, state-of the-art amenities will be installed and safety measures will be implemented ensuring a cutting edge, safe environment. This course of action will be initially pursued as a way to efficiently utilize capital and establish a reputation within the community. Future projects may include custom-built units. The most beautiful attraction will be the all “live crypto exchanges” in separate halls on big screens for our crypto community with five-star facilities.”...",False
