Rise Housing is a social impact company using cryptocurrency (RSE) to tokenize buildings. Our platform allows tenants and everyday investors to be able to buy equity in real estate, one token at a time, without any lending or interest rates involved. Our platform created liquidity for the current asset owners of large, multifamily buildings, without enduring the expense and wasted time of the traditional selling process. A currency is only as strong as its circulation and what it is backed by—Our security token will not only be used by large real estate investors looking for a cleaner way to liquidate. We are positioned to be in the hands of otherwise disengaged tenants and small investors, creating high transaction volume in a new global asset class.    Rent like an owner Don't miss out on the benefits of home ownership any longer.   Liquidity for property owners Let your property investment continue to help you grow.   Rise housing has created an ecosystem that will allow renters to receive Rise tokens (RSE) when they pay a little extra each month on their rent. All members of Rise Housing will have access to our platform that will contain the RSE wallet, an exchange to sell or buy RSE—On our platform you can purchase portions of actual assets we've tokenized and put on the blockchain. You can choose to pay a little extra and receive more tokens in return each month to start growing that equity towards a new home.  Each renter under Rise Housing will have the opportunity to earn equity, and will be part of our unique dividends program that is paid out to anyone holding (RSE.)

Instead of putting money into someone else's pocket, everyone will have access to equity. There are no loans, no mortgages, no interest, and no banks involved in our ecosystem!    Rise Housing (RH) has created a new kind of real estate market where blockchain technology is used to level the playing field. Our Rise (RSE) token will help disrupt the real estate and banking industries associated with real estate. Our ecosystem is designed so that everyone can have access to equity without interest, loans, or mortgages. Rise Housing will tokenize property of building owners to provide them liquidity which in turn gives them more freedom with their property investment. Rise Housing will create better renters by providing them access to equity and educating them on their investments.   Launch Information—  When are you launching? Our pre-ICO is set to launch on KICKICO (TBA)  When is the ICO? The main ICO launches April 1st, 2018.       Our plan and ideas are robust, our program and ecosystem are utterly revolutionary to how the world will see renting forever.  We will continue to be visible in our growth and be present for our investors. After ICO we will release our platform/wallet. We will start to acquire properties to show proof of concept. The properties that are purchased will have a property manager with already built in tenants. All tenants will become a part of the RISE housing ecosystem and will start to receive tokens for things like paying their rent on time! We will continue to acquire properties and provide equity to multiple renters in progressive cities and countries. Eventually, in phase two we will able to blanket property with partnering landlords, offering them the Rise Housing ecosystem to their tenants for a franchise fee paid by the owner of the building.   Do you have partners? We’re currently in talks with a few prospective partnerships that have goals that are in line with ours.  What if I just want to rent? You can, but now you’ll have more options to acquire equity as a Rise Housing rentee. With RH, you can now rent like an owner!  What if I want to become an owner? RH will have a platform where you can use RSE to purchase portions of a property. In our ecosystem, you can own parts of a property by purchasing tokens from a tokenized property. When you gain equity on our platform, you can use our equity projection feature to help you get one step closer to a down payment for a home. This feature will help you strategize your investments by allowing you to put in an amount you would like to invest each month, and it will show you a projected returns for the next five years.          How expensive is rent? We keep our rents right in line with everyone else’s. We stay around the competitive rental prices in your area. There is no premium that you have to pay for being a tenant and owning equity in a Rise building. The benefit is you now have access to equity without having to pay off months or years of interest first. As a Rise tenant, you will have lower transaction rates.  What cities are you in? We aim to be in five cities by the end of 2018, depending on how large of a fund we can raise right now. We’re going to focus on major cities that has needed RH for years. We’re also expanding overseas by late 2018 or early 2019.  Why are you focusing on multifamily properties? We want to tokenize a building that has multiple units to adopt the tenants into the Rise platform. The more we can help at once, the better. We want to create a better tenant for that building by giving them potential partial ownership of the building in which they rent.  Briefly describe your campaign and why it's important to you. Rise Housing is changing the way everyone can access equity in the real estate market while helping property owners gain liquidity faster and more cheaply by disintermediating the process of property buying and selling. By tokenizing real estate assets, we are taking the most used asset class - shelter - and making the returns from that asset available to everyone, without a credit score and without paying interest fees.   Express the magnitude of what contributors will help you achieve. With the right contributors and strategic partners, we will be able to make equity available to people who don’t have the money for a down payment, and change the way they live, rent and own forever.  The global asset value of real estate is $217 Trillion, with a global trading volume of $16 Trillion, we see a lot fo room for growth, and our RSE token being an agnostic coin for all to use.    Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and to the world. These three things are not going away from the man experience - food, clothing, and shelter. We have chosen to involve ourselves with shelter, as it is vital to the human experience and it is currently mismanaged. In the age of increasing AI, we see vocation and wealth both shifting dramatically, and to adapt and make the best of this shift, we know that wealth redistribution is key to a brighter future. Making equity accessible to everyone is the single most tangible way to do that, and in solving a billion people’s problems, we just so happen to address the liquidity problems of the wealthy few as well. We are creating a circle in the economy, where before the wealth flowed only one way - from tenant to landlord. And that whole circle is the bedrock of a stable, inclusive, economy, which is vital to the health of a currency. Social impact isn’t just something that makes us feel right, it is good business, and it keeps our coin circulating.      Our team includes executives in mortgage and securities finance, with over 40 years experience, both domestically and overseas.            Monika Proffitt, Co-founder and CEO of Rise Housing Named Top Women in Cryptocurrencies by The Women of Denver  Monika Proffitt is an entrepreneur, writer, and speaker with 20 years experience in community design and real estate investment. She is the founder of Rise Housing, a real estate company using blockchain technology to the address issues of equity access for tenants and liquidity for investors. She regularly speaks at conferences and universities throughout the Americas and Europe and has been featured in Vogue Italia and New Mexico True TV. In her spare time, she writes poetry, creates art installations, and goes on long, meandering walks through New York City, where she lives.    TIP: Make sure the company that you invest in is playing the long game by making sure their token  is backed by a real asset - not just a possible idea.     Tech General—  What’s the technology? Rise will be using blockchain technology to create an ecosystem on our platform. We will be tokenizing buildings utilizing the RSE which is an ERC20 token on the Ethereum network. Our platform will allow registered RSE holders to purchase portions of assets that we’ve tokenized to gain access to equity. We’re using an atomic swamp technology, so your token becomes more stable once you purchase portions of an asset. When you sell portions of the properties you have acquired, it is sold back as Dai token that is as stable as the USD.      What is blockchain? It’s a digital ledger in which transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are recorded chronologically and publicly. Example: It’s Instagram without the delete feature for contracts, information, and transactions.  How does it use blockchain? We’re using blockchain technology to keep all transactions public and confirmed. This will eliminate fraud in our ecosystem. By using smart contracts each property can be verified just like every transaction.       (RSE) will be the Rise Token market symbol Rise Tokens will be released after ICO is completed and after Rise platform is active Dividend program will spread out RISE tokens that are released from escrow that has a contract to the only release when we acquire a new asset. The escrow contract will release $1 worth of Rise Token (RSE) will be released for every $1 spent on the closing of an asset.     Coin Value— What kind of real value does the coin have? RSE will be tied to actual assets acquired by Rise Housing. Tying them to assets will give it a real-world use case. RSE has a progressive dividends program that is stable to USD. With the limit in circulation from our escrow contract, it will create a stable supply in the open market. When Rise Housing acquires more properties, it will grow demand for RSE.  How will the value of the coin go up? The value can go up in two ways. One, the coin value goes up when it is traded on open markets. Our targeted exchanges for RSE are Poloniex, Binance, and Bittrex.  Two, RSE circulation will be limited by the escrow contract which will create more demand and also replenish the supply.  What is the real asset? The properties themselves that Rise has tokenized or acquired—that you can use RSE to purchase portions of.  Can I mine the coin? No, all coins are released, but not all are circulated. An escrow account will hold a majority of RSE tokens under a contract that only releases tokens to property owners who tokenize their building with Rise Housing. For each $1 spent on acquisitions, we will release $1 worth of RSE from escrow holding to tokenize the building.  What exchanges will it be on? We are currently in talks with Bittrex, Binance, and Poloniex, etc.    Here's a look at our Rise platform—This is where Rise members can log into where their wallet is held. Here they have the option to keep their funds or trade with a fixed portion of their RSE on the open market. Rise members will be able to search for properties that we've acquired to purchase portions of that property which will start gaining them equity!                                    Escrow contract/escrow release protocol—  50% will be put back into acquisitions, operations, and growth.  50% will be spread among all holders of Rise Tokens (RSE) during the time of closing on the asset as dividends.  Dividend example—  Scenario:  5,000,000 tokens in circulation being held by traders and investors.  10,000,000 get released from escrow after stipulations of a contract have been met.  *For each token held, two tokens will be added to each wallet holding Rise Tokens (RSE) at the time of closing on an asset.       We have a dream to change many lives around the world, in multiple cities in multiple countries. For the first time, everyone can now earn equity back for paying a little extra for the place they live in. After their equity grows, they will eventually have the tools to purchase their own home. Help us grow this idea and change a system that doesn't help renters grow.     We grow, YOU grow.
