In the classic pump & dump we find the coin that suddenly, in about 30/60 minutes ago about 100% with an explosion of the sudden volumes, and then drop quickly 50% within the next 24 hours, until returning to the starting value, or also below, in the next 7-10 days; the pump & dump is immediately noticed, and it is better to stay away.  With Red Pulse we have had something different, with volumes and prices increased for several days, but they have always been driven; proof is its immediate downsizing of the same and of the price.  The only positive note is that Red Pulse just went up for a few days, and has been known or discovered by different people and investors.",False

The market has been very rough for most projects this year, and Red Pulse tokens have taken a beating alongside most other tokens. If you're a long term investor and a believer in the project and a price recovery you could consider averaging in entries at these lower prices. This is something you should seek financial advice for. But personally, when I see a chart putting in a long rounded bottom like Red Pulse PHX is doing, it usually makes me want to buy the new support levels to catch a possible return to the older levels.

I believe a strong attribute of RPX is the ability to filter out noise, such as: propaganda, fake news, and rumors. Speaking crypto terms, they’ll distinguish between what is FUD, shill, and real news. This alone, would be the goal of a small scale project, but RPX is aiming for the stars and this is only a small part in what they’re going to accomplish.  Per the White Paper, Q2 was when they integrated Financial Advisors, Money Managers, etc. to their mobile platform. I’d like to see who these experts are, similar to how they highlight the RPX team and Advisors, as I believe these people are equally as important to the success of this project. However, seeing the people leading RPX team, I don’t doubt that these participants will be less than the best. With 2 CFA designations on the team, I’m sure they’re more than capable of analysing the data on their own in the short term.

First off, I know that many of you in the community have noted that the Red Pulse Team seems to have gone relatively quiet. While we have been maintaining communication through our social channels such as Telegram, Reddit, and email newsletter, I do agree that it’s not the same warm fuzzy feeling as compared to when we were conducting our token sale and shortly thereafter.  But this was intentional. What have I and the team been doing in the meantime, you may ask. We’ve fully staffed up our product and engineering team, with capabilities spanning blockchain, front-end, back-end, infra/devops, UI/UX, machine learning, natural language processing, and data science. Not only are they on board now, they’ve been working at breakneck pace to build our new research platform, to achieve our vision of creating an open and transparent financial knowledge ecosystem.  On the marketing and community development front, I’m excited to share that Sombat Southivorarat is rejoining the Red Pulse team on a full-time basis, as our Marketing Strategy Lead. Many of you that participated in our token sale remember Sombat as our faithful community manager, and one of the key reasons for our success. Come say hello to Sombat in our telegram channel t.me/redpulse.  I’ll also be communicating directly with the community on a more frequent basis, via messages such as these, as well as quarterly Live AMAs to give everyone a chance to hear directly from me and ask questions in real-time.  Finally, Red Pulse will be conducting an Asia roadshow, with meetups exclusively focused on the Red Pulse ecosystem. The roadshow will be kicked off on July 21 in Seoul as an official event capping Korea Blockchain Week. On that day, I’ll be making a major announcement related to all the fantastic progress that our product and engineering teams have been working on, followed by stops in Tokyo and Hong Kong.

We want to reassure our community that the RPX token falls into Category 1: Limited risk. What this means is that a malicious person could potentially spend RPX to increase the reported variable TotalSupply, but without an actual increase in the RPX supply. We consider this to be of minimal risk and impact for several reasons:  1) The attacker would have to spend RPX, but would not receive any benefit in return. No RPX tokens would accrue to the attacker. In fact, the RPX spent by the attacker would essentially be ""burned"".  2) Changing the variable TotalSupply has no actual impact on the real supply and circulation of RPX. This variable was for ease of publishing the supply of RPX. Red Pulse team will develop a simple script that watches for any unintended change to this variable, and provide the accurate supply via public API.  All RPX tokens are safe. No wallets or transactions are impacted now and in the future, and users can continue to transact and hold RPX without issue. As always, we are available to answer any and all questions via our main social media channels: Telegram (https://t.me/redpulse) and Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/redpulsetoken).  Thank you for your continued support of Red Pulse and RPX. You are what makes our platform possible, and we are extremely excited to launch our new tokenized research ecosystem later this year, which will coincide with staking of RPX on the new platform.  Thank you and best regards,  Jonathan Ha & Stanley Chao Founders, Red Pulse",False

They had everyone update their company phones with the new feature. Lol. They integrated RedPulse into the employee portal. Lmao. Not the currency itself but the software. I seriously don't own RedPulse, you can check my posts . im not sure I ever even mentioned it before. But yeah, she's a crypto investor . and so are some of her co workers at the meeting. The convo quickly switched to crypto . she texted me about it today. So yeah, maybe I should pick up some. Listen, I understand I am a total nobody but I wouldn't completely dismiss my rumor or be totally shocked when you find out its true because according to their website. Rueters, and Bloomberg employee web portals can see notes from red pulse. So big names have adopted it. It must help them in some sort of way if these compsnies are wasting their time integrating it into their employee portals. So it seems like RedPulse isnt yet releasing all their major partners. This is just one that I know of. There has to be more we don't know of. At least consider this being true. I don't know how I'm gonna prove I'm not lying. My friend is definately not a liar. EDIT: Considering red pulse not releasing all partnerships, I can only,imagine other cryptos don't release all their partnerships either. Maybe there's a good reason behind this. Gives them some sort of advantage. I'm open to people more experienced in marketing explaining why companies don't disclose info like this.",False

NEX combines the NEO blockchain with an off-chain matching engine to enable much faster and more complex trades than existing decentralized exchanges. By establishing partnerships in key markets, NEX will be able to provide decentralized fiat gateways, addressing a major pain point in crypto markets today.   The NEX payment service enables third-party smart contracts on NEO to send and receive global assets such as NEO and GAS. As part of the partnership, Red Pulse (RPX) will be the first NEP-5 based decentralized application to be included on the platform. NEX will also aim to develop a solution that will be embedded within the Red Pulse platform, allowing for seamless purchasing of RPX using conventional credit cards to directly convert to fiat, and deposit to users' bank accounts using integrators on NEX’s network. This helps our clients using our Red Pulse platform, given that many of our existing and future users, such as finance professionals and industry experts, may not be familiar with cryptocurrencies and face a steep learning curve and slow adoption rate when dealing with cryptocurrency secondary markets.",False

There's a backstory to this; when RPX came out I believe it was supposed to be listed on Binance initially.  Long story short, somewhere along the line Red Pulse and Binance hit a snag and they decided to go their separate ways.  While I don't know exactly what happened, this situation is well documented in the RPX slack.   Now I personally haven't been in the RPX slack in over a week, but last time I checked, the sentiment I got was that Red Pulse was willing to let by gones be by gones if Binance did the same, but outside of that, RPX team isn't pressed to get a Binance listing.  I'm sure if you go to slack and do a search on Binance you'll get some hits regarding this.  Multiple team members have commented on this in RPX slack.  You gotta commend RPX though at the same time regardless of Binance.  A few weeks back they mentioned getting listed on 2-9 exchanges in a short period of time and I'd say that they've successfully executed that.",False

The initiative allows companies to share information which is then stored by Blockchain, so that suppliers, regulators and consumers can get insight as to how food is controlled from the farm to the table.  https://medium.com/@trade.io/interesting-blockchain-happenings-you-may-not-know-720bc736a49f",False

Chris brings with him nearly two decades of experience in several of the key technologies that Red Pulse intends to build our open research platform upon: blockchain, cryptocurrency, Python/Django, cloud, and mobile. He joins us immediately as interim CTO, as we continue to seek a permanent CTO that is based in Shanghai.  Bringing Chris on board now means that we can jump immediately into our near- and mid-term goals: 1) Scale and secure our current web platform to accommodate hundreds to tens of thousands of projected new users as a result of our shift from a paid subscription model to a free content model, 2) Build in parallel a Python/Django based web framework to replace the existing infrastructure and content platform, and 3) Incorporate RPX tokens as a compensation and payment mechanism for our open research platform.  Chris is an engineer and technologist with 20 years of professional experience in the areas of software development, system architecture, cloud infrastructure, operating systems, scalable and distributed applications, blockchain technologies, and mobile applications.  Being involved with successful software startups for the better part of a decade, he has successfully served as CTO for several companies, including the ""Flock multiplayer engine"" which was acquired by the social network MeetMe.com. Chris also teaches software engineering and mobile application development at the University of Applied Sciences Vienna.  Chris has been building scalable systems with a variety of programming languages, stacks and frameworks, and is a strong proponent of continuous integration, delivery and deployment as well as test driven and agile development. Chris has been a developer for the NEO open source community City of Zion (CoZ), which is collaborating with the NEO project on a number of activities. Chris has been a core contributor to neo-python, and recently built the blockchain middleware for the project imusify, which won second place in the NEO CoZ dApp competition.  Welcome aboard, Chris!

Usually when a coin hits an exchange after the ICO it's price will spike then immediately fall as everyone grabs there profit. It's a good time to buy when the price falls just after listing as this is just a profit taking reaction and is nothing to do with the viability of the coin - it may take weeks/months to recover so it's one for the hodlers.,False

Seems huge right? But in USD, its valuation as of date is just $15,000,000.00 at the rate of $0.0276 per RPX Token.  As of writing this personal research and opinion, Pepe Cash at 175th position in www.coinmarketcap/all/viwes/all has similar statistics (not comparing the projects. Just the numbers in general to get an idea). Whereas, RPX has the caliber and potential to claim top 50 positions from the very beginning with minimum market cap of over $150,000,000.00 and initial volume at $50,000,000.00.  If ICO participants were allowed to invest, then $50,000,000.00 could have been achieved from within the whitelisted investors itself. In that case, Red Pulse could have claimed 88th Position as of date in www.coinmarktcap.com (practically achievable) at the rate of $0.092 per RPX. One of the strong reasons being – The Demand and Profitability would still be higher in secondary market after it hits exchanges as Chinese, US and Singaporean were not allowed to participate in the ICO.  Red Pulse team must have realized by the ICO time that they actually undervalued the token and sold at lot lesser rates than they actually could have. 9 cents per RPX or higher could have been an easy target. Many other non-deserving ICOs have hit similar cap. Sincere thanks to Red Pulse team for sticking to and honoring the initial terms.  So, in my opinion, any rate below 7 times the ICO rate would be an undervaluation of RPX Tokens once it hits exchanges.  There are too many forces that can drag this coin’s value to $1 per RPX in short period. Below are the major mentions:  1.   Solution Red Pulse intends to provide: Specific, on time and quality data/contents over Information Overload to facilitate Investors to make radical and informed investment decision. Investors, both individual and institutional can benefit from this to large extent thereby attracting Investors to buy RPX Tokens for its actual use cases. 2.   Red Pulse is a proven company generating revenue for past 2 years with working desktop and mobile platforms. With all-star team and advisors, more are under development as stated in the road map. This makes RPX one of the rare ICOs unlike others those having either only idea or a minimum viable product. 3.   Red Pulse is supported by Strong Partners including NEO, Accenture, Binance, Onchain, Z-BEN/ADVISORS, Blockchain Partners Korea, Kenetic Capital. 4.   Red Pulse already have existing huge clientele base that will require RPX Tokens to access the data and contents. Red Pulse is also used by Bloomberg, Business Week, Thompson Reuters, Euromoney, Financial Times, Asian Investor, South China Morning Post, The wall street Journal. 5.   Content Creators (Generally Industry expert. Both Individual and Companies) with higher credibility shall earn more RPX. This will motivate them to create quality and on-time contents that will simultaneously attract more RPX Investors. 6.   Content Consumers (Investors. Both Individual and Institutional) will want to stock (freeze) sufficient RPX. Reason being; •   Investors with more RPX Tokens shall have more up-voting power. •   Can be on standby with RPX in stock to pay for the new contents to get early access. •   Temporary but exclusive access to contents to read it first. •   If RPX tokens are held in Red Pulse platform, 5% tokens from total of 10% inflation per year will be distributed proportionately to token holders. Remaining 5% will be distributed to the Content Creators. 7.   If an Investor is going to largely benefit from the content provided by Red Pulse Platform then each Investor would not mind investing in thousands to stock / freeze RPX Tokens to secure their spot thereby creating scarcity and high demand in the market. 8.   Investors (Both Individual and Institutional) are the ones who will require RPX the most for actual use cases. Knowing the demand, the crypto investors including US, Singaporeans and Chinese will rally in to claim a piece of the action which will increase the demand to next level whereas the market’s total RPX supply capacity at the moment is only 543,348,500.00. Supply is so low that it might be enough only for few hundreds of heavy buyers. So, the demand is going to be excessively higher than supply rapidly multiplying the RPX rate once tradable in exchange. 9.   Possibilities and Impacts: •   China’s decision that’s expected shortly will have an impact. If negative, crypto will find its way as it has in the past. NEO, Hshare, Binance Coin, Walton, etc. are the live examples. If positive then RPX growth rate will be exponential. •   Investors expectation to receive 1 free Bitcoin Gold for 1 Bitcoin held during the hardfork happening on 25th Oct 2017 is one of the major reasons that is centralizing most of the crypto investments in Bitcoin at the moment with Bitcoin domination over 55+% in coinmarketcap. Yet to see if it is really worth it or Bitcoin Gold will be another altcoin struggling for its basic place in crypto space. Anyways, after that, the investments should again start flowing into deserving altcoins as normal and that’s when I believe RPX will or should go live in exchanges. •   Another Bitcoin hardfork expected between 18-27 November 2017 was pre-planned on day one of segwit2x. Hence, should not pose any unique threat towards RPX growth. Depending on how the overall crypto market moves, all the altcoins are affected accordingly which is a different matter altogether and not specifically related to Red Pulse. 10.   NEO supporters are equally interested with RPX being first ICO on the platform. By NEO supporters, we are talking about significant numbers.  Traders, Holders, Investors, Content Creators, Content Consumers, Whales, etc. will try to buy at low rates from exchange but unsure if will happen as RPX should be the Project with one the highest ICO ROIs.  I would like to congratulate and thank NEO and CoZ. ICO Platform performance during ICO was as smooth as Silk!  Disclaimer: I am not paid to do this.

Red Pulse is a market intelligence firm that focus on Chinese stock market from event-driven perspective. That means that their aggregate information about Chinese markets from various sources, check their validity and relevancy, analyze them and then publish them on their platform in the form of short release notes. Event-driven relates to event-driven investing strategy, that is (according to wikipedia) hedge fund investment strategy that seeks to exploit pricing inefficiencies that may occur before or after a corporate event, such as an earnings call, bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, or spinoff. So I guess Red Pulse main focus are news about corporate events.  What are they trying to do now is to build new platform (or upgrade existing one), that would allow independent researcher, market analyst and so on to post their own research and earn financial reward (in RPX) for doing so. As far as I know this new platform is currently in development and the first beta version should be launched sometime in the first quartal of 2018 (so you can't test it now). If you want to learn more about it, I'd recommend reading their whitepaper, it's an interesting and informative read.",False

But it happened. Red Pulse didn't communicate the working of the timestamp for the second round, which they should have. Or they should have had a countdown on the site for the second round. Anything to make it less of a guess when it started. But it happened and it's done.  As the situation is right now, I think they're doing well. Strictly speaking, they don't owe anybody anything anymore. Everybody got paid their RPX up to the cap of round 1 and the remaining NEO got returned. There were a lot of people complaining about the NEO price dropping and they have to sell NEO (which they bought purely for the ICO) for a loss. That means they will not be generating GAS themselves.

A few statistics: 4,213 total refunds distributed Total NEO: 970,085 NEO Largest refund: 2165 NEO Smallest refund: 1 NEO Average refund: 230 NEO The refunds came from NEO address: ANFqwASLDLHeyz4PK4e37qCzsEb4dxZmAb There may be additional erroneous NEO transactions that are sent to our RPX sale address. We cannot control this. As policy, we will continue to refund any transactions sent to the RPX sale process until October 15, 2017 (0900 EDT / 1300 GMT / 2100 HKT), exactly 1 week after the start of the RPX sale. Any contributions made to the RPX sale address after that time will be considered a donation to Red Pulse, and will not be returned. As mentioned previously, we will also be refunding the GAS generated on the held NEO over the past ~50 hours between the RPX sale conclusion and the refund. All refunds were processed within an hour of each other. Thus as simple calculation, the GAS in the RPX sale wallet will be distributed to addresses that received refunds, proportional to the NEO that was returned. We will be refunding the GAS over the next few days. Again for those that had trouble accessing and submitting our RPX Purchase Agreement, please do so now. There is no need to submit again, if you have already done so. https://coin.red-pulse.com/rpx-pa-1082017/ Thank you for your continued support of Red Pulse.

With ETH ico's, the transaction just fails and you get your ETH back into MEW or wherever you sent it from.  What I'm saying is, everyone knew that there was a chance of the transaction being unsuccessful and the NEO being held.  The comments on Slack are just something to grasp at.  Even if there wasn't the block or timestamp issue, and everyone sent at exactly 1 second into the 2nd hour, most people would not get into the second round and would still be complaining and cursing Red Pulse.  That was the decision I had to make: Take the risk of trying for the 2nd round or cash out some NEO at $36 for another ICO.  I went half and half.  I don't mean to sound flippant about it and I hope everyone gets there NEO back ASAP.

Further, they were asked point blank - is it based on block or ""real time?"" His response was ""real time."" So what is one supposed to think?

Q: I was part of block 1,445,026, but I heard other people received RPX. Why didn't I get any RPX? A: That block was only partially completed when the hard cap of US$15m was reached. Your transaction came after we already hit the hard cap, and will be refunded to you.   Q: When am I going to get my refund? A: We are processing the refunds as quickly as possible. We are working with the NEO dev team to process this using a programmatic method (but not automated), after we have reviewed refunds. It will be faster than processing manually by hand.

If things will move on we will have to make some structure for this group, but first I would like to have a lawfirm that is willing to take on this matter and would like to represent this group of investors. After all cryptocurrency is not a daily routine for most lawfirms, however some have already got experienced cases in them which is quite good. Keep an eye on this thread, once things are progressing we will probably need people to somehow identify themself to the said lawfirm and a definite count would have to be made of those participating.

As stated previously, during this first period, the cap was set at 1,000USD (27 NEO). At the conclusion of this first hour, the cap was lifted to 50,000USD (1,352 NEO). Consequently, many people who wanted to invest more, waited until the second period to invest more.  People who contributed NEO as part of block 1445025, were not considered by the smart contract to be part of the second period of participation yet. However, those that were part of block 144026, and going forward, were included. The reason for this is because smart contract timestamps are deterministic, meaning that it must output the same result, given the same input. In NEP-5 standard, the code used is:  uint now = Blockchain.GetHeader(Blockchain.GetHeight()).Timestamp;  Executing this line gets the timestamp of the PREVIOUS block, because that is the only way all the nodes can agree on what ""now"" actually means, since the current block 1445025 was still in progress. For everyone that contributed as part of block 144025, the ""now"" parameter was returned as 2017-10-08 13:59:50 GMT, outside the window of the second period. When the next block 1445026 began, the ""now"" parameter was then returned as 2017-10-08 14:01:44 GMT, which is within the window of the second period.  Regarding automatic refunds, we were unable to do this as a refund function could only be accomplished with implicit transaction outputs. The NEO blockchain was not designed to have implicit transaction outputs for global assets (such as NEO), because it would bring a number of problems and risk to the SPV protocol. After consulting with the NEO core dev team, the next steps for them are: NEO will provide a trigger mechanism, so that future smart contracts can refuse a transaction upon receiving a global asset transfer at a certain condition. This way, there is no need for refund, because the asset would not be accepted in the first place.  For Red Pulse our next steps are to focus on refunds. I understand the sensitivity regarding having your NEO tied up, so I'm prioritizing the refunds above all else, and personally working around the clock to process them. I aim to have these completed within a week.  Thank you everyone for your understanding, and I apologize for any misunderstanding and inconvenience caused.

I work with ICO projects and help them through every single step in the process.  Red Pulse, you have done a good job but today you absolutely failed and handled the 2nd round ICO process in an absolutely terrible fashion. First and foremost, you have closed your main channel of communication to most investor on slack. It was not possible to join? What is this? This is extremely unfair towards your investor. You cant only give some people information that directly benefits them and leaves the rest in the dark. You know what this is called? Insider trading, by definition. I am sure this was not your intention, but you need to be professional and cannot only give them access to some and keep most out of the loop.  From a legal perspective, this highly illegal. You cannot change the terms and conditions and the contribution time shortly before the 2nd round ICO. You understand this, right? You cant just change the information. This is highly illegal, and if not now, you will have serious legal repercussions in the future. What is worst is that you have gone from a very credible and legitimate project in the minds of your investors to a massive scam. You have lost a lot of support with your action. You have lost credibility, you have favoured a smaller slack circle over others, you have broken your own legal terms and conditions. You have done wrong to the people that supported you.  Red Pulse Team, you need to take responsibility for this and compensate all of these investors that contributed on time with the adequate amount of tokens.

I made sure the wallet was setup right, went over the instructions numerous times, watched what I could as far as twitter, facebook, etc. They weren't letting anyone into slack.

It was their coin, their instructions. And because they screwed up, we suffer in terms of not getting red pulse coins and or watch our NEO tank before we can even get it back to sell it while they collect the GAS off of it. It was extremely unprofessional all the way around and if they don't make it right, I will go out of my way to ensure no one supports red pulse. I understand that mistakes can happen, and I'm completely understanding of that fact, but only if the company or person owns up to it and makes it right. However, if they try to be dodgy or get out of it some how to me that is the first signs of a company that I won't and cannot support. That's a company that lacks integrity.

The RED PULSE CEO should deliver the RPX from his reserve and developer's reserve to all members of the ico at block 1445025.

You can't use Neotracker wallet as Neotracker wallet is not able to correctly send transactions to Red Pulse smart contract. It lacks necessary functionality. In fact, no NEO wallet whatsoever has that functionality. As of now, there's no way to correctly send transaction to Red Pulse smart contract.  NEO-GUI wallet is the official wallet developed by NEO team (guys behind NEO blockchain). It is the only wallet that was confirmed to be updated and ready in time for Red Pulse ICO. The problem is that the update probably run into some issues as it was scheduled to released last weekend and it's still not out even today.

This email asked people to send ETH to a contract address. This was a fake email.  Our email servers, email list, and KYC information are all secure. The sender of the scam email appears to have obtained user information from a different project that was recently hacked. We know this because there are many people in our community that report that they did not receive this email, or received the scam email in a different email inbox than the one they used for Red Pulse. There are also many people from the other project's slack and telegram channels that received the scam email, yet have never heard of Red Pulse before.

It is necessary to use a special wallet ""NEO-GUI"" available at neo.org/download, or perhaps the NEON wallet if it is updated in time. Participating in the sale will require a special function to be invoked from the wallet, not merely a simple token transfer. The whitelist for our RPX sale is already closed.

So the Chinese are not able to participate in the pre-sale, but this creates even a bigger hype for when the pre sale is over. It will immediately go to Binance after the pre sale and they are also talking with bittrex.  So a few point that I think this will be very successful: 1. First ICO on NEO platform 2.

We will be issuing our RPX tokens based on the NEO blockchain and using the forthcoming NeoContract. Further details will be announced soon! Join our mailing list at https://www.redpulse.com to receive important updates.  Red Pulse will use the funds raised to establish a research sharing platform that matches consumers and producers, and let consumers guide research. We aim to disrupt the financial research business by directly and fairly compensating analysts and contributors using cryptocurrency RPX. Put simply, Red Pulse is the combination of Seeking Alpha and blockchain-enabled social network Steemit. The platform will initially focus on the China market, while our vision is to create a direct-incentivization ecosystem facilitated by the RPX token, creating a global community of colleagues.   MOTIVATION  China's economy is already the 2nd largest in the world in terms of nominal GDP, and 1st in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP). However, as a market for investment and industry participation, it remains incredibly difficult to understand. This disconnect presents a huge opportunity to platforms and services that can bridge this informational gap.  The problem is made all the more challenging to solve by several critical circumstances.  Research Content Ecosystem is Broken  The research content ecosystem as it exists today is broken. The economics of the research business has become dominated by a few key players in content production (sell-side research) and content distribution (major financial terminals). Smaller and independent research producers lose, as do all financial institutions, both large and small, that are forced into the ""all-you-can-eat"" pricing model.  Information Accuracy and Transparency  While sources of information on China's financial markets and industries abound, information accuracy and transparency are ongoing problems. A common theme is for China market pundits and reputable news sources to report on a market rumor in the morning, only to have it be denied in the afternoon. It's difficult to know who and what to trust, amongst all the noise.  Information Overload  As China has leapfrogged ahead into becoming one of the most mobile- and Internet-connected societies in the world, market information has now not only become ubiquitous, but well in excess of what an average analyst can humanly process. This information overload phenomenon, while not unique to China, has made the job of analysts all the more difficult.   WHY CRYPTOCURRENCY?  Traditional methods of transferring capital using fiat currency incur relatively high transactional costs (often ranging from 1% to 10% along with flat fees regardless of transaction size) due to banks and other financial intermediaries having to address counterparty risk and settlement and clearing costs. Using a cryptocurrency significantly reduces these costs, especially if the platform engages in a large amount of relatively small payments.  The blockchain ledger inherent to cryptocurrencies is a publicly-verifiable record that can be used to confirm that content producers on our system have been fairly compensated for their works. Research consumers will also have confidence that crypto-payments have gone towards research content that they selected, with a dependable system-of-record always available as an accounting of their usage.  Finally, employing a cryptocurrency as the underlying compensation for our open research platform solves the “cold start” problem: convincing enough independent analysts and commentators to contribute to the platform, while convincing enough research consumers (e.g. finance professionals and financial institutions) to use the platform.  In both cases, one party is unwilling to participate if there is not enough activity and usage by the other party. To solve this, cryptocurrency is used to immediately compensate research contributors, thereby seeding the platform with enough valuable content that would attract a critical mass of research consumers. With more consumers, the platform gains in popularity, thereby increasing the exposure to research producers, and their corresponding compensation.   WHY OUR OWN RPX COIN?  Building a Community  Establishing our own cryptocurrency allows us to create a common language and value system that we can build a community around. Ultimately, this becomes a rallying point, and will attract new participants, both research content producers and consumers to the Red Pulse platform.  Our platform also introduces the concept of research prompts, that allow research consumers to request new research content on specific areas, similar to a Request for Proposal (RFP) process.  Payment Scaling Issues  Major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, have issues with scaling, as each payment, no matter how small, incurs a transaction fee. As our content platform thrives on the concept of micropayments in exchange for small chunks of research content, these fees can quickly add up. RPX allows both content producers and consumers to keep a running ""tab"", and set thresholds for automatic or manual exchange to another currency, thereby minimizing the frequency of transactions and reducing aggregate fees.  Managing the Monetary Supply  Finally, by establishing RPX as our own underlying currency driving the content ecosystem, Red Pulse as a company can manage the monetary supply, which is needed to ensure the fairness of the cryptopayments system and research content price setting that is commensurate with real world compensation for similar work produced by professional research analysts.  Red Pulse already has an operational research content platform at www.red-pulse.com and iOS mobile app, and a prototype of machine learning-based market event data platform, focusing on China's markets and economy from an event-driven perspective. We capture major macroeconomic, regulatory, corporate action, and M&A and cross-border events that we deem to have the potential for significant impact to specific companies, industries, or the economy at large. Red Pulse currently have 50,000+ free newsletter subscribers, and 50 paid institutional clients, including global asset managers and top investment banks.
