We work in the mining sector carrying out mineral prospecting, geological survey, mineral extraction and processing. We bring together the mining sector and blockchain technology through our project, designed for global gravel production. Our tokens will be offered in an IEO.  We have created the smart contract and published it on Etherscan. The project is a participant in Oracle's startup accelerator Oracle Global Startup Ecosystem, in which we are developing a Blockchain SCM Platform to manage all our operating activities.

We believe in an optimal balance of environment and economic efficiency, that leads to a rational use of resources. With this project we are committed with the communities surrounding the mining sites to deliver not only gravel for civil construction, roads and railways, but also shelter, dignity and free move.  Our Mission  Development is an inexorable movement. Human beings are constantly seeking the improvement of their lives, the society and also the Earth. Housing is one of the primary needs and transportation also plays a very important role in society. Gravel is a basic product both for housing as well for transportation. In many areas around the globe there is a shortage of gravel and we are ready to help in this particular based on our experience and skills in the mining sector. So, we embrace the cause and make us available on behalf of the society. This is the main reason we make all efforts to settle this project with different positive aspects for each related group involved - the stakeholders.
