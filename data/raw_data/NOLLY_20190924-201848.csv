You are thinking of it in terms of a project trying to establish a new crypto protocol when it is an application token built on an open source Ethereum protocol that is well established. Far from being a money grab, this is a project to solve MAJOR problems in movie distribution in developing countries including Copyright registration; global distribution; forex problems and access to capital for major producers.  I am very proud of our technical team and know for a fact that our technical team are as good as any out there with proven products in the marketplace still doing millions of dollars each year to prove that they are highly skilled coders (i.e. MOBIMATIC APP BUILDER; SOCIAL DADDY AND CONVERTPROOF SOFTWARE). However, the fact is that blockchain experience of the technical team is not even the critical component in a project like this. Whatever technical work we need to do to actualize our project can basically be done by people even far less experienced that our team… because they are not coding a new protocol but applying a proven open source protocol to a new business idea. Instead you should be focusing on the management experience and marketing experience of the team (and our team would score higher than any in this field. Guaranteed)  So, with due respect sir, you are focusing on the wrong perspective to this project to create a new ecosystem for distribution of movies in developing contries  In case you are confused, our coin is built on the ETHERIUM BLOCKCHAIN which is an open system being developed DAILY by hundreds of thousands of coders. It is an APPLICATION OF OUR BUSINESS IDEA on a well-established blockchain that is OPEN SOURCE (meaning we really didn’t need the heavy technical stuff to make this work since Ethereum blockchain is well established and being developed daily).  Therefore, in a project like this where a token is built on an established protocol like Ethereum, what matters most is the BUSINESS CONCEPT and the QUALITY, EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE OF THOSE THAT WOULD EXECUTE THE PROGRAM. On that score I would put our team against any other team in times of depth and quality of experience. Simply click on each of them and compare their resume against any of the top names in the same ERC20 token class.",False

You assume African countries dont know about bitcoin or cryptos. Yet, Nigeria and South Africa, both african countries, are among the top investing in bitcoins/Altcoins in the World. So embracing a crypto project that is actually based on improving a movie industry in the African continent will be an added motivation to what they already do. In fact, thats why we CHOSE to focus our project on african movies and developing nations when we could have focused it generally on movies. We know we have a PASSIONATE and ready market to buy and push this.  #2. Cryptocurrency is a NEW TECHNOLOGY TO THE WHOLE WORLD, not just africa. Even in the USA very few understand and use it even now. For instance how many cryptocurrency platforms do you know or have used? Yet, it didnt stop people from buying it and driving crypto capitalization to over $500 billion at one point on CMC.   #3. Your question  also assumes that users of a blockchain powered platform even need to know how technology works. The nollycoin project involves creating a NETFLIX type of site ON STERIODS. They already use those kind of sites like iroktv.com or netflix  that stream movies. Applying blockchain to that kind of site is simply creating a new kind of site where you can stream movies that are loaded on smart contracts and use crypto as payment . Most users can relate to that since the platform will have a place where they can use fiat money to purchase crypto, the way they know they need to go somewhere to convert local currency to dollars to use site like alibaba.com and amazon.com that many of them have been using for years. So its just doing what they already do, but using different platform",False

I will try to answer them in order. We already have many of the great legends of African movies already behind this. Many will also be commiting to bring in their own movies on the platform once its ready in the next few weeks after ICO as i visit Africa soon. Yes I have contacted them and having discussions with many of them on a daily basis.  I will be having a Press Conference with some of them soon by first week of march. You will probably be surprised how many legends Nollytainment will get on board in the next few weeks. They are all excited about this project too because it takes the whole Nollywood, Africa and other developing countries movie industries to a whole new level.  Also, I have had prior business relationships with many of them an an Entertainment executive and Copyright Attorney in Africa for over 20 years before moving to the USA and after, so they trust our platform would be good for them. I still represent a few of them as a matter of fact so getting their support is not going to be difficult  We believe Our fully finished platform will be online probably within 90 days of the ICO and we are expecting to start out with 100s, if not 1,000s of movies, as we continue to negotiate with them.... This is apart from the original movies we will commission some of them to shoot exclusively for our platform.",False

If it's legit information that Emem Isong, Fred Amata and Zeb Ejiro are backing this project then I will DEFINITELY BE A PART OF THIS.  Is there anyway to provide evidence that these legends in the Nigerian/African movie industry are backers of the project and advisors too? Perhaps a press conference or some form of team hangout publicized will go a very long way.  I'd advise the founder of this thread not to ignore this. I see other responses getting replies so I'd really like one.  Evidence that people like Emem Isong, Zeb Ejiro and Fred Amata are indeed backing this project will be a huge confidence booster.
