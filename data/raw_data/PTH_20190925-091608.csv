Philanthropy isn't charity. Philanthor has dedicated only 10% of its work to charity, the rest will go into long term research into social good.  b. Like any other utility token, there is no direct correlation between the token price and the financial performance of a company. You are not buying shares and the value of the token is derived by the supply and demand and the utility value of the token. In our case, the better philanthropy work we do, and the more usage of the token inside the ecosystem (and outside in exchanges), the increase value of the token is expected.  c. We do not make the decisions alone. In fact, our platform takes directions from our members, who vote, decide and introduce new philanthropy projects and causes. It's run by everyone as a DAO collective, and not by a small group of people like in traditional companies and foundations.  Our foundation is being registered in France possibly in the USA as well, this is at first. And in the future we may operate in additional countries gradually to offer tax deductions to our members. Our philanthropy work will be global.  This points are discussed in more details in the Whitepaper as well as the token utility and usage.",False

With regards to your question:  1. The transactions will be token based and recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, therefore available for everyone to observe - creating full transparency. 2. Due to the nature of blockchain, it is virtually impossible to change and temper with past transactions, so fraud, human errors and manipulation of other kinds is impossible. 3. By using crypto currency, we eliminated (or dramatically) reduce transfer costs, cutting banks and other middle agents from the equation, making sure the recipients get the maximum of the funding. 4. In the future as more and more charities and organisations embrace crypto currencies, the vertical integration would become deeper, and more profound allowing them to pay suppliers, salaries etc.. over blockchain, which means that another level of granulation transparency opens up. 5. As for Philanthor, we'll be audited and we'll publish quarterly and annual reports which will outline which causes were supported and how.  WE hope this offers an answer to the question (?)",False

Obviously I cannot assure you that we will not fail, but I can share with you what makes me personally believe in this project and invest my time and effort in it.  The reason I have faith that Philanthor is not a facade using philanthropy/charity as a pretense to raise money for other reasons (from outright scam to ""just a trading business"") is that our team has already extensively engaged with leaders of charities and philanthropic causes. We presented our ideas and roadmap to them and not only received their blessing and their wise advice but a significant number of them liked what they heard so much that they took the next step and actively joined us to take part in the project as advisers. Too many of the pretend-philanthropy projects raised a huge red-flag for me because it was clear that they are much more concerned with getting people to donate than with the intended recipients of these donations!  Please take a look at our list of advisory board members at https://www.philanthor.com/#section-team. You will find among them leaders of charity organizations as well as industry leaders in fields that tie in to many of the philanthropic causes we plan to support such as health, clean energy, water, agriculture, pharmaceuticals and more. I have not seen any blockchain philanthropy projects to this day that did this kind of extensive footwork on the receiving end of the aid (and we are just getting started!)  Besides the credibility these advisers bring to our project, we expect them to become an invaluable resource to the foundation both in establishing relations for distributing the foundation's funds where they can achieve the highest social impact but also as means to engage in other parts of the same industries and open up additional fund sources (e.g. tapping into CSR programs).

Philanthropy is a bit different than charity; not all types of charity are philanthropy, or vice versa, (though there is an overlap). The main difference is that charity aims to relieve the pain of a particular social problem, whereas philanthropy attempts to address the root cause of the problem. An example is the difference between sending pain killers to malaria patients which is charity, versus educating the public in affected areas or supporting medical research teams in finding a cure for malaria, which are philanthropy.

Over a considerable period of time we have done quiet a lot of research, and had a discussion with dozens of future recipients who are happy to work with us, either as donations, grants or scholarships or aid. b.

Each one of our team members in involved in more than a handful of projects that are eager to work with us, so we have a growing lineup of exciting projects. c. Charity is only a small part of our scope (about 10% of the reserve fund) but we can see already various blockchain based charities, coins, or charities that accept crypto as donations. So we believe the trend will grow from here forward. d. We have seen a few other projects in this space, some are truly inspiring, but most of them are focused on building a platform for charity fund raising. Our focus is on the actual philanthropy work, specifically building an AI based Hive mind, that not only raises funds, and takes advise from the token holders, but then spends the funds for social good. You can think of it as a 360° holistic true philanthropy work, rather than just the fund raising platform.  I hope that gives an answer, and we'll be happy to discuss more in details.   ",False
