It is a connection of financial experience, marketing experience and experience in customers relations building. Plus we just love blockchain solutions. Inspiration came with long talks about the model, we have pivoted 23 times! And probably will pivot more, when the implementation comes.. Inspiration also came because of my wife, which told me to use the cards to grocery shop, furniture show, I already had my card for gas station.. I just had to make it simpler.       Apart from as an investment, who would receive the most value by investing in your ICO?   Its win-win, customer gets added value, while merchants get customers. All is modelled in blockchain to increase network and value of the token, plus make it easy for distribution and social interactions, and, what is most important, with no entry costs like people get in FIAT Money level.      How does TokenLoyalty differentiate itself from its competitors (if there are any)?  We differ mostly in attitude, because main players focus on technology. We focus on customers. It's like Mr Branson's inspiration - think about customer first, business will grow itself. Huge difference is in the mechanics, which we do not often speak about - in combination of market trading mechanics, FMCG trading experience, marketing automation, a lot of processed in one ""soup of the backend"".       How have you grown TokenLoyalty presence in the market?  We work hard since February, we have many opened talks, some of them we were able to finalize before ICO to show our effectiveness and determination. We are active on-line in the social media, as well as active off-line in meetings. Yes, we have limited resources yet, but that is why we are making ICO.      How is your team structured? What benefits do you believe that brings?  We have secured basic board - me as CEO, my experienced friend in offline sales as CMO and great e-commerce experience CTO. We also cooperate with two technological companies ready to ""deploy"" if needed. As for the social media - supports me my wife (with brand ""loyaltywife""), also we have team members from Indonesia, from USA. We treat project members like a family, its the most effective structure. But last word is mine .      What are the biggest challenges in the industry you have had to overcome?  Main is the lack to trust to blockchain in the corporate level - people acknowledge cryptocurrencies as fraud. So we have to put a lot of effort in the education that it is a myth and blockchain solutions are the future. The leap we are making is huge, so non-innovative companies require a lot of ""evangelist marketing"", which creates costs, but it is calculated in the model.      How have you found starting a cryptocurrency and trying to take your company global?  We analyzed ETH, NXT, Waves network and other. Waves was a good solution for us because of Waves NG protocol and easy to use mobile app, plus API and a lot of other things. But main thing is that the blockchain, from the definition is global, so we first look for international merchants (shipping internationally), while the network of people is created naturally. That is the beauty of this community.",False

Is it a security?  It is a typical utility token that represent loyalty points in the loyalty system. Token acts like a ""ticket"" to services, at this stage it is more like early access to the loyalty platform and in the future it will act as full loyalty point. Our platform will concentrate on marketing campaigns that will reward its users, but ticket are only confirmation of the identity of participation to the system (so there is no dividends, but still people get goods or rewards, but like in typical loyalty programs). Of course, merchants may define the rules of campaigns for the representation of the token, but still it is not in the element of a security, so we were careful on that and talked to 4 legal offices.    Are you planning to reach out to US investors?  It requires approx. 200-300k USD for research due to: - 4 patents on tokenization of loyalty systems - legal offices support - tax recognition  It all depends how much we will grow. For now, our terms and conditions forbid US Citizens to invest, but it is a ""just in case"" scenario, as we use external KYC/AML mechanics related to Waves DEX exchange.  What is your hard/soft cap?  Soft cap is not defined, because we have 3 scenarios of growth:  - if the budget is not collected, we plan to make an advanced airdrop to generate new customers (even now we are able to work with 150k customers for merchants) + we are securing partners (we talk to merchants who want to participate), we will make a consilium with main token owners. - if the budget is collected but at small amount (i.e. 80k USD) - we do the software ASAP in minimal variant and implement campaigns based on social trade tokens (so the dynamics will be lower, but it will be easier to do than in the first scenario) - if the budget is collected at min 2.7M - we plan to do MVPs in Amsterdam and Malta and China (mainland - we have partners there), and then we will try to get to ""Asian Tiger Countries"", but all business are under conditions to be global - so ALL users of the token will have access to their goods/services.  Hard cap is defined by relation to Waves, here you have the token table:  https://tokenloyalty.io/files/TokenDetails.pdf  How many tokens do you plan to create? And how many from them will you sell during ICO?  As in the link above (approx. 70M tokens created). There is progressive model of sale (because the second goal is to have token holders), so:  1. First phase was airdrop to create a ""small market"" of tokens as a research for the project + to have initial customers to show to initial merchants we talk to (it is very important to show the merchants the mechanics plus encourage people to use the token) 2. ICO phase is divided into different prices, increasingly, so it is defined as with discount, but this discount does not affect the end price, which is important for long-term thinking as we have.  Did the team work on other projects before?   yes, we have a very experienced team plus we have an own business experience, for example: - our CTO worked for a very large polish e-commerce corporation, workked in Germany, and other countries - our CMO worked in offline with FMCG industry, traded with Russians, Chinese, British People - I have a huge experience in the financial market, I had an own (co-ownership) VC which was sold We have also international bounties-team support, those people are invited to work after ICO with us if we have budget (they are doing a great job).  What projects did you do before (as a CEO)?  For example: - Internet Group SA (by ex co-owner of eFund SA; apport process for the sale of assets, as a Supervisory Board Member) - public listed company. - Cada Casa systems (I co-started the project as general manager in Poland, we got even prize of the Polish Chamber of Commerce, this project works in Poland, Russia and Germany, we cooperate also with Algeria, France, Italy) - Krauck Systems for Poland (co-implementation on Polish market - first phase of implementation, cooperating with Innox Nova and Estom) - TechnoBoard (ex co-owner)  best regards, Gregory.",False

But has to bring something into the ecosystem, like access to goods/services with discounts or budget for the campaign. So simple. We have now open talks with networks that have 40M+ customers in China (electronics send worldwide), 16M+customers in insurance sector, 5M customers in FMCG sector. Talks are open yet, but the family is growing, because no one looses. This way I want to bring as many services and goods as possible to my community — I want my customers to feel good and secure.  Summarizing: 1. We are looking for partnerships with project that offer goods or services and are at least in a progress that they will launch this products/services in maximum 6 months 2. We are happy to make cross-promotion, cross-selling - we just want to ADD A LAYER our loyalty system into basic layer of such project 3. We are open to talk on any kind of projects 4.

There is maximal volume of 70k tokens in the trade, however people trade only micro amounts. The total supply of tokens will be 70 million, so one can see it is marginal. But it was very important to do the airdrop - people notice the project this way. AND WE GOT FIRST CUSTOMERS when the platform starts.  Look it on the other way:  DEX is an integrated exchange in the Waves network. ANY asset that is made may be traded in just seconds after its creation (but doesn't have to). For the exchange there has to be a demand an supply (like in other exchanges). So when people got tokens on airdrop, then the potential supply occurred, because SOME of the people may want to sell the token before the ico. HOWEVER, this supply is limited (that is why airdrop was limited to 70k not to influence the ICO). And - what shows good for the project - internal prices before the ICO are bigger then our price for the ICO. DEX is a self-regulating market. What it means in practice? ANYONE who participates in BOUNTIES has a GUARANTEE that the token is in TRADE. Because there is an exchange in the blockchain AS DEFAULT.",False

First reason is it is unusual, then company still have to explain about how its work for their customers. Whereas company did not need to do that if they using ""old system"". In the customers side this is may be a new things to 'accept'.  A: There are solutions like Lioness basing on “charge-back” model. Also there are known some simple solutions to use the token as loyalty point. However, our business model was discussed with entities and bases on unique “nominal” and “added” value. For our partners most important is control of the budget and integration of marketing solution, social mechanics and loyalty program itself. Our advantage is that we can treat token users as leads for the campaigns, while preserving their anonymity. This is unique. Most of the loyalty campaigns are treated as cost, because each cost of user is approximately 5-60 USD per person. That is why most of such program base on trade of data of the user. We want to change that. But for this was required a win-win strategy. We will offer a marketing tool to ENGAGE users of the token as community in life of the brand (gamification mechanics), but users will be paid with tokens and the added value, depending on the campaign (for example discount codes or free gifts). That is why we call it “pay for the effort”. But in this model, it does not state a cost for the merchant, because he receives an added value, for example – one customer can generate 3-10 more customers, which gives ROI for the marketing campaign. We do not want to show all the cards during ICO, as there is a slight risk that competition may copy the model. In talks with merchants there has to be a proof of concept – that is why we plan initial campaign (2-5) basing on the model. When the community grows, it we will be more and more attractive each time, because ANY MERCHANTS creates BIGGER ENVIRONMENT, so entry costs (barriers for campaigns creation) are lowered each time.",False

It is the thing that is given by the merchant as bonus.  Example USE CASES - It is best shown on examples:   Example campaign 0   Example: token as money  Bonus card: You have a Bonus Card that is integrated with payment card. While purchasing goods you just collect tokens on it. You can do anything with them thanks to integration of our system with payment processor (use the Bonus Card as payment card).  Application: You can collect points and make transactions through NFC protocol  Example campaign 1   Token as money  Under the bottle cap of Soda Drink is a code for registration on the LYT your life platform. You enter the code and receive 1 LYT equal to 300 campaign points (CP) or 40 cents. You can sell the token on exchanges or collect more tokens. After collection of 1500 CP (=5 tokens) you can exchange it into coffee. This means you bought coffee for 2USD, while normally it costs 3.75. You could also sell the tokens to get only 2USD.  Example campaign 2   Example: token as a proof of participation  You lock your token into campaign receiving a special coupon code for 10% discount in Example Network Shops to buy anything you want. This coupon is valid for 1 day. After it is released and campaign is locked/finished (so the token proves that you are a participant of the campaign, not a ghost).  Example campaign 3   Example: token socialization  You enter initial campaign that gives tokens for invitation of friends into the campaign. You receive the tokens (you are payed for the leads – this is so called in marketing) together with a special bonus (20 days access to music platform), while your friends receive 10 day access each (but without tokens).  Example campaign 4   Example: socialization as group purchase  You and your friends (7 friends) refuel your car on a Specified Gas Station that has open loyalty program. But you do it rather not so often. You have collected 100 LYT, but together with your friends you have collected totally 1230 LYT. At the present nominal value it is 492 USD. You can cash-out. Or You can buy a huge group dinner for 8 people in a restaurants that has another open campaign that uses tokens (for example the campaign offers such dinner for 200 LYTs).

Someone also has to realize the idea in form of a team, a structure. That is why we will form a company. Decentralized Loyalty company will be based on the marketing agency model, together with an idea of loyalty points operator. What does it mean? This means that we will operate like a marketing agency in communication between merchants and participants of the campaigns in cases that are not automated on the platform. The difference is that loyalty points will be based on blockchain in form of tokens, which gives a decentralized model for their distribution and maintenance, as well as usage (o this is free for merchants as “no entry costs”). However, our company will be the consulting agency in relation to the campaign issuer, which gives ability to earn on such services additionally (for example complex or mixed campaigns over the network, connecting 10 or more partners, etc.). Such approach of “campaign as a service” gives more elasticity for scaling to new countries and areas and its potential will grow together with the increase of the network. What is the best example to compare the model? In ads based on words from the most common supplier, merchants pay for the effect in form of CPC or CPV, etc. In our case, merchant will pay for the desired effect – to give the prize to new or existing customer to sustain loyalty, including our commission for the company for further development.

The amount from token sale will enable to the project at minimal, defined variants. So this is equal to mechanism with bonuses or minimal cap in smart contracts. But project has much higher potential, so more tokens have higher price, reaching up to 0.1 Waves. It would be economically unreasonable to sell the tokens during the ICO (by users), as we believe in their value growth. But early adopters will have such opportunity. This creates the liquidity of the market. Why we choose this mechanics? Because it highly differences from the “bonuses” model made in smart contracts. Mostly in smart contracts tokens are held until the end of ICO and then there are made “drops”. Because the volume of tokens with bonuses is made often high, due to the law of “demand and supply” the tokens often drop their value even 5-10 times than the actual value should be. This destroys the market. With start price of 0.09 Waves, there is high probability (if someone will not dump lower then he bought to troll the project) that the price WILL NOT DROP lower than this value 0.09. And with each campaign, depending on the negotiated model with merchants, these merchants will require tokens for the campaigns. So they will have to buy them from the market. As the law of “demand and supply” states, when merchants generate demand, the price should increase. We have analyzed 3 models for that and this one is really one of the best ones to secure our token holders from price drops. Bounty holders of tokens will receive them AFTER the ICO, it is another element of this security. The team will be distributed with tokens in at least one-year motivation plan. But as the business model of the project shows – it should be profitable to hold the tokens to enter the campaigns. However, speculation is the characteristic of the crypto market, so we calculate the risk, trying to secure token holders from value drops as much as we can.",False

We are not just a loyalty program. We integrate financial possibilities (like Lyoness), marketing (like Adwords and lead generation through Facebook), gamification mechanisms (Loyalty is based on activities) and in the end - cryptocurrency advantages.  2. Our main difference is in the approach of the nominal value of the token (like on exchanges) and added value (the one related to campaigns, like gifts, groceries, discounts, anything). It means tokenization of the loyalty system.  3. integration with normal services - API built as an Overlay to the blockchain to integrate ANY services of merchants (like a bridge between loyalty network and services).",False
