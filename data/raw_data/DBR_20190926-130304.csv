The DBRAIN platform is a platform based on Blockchain designed to offer artificial intelligence applications to individuals with smartphone capabilities to provide easy and reliable use for you. As a result of the great effort of teaching data that 80% of artificial intelligence is made up of data and planned to be transferred to the machine, this corresponds to a long time period and we face temporal problems. The DBRAIN platform has initiated this probing solution process. For experts and field workers in the data field, we have developed a tool to simply transfer the natural data to be translated into machine power. the hard work on this side was removed and the transactions were made faster and easier.  System Working Principle The DBRAIN platform provides a fair revenue distribution feature with a blockchain base and its own DBR token, which provides transparent use. The reliability of the system is also ensured. DBR is an official token that provides services to you while using artificial intelligence in the system. Another application included in the system in the name of security measures is the PICARD application. this application provides data confidentiality so that private data and income can be controlled in the future. The DBRAIN platform will form a scalable basis to increase the accessibility of systems with high quality ratios in the artificial intelligence field. DBRAIN stands out with many convenience and security measures. This platform brings together many applications such as object detection, face recognition, classification, voice recognition, data analysis.  As a result, we will evaluate the project in general terms; The DBRAIN platform has become a very important application for artificial intelligence, and it has become important for the participants to keep their expectations at a high level.",False
