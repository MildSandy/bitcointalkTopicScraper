We designed our token sale to be like our exchange: Simple, reliable and transparent. And we even give you a Money Back Guarantee.  The Basics Name: XS2 Token Ticker symbol: XS2 Total supply: 20,000,000 XS2 For sale: 5,000,000 XS2 Sale period: 15th October — 15th of November (or until sold out) Price: 0.1 BTC for 5,000 XS2  Sign-up bonus of 100 XS2 tokens for the first 1,000 customers. Sign-up bonus of 10 XS2 tokens for the next 100,000 customers.  Referral bonus of 25%.  See the full promotion terms for more details.  100% Return Guarantee Not happy with your XS2 tokens? No problem, you can return any unused tokens you bought for the BTC you paid at anytime before the 1st of May 2019.  What is the XS2 Exchange? We’re a Sydney based crypto wallet and exchange listing over 60 tokens including BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC, XLM, NEO, DOGE and many tokens on Ethereum and Stellar. Our base trading fee is only 0.1% and our withdrawal network fees are basically at cost, many times cheaper than most exchanges.  The XS2 Exchange Our exchange is live and available at https://xs2.exchange or through our mobile apps on the App Store and Google Play.  We are focused on security, simplicity and transparency. The exchange is developed in-house, from the ground up with security and simplicity in mind.  We are a self funded team of proven industry veterans in our fields. We all love crypto and blockchain technology and the promise it holds.  XS2 is committed to compliance with all applicable laws and to operate at best industry standards. We are registered with AUSTRAC as a Digital Currency Exchange and Independent Remittance Dealer and are a member of the Australian Digital Commerce Association (ADCA).  What can I do with XS2 Tokens? Holding XS2 Tokens (staking) will reduce trading fees. For every 100 tokens you hold in the exchange, your trading fees are reduced by 1%. Holding 10.000 XS2 makes trading completely free!  Trading fees can also be paid in XS2. To reward Customers using XS2 tokens to pay transaction fees, the current value of XS2 token is doubled — creating an effective discount of 50% applied to the trading fee.  For example, Alice holds 2,000 XS2, her trading fee discount is 20%. Her trading fee would be 0.08%, which is the 0.1% base trading fee, minus the 20% discount. Alice does a trade of 10 BTC. Her trading fee is 10 BTC x 0.08% = 0.008 BTC. The last price of XS2 tokens is 0.001 BTC per token. Therefore she needs 8 XS2 tokens to pay the fee. But paying with XS2 gives her a 50% discount, so she only pays 4 XS2 in fees. Used/Returned Token Burning We consider XS2 Tokens used to pay trading fees or returned through our Buy Back Guarantee as spent or used. We will not resell these tokens, so we will simply burn/destroy them (except for any taxes payable).  How do I buy XS2 tokens? First you’ll have to sign up to the XS2 exchange and verify your email and phone number. Residents of USA and China as well as some other countries are restricted from buying XS2 Tokens.  Once the Token Sale starts, there will be a banner on the site to the Token Sale page. You can use the BTC in your XS2 Exchange account to buy the XS2 tokens.  The tokens will be available instantly in your wallet. They can be transferred, used or returned straight away.  Each customer can only buy a maximum of 5,000 XS2. If you want to get more, you can refer your friends to get extra tokens.  XS2 Referral Program If you refer your friends to XS2, you will receive 25% bonus tokens for FREE (based on the sign-up bonus and the tokens your friend buys).  Roadmap We don’t keep an official roadmap, because crypto is a constantly evolving space. Our current plans include:  Keep adding tokens and support for more chains. Some chains we are looking at are ADA, NEM, EOS, ONT, TRX, VET, XTZ, etc. We’re also looking into stablecoins, such as USDT, TUSD and DAI. Support fiat (USD/EUR/AUD/etc) deposits/withdrawals and trading. We can do this directly or through partners. Enable the sending of tokens to a friend using email/phone/etc. instead of long crypto addresses. Enable free transfers between XS2 Exchange accounts. Enable the ability to create a wallet for any token. This allow you to keep your entire portfolio in one place. Connect with decentralised exchanges/liquidity platforms like Bancor/0x. Adding merchant services to help merchants easily accept payment in crypto and hold or regularly convert into fiat. In the long term, when the technology is mature enough, we consider moving to a decentralised or hybrid exchange model. What? Why are you selling the tokens so cheap? Two reasons. Firstly, our goal isn’t to raise funds, this isn’t an ICO. Our goal is to rewards our customers for their loyalty in using our exchange to trade. Secondly we strongly believe that many projects that issue tokens are selling their tokens too expensively and are overvalued.  Why don’t you have a fancy token sale website? Our focus is on creating the most secure, reliable and easiest to use crypto wallet and exchange in the world. Fancy graphics, videos, a long list of “advisors”, announcing “partnerships” and flashy banner ads don’t make our exchange better. Great service, fair pricing, solid design and hard work does. So that’s what we do at XS2, run a terrific service that works.  Questions? If you have any other questions, drop us a line at support@xs2.exchange. We’re here to help.",False
