What is Obizcoin BOT? With the progression in technology, Obizcoin managed to take its officially fruitful plan of action to another level of up and coming decentralized revolution by creating Knowledge BOT with the assistance of blockchain and AI innovation. This new arrangement is called ‚ÄúObizcoin BOT‚Äù. Obizcoin wanted to use YRCs domain mastery and rich industry experience by incorporating it into BOT through Artificial Intelligence and blockchain innovation. This according to Obizcoin would help eliminate time required for innovative work of each area as YRC has officially created Intellectual Property of more than 10 domains that they are as of now obliging. This BOT might accelerate the turnaround time from advancement to deals. As once the innovation of BOT is prepared, the deals can begin with the current domains.  BOT is equipped for creating and improvising business forms with the assistance of AI and Ethereum Blockchain Technology. Perpetual upgrade in Business knowledge is supposed to make the BOT more intelligent every day, which should in the end augment to the procedure enlisted. Bot developed by Obizcoin has many capabilities which it adheres to like the process design and decision, SWOT system and smart contract and lastly auditing and reward systems. This makes the Bot artificially intelligent to act as a virtual CEO.  ObizCoin ICO and E-wallet? One can get obizcoin from the ICO that the company has launched. What better way than investing in an ethereum based platform with maximum returns and is comparatively less risky.  Also one must be careful of the fact that token must be held in wallet from where it was purchased in ICO.  The best part about the tokens is that the profits will be shared on pro- rata premises which are contingent upon the number of days the obizcoin tokens are held in the wallet. Profit sharing would also be conveyed in ETH. Since profit sharing is according to the time one holds the coins in the wallet it depends on the off chance that a man holds OBZ tokens in wallet for 15 days, he might get Profits according to 15 days count.  Obizcoin Returns and Guarantees? With Obizcoin what really is important is the returns on to which one places their bets on. After careful examination Obizcoin tokens offer Minimum Guarantee Return.  MG might be applicable until the point when the BOT advancement is finished or until 1 year from the end of token sale whichever is prior. The holder must hold OBZ tokens in wallet for accepting MG. Token holder will get MG for the period OBZ tokens are held in wallet. Token holders will be compensated in ETH Example: Investment Amount : 100 ETH Period of holding OBZ : first April 2018 to fifteenth April 2018, No. of days: 15 days. Estimation of Profit Sharing: 100ETH * 1% *15/30 = 0.5 ETH. Payout will begin following the end of the month of ICO. Also, instalment date would be last date of consistently.  Another advantage of holding OBZ tokens would be the Buyback of tokens which will be done to compensate the token holders. The tokens purchased back will be destroyed.  The occasion of Buyback will be led each month in the principal year of the offer of Bot-As-Services (B-A-S) as it were. The most extreme Buyback period will be 1 year assured with greatest purchase back proportion of 1%. With these benefits Obizcoin is not just beneficial considering the technology implied but also a safe return on your investment.  https://medium.com/@obizcoin/how-obizcoin-obz-token-can-make-you-earn-income-beadd51793d0",False

It gives us a chance to clarify things for you as well as many other potential investors having similar doubts.  No. OBIZCOIN does not plan to replace human CEO's. What OBIZCOIN is aiming is to make the life of a CEO easier.  How ?  OBIZCOIN is developing a Smart Business Process Automation BOT based on Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain technology. In startups and SME‚Äôs, because of limited resources, multiple job profiles are handled by those involved in the top management. They have to overlook all the processes of the organization like Sales, BD, Purchase, Logistics, HR, Accounts and so on. Handling too many things at the same time makes it difficult for them to achieve excellence in any business process. They are left with no time for evaluation or monitoring of the actual performances. Also lack of domain expertise lead them to take wrong decisions jeopardising their venture‚Äôs survival in the long run. This is where OBIZCOIN comes in picture.   OBIZCOIN Smart BOT will act as a virtual CEO for these Startups and SME‚Äôs helping them with domain expert knowledge, designing of efficient business processes, aligning their team to the designed processes, allocating automated tasks based on their KRA‚Äôs developed on the BOT system, monitoring team‚Äôs performances and rewarding them, training them as per performance results.  One of the core services of OBIZCOIN is ‚ÄúOperational Risk Score Analysis‚Äù. Often, while making any sort of business decisions, the only data available about that organization is the financial data. With the development of OBIZCOIN by next year, business owners and investors will have the access to an organization‚Äôs real time operational health which will help them analyse their businesses better and take corrective actions to improvise their business processes. Investors can have a better understanding of the real time operational health of the businesses they wish to invest in along with financial evaluation.   OBIZCOIN BOT Application will have API‚Äôs to connect with various software used by Organization to fetch data and make it usable. This will make users like the application because of its flexibility in blending with the existing business applications.  In addition to this, organization can have a  Operational Risk Score Analysis done to understand how strong their business processes are and know their organization‚Äôs operational health.  BOT will be a decentralized platform allowing other business consultants to develop their processes and use them for their clients. Thus it is an auto scalable model with multiple utility.  I hope this solves your query. Please let us know if you still have any doubts.",False
