The only reason I could see that the Edgeless Team would not want to Enable the 40% Staking is this effectively turns EDG into a Stable coin...

Without a stable coin to value the Casino Token with, the current business model will siphon off the little profit they have and without a way to raise capital, they are burning the candle on both ends. Failure to hold to their promise to the crypto community has burned some incredible bridges for Edgeless. At this point they will be unable to raise additional capital as they have not followed through with the original promise of Edgeless.  Currently the lack of stable value for EDG, and use of Bankroll profits is pushing all risk onto the existing Holders of EDG, and the original purchasers of EDG who may still hold EDG. Those who choose to stake are a small pool that is insulted by the current Staking arrangement that refuses to reward the risk this project is running with any returns to justify that risk.

A lot of people would say, ""Gosh, zero?"" OK, that sounds safe and reasonable. You worked hard to build your business; you're counting on it for your retirement and your kids' college and whatever.

Somewhere, there's someone out there who is taking more risks than you, and that person's business is growing faster than yours, and that person's business may one day come to dominate your industry while yours withers away.""  This has created a vicious cycle of negative price pressure for Edgeless, which is only worsened by the Edgeless Team announcing that the Bankroll profits are being used to fund current development. The market has properly punished the price of EDG, as without a clear timetable of when the Bankroll Profits will be released to match the original design, and without any possibility of favorable terms for infusing future capital the Edgeless Team is left only with heavily discounted deals to fund the continuation of Edgeless. Such deals at heavy discounts to the current market price will cause additional pressure down.  We are looking at a quite bleak future for Edgeless. Those who still may be optimistic about the possibility of Edgeless, ignore that they cannot achieve what they state with the current design.  I went to the Edgeless website, and they still talk about Staking as if it is a Beta product. This was one of the cornerstones of the White paper, and they alienate crypto enthusiast's that could provide capital by treating this as an optional, maybe if we make some profits we'll have some excess to share. This is why Edgeless is in a death spin, they won't honor their original commitment, and they are punished by the market.  Using ""Profits"" from your Bankroll demonstrates that you have no capital. Instead of treating the Bankroll as an asset that grows and a pot that will enthuse Players in the casino, The Edgeless Team is treating it as a piggy bank to raid.  If Edgeless would honor their commitments, and allow those who risk capital to realize a return, they would reverse this descent. They would have additional resources for building the Edgeless system, and they would not push unrewarded risk onto the market.  Every Edgeless token taken by the team and sold into the market is providing downward pressure of this project's only ability to succeed. EDG must be treated as a Stable Coin by the market, and the Stakers must be compensated for risk with reward.  If both of these were done, there is a chance for EDG and Edgeless. If not it isn't worth a penny.",False

We currently have a system wherein:  1. The PLAYERs are happy 🙂, they have an expectation of a fairer Game and they get that from Edgeless. 2. The HODLers are unhappy 🙁 , since they do not play and do not STAKE they are subject to a valuation based on the market price for EDG. They benefit PLAYERS, STAKERS and the Core Team because they absorb liquidity in the market, making tokens more dear to come by. 3. The STAKERS are unhappy 🙁 , they used to be HODLers until the Beta Staking was rolled out, now they struggle to justify, financially the return that the Staking is delivering, they are unhappy. 4. The Core Team is keeping the lights on, 😐 although they have done a fabulous job of executing most objectives on the original design, through the loss of funds of the Parity Wallet hack, and to weather the broader downturn of Crypto Winter they have continued building.  Their focus is on building the infrastructure, and the only fault is delay on releasing the original 40% Feature for the Bankroll Profits, I think we could agree that all things considered the Core Team would be much happier with a larger Bankroll and an appreciation of the EDG token itself.  So I would say the Core Team could be much happier. Also since they are focused so closely on Building they are unable to see that the Edgeless ecosystem has components that are languishing.  5. And finally this leaves EDG buyers, those who when they have purchased will become, a PLAYER, HODLer, or STAKER. They can only be confused at this point.  This is not a virtuous ecosystem, and the only saving grace is that development has continued, and there we have an opportunity to address the shortcomings. The mechanics of Enabling the 40% Staking feature do support a virtuous cycle of EDG Buyer -> PLAYER / HODLR -> STAKER -> HODLR / PLAYER when that feature is turned on, right now the project is running on fumes and a finite runway because they have left out this key component.

Staking has worked to grow the Bankroll to 13 million EDG this year.  My analysis is there has not been any additions to the Bankroll other than the new Staking Cycles. I was curious about this, and when STAKING was announced to be open, I found no infusions to the Bankroll prior to Open STAKING.  When the 40% Feature of Staking is enabled, more capital will pour into Edgeless with the arrangement found in the White Paper. Players want BIG, having a $1 million Bankroll is an achievement. We can go a lot bigger. This depends on STAKING to push us to the next level. $10 Million is possible easily.  The EDG that sit in the Bankroll are off the 'market' until the next cycle. This constrains market supply and will stop the descent of the EDG token. It is a simple and virtuous cycle to have a larger Bankroll and thus more interest from Players. The STAKERS are rewarded with 40% of the Profit.  If we had two STAKING contracts one at 5% and one at 40%, which do you think the market will choose? The White paper says: ""a decentralized price pool which is backed by 40% of casino profits"". This must be implemented to realize the potential of Edgeless.  A market is about Risk and Reward. You must have Risk to have Reward. Every stakeholder in Edgeless, the PLAYERS, the HODLRs, the STAKERS, the Edgeless Core Team, and the Buyers of EDG must face risk and must always be able to realize reward.  There should not be less Risk for STAKERS than the PLAYERS! The PLAYERS put it on the line, wanting to win! They risk their EDG and they have a chance to win it big!  HODLRs have bought EDG and watched it's value collapse, at the same time, the Core Team says they must use Bankroll Profits to fund ongoing development.  Well where has that got us? We do have a Beta Staking product, which is the first step; this step has finally got us a sizable Bankroll. Now all we have to do is allow the market, to participate in the value of STAKING EDG with the 40% Feature and we will begin building the value that all the Stakeholders want.  The valuation of EDG as a token is important psychologically, in the industry it is common to represent chips such:  $1: white; blue (more common in Las Vegas and much of the Western and Midwestern US) $2.50: pink (rarely used for poker; however, see Pink chip game and as a 3:2 payoff in blackjack $5: red $25: green; yellow $50: blue $100: black; white.  These are the psychological tiers in a PLAYER's mind, and when you are using this in your Casino, this is what is expected at least unconsciously.  Enabling the 40% Staking Feature would bring an infusion of crypto funds that are looking for yield, those EDG tokens would be locked into the Bankroll for the monthly cycle, and thus would remove liquidity from the market, and drive up demand for EDG and thus the price would begin to appreciate again.  We should also see this would stabilize the price, and as long as the Edgeless team Enables the 40% Staking feature should continue indefinitely.  The monthly STAKERs that see a yield would in some cases withdraw EDG from the next STAKING cycle to realize an income or gain, with the appreciation of EDG this would be less than they had STAKED and most likely would be less than they had received in the last STAKING cycle as they would want to compound their asset monthly.  The calculation for actual Annual Percentage Yield when calculating monthly is: APY=(1+periodic rate)∧number of periods−1  When this is done with an Edgeless Staking model for EDG at 40% of the Bankroll profits, then the numbers are attractive to anyone managing a portfolio.",False

But this is coinpoker nightmare all over again with those ether contracts being used for coins.  Spread is horrific, 0.009 ether turns into 0.003 ether on shapeshift, and there is 4.5 edge fee to send, more than half of that, and 0.002 ether to receive.  Thats a whole lot of edge.  Now I know this is one of those things where you gotta invest into it, but how is it going to grow if people can't play because players wanna play and withdraw, getting a third of your chips back is not good.  Now you need a player and an investor.  I feel about this the same way I feel about coinpoker, if you are going to create a coin, create a coin, don't create an ether contract.  Completely stand alone, maybe proof of stake, keep 25 percent or so of created coins for yourself and sell off a bit as coin rises to pay for the site, and test that chance of ruin no edge theory on massive scale.  I need to be able to deposit 5 bucks and when i sell get like 4.80 back maybe a bit less for charges, like good solid altcoins, doge, litecoin, etc.  Now if the spread was super small, bigger deposits than five bucks will cover the ether fee and even the large edge fee, like 200 deposit would cost maybe five bucks, but the spread would turn 200 into 60.  There is also id verification, but for a coin with tight spread and low fees, and zero edge, I would send my crap in for sure.  Good luck with the project, support is instant, black jack is fun to play, best black jack I played with crypto, dice is very nice too, what I really like is that you don't have to type your bet, you can place chips, both for dice and black jack.

Sure hope ICO investors strengthen their backbones with this activity.   Edgeless Casino goal is to get the licenses from UK and Malta.

I've got a question concerning your vision about the optimal price of EDG token. It seems to me that there is a conflict of interests between gamblers and investors of the Edgeless platform. The first ones are interested in a narrow range of the EDG price change, the second ones are interested in a big pump of the price. So, do you have any politics about what are you gonna do if the EDG price will rapidly go up or down? Are you going to change the bet limits or buy/sell EDG tokens on exchanges or do something different?  BTW my opinion is that the most preferrable range of the EDG price fluctuation for gamblers is around 1 USD - 0,5...1,5 USD.",False

The decentralized online gaming pioneers announced that “Edgeless 1.0” platform will be launched on March 29th.  “Exactly one year has passed since the end of our successful and well-funded ICO. We are proud to be a rare example of an ICO project that has managed to deliver tangible ‘smart-contract’ products aimed at mass consumers. Now the time has come for some serious user acquisition and real business growth. Our brand new platform with system upgrades, new features, next-level user experience, interface and additional languages will help attract new players providing one of the best crypto gaming experiences in the entire market,” says Tomas Draksas, Co-founder of “Edgeless”.  “Edgeless 1.0” is a full version platform with all the necessary functionality required for mass cryptocurrency customers. The “Ethereum” smart-contracts used by the casino have been upgraded and will deliver a much faster game speed and optimized transaction fees. Additionally, the sign-up to the beta version of bankroll staking will be enabled for a limited amount of people: only these users will be able to try the first beta version of bankroll staking after it is launched!  Other upgrades in “Edgeless 1.0”:  - Rebranded casino  - Simplified Blackjack game;  - Natural UI, UX and platform navigation system;  - Easier, more fluent user registration and verification;  - Improved and faster customer support;  - Internal community chat;  - South Korean and Russian language support;  - Bug fixes.  “This upgrade was made possible by the very first users of our platform who provided us with feedback and advice. We are grateful for all of the help and support provided. The “Edgeless” platform is now ready for worldwide expansion, and for that we need additional resources. As we announced during our ICO, part of the EDG company tokens were automatically locked for a one year period. Now the time has come to use these significant resources which will help us expand and ensure smooth casino operations,” notes Mr. Draksas.  Additionally, most of the 50 million EDG tokens that are being unlocked on March 21 will remain in the bankroll to sustain the entire “Edgeless” network operations, especially once we increase our client base. Part of the tokens will be used in exchange for services with influencers, partners and marketing vendors. This will help the company make “Edgeless” a worldwide brand and encourage partners for a long-term relationship, since they will have an interest in growing the value of the token.  As the company has announced earlier, soon after the launch of version 1.0 of the casino platform; a second game - Dice - will be introduced. This game is incredibly popular among crypto gaming operators and players. It is intuitive and easy to play for everyone and has the shortest learning duration among all casino games.",False

The month of March for our community will be an exceptional month. Together, we will reach a few important milestones for Edgeless:  Edgeless will celebrate one-year birthday. Thanks to you, our community, and team we achieved a lot during our first year. According to Bloomberg, the tokens with the biggest gain, a 500 percent jump since it started trading, was issued by Edgeless. We became the FIRST Ethereum ICO project which has solved smart contract scalability issues, launched a working online casino and started generating real results for the business. We are also the first crypto casino that has received an official Curacao gambling license. Most current ICOs are projects that are promising solutions based on smart contracts; but are still in a ‘white-paper’ stage.  At the end of March, we will introduce Edgeless 1.0 version which is focused towards catering for mass consumer adoption. The platform will have significantly improved user experience, simplified registration process, flawless mobile experience, statistics dashboard and social elements including a chat.  The new Dice game based on smart-contracts will be released. Dice is an extremely popular game among top bitcoin casinos. Additionally, it’s much easier than Black Jack and fun for people who just want to make a bet without thinking too much about the rules of the game.  Marketing, marketing, marketing. During the last 2 months, our team have tripled in size and top talents have joined the team to push Edgeless to a global level.

At the certain moment the last potential player decides that the price of a chip is so high and goes to another casino with his money. The average player has 50-100 USD weekly to spend to online gambling games. Edgeless bet's imits are 0,2 EDG - 5 EDG. Thus you need about 50-100 EDG to have a long play with average bet of 1EDG. Now you can easily calculate the EDG/USD ratio. If the ratio is lower than 1 it is good for players and it may attract more players on the platform. The opposit will occur when the ratio is higher than 1. This is the basis of my opinion why the cost of EDG should be around 1 USD until the bet limits are 0,2-5 EDG.",False

An interesting fact is that 5 years ago, there was almost nothing happening for online operators — and now it’s a total shift.   The online gambling venue was overpacked with people and the offline gambling part felt a bit empty.

Yes, 2 months average. But this is no simple casino with only a few games in BETA only. I do hope for the best, but I'm becoming more doubtfull now. The hype is over and the only reason to get this back-up is pure the license and that's a fact. Who cares? People who want to invest and gamble big time in it. So deal with it people. It's less than 7k satoshi now.  -----------------------------------------  How long does the application process usually take? All applications will be processed as efficiently as possible but the time required varies with:-  the completeness and accuracy of the application the complexity of the ownership structure and the commercial proposition the commercial readiness and preparations of the applicant and their ability to respond quickly to questions arising in the investigation process The application and approval process splits into three pieces- suitability, fair games and adequate processes. The process runs as follows.  Suitability – the average licence approval takes 60 days from receipt of the application, although the spread can be from within a month to greater than a year. The critical delay factor is the time taken by the applicant to respond to due diligence questions. Fair games – the average initial equipment approval takes 60 days. Best and worst variations within this are extreme, reflecting the quality of submissions, and the speed and focus of response; the norm is less than 2 months. New games approvals take an average of 21 days to grant from initial application; again there is a wide variation within this average, with better results being routinely achieved by applicants with existing testing house relationships, good software development teams and focused project management. Adequate processes – the average initial ICS approval takes 70 days. The Commission’s final ICS review is normally completed within a week of receipt. The difference between the two being that initial submissions are frequently incomplete and unfocused- again the difference between good applications and unfocused applications is stark. The three processes can be run in parallel or in series; neither time line is likely to be a simple arithmetic product of the above. The “in-parallel” applicant will usually take a little longer than the time required for games testing, to complete all three components. The “in-series” applicant will normally be able to progress ICS and games testing together.  Live activation is routinely achievable, from the Commission’s side, within six months of initial application. Delivery time is, in practice, dependent on the applicant’s ability to plan and focus- there is little to prevent the Commission from moving at the same speed as the applicant in its progress towards live activation",False

Quote from: Alp88 on September 18, 2017, 07:37:32 PM From Edgeless Slack channel:   munkeyboy14 9:33 PM @channel Hi all, I've decided to alert all of you as it'd be easier than having to repeat this (however no doubt this will have to happen ). I've just spoken to the Edgeless team and tried to receive an answer for all your queries and complaints. They've answered them all and I shall break it down below, any further questions we'd be happy to answer them, as we all want a successful launch and product.The Edgeless team are cautious of adding a countdown due to the fear it'll attract people hyping the price up and dumping in the last few hours before launch, however further discussion on this is happening in the next day or two (please put any reasons for a countdown forward as well please). They can see the benefits!Further licence details and clarification will be happening in the next day or two (as they understand many have questions on whether it'll happen or not, why the delays etc)In regards to this ""beta"" which is a main net launch for 800 people, it is expected to be limited for 1-2 months, understandably this will annoy people I'm sure. However it'll be shorter/quicker to removing this limit depending on the amount of feedback and how many changes (if any) will need to be done to the smart contract code.Profit sharing was forgotten and they apologise, however it remains the same as it has been described in the white paper (only change being profits in EDG and not ETH).In response to, well these 800 people are risking real EDG, what about this? They have capped the bets at 0.2EDG to reduce the risk. Due to this low sum it won't be attractive to hackers, all of these smart contracts have been tested on the ropsten network (the beta that has gone on for a few months) but a few people compared to 800 people. 800 people will suffice in properly testing these contracts.Edgeless apologise for the misleading ""full platform launch"" in last week's post. They meant full launch due to the fact it's the first time the smart contracts are to be uploaded onto the main Ethereum blockchain. That is a bad PR mistake and will aim to be much clearer and precise with future updates.Hopefully this answers all of your questions. Thank you.",False

You're looking at it backwards and also clearly have no clue about gambling in general. Firstly, 0% edge is only commercially viable on a blockchain network (which is an absolutely huge deal), thus why it's developed on there. Secondly, having the network operate in crypto currency gives availability to large markets in the world where gambling is illegal / taxed etc.  You seem to be looking at it from a viewpoint of, 'this is a casino designed for crypto/blockchain people' when in-fact that is not the case atall. Do you also really think that if they get legally licensed they aren't going to operate fiat deposits? I mean, it's like 5 lines of code to simply display EDG in USD/CNY in the UI, so to say that you have to knowingly be involved in crypto to become consumers isn't fair to say, in fact other companies already operate their entire business on BTC whilst accepting USD deposits and the consumer is not even aware they're holding BTC.

Casino launching 28th September  License forthcoming.  How come do they launch on 28th of this month without any license? The license part expected to be completed by October? This news does not bring a positive impact on the users and the price went down below 30k sat now. I was of the impression that they would be launching the platform with a full license on this month.  Who cares about a license from Curaçao anyway?  How many people live there?  Do they really like gambling that much?  It's not about Curacao alone, it's about getting a license and being fully functional.I am a supporter of EDG and do not like the way they made this mess.Was happy to see that the game would go live with a fully acquired license but they turned up to launch without any license which made a drastic dip in the price.  If it was a license for some big market like EU, and even within EU you need country specific license to operate in some countries.  Curaçao is useless.  Curacao license means they can legally offer services online globally. Also means they can operate legally in fiat currencies online. Which is very clearly the goal.  Also, don't need a license to operate the entire network in cryptos, only need it to accept fiat deposits - withdrawals.   Let's not jump overboard with the nonsensical speculation here guys. It's fucking super annoying that they hyped up basically a bullshit announcement but it's definitely not half as bad as the charts dictate. Certainly no reason to start questioning the entire model.",False

I've just spoken to the Edgeless team and tried to receive an answer for all your queries and complaints. They've answered them all and I shall break it down below, any further questions we'd be happy to answer them, as we all want a successful launch and product.The Edgeless team are cautious of adding a countdown due to the fear it'll attract people hyping the price up and dumping in the last few hours before launch, however further discussion on this is happening in the next day or two (please put any reasons for a countdown forward as well please). They can see the benefits!Further licence details and clarification will be happening in the next day or two (as they understand many have questions on whether it'll happen or not, why the delays etc)In regards to this ""beta"" which is a main net launch for 800 people, it is expected to be limited for 1-2 months, understandably this will annoy people I'm sure. However it'll be shorter/quicker to removing this limit depending on the amount of feedback and how many changes (if any) will need to be done to the smart contract code.Profit sharing was forgotten and they apologise, however it remains the same as it has been described in the white paper (only change being profits in EDG and not ETH).In response to, well these 800 people are risking real EDG, what about this? They have capped the bets at 0.2EDG to reduce the risk. Due to this low sum it won't be attractive to hackers, all of these smart contracts have been tested on the ropsten network (the beta that has gone on for a few months) but a few people compared to 800 people. 800 people will suffice in properly testing these contracts.Edgeless apologise for the misleading ""full platform launch"" in last week's post. They meant full launch due to the fact it's the first time the smart contracts are to be uploaded onto the main Ethereum blockchain. That is a bad PR mistake and will aim to be much clearer and precise with future updates.Hopefully this answers all of your questions. Thank you.",False

For all reasonable purposes they're 'fake' and can be ignored.  For example, if EDG is currently one dollar, and I put up 1000 EDG for sale at $1000, then that's a 27,000 BTC sell wall. Yes technically the numbers are true, but in practice it's totally irrelevant because the target price is so far away that it's out of the universe of consideration.  There's absolutely nothing to stop you making a sell order of 1 EDG at a trillion dollars. Boom! Now there's a 277,000,000 BTC sell wall. See how this works?

But I feel I have to warn any potential investors of what the people running this project are really like.  I was unfortunate enough to be a victim of their unmoral and cheating ways where the team literally have stolen money from me, and whats even worse, an investor in their own project!     I have tried to keep this under the radar as to not effect the projects progress, but having exhausted all avenues of communication with the team, in the end, I was basically told to bugger off!!     So again, please do your due diligence when you are thinking of dealing with these guys.  I'd like to convey to you all what actually happened and would like to have your feedback on this issue.  I wrote two of the highest awarded articles for their ICO campaign and noticed that the address they had listed next to my name and bounty details was incorrect. I notified them of this and they acknowledged that the address was wrong.  But the team sent the bounty to the wrong address anyway!? This bounty would now worth about $20,000 +  I spoke to the team and was happy to take 50% of the bonus as the team had already sent the bounty amount to the wrong address, but I was still told that they did not care and took no responsibility or liability for their error.  So after my efforts in trying to negotiate with the team, and having come to no agreement with the team, I am now going to voice my concerns publicly, both in here and in further articles until I at least get a satisfactory response from the team.  Before anybody tells me to rack off and stop complaining, please put yourself in my position, where I was unfairly robbed of tokens that I had earned for my contribution to the project.  And I have even said to the team that I would accept 50% of the awarded bounty as not to disrupt their balance sheets too much.  I have transcripts between both myself and EDGELESS that I will be publishing in an article shortly that back up what I am saying here.  I have been a member of the bitcoin community for a number of years now and have never encountered such animosity, rudeness and disregard to investors and contributors to a project.  And to be honest, this is a RED FLAG that I need to put out there, a red flag that I would be happy to ignore should the Team do the honourable thing and at least come to some kind of compromise with me.  I will not label this project as a Scam just yet, but from the dealings I have personally had with the EDGELESS Team Members, it is looking more and more like this project could have the hallmarks of a scam.  I urge the Team to please contact me so we can once and for all sort this long standing issue out.  Kind Regards, Deanero",False

So things are very good:  1. They have enough funds in different coins to run project, only thing what was impacted by this hack is bankroll.  2. Before they run out of money their 50 millions will be unfrozen and this is worst case, though they don't want use that money and will do everything to not touch it for next couple years.  So guys, it looks like these people will win that rat race. As I stated before, challenges like these are good for business when it's just starting because it can direct it to right path.  Attracting of ETH community is much easier than EDG. Though it's much better to start with hard things than easy because after that will come big growth.

CTO of Ethereum Foundation) got hacked due to a small bug in the code. Technically speaking, this hack put at risk all the Ethereum tokens which are stored in these multi-signatures. Since Parity is an industry standard, that’s almost every Ethereum project and major crypto exchanges. And it happened! How large damage is? At that night, it all got hacked. Most of ‘multi-sig’ wallets got ‘successfully hacked’ by whitehackers. Source: https://etherscan.io/address/0x1dba1131000664b884a1ba238464159892252d3a Unfortunately 3 Ethereum projects did not make it to the white-hack list: Edgeless Casino, Æternirty and Swarn City. Æternirty: https://blog.aeternity.com/parity-multisig-wallet-hack-47cc507d964d Swarn City: https://press.swarm.city/parity-multisig-wallet-exploit-hits-swarm-city-funds-statement-by-the-swarm-city-core-team-d1f3929b4e4e and we, the Edgeless Project.

Gladly we diversified our funds right after an ICO and we have a sufficient amount to run the project. Additionally we got our funds when ETH was 15$ — 50$ per unit and now ETH price is way much higher which covers our hacked loss. It means our platform launch will be happening in Q3. However, we made some changes in our dapp structure. From now it will be purely ran on EDG tokens, since a large part of our ETH was supposed to be our casino’s bankroll. That means, if players want to gamble on our platform, they will need to get EDG tokens. What will you do with Gavin Woods and Parity? Edgeless, Æternirty and Swarn City formed a group to address this question. It will be announced in a near future.",False

Quote How Edgeless Casino Can Be Profitable Business with 0% edge?  Casino profits and 0% (0.83% in practise) house edge concept.  There are several ways how Edgeless Casino can be profitable. Edgeless Casino provides games which depend on LUCK+SKILL and Sports Betting.  The first two games provided will be Blackjack and Video Poker. Both games are played with a combination of LUCK and SKILL. That means players make choices and either play well or poorly. To give an example of such a situation:  Blackjack: House has a 6 card. The player has 16. The player wants to collect at least 17 and hits for one more card. - BAD MISTAKE. The player just made a huge error, because, 12+ against 6 ALWAYS STAYS. (according to Blackjack basic strategy)  An average player does not play ‘the perfect game’ therefore, in the long run the casino makes a profit from his mistakes.  An analogy can be taken from poker. A new player is playing against a Pro. Both have equal probability conditions - 50% vs. 50%. However, the Pro player makes better choices and the new player makes bad decisions, and in the long run, the Pro wins.",False

It's a good ROI, but not as high as what is being mentioned now.  This is not my response but a copy/paste from the original message.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Edgeless/comments/61aune/thoughts_about_edgeless_roi_assumed_calculations/  If you will check the satochi dice daily volume, it was about 50 000 BTC/day in 2013. 50k*30=1500000BTC per month. If we will assume Edgeless casino games (there will be many games, including sports betting) will have the same volume in ETH (1,5mln ETH bets/month) and about 1% of profit, there will be 15000ETH/month for casino and 6000ETH will go to Lounge.  There are 132,046,997 EDG tokens. 50mln tokens are frozen and can't participate in lottery (I assume they will have no ability to participate in future too)  82046997 EDG will be able to play in Lounge lottery with ~6000ETH monthly fund.(All calculations are estimated and may be absolutely wrong).  So if all possible EDG will participate in a lottery, 1 EDG will have 6000ETH/82046997EDG = 0,000073129 ETH. So to receive ~1ETH/month you will need to have ~13674EDG in a lottery. That is a 13,6 ETH at the time of ICO.  In other words, early investors may receive ~1ETH/month forever for 13,6ETH one time investment. If that will work, EDG is a gold cow with an insane ROI.  NOTE: All calculations are absolutely estimated and may be wrong.",False

Of course, that gives us a good opportunity to buy now, it is normally what will happen when the value of bitcoin is soaring high, in fact not only EDG but most of the coins now.  indeed! whenever the BTC price skyrockets, the price of alts are goin down, and this means that it is a good time to buy. EDG is at 6800 sats this time on bittrex. it still a good time to buy though. but if it will go down to 6k or 6500 sats will be much better. then HOLD! thats the key there.. EDG will go back to 10k sats up if the beta will be launched soon.",False

A couple of Bitcoin casinos have been granted various licenses to date despite the various risks associated with digital currency & the plethora of hit and runs. Edgeless is actually a big step forward because smart contract based gambling potentially allows players to verify the gameplay is fair and they can be in control of their funds rather than trusting them to a third party site.  In any event it would appear some of the largest traditional online gambling companies are deriving the majority of their profits from restricted markets and one would think one of the key USP's of crypto-currency payments and blockchain based accounts is that they will be even more successful at penetrating those lucrative markets vs. just focusing on the smaller, more heavily saturated ones.  Quote Bet365...also known in Britain for funding the Premier League football team Stoke City... has grown into one of the world’s largest online gambling businesses,  The company – which has no physical presence or assets in China – operates one of the most successful online gambling services that can be accessed from inside the country.  -Bet365 frequently changes its website addresses in China, thereby side-stepping attempts by local regulators to close sites down.  -The company has constructed a complex payments system that allows it to take bets placed using China’s currency, the renminbi.  -only about half of the £1.3bn the company won from gamblers in 2013 came from countries where bet365 possessed a licence to operate.     https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/03/bet365-profit-china-online-gambling  So the market for lower casino edge, transparent code & player controlled funds smart contract gambling will be very lucrative both for those with and without a license.",False

EDG seems like a goldmine if his numbers are correct.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Edgeless/comments/61aune/thoughts_about_edgeless_roi_assumed_calculations/  If you will check the satochi dice daily volume, it was about 50 000 BTC/day in 2013. 50k*30=1500000BTC per month.  If we will assume Edgeless casino games (there will be many games, including sports betting) will have the same volume in ETH (1,5mln ETH bets/month) and about 1% of profit, there will be 15000ETH/month for casino and 6000ETH will go to Lounge.  There are 132,046,997 EDG tokens. 50mln tokens are frozen and can't participate in lottery (I assume they will have no ability to participate in future too)  82046997 EDG will be able to play in Lounge lottery with ~6000ETH monthly fund.(All calculations are estimated and may be absolutely wrong).  So if all possible EDG will participate in a lottery, 1 EDG will have 6000ETH/82046997EDG = 0,000073129 ETH.  So to receive ~1ETH/month you will need to have ~13674EDG in a lottery. That is a 13,6 ETH at the time of ICO. In other words, early investors may receive ~1ETH/month forever for 13,6ETH one time investment. If that will work, EDG is a gold cow with an insane ROI.

About people strugling on the RNG cerfitied casino, no special worries on this:  1st) Having an online casino on the US --> for sure they had to apply for this license. Nothing new on this, i don't understand why people started worrying on this now. 2nd) As far as i've been told (not related with EDG, just a friend related with Gambling Association), it has to be a pretty mature project (like now that Beta is out) for applying for license, you cannot start paperwork with just a concept. So, as my understanding, they didn't forget about this until now, which seems some people think, just they start now they can start it.  Hopefully, they will get license by Q3 aligned to the theoretical launch of BJ... I'm quite confident (little crossing fingers too, paperwork always surprises me XD)  --  Regarding my thought of being listed on Polo, as said, was just guessing. Having new space after the 2nd of May drop out of many coins leaves space for new ones. That's all, rest is just desires. Truth to be told, on liqui.io, EDG is the 3rd coin with more volume, even this slow days and on bittrex i think was among the 35 of 180 coins. That's enough for being listed on more traders, as someone said, they like large volumes and we should not forget that there will be big volumes when the bounties are slowly released ~July, that's an valid excuse by itself.",False

I've been in this market for some years and some patterns are always fulfilled...  I think many people forget this is crypto, to be exact alt-crypto XD 90% is holding alt-coins for ""gambling with its prize"", it's succulent to get 25% of benefits (and losses!) when it's the turn of ""fame"" for your selected coin. We all know how this behaves, many coins will have bursts of dump/pump until they succeed or are abandoned. EDG has a solid idea, it's the first to go for it seriously and now it seems to have stabilized after the inclusion in bittrex.  I won't lie to anyone, I also hold EDG (among other coins) from the very beggining, once I get my bounties I will have multiplied the inversion, there will be tough times for EDG's prize, many people will sell, many more to buy cheap. I don't know what I will do by then, but that will be in a couple of months. Everyone who panicked after the explanation of the number of bounties left, have already left the ship. Don't think it will go deeper than now.  My impression is that the following weeks/months until first release of bounties, we will see at least one big pump (maybe with the inclusion on polo ~2nd of May, just guessing) and for sure some dumps too. This is how it works, now it's time to make gains with other coins, turn to EDG will come again, we will se """"going to moon"""", people very happy, and then the reality one it corrects it. What happens after June/July only god knows. Conclusion, EDG is quite cheap right now if you want to go for the timeframe of 2-3 months. After that timeframe, difficult to know where the prize will be.  It's fun to see how coins behave on weekends when no in-out fiat is possible, you see people weaving betweens the coins. Don't forget this, crypto is crypto. Do not panick on EDG yet.  Would be great to hear your opinions too",False

What do you mean by ""the Gambling Commission?""  The Malta Lottery and Gaming Authority? Curacao Internet Gaming Association? The Kahnawake Gaming Commission? The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement?  As above, a gambling site can obtain a license from any number of places. A license essentially grants you authority to operate in their jurisdiction, not worldwide. The limiting factor is more local laws/regulation than if you have a license granted by X,Y or Z.  As an American, I'm limited as to what sites I can play on. Someone in Thailand or Colombia may not have the same restrictions.  Using the USA for example again, certain states such as Washington may have further limitations than another state like Texas or Florida.  A real world example: PokerStars NJ has a license to operate an online poker site from The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement. This means nothing to me living in North Carolina because my state doesn't recognize that.  Most gambling sites self restrict where they offer themselves based on local laws. If they interpret a particular location's laws to be too strict (ie, too much of a legal headache to deal with) then they simply restrict players from that location.",False

We respond to creative and insightful posts to help market your favorite coins and Bittrex. I'd also consider coming to our irc channel #bittrex on irc.freenode.net and do some guerrilla marketing.

Bounty program was supposed to be purely automatic. However it has a ""human factor"" which requires a ""judgement"" on a specific situation which we did not estimate properly.  Before launching a bounty program we DID NOT EXPECT A LOT OF FREE RUNNERS/ CHEATING bounty participants who made fake posts, fake blog articles and other type of things which generates a negative value.  Because of these cases, right now we need to go to each person individually, check their IP addresses and many more. (more than 3000+ people) and evaluate his contribution. For 1 person it takes 2 - 4 minutes. So its somewhere around 6000 - 12000 minutes which is 100 - 200 hours. And that's just for checking whether a person is a proper participant or a free runner.  I hope you understand.  Today we will make a large update on a current status of the bounty program.",False

It's a casino start-up which uses decentralisation for a randomness generation and transparency. Because we believe that's a significant improvement for gambling experience. Using it, Edgeless can get a strong competitive advantage against traditional online casinos and become really profitable business unit.  Crowdsale method is chosen as a ""capital raising"" method for a start-up. In exchange for 40% of casino profits. An analogy can be taken from a traditional start-up which is looking for VCs. VCs fund a startup in exchange of shares. Start-up gets capital for further development, VCs expects to earn profit from shares it just bought. Founders are NOT really making money from VC funds. Founders expect to earn money in a future, once a start-up is well developed and scaled business.  In this particular situation, Edgeless team will not make money/ get rich from collecting crowd sale money. All capital will be used for a start-up development in a period of 1 - 2 years. However Edgeless founders expect to turn a casino into really profitable/ scalable business, so they can get paid having 60% profits of the start-up (isnt it fair? after spending several years working on it). Investors get 40% of profits for their early support. Investors expect to earn money because they believe this team and start-up has a lot of potential to disrupt a casino industry.  Using this ""capitalistic"" approach we can be sure that all parties involved have a strong financial/ value creation incentive to take action. In this case we can make sure that business unit will have fast decision making (because it has only 3 co-founders, not 4000 people voting on decisions) and strong financial incentive to be extremely good product. And that's why freedom + capitalism is so dominant, because it makes sure people have enough motivation to run long and complex project.  Casino DAO is nice idea, however we feel world is not ready yet. And here are several reasons:  - smart contracts are experimental and untested technology. From a DAO hack example we can see that smart contracts are still in a super early phase. It will take many years ahead once we can move to complex smart contract systems. Human error in a contract is simply inavoidable, therefore we need to start building something really simple as randomness generation and only THEN move to complex DAO and decentralised systems. People built calculators first and only THEN moved to artificial intelligence. Not the other way around.  - DAO governance model is still not tested. There is a high chance that it will not perform really good in a technological environment which requires fast decision making and clear direction. And requires founders which are willing to die for their start-up.  - Casino business is extremely sensitive/ dependent on marketing. No marketing means no people on casino and business is pretty much dead. Having 3000 decision makers who are voting on these decisions can harm a business unit really bad. It simply would not catch up with small start-ups which can make decisions really fast.  With Edgeless we aim to build a business unit which is tangible and applicable in today's world, therefore we do not want to OVERPROMISE too much for early investors.  Regarding dev. teams token share - dev. team's tokens will be frozen for a long time. It will not be in use. Also dev. team keeps tokens because it might be that, after 1 - 2 years, start-up needs more capital for further scaling. Therefore tokens will be used to get extra capital.  And one more important note: Edgeless ICO IS NOT GET QUICK RICH SCHEME for token speculators. We do not promise 100000% ROI. We are realistic, making sure that your investment is protected and value creation happens over time. Not in a day.  Also your calculations are wrong. It's not 70% of tokens. Secondly number of issues tokens are growing every day. Also team holds 10%, not 12%. 2% are for bounty participants.

(through gambling community forums, reddit groups, gambling media portals and other gambling related channels.) Since our casino is the only one in a market which offers these conditions, we expect that gamblers will catch our message easily.They already have a lot of frustration with casino transparency, delayed withdrawals and many more issues related to a casino industry)  2) help people to purchase a cryptocurrency (ETH in our case). We will release a lot of tutorials and make sure that they rank high and search engines, gambling community websites. Secondly process is extremely similar to registration process on fiat casino.  Online fiat casino registration process: you register your account, verify it sending your ID, deposit fiat currency, currency appears on your casino’s account.  Purchase crypto process: you register on exchange or services such as cashilia. Verify your account sending your ID, deposit/ send fiat currency, crypto appears on your crypto wallet.  So gamblers are pretty much used to this kind of a process. Crypto currency is extremely similar to online casino chips/ fiat.  bottom line: it would not be hard for gamblers to purchase a crypto.  3) Gamblers play on your casino using ETH!  Some global forces which make everything easier: more and more people are getting familiar with a crypto world, therefore it’s getting easier and easier to attract wider audiences who know how to use crypto.  What’s your long term business monetization strategy?  Attract a lot of gamblers, promoting 0% house edge games. (these games will cover casino marketing/ operation costs too). Make profit/ monetise from traditional games such as Sports Betting/ Dice. Because part of the people who gave for 0% house edge will definitely try traditional games too (in marketing terms it can be called “an up-sell”)  Quote from: blocks.explorer on March 02, 2017, 11:08:22 PM Are the tokens you sell in ICO shraes that earns dividends or spendable currency on the gambling platform?  No, its not a dividend sharing token. However token can be used to participate in Edgeless Lottery which has a prize pool of 40% casino's profits.  Quote from: andron8383 on March 02, 2017, 11:23:30 PM Quote from: blocks.explorer on March 02, 2017, 11:08:22 PM Are the tokens you sell in ICO shraes that earns dividends or spendable currency on the gambling platform?  No they want avid profit sharing by creating game where you can win your profits from having EDG token.  *** Question for team.  Using ETH blockchain will cost who will pay costs of using ETH blockchain ? Why players will want to pay those small fees IF ETH will rise 10x cost will rise 10x. And having to pay like 0.1$ for every roll is not fun. While online casinos fees will be whole 0%  Maybe paying with 100$ will be ok but with 2$ is not that fun to run BlackJack Maybe you will have 0% edge but you will eat fees equal like 1% edge of other online casino.   On early days of the casino, gas will be paid by a player. However since a contract is not written, we cannot tell what will be exact gas price. But we are aiming to optimize it as much as possible. Also an average player might play 60 - 80 average during 1 set, so gas wouldn't be that significant. Still WAY MUCH CHEAPER than a casino with edge.

People who want to see Ethereum succeeding have an interest to fund all ethereum dapps, only just because these are on ethereum. It could be one of the reasons why all ETH projects get funded in 20 minutes.  Also last week we received enormous amount of calls from VCs, asking a lot of detailed questions. I guess, if they ask questions - probably they are going to invest. And some of them are interested not in a casino specifically, but ethereum success as a bockchain. It could add up to ETH price raise. But yeah, its just a forecast. I cannot state it as a fact.",False

That's one of the reasons why ethereum is so popular.  Ethereum Smart Contract automatically distributes tokens, lock tokens, do all investment protection and more - also people (including dev. team) CANT influence a smart contract because it's on a blockchain. Principle is the same as a bitcoin transaction - if it get's approval - transaction is successful and you cannot change it.  Exactly same method was used by other famous ETH projects such as Golem and Melonport. All investment process was super smooth and successful. Also both projects got funded in first 15 mins. And it's because people trust ethereum smart contracts a lot.  Since our all casino/ casino financial operations are purely based on Ethereum Smart Contract, it would be hypocritical/ controversial for us to run an ICO without smart contracts.  Also we hired a 3rd party auditor (Mikko Ohtamaa - First's Bloods IT advisor) to do intense security check on a contract, we have a contract kill-switch with a multi-sig wallet and many more security measures. Also today our auditor will post an official blog and confirm that everything what we mentioned in a whitepaper actually is in a smart contract.  Another strong point: our team has known, credible and old blockchain community members - Paolo Rebuffo and Ransu Salovaara. Probably they would not want to risk own reputation, if we were no credible.  main features of contracts:  - it has own escrow, during an ICO no-one can't touch ETH - contract on real time sends EDG tokens for your ETH - unsold EDG tokens are automatically burned - if minimum goal is not reached, all ETH is returned to investors - EDG tokens become immediately tradable after an ICO  Contacts can be found here: https://github.com/EdgelessCasino/Smart-Contracts",False

I am not familiar with the ethereum smart contract language and therefore cant verify your statements. Who is the auditor? 2. The smart contract just protect a scam during ICO. There is no guarantee that you will scam us the first day after ICO and the tokens will be worthless even if tradeable. Thats why good organised escrow funds are released when specific product milestones are reached. I am really surprised that projects like golem didnt have such a escrow and iconomi invested in it without escrow. this is still wild west investing and people will get punished for it I am sure  I think this is a very serious project with a good business case and team. I will also invest <1 BTC but cant invest more. You have to know that smart money dont invest like wild west style,False

We will share his official audit on our channels once he will publish it (it will be today), because contract final version is already uploaded on a github.  Reason why iconomi invested in a golem without an escrow: it's just a simple game theory/ human psychology. Golem guys are already on blockchain community for a while. Technically blockchain is their topic of chitchat/ topic of real talks/ religion and direction of life in general. They raised couple of million.  Now they have 2 options:  1) Run a way with ETH. But team would sacrifice their long-term reputation, blockchain knowledge, life direction, self-development opportunities. Technically blockchain doors would be closed to them. That means cost/ opportunity cost is extremely high of this option. Also 3000 hunder people funded them. Decent part of these investors know computers really well. They can easily hack systems and find where these guys are located.  2) Use ETH and develop something awesome: increased reputation, you become a role model in a blockchain community/ get approval, your project attracts more and more high status/ wealthy people who showed an interested. It gets even more funding. Also functioning project can make you 1000x more rich than cheesy scam.  In this particular scenario, chosing an option 1 is just a pure stupidity. Opportunity cost is way too high. Since blockchain community members are capable of logical thinking/ are already way more knowledgeable than rest of the population there is super high chance they would go with an option 2 and discard option 1.  Value creation is always better for all stakeholders including yourself than scam attempts. Especially in a field such a blockchain which is like internet 30 years ago. And we are glad to be in exact time where all real action happens.  Game theory is a really awesome thing. Thanks to John Nash. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_game_theory",False

In order to attract a fiat gambler we need:  1) spread the message: 0% house edge casino, fully transparent casino already exists! (through gambling community forums, reddit groups, gambling media portals and other gambling related channels.) Since our casino is the only one in a market which offers such a good conditions, we expect that gamblers will catch our message easily.They already have a lot of frustration with casino transparency, delayed withdrawals and many more issues related to a casino industry)  2) help people to purchase a cryptocurrency (ETH in our case). We will release a lot of tutorials and make sure that they rank high and search engines, gambling community websites. Secondly process is extremely similar to registration process on fiat casino.  Online fiat casino registration process: you register your account, verify it sending your ID, deposit fiat currency, currency appears on your casino's account.  Purchase crypto process: you register on exchange or services such as cashilia. Verify your account sending your ID, deposit/ send fiat currency, crypto appears on your crypto wallet.  So gamblers are pretty much used to this kind of a process. Crypto currency is extremely similar to online casino chips/ fiat.  bottom line: it would not be hard for gamblers to purchase a crypto.  3) Gamblers play on your casino using ETH!  Some global forces which make everything easier: more and more people are getting familiar with a crypto world, therefore its getting easier and easier to attract wider audiences who know how to use crypto.  Regarding predictions/ future forecasts.  2 month ago our whitepaper had really detailed prediction, financial forecast. However we realised that blockchain technology is a totally new industry which has never been before. Therefore we cannot take ""past data"" from other industries and forecast. We erased our forecast realising that a future is totally unpredictable when it comes to blockchains. But we and most of us see a lot of potential here.

Why Ethereum based casino is special, because it can prove it's fairness/ transparency using a blockchain. Gamblers will no longer need to feel that casino is anyhow cheating against them. That's extremely strong advantage ethereum blockchain casinos have.  And another really strong point in value proposition we offer: 0% house edge for luck+skill games.

However not before a start of an ICO which is happening in 6 days It's a peak moment so these days require a lot of resources from all of our team.  Quote from: Douglas Kim on February 22, 2017, 01:56:02 AM How will the shareholders make profits?  EDG token holders can participate in a lottery which has a prize pool of 40% total casino profits every month. In a lottery EDG tokens cannot be lost and participants always win a share of profits. More EDG tokens you have - more ETH you win.  Quote from: no1dead on February 22, 2017, 03:47:52 AM The concept of 0 house edge is awesome, so far ordinary casinos never offer such services, so we need to be more focus on this scheme, the future of gambling.  Yep, we are aiming to develop best gambling product in the market. In terms of transparency and price. 0% house edge is the lowest what casino can offer  Quote from: Maloppo on February 22, 2017, 03:59:20 AM Where to get a profit your casino if you are offers 0% house edge? but it is a new concept in the online gambling. I think it is a great project.  Yes,  catch is: games our casino will offer are games of luck+skill such as Black Jack or Lunar poker. That means, players get a 0% house edge only with a perfect play. However that's not a case for an average player. Take a look at this research: https://wizardofodds.com/image/ask-the-wizard/how-poor-are-bj-players.pdf From Black Jack, player's make mistakes which are equivalent to 0.83% house edge. - that's where a part of our profits are coming from. Another important point: 0% house edge games will attract a lot of players, because they have not seen something similar before. And then casino monetize from a regular games such as Sports Betting. More on a monetization strategy: https://medium.com/edgeless/casino-with-0-house-edge-perfect-marketing-strategy-7c1f2d49beb0#.ym4zywqm7  What do you think about this concept?  Quote from: Alonzo Ewing on February 22, 2017, 06:32:34 AM Do we have the smart contract ETH address available for ICO deposit now?  Or will it be published later?  We are almost finished with a 3rd party external contract auditing. Contracts will be updated and published in upcoming 24 hours. Then people can early schedule parity to invest during a powerhour, so investors would not miss a best price of EDG token.",False

It won't even complete the site's server expenses.  catch is: games our casino will offer are games of luck+skill such as Black Jack or Lunar poker. That means, players get a 0% house edge only with a perfect play. However that's not a case for an average player. Take a look at this research: https://wizardofodds.com/image/ask-the-wizard/how-poor-are-bj-players.pdf  From Black Jack, player's make mistakes which are equivalent to 0.83% house edge. - that's where a part of our profits are coming from.  Another important point: 0% house edge games will attract a lot of players, because they have not seen something similar before. And then casino monetize from a regular games such as Sports Betting.

That means, players get a 0% house edge only with a perfect play. However that's not a case for an average player. Take a look at this research: https://wizardofodds.com/image/ask-the-wizard/how-poor-are-bj-players.pdf  From Black Jack, player's make mistakes which are equivalent to 0.83% house edge. - that's where a part of our profits are coming from.  Another important point: 0% house edge games will attract a lot of players, because they have not seen something similar before. And then casino monetize from a regular games such as Sports Betting.

Social media bounty.  - Protection from cheating bounty participants: every week we will select random 10 people and check whether they are cheating or not using fake accounts/ doing private sharing. Spotted cheaters will be imminently kicked from a bounty program. - Certain bounty proportion will be used to pay extra for bounty participants who report cheaters in a bounty program. - Twitter bounty is reduced to 1 000 000 from 1 500 000 - Facebook bounty is reduced to 1 000 000 from 1500 000  Translation/ local community management bounty.  - Bounty program pool is increased from 2 000 000 to 3 000 000. - Bounty program is split into a translation part and local community management part. Pot distribution: 2 000 000 for translation. 1 000 000 for local community management. In this way we balance/ protect translators who do not manage large communities. For example Japanese translation.  New bounty pool created.  1 000 000 EDG tokens will be distributed as an additional prize for bounty participants. Participants who have given us instant and honest feedback, maintained constant and efficient communication, performed in the bounty program without any attempts to shortcut or cheat (like in facebook or twitter campaigns) and in general been strong supporters/ awesome participants will be rewarded with an additional bonus.  p.s regarding bounty questions - please write us personal message on BTC or join our slack/ telegram so we can avoid spam in ICO related thread.",False

Right now we have 200+ people participating in a bounty program and it's growing every day. That's not so much if you take into consideration number of people participating in a bounty. However payouts of a bounty program will not be instant/ immediate after ICO. Payouts to bounty participants will be paid over time using escrow, so investors can be protected from a risk of bounty participants dumping/ devaluating token. Also it's good for bounty participants because it increases a chance that minimum ICO goal is reached successfully and bounty participants are paid. As mentioned above, details will be announced tomorrow.  200 000 EDG tokens are left out without structured distribution.

Traffic of a casino dropped significantly and profitability decreased. Also with such a randomness generation speed, vDice cannot wager a lot of money. People simply bet less because they need to wait more while outcome is decided.  - During a first week of sales, they gave a huge bonus for first wave investors. They purchased a lot of tokens for cheaper price and dumped them immediately lowering the price.  - vDice is on extremely small exchange (liqui). Because vDice is offering a profit sharing token, large exchanges would not take them. Being on large exchange naturally increases the price because it provdes a lot of liquidity  Our project deeply analysed strong and weak sides of a vDice and learned a lot, so we can improve. Here is a list of additional readings how we address questions above:  faster randomness generation so game can be playable:  https://medium.com/edgeless/finally-we-will-have-fully-transparent-casino-in-2017-7ef1ecd845a#.rmt9qm5fc https://medium.com/edgeless/ethereum-blockchain-casinos-are-extremely-slow-solution-aaa2e3e95208#.2axgp66ga  crowdsale structure without offering insanely large bonuses on a first week, making inequality among investors:  edgeless.io https://github.com/EdgelessCasino/White_paper/blob/master/White_Paper.pdf  token value backing making sure it has a chance to appear on a large exchange such as Poloniex and fit to their legal requirements:   https://medium.com/edgeless/important-changes-on-a-white-paper-and-business-model-2017-02-07-17a2b61de689#.qm6pxhwrx https://medium.com/edgeless/edgeless-lounge-fc11c6274259#.1fpdylhsu  Quote from: inoes on February 14, 2017, 04:42:49 AM    its you already read about this project ?? so far im still with positif think for this project because im already finnd out about edgeless.  and dont forget about TOKEN market,edgless already listed on there  Thank's for your support  Quote from: Kaznachej123 on February 11, 2017, 03:06:10 PM   WoW Project Edgeless Casino another gaming token What is the difference and what are the advantages of your tokens, and tokens vDice? Subscribe to you in the tweeter and facebook will follow developments!    Yes  Ethereum Smart Contracts can be a total game changer for a whole gambling industry, therefore so many projects are raising in this area. Seeing this potential from our first project: etherslots.win we decided to create more powerful.  A short comparison table of Edgeless and vDice.  vDice - fully transparent dice  it's a first ethereum dice. Concept is pretty much similar to any dice casino, however it's using Ethereum Smart Contracts which makes a game fully transparent - that's a game changer. However ethereum blockchain does not have required transaction speeds for gambling dapp - it takes 1 - 2 minutes for vDice to generate a random number and decide a winner. From user experience, its really bad (hopefully ethereum blockchain will improve and transactions are going to be faster) and for now there is no way to scale a business, compete with bitcoin/ fiat casinos. It also offers a profit sharing model which is nice but might lead to legal troubles in the future. Also token has a hard time being accepted to large exchanges. Exchanges do not want to take profit sharing tokens, it's too risky for them from legal point of view.  Edgeless - next generation gambling experience  Edgeless will be on Ethereum Blockchain which guarantees a transparency.  Edgeless offers luck + skill games (Black Jack, Lunar Poker) with a 0% house edge. This is a totally new gambling concept, it's like next generation gambling experience. Idea is not new, people have been discussing it for years. However it was not possible to implement it on fiat running casino - operational costs are too high. Thank's to blockchain, crypto operational costs extremely low in comparison to fiat online casino - it makes possible to run a 0% house edge casino (0% edge luck+skill games profitability is similar to 0.83% edge pure luck game: https://wizardofodds.com/image/ask-the-wizard/how-poor-are-bj-players.pdf  Also 0% house edge games is a perfect marketing to attract masses of gamblers: https://medium.com/edgeless/casino-with-0-house-edge-perfect-marketing-strategy-7c1f2d49beb0#.9ufrf25j8  Edgeless is using different transparency mechanism (people will not need to wait 2 minutes) which makes casino way much faster and more user-friendly. Therefore we can compete with fiat casinos. More info: https://medium.com/edgeless/ethereum-blockchain-casinos-are-extremely-slow-solution-aaa2e3e95208#.c38fktdxt  Edgeless DOES NOT offer profit sharing token. We are more safe from legal side and our token has way much higher chance to appear on large exchanges.  Our token is backed by a monthly lottery game where EDG tokens can be used win a share (40%) of casino's profit.  I think vDice had a first mover advantage, and while we are not first on Ethereum, we had to learn from vDice mistakes and improve all other areas of our business model. We are aiming to compete with fiat online casinos - because that's where real casino market is!

Technically a smart contract is uploaded to the blockchain and starts working. It will be impossible to change it or interference a smart contract while crowd sale is active. Because everyone has an original copy of the smart contract - principle is same as BTC transaction. Same method was use be other famous blockchain projects: Golem https://golem.network/crowdfunding.html  Main features of our crowd sale smart contract:  - once a smart contact received ETH from an investor, contract automatically sends EDG tokens in exchange. Everything happens immediately and real time. - investors can start using EDG tokens once crowd sale is finished - if minimum goal is not reached (50 000 ETH) smart contract automatically sends ETH back to all investors and burns all EDG tokens - unsold EDG tokens are automatically burned by a smart contract  More info how smart contracts work and perform escrow functions: https://www.ethereum.org/  When it comes to a bounty program - we use traditional escrow. Ransu Salovaara from Token Market. Right now he is an escrow for Chornos Bank. He will be our bounty fund escrow and disctribute tokens for bounty participants based on their results.

Reason why our slots are spinning for 2 minutes, it's because it uses same method as all Ethereum casinos. Random generation through oraclize. It requires 4 requests to the blockchain for random number generation. And that's why our slots, vDice or any other Ethereum casino is extremely slow.  Our new model will use blockchain only 2 times and non of them are going to be related to random number generation. However these requests will validate whether it's a real random number or not.  A short summary: it will take 2 hashed seeds. One from player, one from casino and smart contract will bend into a number which will be used for randomness generation. Right now all bitcoin casinos are using a same method, but they can easily cheat. Because they can provide their seed as 2nd entity and know player's seed before hand (that's the method 999dice.com is using to cheat against own players). In our model, casino will always provide own seed 1st and process will be guided using ethereum smart contracts. That's why casino cannot cheat without being spotted on the blockchain.  Here we have detailed explanation how Edgeless random generation will work:  https://medium.com/edgeless/finally-we-will-have-fully-transparent-casino-in-2017-7ef1ecd845a#.hveoaugq2 https://medium.com/edgeless/ethereum-blockchain-casinos-are-extremely-slow-solution-aaa2e3e95208#.47hdjvmdy  Quote from: fantoos on February 11, 2017, 07:08:06 PM I was interested to read about 0 % house edge at the moment because without casino may be run but what benefit will I get as investor. Where the all revenue of profit will come in case casino doesn't charge any fee for its services through platform to perform gambling activities. any answer would be great though I also am reading the whole opening page slowly to catch the idea.  catch is:  Our games are not pure luck games. We will offer games of luck + skill such as Black Jack or Lunar Poker. That means, casino makes profit from imperfect play of the player. On average players make mistakes for 0.83%. So 0% house edge luck + skill games is equivalent to 0.83% pure luck game such as roulette. Data behind Black Jack: https://wizardofodds.com/image/ask-the-wizard/how-poor-are-bj-players.pdf  Concept is not new. People have been talking about 0% already for a while, however it's extremely hard to implement on fiat currency casinos - due to high operation costs. Thank's to blockchain crytocurrency - casino operational costs are extremely reduced and it becomes possible to create a casino which offers 0% house edge and has absolute transparancy.

Seeing this potential from our first project: etherslots.win we decided to create more powerful.  A short comparison table of Edgeless and vDice.  vDice - fully transparent dice  it's a first ethereum dice. Concept is pretty much similar to any dice casino, however it's using Ethereum Smart Contracts which makes a game fully transparent - that's a game changer. However ethereum blockchain does not have required transaction speeds for gambling dapp - it takes 1 - 2 minutes for vDice to generate a random number and decide a winner. From user experience, its really bad (hopefully ethereum blockchain will improve and transactions are going to be faster) and for now there is no way to scale a business, compete with bitcoin/ fiat casinos. It also offers a profit sharing model which is nice but might lead to legal troubles in the future. Also token has a hard time being accepted to large exchanges. Exchanges do not want to take profit sharing tokens, it's too risky for them from legal point of view.  Edgeless - next generation gambling experience  Edgeless will be on Ethereum Blockchain which guarantees a transparency.  Edgeless offers luck + skill games (Black Jack, Lunar Poker) with a 0% house edge. This is a totally new gambling concept, it's like next generation gambling experience. Idea is not new, people have been discussing it for years. However it was not possible to implement it on fiat running casino - operational costs are too high. Thank's to blockchain, crypto operational costs extremely low in comparison to fiat online casino - it makes possible to run a 0% house edge casino (0% edge luck+skill games profitability is similar to 0.83% edge pure luck game: https://wizardofodds.com/image/ask-the-wizard/how-poor-are-bj-players.pdf  Also 0% house edge games is a perfect marketing to attract masses of gamblers: https://medium.com/edgeless/casino-with-0-house-edge-perfect-marketing-strategy-7c1f2d49beb0#.9ufrf25j8  Edgeless is using different transparency mechanism (people will not need to wait 2 minutes) which makes casino way much faster and more user-friendly. Therefore we can compete with fiat casinos. More info: https://medium.com/edgeless/ethereum-blockchain-casinos-are-extremely-slow-solution-aaa2e3e95208#.c38fktdxt  Edgeless DOES NOT offer profit sharing token. We are more safe from legal side and our token has way much higher chance to appear on large exchanges.  Our token is backed by a monthly lottery game where EDG tokens can be used win a share (40%) of casino's profit.  I think vDice had a first mover advantage, and while we are not first on Ethereum, we had to learn from vDice mistakes and improve all other areas of our business model. We are aiming to compete with fiat online casinos - because that's where real casino market is!  So, what do you think about our concept?",False

There are several ways how Edgeless Casino can be profitable. Edgeless Casino provides games which depend on LUCK+SKILL and Sports Betting.  The first two games provided will be Blackjack and Video Poker. Both games are played with a combination of LUCK and SKILL. That means players make choices and either play well or poorly. To give an example of such a situation:  Blackjack: House has a 6 card. The player has 16. The player wants to collect at least 17 and hits for one more card. - BAD MISTAKE. The player just made a huge error, because, 12+ against 6 ALWAYS STAYS. (according to Blackjack basic strategy)  An average player does not play ‘the perfect game’ therefore, in the long run the casino makes a profit from his mistakes.  An analogy can be taken from poker. A new player is playing against a Pro. Both have equal probability conditions - 50% vs. 50%. However, the Pro player makes better choices and the new player makes bad decisions, and in the long run, the Pro wins.  Look at this EXTENSIVE RESEARCH  from players’ mistakes in Blackjack - on average they give away an 0.83% edge to the casino. https://wizardofodds.com/image/ask-the-wizard/how-poor-are-bj-players.pdf  And that's exactly what the casino will earn - 0.83% which is the same as playing dice with an 0.83% house edge  The second stream of profit comes from sports betting. Sports Betting connects bettors against each other, charging vig / juice / rake from each side for their bets. In this area, the casino will earn 4% from all money wagered. An analogy can again be taken from poker. Imagine two players are betting 10$ against each other and the rake is 1%. So, they are actually betting 9.90$ and winner gets 19.80$.  More information on how sports betting is making money: http://www.biasharainsight.com/2016/01/how-do-sport-betting-sites-make-money/  To sum up - the first stream of profits is from games of luck+skill. The second stream of profits is from Edgeless casino with 0% edge games and is a very strong marketing channel for attracting players to Edgeless Casino. Gamblers can enjoy fair betting conditions, and a good percentage of visitors will do Sports Betting which generates 4% returns to the Casino.  The concept has not literally come out of the blue - discussions on zero edge casinos are already occurring in the community.  https://www.bitedge.co/blog/0-house-edge-provably-fair-and-trustless-gambling/  https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinGambling/comments/36z3wi/which_is_the_lowest_house_edge_fair_bitcoin_casino/  p.s added this question to FAQ, announcement post.",False

There are several ways how Edgeless Casino can be profitable. Edgeless Casino provides games which depend on LUCK+SKILL and Sports Betting.  The first two games provided will be Blackjack and Video Poker. Both games are played with a combination of LUCK and SKILL. That means players make choices and either play well or poorly. To give an example of such a situation:  Blackjack: House has a 6 card. The player has 16. The player wants to collect at least 17 and hits for one more card. - BAD MISTAKE. The player just made a huge error, because, 12+ against 6 ALWAYS STAYS. (according to Blackjack basic strategy)  An average player does not play ‘the perfect game’ therefore, in the long run the casino makes a profit from his mistakes.  An analogy can be taken from poker. A new player is playing against a Pro. Both have equal probability conditions - 50% vs. 50%. However, the Pro player makes better choices and the new player makes bad decisions, and in the long run, the Pro wins.  Look at this EXTENSIVE RESEARCH  from players’ mistakes in Blackjack - on average they give away an 0.83% edge to the casino. https://wizardofodds.com/image/ask-the-wizard/how-poor-are-bj-players.pdf  And that's exactly what the casino will earn - 0.83% which is the same as playing dice with an 0.83% house edge  The second stream of profit comes from sports betting. Sports Betting connects bettors against each other, charging vig / juice / rake from each side for their bets. In this area, the casino will earn 4% from all money wagered. An analogy can again be taken from poker. Imagine two players are betting 10$ against each other and the rake is 1%. So, they are actually betting 9.90$ and winner gets 19.80$.  More information on how sports betting is making money: http://www.biasharainsight.com/2016/01/how-do-sport-betting-sites-make-money/  To sum up - the first stream of profits is from games of luck+skill. The second stream of profits is from Edgeless casino with 0% edge games and is a very strong marketing channel for attracting players to Edgeless Casino. Gamblers can enjoy fair betting conditions, and a good percentage of visitors will do Sports Betting which generates 4% returns to the Casino.  The concept has not literally come out of the blue - discussions on zero edge casinos are already occurring in the community.  https://www.bitedge.co/blog/0-house-edge-provably-fair-and-trustless-gambling/  https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinGambling/comments/36z3wi/which_is_the_lowest_house_edge_fair_bitcoin_casino/",False

You wont make any money on sports betting, no legit casino's do. In fact the lose on the sports gambling quite often, the only people who make money on sports gambling is local bookies who make it on the juice or vig. However you slice it you know nothing about the casino business. Take it from me everyone, Red flags everywhere and the stench of noob acting pro is strong.  Frank Lefty Rosenthal signing out.",False

I did my time little boy and made millions doing it, Im not here to argue with you or prove my point. But the fact remains the same. No money gets made from sports betting for casinos and you proclaiming that that's where you're going to make your money is insightful into the ""casinio businessman"" you are. I predict a huge failure and massive total losses for anyone who invests here.   Frank Lefty Rosenthal signing out.",False
