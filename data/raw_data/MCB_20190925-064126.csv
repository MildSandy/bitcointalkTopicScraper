What is the point of MCB token within ecosystem other than discounts for services? If your fees are already low its not like you going to earn a lot cutting those fees, so holding tokens for that looks kinda pointless. Only real thing there is deposits rates increase, but holding volotile token just to make 2% more on deposits doesn't sound so good, unless your deposit i much larger than amount of tokens you owe. What is really a reason to buy your token when you can access all bank services without it?  Since your token is utility token bank profits are not going to be distributed amongst holders? Or will there be another mechanism to distribute profits? Will it be tied to ammount of tokens you hold or to your total stake in all currencies combined that you deposit to the project?

Loan from the bank to the client on the security of its crypto currency. Loan within a few minutes, the process will be automated. The size of the loan will depend on the amount of collateral the borrower pays (70% of the deposit of the crypto currency). % of the loan - 10%. The loan can be anonymous. Credits are available only to holders of at least 6 000 MCB tokens. 2. Loan from customer to customer (P2P). Issuance of a loan after the creditor confirms the borrower's application. Terms and terms are set individually by the lender and the borrower. The creditor is provided with the borrower's history of previously obtained loans. Credits are available only to holders of at least 6 000 MCB tokens. For investors, the main advantage will be access to all the bank's tools, depending on the number of possession of the tokens, the discount for services and increased cashback increases, as well as additional bonuses in the form of gadgets - payment rings, multi-digital cards and other serices. Due to the fact that the number of tokens is limited and depending on the status of the client in the system, the tokens are frozen for 160 days, the tokens available for sale on the market will decrease, and in connection with the growing popularity of using our service and the growing demand for tokens MCB - their price will increase.",False
