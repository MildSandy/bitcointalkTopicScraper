To introduce myself in a way (but still to refrain from exposing my real identity for obvious reasons) - I am a business owner with branches in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, and my points of sale are focused on end-customers. Your project is interesting for me as both investor and business user.  I started following thread when there were already a few pages, but decided to register in order to write to you here. No other project has raised my interest that much in order to make me post. Now, after the Tesla campaign you have and the Forbes article, it seems even more promising. On purpose I am not writing you a direct message via e-mail or your site, because I want to get clarification on my questions publicly, in front of everyone. To be honest, I don't like media such as Telegram for such things - I think your decision to kind of abandon this forum and chose Telegram as primary method was not right. If the answers to my questions are satisfying and complete, I would suggest a phone call and a meeting to discuss a potential business and/or investment relationship.  Since in many business spheres the competition is high, it is exceptional customer experience that matters, and this is why I always put myself in my end-customer's shoes. I also apologize in advance if some of my questions were answered elsewhere - I did, however, do my best to go through each and every post, your presentation and the WP.  From retail/business perspective: How does retail exactly receive payment in fiat? From where does the bank transaction come from? Will each country in which Eterbank is doing business with retail have a bank account open? How long does it take for retail to receive the actual money in the bank account after confirmation? How is it achieved that the confirmation is instant? I thought in crypto one must wait for certain confirmations. Are transactions (payments to retail) irreversible (to make sure the money will not be blocked/disputed etc. after retail already provided service / delivered or sold product)? Are there any sum limits? Does business need to have any crypto account to receive any token/coin/cryptocurrency? What security methods will be used to avoid scam/fraud (fake confirmations of payment)? Do you already have retailers that are aware of the project/offered Eterbank solution and have readiness to use it? From which countries if yes?  From customer perspective: Is anonymity guaranteed (identity cannot be revealed via transactions to the business owner or 3rd party)? Is anonymity guaranteed in front of Eterbank, or a customer needs to provide personal data when registering (real name, address...)? One of the bases of crypto is anonymity. I am asking because the wording KYC is mentioned on many occasions. Trust me, in the countries I do business in, people would not like it being mandatory. Are transactions reversible (i.e. can money be refunded or disputed if the product or service was not delivered or as expected)? Does the customer need to wait for any transaction confirmation after payment (before receiving the product or service)? If yes, how long? What exchange rate will be used for e.g. BTC/USD during payment? Is there any conversion/spread fee? What are the exact benefits you are mentioning (discounts for token holders)? Can you share more specifics? Will there be a tipping option? If yes, would business receive the tip in fiat or on a crypto/wallet/Eterbank account? Will there be an option for offline payments (e.g. that are usually available for credit card owners when on airplane flights, when paying road tolls)? This would avoid the problem of temporary internet connectivity issues. What if a customer doesn't want to pay in one of the crypto currencies (e.g. afraid of crypto volatility), can he have some form of EUR or USD account from which he would be able to pay? It seems your project is concerned only about volatility problem for businesses, but not for customers. And customer satisfaction is one of the main business focuses. In order to be able to pay in crypto, does the customer need to send crypto from a hard wallet to an Eterbank address? If yes, will Eterbank wallet allow exchange between crpyto currencies as e.g. Monaco (MCO) solution does?  From both business&customer perspective: How is the payment actually done? Scanning QR/barcodes, NFC/PayWave technology/contactless/chip? In which countries exactly Eterbank will start to operate? Will it include the ones I am doing business in? On which kind of platform / hardware / OS will the solution be working? How will the potential threat of double spend or similar be prevented?  From investor perspective: (Why) will the Eterbank coin/token actually be necessary when the product goes live, if the customers  are supposed to spend e.g. BTC, ETH... Is the 1% transaction fee paid by business the only revenue source? Do all holders receive proportional dividends based on holded amounts? You are mentioning proven track record in delivering mobile technology products. Could you share some specific examples? Where is your business/company registered?  From everyone's perspective: Why you? Why your solution and not someone else's? Why are you the best? Why exactly your product? Are you positive you are the only one offering such services? Are there any plans to involve some form of payment card (also referring to the question regarding offline payments from customer perspective)? What is POsS you are referring to in your WP? Is there any airdrop procedure of distributing tokens planned, in order to spread the word faster? Why is exactly the Waves platform used to issue tokens? There not many exchanges trading with Waves or tokens issued on that network as per my knowledge.  Thank you in advance.",False

If you buy a pizza for 10 euros worth of ETH, you are actually paying 10 euros worth of ETH - the Pizza place is charged a transaction fee for using the service. This is a very important concept for us, the point of crypto is to pay less fees and less middlemen, therefore our network is designed to unburden users and generate revenue from businesses - generating revenue from us.",False
