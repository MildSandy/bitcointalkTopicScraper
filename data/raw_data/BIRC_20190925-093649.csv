Transferring from the high energy consumption of PoW to the energy-efficient PoS is the core goal of the Ethereum development team.  The blockchain system protected by the consensus mechanism PoW was proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto. It needs powerful computing and a high-performance internet infrastructure. According to statistics, the electrical power consumed by global miners for Bitcoin mining is more than the yearly electricity output of 159 nations.  PoS is a system which issues additional coins to miners who already own coins for that system; coins are awarded according to coin age, and coin age is calculated by total amount and duration of time the coins have been held by the miners. In PoS, profit from mining and coin age are in direct proportion, profit is not determined by the performance level of computers.  https://i.imgur.com/cN6OSLV.jpg?1  PoI Achieves a Business Value of Cryptocurrency  In contrast to PoW and PoS, blockchain startup Business Interactive Reward Coin(BIRC) proposes a brand-new mining concept, ‘Proof of Interaction (PoI)’. In PoI, mining is performed by completing ‘interactive actions’, and profit is calculated by ‘total number of interactions’ rather than by computing power or coin age. For these two indexes, BIRC defines the interaction scenarios of shops and guests. This is completely different from PoW and PoS. PoW and PoS are solutions for blockchain technology, but PoI is a practical solution for offline business activities. It can solve some of the problems of offline business activities that have existed for a long time, for example having no substantial reward for shop commenting or review, O2O inefficiency, or issues with the credibility of centralized commenting mechanism, among others. At the same time, under this technology architecture, cryptocurrency applications can be integrated into daily life more quickly.  Every interaction scenario has three necessary interactive actions (1. Review, 2. Comment, 3. Post an image) and one or more additional designated interactive actions customized according to different scenarios. For example, there is a designated ‘watching’ action for exhibition activities, and a ‘running’ action for fitness centers. These application scenarios and actions will be constructed progressively on the BIRC’s base layer protocol.  Constructing an Offline Business Ecosystem, Speeding up cryptocurrency business applications  BIRC that proposes Proof of Interaction will release the Business Open API to 3rd party application platforms for two-way connection. For example, POS system developers can connect with BIRC, and in this way interactions in restaurants can be recorded on the BIRC blockchain in real time. Developers of IoT-supporting treadmills can feedback ‘run-data’ through API, then PoI can issue rewards according to pre-defined scenario.  Compared with the flourishing blockchain technology, the blockchain-application field still lacks a ‘killer application’ for people willing to use cryptocurrency. Currently, cryptocurrency is still just financial hype for some engineers and financial speculators. BIRC will constitute a complete offline business ecosystem with its Business Open API. It is estimated that by 2020, the barriers to using cryptocurrency will have been reduced significantly and the last mile of cryptocurrency application will be achieved.

LTD.Hong Kong. BIRC comes from the abbreviation of “Business Interactive Reward Coin”. The nature of BIRC will be based on interactions between consumers and shops, then a brand new mining system of cryptocurrency will be developed. It will be the first “cross-industry”, “O2O integration”, “cross-national boarder” cryptocurrency application of new form in the global market. Now there are already more than 1,500 stores in the RE union.  In the future, we will collaborate with all local or overseas partner shops which join RE union now and in the future and create a unprecedented two-way O2O cycling ecosystem with the key feature “physical interactive action mining” of BIRC.   Market Overview and Current Solution   Now the commenting mechanism of stores is constituted by My Business and Local Guide from Google. After registering Google My Business, system will show related information to consumers when they survey Google or Google Map; on the other hand, normal consumers can join Local Guide. Consumers with Local Guide title go to shops which registered Google My Business and do designate actions, for instance taking photos and uploading, rating and commenting, they can get points. Their Local Guide titles can upgrade with accumulated points, just like upgrading systems in videogames.  Consumers who provide these comments get nothing except points, ranks and badges. In other words, as Local Guides, these consumers are main providers of these data, but they can’t get corresponding rewards. The rewards are relatively insignificant even if those consumers get them.    https://i.imgur.com/mYOSAMA.png?3  https://i.imgur.com/cN6OSLV.jpg  https://i.imgur.com/KHPstB0.jpg  https://i.imgur.com/HR57WFC.png    OUR VISION   A local business platform better than Google's My Business  Because of open and fairness, the commenting function of Google's My Business has gradually replaced the promoted posts from traditional bloggers. Plus Local Guide mechanism which can accumulate points, My Business has already became a useful tool for local shops. BIRC salutes Google and releases a commenting mechanism which is more attractive. A cryptocurrency acquisition mechanism based on concept of interactive mining will change interaction between guest and shop into substantial profit. It is expected to compete with Google in three years, and build better O2O platforms for local shops together!   In the future planning, BIRC API will have a structure of 3 layers  BIRC Local Business APIs will be enabled in 2020. 3rd party developers can develop reward systems or other creative .  Data Layer: Data storage structure based on blockchain technology. Basic information of shops, exchange records and reward date will be stored in the blockchain for access from front APIs. Application Layer: These are real APIs open to public. There will be four API collections of different application layers. Store API will provide access of RE alliance shop information for 3rd parties. Location API will provide GPS information of shops and activities. Account API will provide information of interactions between guests and shops for big data analysis and better service experience. Exchange API will provide query/send/receive functions of BIRC. Business Layer: Tripadvisor will be our potentially collaborating goal of 3rd party application in early stage. We will thoroughly integrate platforms which are already existed, and then build a brand new business model. Everyone in the world will have opportunity to join interaction reward and create an all new economy ecosystem.   https://i.imgur.com/zsPk0kR.jpg   API Economy  Connect different platforms and applications with open protocols Generate infinite business value  Increase value of service platform through opening of API, then an ecosystem will be built. “API Economy” is coming!” eBay opened API in 2000 and connected about 2,000 application programs until now. About 60% of exchanges come from API. SoftBank’ “Pepper” uses open API. It provides SDK to developers for free. In this way it can accelerate the rich content of application software and promote marketing sale.   https://i.imgur.com/iH0CMoF.png  https://i.imgur.com/rXbz1cK.png  https://i.imgur.com/cjuA4aE.png   Token Allocation  https://i.imgur.com/9yEcPUU.png  Our Team   https://i.imgur.com/JwdWJR2.jpg?1    Official Websiter:https://birc.io  Social Media Twitter : https://twitter.com/bircoins Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/BIRCOINs/ Telegram : https://t.me/BIRC_Official Youtube : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbW-KH2BFjWVSq83nCuELDQ?view=  Lite Paper English : https://birc.io/static/files/BIRC_Whitepaper_lite_EN_v1.pdf Chinese : https://birc.io/static/files/BIRC_Whitepaper_lite_TW_v1.pdf  Full Whitepaper English : https://birc.io/static/files/BIRC_Whitepaper_full_EN_v1.pdf Chinese : https://birc.io/static/files/BIRC_Whitepaper_full_TW_v1.pdf",False
