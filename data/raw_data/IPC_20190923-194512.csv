But i also have some Questions:  1.) Why do you use ERC20 token instead of ERC23 token?

Is there any bounty program?  3.) What will be your first Country to start your Business? I read international and global, but where you will do your first steps and why?

In order to choose the right ERC standard our team has considered the most relevant ERC standards, which include ERC20, ERC223, ERC721 and others. Each of them has its pros and cons. The team decided to use the ERC20 standard for several reasons. Currently ERC223 is more like a proposal than a standard and the proposal discussion is still ongoing thereby bringing many risks like security issues, its undecided signature or uncompatibility to other smart contracts. Transfering ERC223 tokens to contracts creates a named function on that contract but since that function's name is currently undecided it is not possible to write such a contract and we would have to wait for the final standard to be defined.  Furthermore it will cause problems for multi-sig wallets and contracts that have not implemented the tokenFallback function which depends on blind token transfers to contracts. The ERC223 has less applications for the token holder due to its lack of compatibility to some current smart contracts (e.g. token exchange contracts).  The main goal of ERC223 is to prevent sending tokens to contracts that do not expect ERC223 tokens and enable token deposit from contracts by creating only one transaction. Lost tokens are most likely stuck in the token contract itself since many token holders accidentally confuse the target address with token contract address. Unlike most others the ERC20 token,  the (IPC token) contract protects the user from this mistake by not accepting ipc tokens from anyone and therefore making the mentioned transactions unsuccesful.  Additionally the contract will provide the approveAndCall function which makes it possible to enable token exchanges within one transaction instead of two (cost effective).  2.) Our team is considering bounty programs but has not yet decided whether or not and how exactly the PAYSURA bounty program should/ can look like. In the case of a decision pro bounty program PAYSURA will communicate it via Website and all relevant channels.  3.) Due to the blockchain fundamentals scalability (international and global) is given at any time. Nonetheless PAYSURA intends to start in the German e-commerce market at first by expanding to other countries as soon as possible.  We hope that we could answer your questions but feel free to get back to us in case of any further uncertainties.  Kind regards  PAYSURA",False

THe PAYSURA Team is based in Germany and hence our team is facing all kind of reward programs in Germany. That is why it was possible for us to figure out all kind of problems that traditional loyalty programs and current blockchain based reward systems are facing.  Here is a summary of the advantages of PAYSURA solving these problems:  PAYSURA is providing the reward pool. Every merchant and also our community will have the opportunity to use a unit in the reward pool without having any development know how, without caring of any security issues. It will be all developed by PAYSURA so that many costs on merchants side can be safed  The whole infrastructure and the algorithm for calculating the reward will be self-regulated and hosted by PAYSURA. In Germany it is a big issue that customer data is often sold or shared. PAYSURA will not sell customer data to third parties. PAYSURA will not track any customer behavior or have any influence on it. It will be possible to collect IPC for products but also services like car sharing or insurances and many more  PAYSURA is a full community oriented project hence PAYSURA is reserving 85 % (!) of IPC for the community and only 10 % of IPC will be for the Dev-Team. 5 % of IPC will be for advisory and investment purpose.  For more information, feel free to ask.",False
