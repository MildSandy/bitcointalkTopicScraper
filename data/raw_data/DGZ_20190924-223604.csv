Dogezer would be utilizing Agrello to perform KYC for team members if project owner requires so, and will be ensuring that legally binding agreements between parties are backed with KYC and signed with Agrello ID.  Agrello is an Estonian blockchain startup, developing business-ready smart contract solutions. Agrello builds an AI powered graphical interface for the creation and management of smart contracts by users without legal or coding skills. Agrello ICO finished in August of 2017 with around 30,000,000 USD raised.  We are sure that Agrello solution would help us to bring Dogezer to the next level!",False

Dogezer is a platform that integrates the tools people need to work together on innovative projects, with the ability to use project-specific tokens to reward results and incentivize collaboration.  Tokens are issued at the beginning to project participants. At the end, the tokens are bought back from the participants with the revenue earned. This means that companies using Dogezer don’t need to seek outside funding before they begin work. Smart contracts handle the tokens and buy-back, which means people from around the world can join together to build products and trust they will be compensated properly.  Dogezar is targeting entrepreneurs, software engineers, UI/UX designers, artists, salespersons, marketing specialists, and others involved in the creation, promotion and support of software.  “We at Dogezer are aiming to provide world-class security for all the users of our platform, and the enhanced identity verification and security system from Rivetz will really help us to achieve that goal,” CEO Alex Kozlov said.  Rivetz will make it easy for Dogezer participants to make use of the trusted enclave inside billions of devices. “We envision the Dogezer platform and its app developers being able to incorporate the Rivetz security platform into their content, to give a safer user experience,” Rivetz CEO Steven Sprague said. “Working together, we will seek to integrate our high-caliber security product into the Dogezer ecosystem.”  https://medium.com/@dogezercom/rivetz-partners-with-dogezer-to-do-software-together-56160934f421",False

His words are: “This is actually quite similar to how MakerDAO launched. I fully support this kind of mechanism.”  In attempt to overcome some of the problems current ICO market has, Vitalik Buterin and his team came out with the concept of DAICO. The idea is based on the merging concepts of DAO with the ICO concept, where investors can control the way how funds are withdrawn from the smartcontract.  While this concept really solves some of the questions and is a step forward towards a more reasonable ICO market, we feel that there are still some challenges to be handled. Most of these questions are related to the way how disciplined should be investors to really make reasonable decisions, and what will happen if short term motivation of investors prevails long term product development goals (Would investors initiate the refund, if the valuation of all tokens is less than the valuation of ETH which can be received as a refund? Do we expect the market to rebalance for this situation, making the price of all project tokens to be always equal or better than the price of ETH left on a smartcontract, and if it falls down — is a project closed almost immediately?)  We here at Dogezer would like to propose a different approach to solve the same set of problems:  1. Project team generates their token and defines the basic price for their token (e.g. 0.001 ETH per token). 2. The ETH/$ value of all tokens generated is enough for the project to complete the development, or more realistically, to make the project reach the break-even point. (With some reserve in mind). 3. The tokens are not for SALE by project owners. The smartcontract, which holds the tokens, doesn’t really have the “payable” function. *** Note the variation below **** 4. But tokens inside the smartcontract can be used to pay for the job being done by developers, designers, managers, salespersons and others working on the product. 5. These payments are available for review by a third party (potential investors) which could validate that the amount paid is reasonable and the project really moves in the right direction. For example, every issue in the project issue tracker is recorded into a public ledger with information on what that issue is and associated transaction. 6. Such payment can happen exclusively in the project tokens, but, if required, can happen as a combination of project tokens and traditionally established fiat or cryptocurrencies (may be outside of the publicly accessible ledger) 7. People who have earned the coins are free to sell these coins on an open market to multiple investors (for example, through EtherDelta or a separate smartcontract as described below). 8. Investors are buying the tokens from people who actually put effort to move the product further, rather than buying them from the project owner.  Optionally, to ensure that there is a demand from investors to buy tokens from developers, investors can send funds to another smartcontract — a smartcontract used to demonstrate the interest of the crowd towards the project:  Developers can send “sell” their tokens to this smartcontract for ETH stored in it. Investors can withdraw funds from that contract after some period of time (for example 1 month) if they feel they don’t want to be a part of this project anymore.  As a result, there is no actual “ICO” event — but there is something which we call an “Iterative Investment”. Investors are buying only when the project progresses forward. Chances that the funds are misused are minimized. On the early stages, project owners overpay developers paying them more in “project tokens” than they would normally pay in dollars. Developers sell that to investors with discounts to account for the risk taken. On further stages, when it is clear that the project is moving in the right direction — these premiums/discounts become smaller and smaller.  In case if project nature requires some real funds for some asset (not lambos) — then a smartcontract may be adjusted to release a fixed amount of tokens for sale proportionally to the funds spent to pay development team.  The biggest problem in this concept is the need to be able to review transactions to really confirm that the token payments done are matching the real job done. At https://dogezer.com we solve that by providing our own set of tools and a special role of a “Watcher” in a team to be able to track the progress. Other solutions may require manual logging of a task completed into each token transaction or publicly accessible report being periodically published by the project owner.

In addition to this, every project is assigned a rating, which is based on how active, responsive and fair to team members this project owner has been. Every user is assigned a ""karma"" that describes how positive, fair, reliable and cooperative that person has been. These mechanisms are utilized to improve users-to-projects matching and to build effective and reliable teams that will drive projects to success. It is expected that hiring a user for a single issue or task will be a somewhat rare case on Dogezer. It will be more common to build a team of people with appropriate skills who express interest in the project, and then distribute tasks within such team. The task distribution can be based on the project owner’s suggestions, interest of a team member, or through auctions where team members can compete with each other, encouraging a faster resolution and/or a cheaper price. Projects may have multiple teams within the main team. For example: management team, core development team, extended development team, design team, etc. The project owner defines the teams and team permissions. Users are then invited to join one or more teams within the project and can then be moved from one team to another by the project owner. The project owner’s role is also not fully fixed. If required, the project owner can invite more people to join a special “Project Owners” team and reassign some of his responsibilities to these people.

We firmly believe that the following decentralization tendencies will only get stronger: • Wide usage of crypto currencies in every aspect of our lives • More and more independent workers - people who prefer to choose an independent career as opposed to a traditional career with an established company • More and more jobs will become remote jobs crossing the borders of countries and continents • More and more companies will become “no office” companies or will be completely virtual companies operating with the help of crypto currencies separately from the regular economy Dogezer will contribute to that future by providing a tool for virtual companies and individual contributors to work together in a complete, secure and effective ecosystem which welcomes the use of crypto currencies.

The task tracker, named DoIssues, provides all of the functionality of competitive software, such as Jira, and is able to support a number of development processes.

When an Issue is completed, the project owner, or someone assigned by him, will review the Issue and will either accept it, request additional changes, or negotiate the payment with the Issue assignee. If negotiations fail and no agreement is reached, active project members are requested to come out with what should be a payment for the provided work. Each issue belongs to an “Iteration” which is a phase, stage or sprint of the project. Each “Iteration” can also have a budget assigned to it, which is distributed between participating team members basing on the project owner feedback, statistics on resolved issues and valuable comments, and suggestions from active project members.

To speed up such an event, we are going to use a part of the finances collected on ITO to give additional bonuses to individual contributors to get the selected projects executed. In other words – Dogezer will be sponsoring a number of projects on the platform to speed up these projects development.  Our primary objective is to get as many users as possible on the platform and to ensure that the platform community is active.  Our secondary objective is to ensure that the community is flourishing and more and more connections are established through the platform. These connections will eventually result in new ideas and new completed projects. We will be organizing and supporting conferences, competitions, meetups, hackathons and other events, both online and offline, to ensure that the Dogezer platform user has a lot of connections with other platform members.

Our secondary objective is to ensure that the community is flourishing and more and more connections are established through the platform.

It doesn't have on Dogezer if payment is done in project coins. What is the purpose to charge more hours, and don't have project done if you paid in coins which only become revenue when project is successful. Just wasting time would result in more coins which worth nothing. The motivation for freelancer is to really ensure that project is completed and brings revenue - When freelancer is hired, it is always some effort to onboard him. And if freelancer doesn't perform well, often he is still kept in a team, just because onboarding another person would require too much additional effort.

Base ETH Price to be used during Dogezer ITO — $1600 per ETH  Hello everyone!  The Private Sale of our ITO starts in less than 20 hours, so now it’s time to clarify how we would convert the dollar prices, used in our whitepaper, to Ethereum prices, which would be used in a smartcontract.  Taking into account the latest increase in the market price of ETH, which we are bullish on, we decided to use the base price of $1600 per one ETH. This is a bit higher than the current market price — which generally means our purchasers receive an additional discount (if we utilize dollar amounts), while the ETH price is below $1600.  Our Private Sale starts tomorrow, Jan 15th, 13:00 UTC time. On the Private Sale round, you would get 2,000 DGZ tokens per ETH. I.e. the price for one DGZ token is 0.0005 ETH on this round. The minimal purchase is 25 ETH. Please be aware that the total number of tokens for sale on this round is 5,000,000 and only 120 whitelisted purchasers would be able to purchase during this round.  Note: There is an additional discount of 10% for purchases over 100 ETH!  Please remember to complete the whitelisting process, if you haven’t done so yet!  During the public ITO round (Feb 15th — Mar 8th), the rates would be:  Feb 15th-Feb 22th: 1777.77 DGZ per ETH. (0.0005625 ETH for one DGZ) Feb 22th-Mar 1st: 1683.50 DGZ per ETH (0.000594 ETH for one DGZ) Mar 1st-Mar 8th: 1600 DGZ per ETH (0.000625 ETH for one DGZ) For Private Round participants, we are offering additional protection in case Ethereum price will rocket above 1600$ per 1 ETH during our ITO, and will stabilize on this level for at least a week. Should this happen, we would increase the price used in our calculations accordingly, and private sale participants would receive an airdrop in DGZ tokens proportional to their purchase size and increase in ETH price we use.  If, during the ITO, the ETH should drop and then stabilize on a level significantly below 1600, we may reduce the price that we use. Such a decrease (and corresponding increase in price of DGZ token), should this occur, would have no impact on those who have already purchased prior to this event!

We solve that so they don't need to search for funding anymore and get a budget to make their product in their own coin with a few clicks of a button. 2) For individual contributors - developers, designers, marketers - we provide opportunity to earn. And earn much more than they are earning now (with some risk) 3) For project - we provide the whole infrastructure, so there is no back and forth on setting up all of the tools. Also interests of project owner and developers are being much more aligned - if developers are not doing what is good for the project and for example ""beautify"" the code just for the sake of ""beautifying"" - then these developers hurt themselves as it means their tokens would be converted into real income later  Does this help?",False

Bounty is a small percentage for most of the ICOs, and this doesn't generate a big impact. There are just too many other guys - advisers, sales people, advertising people, and in many ICOs these people are getting tokens for their service and become responsible for token dumps. We avoid this approach like hell, but many don't worry on this. In many cases number of these ""free"" tokens exceed the amount of tokens bounty hunters are getting. Often in order of magnitude.  These short term investors you are talking about - they are not dumb persons. Some may be real gamblers, who like to buy lets say December 1st, and sell December 2th, because, ""suprise, suprise"" - there is no huge growth happening in a few days. Some may suddenly need to cash out due to personal reasons, so they sell. But this is small fraction. Most of people don't like to buy something for dollar and sell it for $0.9 a few weeks later. They may sell on ""panic"" - but there is no reason for them to initiate that ""panic"". Most of sales are happening from the persons who get tokens for ""free"" or with a big discount. This is the key reason why token price falls when nothing really have changed with the product.  We have a contact with a few persons who say that they are interested to buy, good project, etc. But they want to buy on exchange right after the end of ITO. Because Quote price would be cheaper than on ITO as people would be dumping ""easy"" tokens.  It took effort to explain to them this wouldn't happen in our case - but their expectations are strong as they have seen it happening multiple times already. These are people with money and experience in handling them.  So ICOs who are giving away too many free tokens are destroying ICO market.",False

It is Alex Kozlov, Dogezer founder, and let me first start from expressing my heartfelt thanks to all of you for your continued interest and ongoing support of our business platform and business activities.  Your support has been vital to our growth and development.  We have done a tremendous amount of work during our preITO working closely with potential token purchasers, advertising partners, event organizers, and we realized that that we need even more time to ensure our message and solution is well understood by the community. We have made a decision to change a start date of our ITO event from Nov 15th to Jan 15th. This will also give a bit more time to our future users to play with the product before ITO will commence. Product alpha, beta and official release dates are not modified and will stay the same as per our whitepaper.  More detailed explanation and rationale can be found in this medium article:  https://medium.com/@dogezercom/dogezers-ito-date-change-f3762d70eaac  To ensure this change only has positive impact on our preITO participants, we are changing preDGZ to DGZ conversion rate to 1:2, so each preDGZ owner would be able to receive 2x more DGZ tokens during ITO. That makes preITO discount to be equal to a minimum of 65% (may be larger depending on ETH price at the moment of ITO).  Also, as per some requests which we had from a number of token purchasers, and to ensure that we are giving everyone equal conditions, we are introducing two additional discounts for preITO purchasers: •   5% for any purchase over 50 ETH •   10% for any purchase over 100 ETH Feel free to contact us anytime and we will be happy to answer all of your questions and provide additional explanation",False

Taking my coffee time reading through your concept.   The payment in project specific coins lowers the entry barrier for entrepeneurs owning empty pockets.

Maybe those got in contact with a bussiness angel, maybe that did not worked out. Could this approach become a gamechanger?  Just the risks are carried over onto the hopefull employes. Team members? Company owners one day! Could work?  You can serve as an example yourself, doing a PreITO, that at some point in time hard currency (if Ethereum counts these days) has to flow for food and nibbles.

See, getting some funds for food and ink is not a big deal. The professionals are always in demand. The problem is in getting money for more than food and nibbles. There is always a limit on how much you can grow financially as a work for hire - and we try to break that limit, by giving tool to make it ""work as cofounder"" for each and every. Ask devs you know and which are not having their startup flying yet - how many of them are having pet projects to get away from regular 9-5 work. Almost everyone. How many of them succeed - very few. That is because they try to do things alone, can't raise funding, etc. There is a huge potential which can be used to increase innovation speed.    from: trinaldao on August 22, 2017, 03:30:40 PM btw how dogezer platform can combine Github, Upwork, Slack, Jira, Dropbox, Google Docs in one product, have beta or trial platform ?

Not on all of them mentioned above there is collaboration possible, to access their services from your own platform. Continually playing cats and mouse to keep their walled garden intact.  The ideal case for us is to be able to integrate with all of these tools, but as you rightfully note - they keep walls around their garden. So we decided to rewrite them, and have done this. It may be not so much perfect as these tools right now, but eventually it will improve more and more and became better than these well known. And that is because people who use these tools will write them for themselves and will be able to have a share of our revenue as a reward.    from: cryptotum88 on September 04, 2017, 03:00:46 PM Can your platform create jobs?

It might become a fast way however because of the world wide reach. Just to be sure - people wouldn't work for preDGZ/DGZ tokens. These tokens is a method to make system to run, not a method which is used to pay for job on some particular project. Project specific coins would be used inside particular project to pay for labor. While some project owners may want to make their coins to be tradeable on market, some will skip this, at least until the first buyout, which will ensure there is no price swings. The project specific coin price is initially 0, and it should eventually grow to 1 USD basing on how much intellectual property is there in a project, and if it is bringing revenue or not. So really not much risk here. Risk is there when project is just starting - because at that moment price is close to 0, and there is no guarantee that it will grow, no guarantee that the project owner is serious to make this till the successful completion. That risk is definitely needs to be explained, and will be explained. For the cost to hire workforce - the cost to hire workforce will be higher, but, because there will be no investors, there will be no cost associated with making these investors to receive their 4x-10x, which will give money to pay to the team, making overall cost for the company to be lower.",False

There are a few solutions in this case: •   First, and most important: If people who work on a product are doing a bad job - then clearly your product won’t have any success and won’t generate any revenue, which means they wouldn’t be able to earn. Doing good job is a win-win situation, doing bad job is lose-lose. •   Second: In a standard scenario we are going to suggest that the project owner assigns a flexible range for a certain task, instead of having a fixed budget. For example, project owner defines a range between 100 coins to 1000 coins for a certain task. 1000 is only paid for an excellent result whereas 100 would be paid for a poor-quality result. When job is submitted for a review - it may happen that a person who did a certain task will ask for less, knowing that his/her job is not great and result was far away from being excellent. If he/she wouldn't do that and will ask for more and a product owner is not happy about it, then they will need to negotiate and come to a mutually satisfactory outcome within the budget. •   Finally, we are going to have a ratings system, which will allow everyone to rate certain specialists for their performance and can be viewed by everyone, so these who constantly underdeliver will need to improve or they wouldn’t be invited to any project.",False

If your team member believes your project owner is not doing things correctly, but he/she still decides to vote against you to make your project manager happy – then he or she will put themselves in a risk to face an exactly the same situation. And the same rule applies If he/she always votes to gain respect from their team members – then he/she will lose trust from the project owner. So, a rational behavior in this situation would be to act fairly and respectful towards both parties to keep up your personal reputation - and concentrate on solution which would make the project to progress faster. Meaning if your code is not perfect – it is often still worth accepting this for the project, and this makes it further. Also, project owner who is constantly unfair to his team members – would be able to make them to work with him.",False

If you completed some tasks and earned some amount of coins no one can take these coins from you unless you will give them to someone. And you will always have a voting power as you are one of these who is interested in ultimate project success. Firing generally means that some permissions to access some docs/files would be removed to keep things secure, and you wouldn't be able to pick up new tasks for execution. Actually, firing is a wrong term to use - you would be moved into a special ex-members team, which means you are still a part of the project team, but more in a read-only mode with limited access. You can return back if you and a project manager work out all conditions.

I have just a few bits of constructive criticism and one or two comments. First and foremost, the website is well laid out but it's not designed for someone that has no idea about software development or GitHub or Slack or bug reports or any of the jargon in mind. Potential investors may be turned away to look at one of the other 3,000 ICOs that were introduced this month. The article on Medium, on the other hand, explains your platform quite well and in a way that can relateable by just about anyone. I would recommend adding this article to your landing page. Some investors don't venture farther than the page with the buy-in button. The landing page and this announcement thread are the two most important places that need to have relevant, easy to understand information on what it is that you are building.

Not everything will be good in alpha (as it is alpha , but key functions are already there. You can see the recording of alpha version in our youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74sr15hbKso&t=119s  Funny question: Who can name all the books and films which inspired content of the video?  Internally what we have is that we created our own issue tracker (Jira analogue). There is also a marketplace of people and projects, where people can join projects of their liking and work on some issues in this project issues tracker (Upwork analogue). To avoid hiring person for each small task, we build the concept of teams. People join project teams - like project development team, and then project owner send issues to the team (to preselected people he has approved to have access to some pieces of his solution) for bidding. People compete on who can do the issue better (cheaper, quicker, higher quality), and then they work on the issue and commit code into git repositories of the project (GitHub). People can also work on docs (for which we used OnlyOffice, but this may change) and modify/author docs while executing the issue. As a result, each issue is connected to either code or doc created/changed, and it is easy to understand who have done what. Messaging is a component which unites things together - generally all comments for the issue, comments and suggestions in a doc, hiring, etc - falls into messaging. So it is sort of a place to understand who do what and see what have happened before. As a result, it is easy to understand what each person has done for the project, and because it is easy to understand this - we can add a financial system which can operate with something different than regular money. Our financial system allows to operate with project specific currencies, where each unit of such currency is a promise of payment at some event - like project completion, or some amount of revenue earned by project. This enables project owner to create the project with no or little funding, pay with the promises to devs (and yes, it will be needed to overpay devs a bit as there is risk associated) and have the project done with just the idea and a passion towards that idea.",False
