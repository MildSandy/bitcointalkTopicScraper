Our 30 Partners in 30 Days continues, today we highlight #27 — FINDI, and all of the partners who are joining that initiative. Executives from Natixis, Principal, Marsh, and other big names are joining to push financial services decentralization forward! Here is how FINDI describes itself:  Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that will drive the systems of the future, and financial enterprises around the world are already racing to incorporate it. However, the centralized implementations these institutions are pursuing will likely nullify the most important aspects of the technology. FINDI (Financial Industry Decentralization Initiative) is a collaborative working group whose mission is to realize that original purpose, and bring the many benefits that public blockchains can offer to financial services, across three main dimensions: 1. Security — Further securing the flow of sensitive financial data 2. Knowledge — Enhancing the validity of critical information 3. Trust — Improving trust between consumers and financial institutions We only have three more partners remaining in our end of summer series, and then a very busy September with every more exciting partnership developments!

The Financial Industry Decentralisation Initiative (Findi) has been unveiled to “facilitate a more open, transparent, and decentralised global financial system” – all powered by public blockchains, reports David Penn at Finovate.  Paving the way for Web 3.0 Paving the way for Web 3.0  The goal of the consortium is to pave the way for Web 3.0, according to Hydrogen co-founders Michael and Matthew Kane.  They see public blockchains as the ideal vehicle to ensure the kind of openness, transparency, and user controls that made blockchain technology so attractive in the first place.  Findi serves as an alternative to what Mike Kane referred to as “an aggressive campaign from private blockchain consortiums” that threatens to leave “billions around the globe” unable to take advantage of the benefits of what he called “the blockchain revolution.” This includes the estimated two billion people around the world who are among the unbanked.  “Private blockchain is an oxymoron and centralised financial security is obsolete, as we have seen with recent hacks of Equifax, BMO, Coinrail, Banco, and Bithumb,” Mike Kane says.  Membership in Findi is free, and the consortium welcomes financial professionals, start-ups, consultants, academics, and governments.  With a focus on public blockchains, the consortium is both chain- and protocol-agnostic, and will support joint research and product development, host symposia, and provide industry consulting.  Findi reported that its members oversee more than $1 trillion in assets, and projected having more than 100 members in its first year.  Among Findi’s initial associate members are Wipro, the Dubai International Finance Center (DIFC), Natixis Investment Managers, and Principal Financial Group.  Headquartered in New York City, Hydrogen is also responsible for developing the Hydro Blockchain, a public ledger for financial services, and IonAI, a machine learning technology also geared to the financial services market.

Here we go again. Firstly, day traders never make any real money. Hodlers and swing traders agree on this, 1-3% on a ""good day"" is a joke in comparison to potential profits swinging or hodling. Secondly, don't presume SWING traders don't hold long-term positions. It's common to have a 50-50 portfollio split on long and swing positions (long would always be profit though, obviously!). Any good swing traders have a split even if its 60-40 or 70-30. So when you say traders will ""miss out"", then you're wrong. When you say they will have to buy back in at much higher prices, they won't. Swing traders buy the dip (red), not the rally (green), so they won't be forced into any ridiculous buying situations. They make money because they sell to those who fomo in, not because they are fomoing in themselves. Don't be fooled.  Experienced traders will be scalping the recovery, as the long-term technicals look awful. That's just pure and simple mathematics, not a conspiracy theory. I'm not trading anymore, at least not until I see some long-term change to a bull market (probably around $4.5k to $2.5k), as well as price confirmation, but any swing traders profiting from this recovery are smart, as the odds are the price long-term is going to go much lower. If you want to fomo into the rallies be my guest, but don't go crying and moaning about the result when you get burnt. If you want to ladder into long-term positions then be smart about it, always put your final ladders lower than the price you expect it to go, increasing in position size as the price drops. Too many people ""laddered"" into high prices and are feeling the pain, don't make this mistake and be another resentful crypto investor, it's simply not worth it.  For example, if you think BTC will only go to $4k, ladder buy orders down to $2k. If you think the floor is at $6k, ladder positions to $3k. You get the idea. Don't think you are smarter than the market, you're not. When the whales want the price to recover it will, but it won't be from individual/retail buying or fundamentals either, it never has been and never will be. Best of luck to everyone out there!

After months of design work, we are very excited about the recent release of Element v1! To all the designers out there: let us explain what Element is and what we have been working on.  Hydrogen is the first and lightest element in the periodic table, making it a fundamental building block of matter across the universe. We created Element with a similar idea in mind — a flexible, modular set of components that can be combined to create UI for digital financial products. The Element library contains small design pieces that can coalesce to make customized products and interfaces, as well as some examples of how those components can come together.  Within Element, you’ll find color palettes, icons, and various core UI components. The UI kit also contains components more specific to financial services, such as Stock Screeners and Investment Profiles. Dashboards with holistic views of projected account growth, investment goals, financial wellness scores, budgets, and net worth provide designers with options for displaying aggregated financial information in clear and simple ways. Samples of client on-boarding design — arguably the most important part of a digital financial platform — are included as well, spanning things like risk questionnaires, investment portfolio surveys, and life insurance signups.  To get started with Element, simply visit our developers page: https://www.hydrogenplatform.com/developers. Make sure to update Sketch to the newest version before downloading. We also recommend downloading the Google font Muli, as it is included in the library. To get the most out of Element, review the color palette found in the Components section as well as the Text Styles we use.",False

LOL. I made 100% profit last year swing trading, I made another 100% profit last month even. You think I lack trading experience? You're hilarious. I don't swing trade anymore simply because it's too much effort in a bear market, I've made enough profit already, and the risk to reward ratio is too low for me now. Yes I doubled my money again this year within 6 months, but last last year I doubled my money in 3 months, although clearly should of pulled 200-300% it if I knew what I was doing back then. Therefore I haven't got the patience for swing trading at the moment, but full respect to the pro swing traders still going strong and living off this market. Not to mention I'm now just sitting on profit so I don't care where the price goes, that's what playing with house money feels like. It's chill, you should try it! The lower the better to be honest, I'm hoping for $2.5k at the 200 Week MA if the 100 Week MA doesn't hold at $4.5k, but I realise we all probably won't get this lucky with institutions waiting on certain discounts. But you can always hope.  I can only assume you're one of those bitter people who bought into the parabolic rise last year and either didn't sell profit to get yourself on house money (no.1 rule of investing into incredibly speculative assets) or you simply bought high and are now sitting on a loss so need to find something or someone to blame. You say this correction isn't normal, have you even looked at a historical logarithmic chart? The 2014-2015 correction? Do you know what parabolic means or what a bubble is? That would tell you with RIDICULOUSLY overbought weekly RSI levels last year, your target buy is oversold weekly RSI. It's simple mate, get a grip. Or if you are playing with house money (profit) at the moment, then what on Earth is your problem? If you're winning, then be grateful. If you're loosing, you should know better. ""If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is"".  Not to mention it's so simple to make money in this market: Buy low sell high, buy red sell green, buy fud sell hype, buy the rumour sell the news. Couldn't be simpler, even with just MACD crossovers you can pull profit in a bear market. I don't get how people lose their money unless they are idiots who sell at a loss. Before it was even easier buying oversold and selling overbought Daily RSI levels. How could you not get on house money???  I love it when greedy people get burnt ""I'm not selling at $20k, it could go to $100k by next week!"", serves them all right   Bye bye lambo boys and good riddance! You're not welcome in this space. Either swing trade and make profit, invest long-term or both, or f*** off basically. I've got no sympathy for sore losers blaming ""manipulation"" for a natural correction. The price would be manipulated if it wasn't correcting right now. The price was manipulated from $5k to $20k over futures markets news, but I never heard people complain about it when the price was going up! Funny that.

Try trading successfully in the Forex market. I don't think you would do so well. That's where you really find out what you're made of. That's not to say you can't do well in Forex.

You're a bit strange ;-) I guess regarding manipulation you're talking about ""price suppression"" by futures & shorts markets, wash trading, spoofing, OTC, whales dumping to get lower prices, whales pumping to generate a fomo rally etc. For me this isn't manipulation, it's merely market conditions. This is evident in all markets, it's just easier in crypto with lower volumes. If you want ""clean"" markets where prices can't be manipulated you are living in a fantasy world. Period. You just have to learn to swim with the whales.  This is just a simple case of ""If you can't stand the heat, get out the kitchen"" in my opinion. Forex markets though, MEGALOLZ. Why would I bother with that? There is so much more money to made out of cryptocurrency than any other market on the planet, with the exception of the ICO market of course, but this is trading fundamentals not TA ""Buy the sale, sell the listing"". I wasn't trying to brag, I was documenting how I'm (no longer) an inexperienced trader, and that all I hear from you is winging and winning like a baby. I've learnt from mistakes I've made in the past trading crypto, and learnt from them to become a successful trader to generate profit. I recommend you do the same while you have the time.  In any other market prices coming back down to the 100 and 200 Week MAs is completely normal and expected over time, but somehow people don't think/believe this isn't relevant to crypto, as if it's some special case that is the exception to the rule of technical analysis. It's a pathetic excuse in my opinion. You never did explain with TA how that graph I referenced doesn't represent a completely natural market cycle. Says it all in my opinion. Back up your arguments with facts, not conspiracies.",False

Same as 20 sats could be the floor which is where the price initially consolidated support, or even 10 sats as this was the initial price from CMC, even if not the initial value of the project prior to CMC listing. TA is far from perfect, especially given that prices are pegged to Bitcoin. If BTC goes down, so will 95% of altcoins. As you said, there are so many macro and micro factors. ETFs could happen for Bitcoin to make the price moon. Another irrelevant exchange could get hacked and the mainstream media could FUD the price lower. That said, if you want to understand TA more, even if you don't want to apply it, there are some really good youtubers you can learn from. I'd personally recommend; SnipersTube, Crypto Kirby, DataDash, and for the ultimate bear analysis: Tony Vays. It took me 6 months being involved in the space and investing before learning about this tbh. The reason I recommend youtubers as opposed to CoinDesk and CoinTelegraph, is that I find their analysis is maniuplated by their own positions. When their stop losses trigger, they post overly bearish predictions. When they enter positions, they publish bullish predictions. They know they can manipulate the price due to their large readership. Hence they are also usually wrong, and not to be trusted either. I used to follow exclusively their analysis, before I learnt it really wasn't that helpful.",False

Day traders are just getting wrecked at the moment it seems unless you are using HFTs (High frequency trading bots) for micro swings (on the 15 minute, not even the hour chart). You're best off swing trading the bounces (scalping the recoveries) than day trading in my opinion, in a bear market at least. That's if you really want to be taking that risk, which I still wouldn't really recommend. Interestingly enough, Tony Vays is somewhat of a day trader (though mainly a swing trader) and he's recommended against long positions on Bitcoin since $15k, which should tell you it's not worth touching. He's only considering a position at $4,975 for example, whereas most youtubers are laddering around $6-$6.5k, which sounds insane to me! Though I do understand the attraction of 20-25% profit on a small bounce given Bitcoin is getting very oversold now (RSI was 28.5 last I checked, so much for a bounce from 30!) Baring in mind previous dead cat bounces were 100% and 50% price increases, so 25% does seem reasonable to me, if you can catch it properly that is. If you're a professional trader, and this is your income, you should be looking at shorting Bitcoin due to the bear market, rather than longing. That said, the Shorts look like they are double topping (27785 on Bitfinex) so short-term I wouldn't recommend this, while long-term it'll probably rise further after another bounce. Best of luck anyway either way!  Quote from: thuthitao14 on June 13, 2018, 09:20:35 AM Is there a plan to get Hydro on Coin Market Cap? Could be a good way to find new investors.

Check it out to see how you can contribute and receive HYDRO tokens!   *****************************************         The Public Ledger for Financial Services    Website | Discord | Telegram | Twitter | Reddit | Blog | GitHub    Hydro allows private systems to interface with a public blockchain. We propose a new hybrid private-public model that enables financial services platforms to leverage the dynamics of a distributed, transparent, and immutable public ledger. The project focuses on particular areas where this can add value, such as authentication, identity management, document security, transactions, and artificial intelligence.       Background  Hydro is part of the parent company Hydrogen. Hydrogen is a tech platform for developers and enterprises in the financial services space. Its modular set of APIs offers digital infrastructure and capabilities to quickly prototype, build, test, and deploy sophisticated financial technology platforms and products globally.  We began an integration of blockchain tech as part of the Hydrogen platform during the summer of 2017. Our main consideration was how the Hydrogen API ecosystem, being fundamentally private, can be enhanced by a public blockchain layer. As we laid out our plans to accomplish that, we also realized that our proposed private-public hybrid model can and should be used to enhance systems of all kinds. We are excited to announce Hydro as an open technology suite, with its ongoing implementation in Hydrogen serving as a point of immediate adoption.    Design Principles  We are building Hydro on the Ethereum infrastructure, although we remain platform agnostic. We intend to leverage the thousands of developers globally that are working to make underlying blockchain technology faster, stronger, and more efficient. Hydro focuses on developing product-oriented capabilities, largely centered around smart contract functionality.  Our main design philosophy is that of augmenting off-chain systems rather than outright replacing them. We do not believe that all economic activity will or should move on-chain. Rather, distributed ledger technology can serve to enhance those underlying, fundamentally private systems in specific ways. Hydro is laser-focused on making that a reality and synergizing with the current environment, in order to facilitate real-world adoption of blockchain tech in a meaningful way and introduce the benefits of decentralization, immutability, and transparency.    What Sets Hydro Apart?  Hydro is architected as an independent parallel layer, and its value comes from various interactions between the private and public layers. This means an underlying private system does not need to change in any fundamental way or create any costly new architecture - allowing even large institutions to rapidly adopt blockchain technology beyond the proof-of-concept phase.  Additionally, Hydro is implemented natively into the Hydrogen API ecosystem, offering immediate and direct access to Hydro capabilities. Hydrogen can power many kinds of platforms and applications across the financial services sphere (investing, savings, insurance, financial wellness, etc.) and the company works with a range of clients, from individual developers up to large financial enterprises.    The Hydro Ecosystem  The goal of the project is to create an ecosystem of power-ups that platforms can leverage, in order to easily integrate blockchain technology in ways that add value. The graphic below sets out our vision for Hydro:       Raindrop  The first Hydro release deals with something that is core to all systems - authentication and security. It was conceived to provide additional protection for sensitive data that is increasingly at risk of breach. In the proposed framework, dubbed ""Raindrop"", on-chain operations performed via smart contract can validate access to private, off-chain systems. This validation layer complements standard private authentication and authorization protocols, such as Google Authenticator and OAuth 2.0, by acting as an additional public factor that must be satisfied before system access is granted. The worldwide developer community, through the decentralized and transparent consensus mechanisms of the blockchain, can now offer greater protection to billions of pieces of sensitive data from bad actors.  The Raindrop authentication process involves 4 entities: an Accessor trying to gain access, a System that denies or grants access, the Hydro module (off-chain), and a Hydro smart contract (on-chain). An example of a System is a REST API, while an example of an Accessor is an API developer. The diagram below depicts how these entities interact during part of the process.      Please see the white paper and website for more detailed information about how Raindrop works.    Client Raindrop  Unlike enterprises with large systems and APIs, many user-facing clients do not require every access attempt to be logged on-chain. Accordingly, we have integrated a Client functionality into our Raindrop API. This functionality creates a scalable, blockchain-based two-factor authentication for any application’s login portal. To augment this offering, we are developing a mobile app to enable users to confirm login attempts in a simple, user-friendly process. This enables a day-to-day integration of blockchain security to any client application. In congruence with our design philosophy, this process does not require more than a few simple API calls for clients.   Token Distribution for Developers  We concluded our air drop distribution to developers on 2/16, distributing 2,556,219,666 tokens to 11,208 developers. A minimum of 222,222 tokens were distributed to each developer for use in integrating Raindrop authentication and further developing with Hydro and Hydrogen. Developers can use their tokens to build blockchain-enabled applications. We encourage people to make world-changing applications using Hydro from day one!    Token Dynamics  Hydro utilizes an ERC-20 standard token. The total token supply is 11,111,111,111 (for the atomic number 1). Of those tokens, approximately 23% were distributed to the developers who successfully signed up during the rollout period described above. The remaining 27% of the initial 50% allocation for the airdrop has been moved to the repository – dedicated to helping grow the community. This portion, plus an initially allocated 20% sum to approximately 47% of the Hydro supply in the repository. We will be releasing a detailed document of our plans for the repository in the coming weeks.  The final 30% is reserved for the team.       We are very excited to launch Hydro and see the amazing ways in which it is used by developers of all kinds! Feel free to comment and ask any questions below - we look forward to engaging with the community!    Website | Discord | Telegram | Twitter | Reddit | Blog | GitHub",False

Not to get philosophical about how airdrops are an exchange of social media labor, but due to the fact that the airdrop was for active developers in the open source community. The airdrop was for those contributing to Github, and proportionate to the amount they had contributed (some devs got more), so I'd say it's a reward for those who volunteer their free time to develop open source code as well as contribute to the cryptocurrency space.  But otherwise yes, you're right, people received $250 worth of free tokens when it was valued at 0.1 cent, which is easily 10x what is usually expected from a ""free airdrop"" that comes from simple social media tasks. Not to mention it's since increased in value by 15x to $3k+ and has since seen strong dip demand even at the 10x mark of 1 cent. On the flipside, is it really that surprising that a project led by devs distributed the wealth of the dev platform to devs? Not really, it'd be insulting if they didn't to be honest! Anyone involved in marketing would tell you this is a very clever and strategic marketing plan. They want more devs to be engaged in the platform, the airdrop was merely to gain their attention.  Needless to say, I wouldn't be betting against this project. For those who dumped when it reached exchanges, as well as the initial peaks of 0.3 and 0.6... serves you right.",False

Each phase of the project will utilize the HYDRO token in some way.  Some of these functionalities could technically be achieved with ETH, but I believe this is a misnomer. ETH and HYDRO have two very different use cases - ETH is a currency to fuel computations on the Ethereum network, while HYDRO is a token to trigger and unlock functionalities within the Hydro ecosystem. Conflating the two is confusing and disingenuous, in my opinion. Here is how I think about it:  Using ETH would restrict what we can do, and introduce competitive barriers as to the actual use of those tokens. Why would someone use ETH within the Hydro ecosystem if ETH also has hundreds or thousands of other potential uses that have nothing to do with Hydro? Why would we tie ourselves to the supply and demand dynamics of a token that has an entirely different use case then what we intend it to be used for? At best, this muddles the Hydro value proposition, and at worst, it is a game theoretical disaster in which developers never expand beyond ETH's native use cases. These issues are almost entirely circumvented by introducing a HYDRO utility token.  I don't have any comments on the value of the token, but here are some facts: We are aggressively pursuing real-world adoption of the tech. That adoption is directly correlated with the use of HYDRO, and the supply of HYDRO is fixed.",False

Thanks to the Hydro development team and management team who are working hard   Adam Smith said that there is Value that is useful, and he distinguishes between two values. It is the value of use and the value of exchange. I think ""usefulness = value"". We always say that there is Value when we speak of usability. Hydro token is expected to be highly useful in the future and is expected to increase its value. As a result, Hydro token is valuable. I think the value is measured by money. I think Hydro team can not say absolute value ($), but it's a bad idea to say it is not worth it. I hope there is no more debate about this. If you think there is no Value, please please give me a lot of Hydro for free. (100,000,000 Hydro) haha(joke) (MEW: 0xF3fbC734ef6b8Fb541E4b32371553398109086FC)  1.

In addition, i want to add my point of view about the value of hydro  At the very frist stage, initial purpose of hydro is not for trading actually. However, After getting feedback from the community, they have changed their mind and agree to bring hydro to exchanges . This activity is a good move for sure, why ? let me clear you this :  - crypto is now attracting people due to its value, and hydro is kind of token based on ETH. Thus, when hydro get its own value, it will bring more people to the project --> the other parts of their business will easily gain much more attention --> the first win - When people use their products ,let make it an example of hydro authenticator, users will tend to use a product that brings them passive benefit --> a win againt other authenticator apps - Hydro team is working hard for the project, they are trying to make it free for users which served with high quality products. When hydro has its value, that will be considerd as a reward for their enormous effort. And tell me what could motivate people to burn their sould for job better than a sweet present. --> a win for hydro team - There are at least 60% of hydro are being active in telegraam group. They are eagerly trying to support hydro everyday, and in my experience, people will do their best to spread hydro to the world as they acknowledge of the reward ahead. --> another win for marketing  those are from my view.

There are 2 main ways this is addressed in our overall project plan:  1. We have architected our roadmap to start out with features that use the lowest transaction volume. The transaction load we would put on the network with the initial Raindrop release, even at large scale adoption, is fairly low compared to other projects at similar scale. Future Hydro products will come with heavier transaction load, but we will have an opportunity to see how Ethereum scaling solutions (e.g. Casper, Raiden, etc) are progressing over time.  2. Hydro is generally platform agnostic. We are building on Ethereum right now, but have already considered how to replicate the functionality on other blockchains such as NEO. As new platforms emerge with smart contract capability (e.g. Cardano, EOS, Waves, Ark, IOTA) we will analyze their suitability on an ongoing basis.  Overall we are confident in the Ethereum ecosystem since it is the most mature, but we are prepared to shift in order to achieve larger scale adoption.",False

Check it out to see how you can contribute and receive HYDRO tokens!   *****************************************         The Public Ledger for Financial Services    Website | Discord | Telegram | Twitter | Reddit | Blog | GitHub    Hydro allows private systems to interface with a public blockchain. We propose a new hybrid private-public model that enables financial services platforms to leverage the dynamics of a distributed, transparent, and immutable public ledger. The project focuses on particular areas where this can add value, such as authentication, identity management, document security, transactions, and artificial intelligence.       Background  Hydro is part of the parent company Hydrogen. Hydrogen is a tech platform for developers and enterprises in the financial services space. Its modular set of APIs offers digital infrastructure and capabilities to quickly prototype, build, test, and deploy sophisticated financial technology platforms and products globally.  We began an integration of blockchain tech as part of the Hydrogen platform during the summer of 2017. Our main consideration was how the Hydrogen API ecosystem, being fundamentally private, can be enhanced by a public blockchain layer. As we laid out our plans to accomplish that, we also realized that our proposed private-public hybrid model can and should be used to enhance systems of all kinds. We are excited to announce Hydro as an open technology suite, with its ongoing implementation in Hydrogen serving as a point of immediate adoption.    Design Principles  We are building Hydro on the Ethereum infrastructure, although we remain platform agnostic. We intend to leverage the thousands of developers globally that are working to make underlying blockchain technology faster, stronger, and more efficient. Hydro focuses on developing product-oriented capabilities, largely centered around smart contract functionality.  Our main design philosophy is that of augmenting off-chain systems rather than outright replacing them. We do not believe that all economic activity will or should move on-chain. Rather, distributed ledger technology can serve to enhance those underlying, fundamentally private systems in specific ways. Hydro is laser-focused on making that a reality and synergizing with the current environment, in order to facilitate real-world adoption of blockchain tech in a meaningful way and introduce the benefits of decentralization, immutability, and transparency.    What Sets Hydro Apart?  Hydro is architected as an independent parallel layer, and its value comes from various interactions between the private and public layers. This means an underlying private system does not need to change in any fundamental way or create any costly new architecture - allowing even large institutions to rapidly adopt blockchain technology beyond the proof-of-concept phase.  Additionally, Hydro is implemented natively into the Hydrogen API ecosystem, offering immediate and direct access to Hydro capabilities. Hydrogen can power many kinds of platforms and applications across the financial services sphere (investing, savings, insurance, financial wellness, etc.) and the company works with a range of clients, from individual developers up to large financial enterprises.    The Hydro Ecosystem  The goal of the project is to create an ecosystem of power-ups that platforms can leverage, in order to easily integrate blockchain technology in ways that add value. The graphic below sets out our vision for Hydro:       Raindrop  The first Hydro release deals with something that is core to all systems - authentication and security. It was conceived to provide additional protection for sensitive data that is increasingly at risk of breach. In the proposed framework, dubbed ""Raindrop"", on-chain operations performed via smart contract can validate access to private, off-chain systems. This validation layer complements standard private authentication and authorization protocols, such as Google Authenticator and OAuth 2.0, by acting as an additional public factor that must be satisfied before system access is granted. The worldwide developer community, through the decentralized and transparent consensus mechanisms of the blockchain, can now offer greater protection to billions of pieces of sensitive data from bad actors.  The Raindrop authentication process involves 4 entities: an Accessor trying to gain access, a System that denies or grants access, the Hydro module (off-chain), and a Hydro smart contract (on-chain). An example of a System is a REST API, while an example of an Accessor is an API developer. The diagram below depicts how these entities interact during part of the process.      Please see the white paper and website for more detailed information about how Raindrop works.    Client Raindrop  Unlike enterprises with large systems and APIs, many user-facing clients do not require every access attempt to be logged on-chain. Accordingly, we have integrated a Client functionality into our Raindrop API. This functionality creates a scalable, blockchain-based two-factor authentication for any application’s login portal. To augment this offering, we are developing a mobile app to enable users to confirm login attempts in a simple, user-friendly process. This enables a day-to-day integration of blockchain security to any client application. In congruence with our design philosophy, this process does not require more than a few simple API calls for clients.   Token Distribution for Developers  We concluded our air drop distribution to developers on 2/16, distributing 2,556,219,666 tokens to 11,208 developers. A minimum of 222,222 tokens were distributed to each developer for use in integrating Raindrop authentication and further developing with Hydro and Hydrogen. Developers can use their tokens to build blockchain-enabled applications. We encourage people to make world-changing applications using Hydro from day one!    Token Dynamics  Hydro utilizes an ERC-20 standard token. The total token supply is 11,111,111,111. Of those tokens, approximately 24% were distributed to the developers who successfully signed up during the rollout period described above. The token allocation breakdown is show below.       We are very excited to launch Hydro and see the amazing ways in which it is used by developers of all kinds! Feel free to comment and ask any questions below - we look forward to engaging with the community!    Website | Discord | Telegram | Twitter | Reddit | Blog | GitHub",False
