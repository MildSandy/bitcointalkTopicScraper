Chief Scientist Michael Yeung: Before joining Celes Chain, Yeung was the head of global structured solutions at BBVA USA. Shen Wang: Wang is an attorney at White & Case LLP. Zuo Tao: Tao has worked at CME Group over four years.  Verdict Below is a breakdown of the risks and growth potential of Celes Chain.  Risks     No advisors yet, but given that the team is highly experienced and has worked for the world’s largest companies, a world-class advisory board can be expected. (-1)     As full token metrics haven’t been released yet, it is hard to estimate the project’s worth in terms of return on investment. (-2)  Growth Potential     The team has already shown great ambition and determination to go the extra mile. The presence of a virtual machine and a compiler specifically designed for the project’s purposes is sufficient to prove that. (+4)     Great team. (+2)     Even if token metrics are not released yet, almost 50,000 people have already joined their Telegram channel, showing some interest from the community. (+2.5)  Disposition The global financial crisis in 2008 is believed by some to be the primary reason why Satoshi Nakamoto developed Bitcoin (see “Coinbase”). To prevent the financial system’s possible collapse, governments and relevant bodies had to take extreme measures such as following aggressive monetary policies and implementing stricter regulation. It is estimated that over $36 billion and 7.3 million work hours were spent just on the writing of The Dodd-Frank Act. The Celes Chain team thinks that the total cost of a possible financial crisis can be minimized by the use of a blockchain specifically designed for governments and regulatory bodies. The role of “super regulators” is designed to have access to all levels and data stored, so that they have the required control over the chain and can take any measure or step they would like to. An innovative consensus algorithm named Delegated Proof of Work, DPoW is implemented to find the optimal balance between decentralization and efficiency, so the platform can work in near or actual real-time. As token metrics are not released yet, it is hard to have a fair guess on any return on investment, yet the presence of a detailed technical paper is sufficient to estimate the project’s worth. The ambitious and determined team is willing to go the extra mile in order to meet their goals and the presence of a language, a virtual machine, and a compiler, all specifically designed for the project’s purposes proves that. High community interest on social media is also apparent. Celes Chain receives a 5.5/10.
