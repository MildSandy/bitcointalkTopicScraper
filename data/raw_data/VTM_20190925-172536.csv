Hey all,  It is a deep regret for us to announce an early closure of our ICO sale. We would also like to add that this discontinuation is totally temporary and the sale will resume on the 20th of January, 2019. As for the reason for this interruption, we hope that the community is aware of the current crypto market state. The market lacks stability and there is little reason in continuing an ICO sale in such an unstable market.  However, in the meantime, we will be accepting funds from private investors through other modes of payment. Again, we appreciate the huge support from the community and regret the inconvenience caused by our decision.

We are going to sum up some common challenges that Victorieum’s Crypto Bank and Exchange is designed to tackle. Let’s get started:  1. Stringent regulations: In many jurisdictions of the world, very strict regulations on crypto trading are in place. Such a regulatory system hampers the seamless trading of digital currencies. It not only spoils the overall trading experience for crypto users but also deeply affects the economy of the country. Through its offshore banking units, Victorieum aims to offer users an experience beyond boundaries.  2. Lack of full crypto-backed banking services: There are only a handful of platforms offer banking services for cryptocurrencies. But the problem with these platforms is that they fail to provide a full-banking experience on an individual level. Therefore, to ensure that crypto users don’t have to switch between platforms to avail full-banking services, Victorieum is planning on creating an ecosystem with all the services in one place.   3. Low transaction speeds: Today we all have limited time on our hands. Thus, speed has become the essence of life. In crypto sphere, users are getting tired of slow transactions and running out patience. Victorieum ensures that all the transactions are faster and users’ overall experience gets better.  4. Lack of security: When it comes to banking, security is a primary concern. There are few platforms in crypto space that are not prone to security risks and threats. Through integration with CIVIC and Trezor, Victorieum ensures that users enjoy the highest level of security. Also, through re-usable KYC, the platform eradicates any remote possibilities of data theft and fraud.  5. Lack of customer support: Cryptocurrencies are rather complex and early users or beginners have a hard time getting the hang of it. This is where a good customer support comes handy. Victorieum’s platform ensures that customers get dedicated 24*7 support on any technical or non-technical issues.  Victorieum’s ICO sale is in progress. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to be a part of a revolution. Go sign up on our official website and participate: https://www.victorieum.io/",True

Apart from just a struggling market, crypto users from around the world face some challenges on a regular basis. We are going to sum up some common challenges that Victorieum’s Crypto Bank and Exchange is designed to tackle. Let’s get started:  1. Stringent regulations: In many jurisdictions of the world, very strict regulations on crypto trading are in place. Such a regulatory system hampers the seamless trading of digital currencies. It not only spoils the overall trading experience for crypto users but also deeply affects the economy of the country. Through its offshore banking units, Victorieum aims to offer users an experience beyond boundaries.  2. Lack of full crypto-backed banking services: There are only a handful of platforms offer banking services for cryptocurrencies. But the problem with these platforms is that they fail to provide a full-banking experience on an individual level. Therefore, to ensure that crypto users don’t have to switch between platforms to avail full-banking services, Victorieum is planning on creating an ecosystem with all the services in one place.   3. Low transaction speeds: Today we all have limited time on our hands. Thus, speed has become the essence of life. In crypto sphere, users are getting tired of slow transactions and running out patience. Victorieum ensures that all the transactions are faster and users’ overall experience gets better.  4. Lack of security: When it comes to banking, security is a primary concern. There are few platforms in crypto space that are not prone to security risks and threats. Through integration with CIVIC and Trezor, Victorieum ensures that users enjoy the highest level of security. Also, through re-usable KYC, the platform eradicates any remote possibilities of data theft and fraud.  5. Lack of customer support: Cryptocurrencies are rather complex and early users or beginners have a hard time getting the hang of it. This is where a good customer support comes handy. Victorieum’s platform ensures that customers get dedicated 24*7 support on any technical or non-technical issues.  Victorieum’s ICO sale is in progress.

Blockchain-backed Offshore Bank and Exchange, Victorieum prides itself on providing the users with a highly secure fintech ecosystem where they can conveniently and safely receive full-fledged banking services. Here is what the power of CIVIC and Trezor offers:  CIVIC  CIVIC’s exemplary platform provides highly encrypted and secure identity verification of users with the help of blockchain technology. It creates on-demand access to customer identification and verification in real time. The whole purpose of the platform is to create digital identities for users or customers so they can reap the rewards of highly encrypted and secure communication and make secured transactions over the blockchain network. It not only creates a environment of highly resilient security but also lowers the overall cost of operation.  Thus, through integration with CIVIC, Victorieum will be able to securely authorize the identities of users with reusable KYC and eradicate any remote possibility of identity theft.  Trezor  Among crypto users, Trezor is popular as a token of security. It is a highly reliable hard wallet. Apart from securely store and trade cryptocoins, Trezor also helps with services like password management.  Undoubtedly, storing data online makes it susceptible to the threats of theft or hacking. This is where platforms like Trezor prove to be lifesavers. Through integration with Trezor, Victorieum facilitates the offline storage of user information or data. Highly secure and recovery private pass-keys make the system as secure as a vault.  Thus, backed by the power of CIVIC and Trezor, Victorieum tackles the challenges and issues related to security and promises users a highly secure banking ecosystem.",True

And we are proud to be able to say that we have already raised over 90BTC.  Now, we have only a handful of days before we move into stage 2 of the sale. At this stage, the sale bonus will drop to 30% and the token price will be 9 cents. Therefore, we want to take this opportunity to encourage investors to make the most of stage 1.

It's really disappointing that we live in an unprecedented technology-driven age and yet the experience users get out of banking (an integral part of our economy) is nothing short of an ordeal. It's even worse for crypto-users who can not use their hard earned crypto assets for banking all because of redundant regulations imposed by the authorities on crypto-related transactions.  But things are about to change. Victorieum's revolutionary crypto-backed banking platform aims to offer seamless crypto-backed full-fledged banking services, regardless of any regulations from authorities. This informative article probes into the concept of the integration of offshore banking with blockchain that makes Victorieum so unique: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roadmap-full-services-offshore-banking-140000820.html  Hope you find it intriguing and helpful!

But it has still not gained the mass adoption it deserves. Apart from the rise in security issues caused by incidents of crypto accounts being hacked, complexity of this revolutionary tech has also deterred various industries from widely adopting it.  The banking and finance sector is one such industry. Banking is already quite intricate in itself. Adding the complexity of blockchain to it seems quite unreasonable. But, surprisingly enough, it is the other way round. The Victorieum Offshore Crypto Bank and Exchange is an example of blockchain meeting banking. Its promising platform aims to offer easy and fast blockchain-powered banking services.  Here is an article from Nasdaq that explains how Victorieum is transforming Fintech: https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/this-roadmap-of-full-services-offshore-banking-ico-is-stirring-up-fintech-companies-inside-20181022-00795  Hope you like the article!

In case of crypto users, things are even worse as governments from all over the world have prohibited the use of banking services for crypto-fiat trading. The volatile nature of cryptocurrencies and the potential threat of their use for illegal activities are considered responsible for such bans. But, in all honesty, these bans and regulations are nothing but holding prospective progress back. Actually, the blockchain technology is capable of bringing around unimaginable revolution in our lives.
