In meantime.  Quote  *OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT* The idea of how to value MNY pre ICO has been a topic of internal discussion ever since we decided to offer the Private Placement Offering. In this line several ideas were floated including doing a pre ICO release of MNY in order to get a qualified valuation of MNY and also to get an idea of how MNY would effect COEVAL and it's traded price. An ultimate executive decision was made by @dmhco (without consensus, which is what led to Peerchemist resigning from the project) last night to go forward with a pre-ICO release of MNY. I do acknowledge that this may have taken many people off guard and may be perceived as being executed in somewhat rash fashion. However, we felt that a hard technical analysis was necessary in order to valuate MNY relative to the Private Offering. We took this approach as a result of the fact that we are seeing serious registration from accredited investors since we posted the Private Offering. These high net worth investors largely, are not previously affiliated with the crypto space. I agree that we should have notified the crypto community before taking this decision.  We have a relatively small team that have been working literally around the clock and don't always have time to answer direct questions and post updates. And I do apologize for that as well. It is our core mission at Monkey to identify how we can effectively bring value to ALL our investors and stakeholders. And the primary model for that is dividends being paid from our underlying businesses to COEVAL holders and holders of MNY which is immediately detailed in the Update Paper posted by @dmhco today (posted above). The first dividends at minimum will be paid in September from DDF. We are fully committed to the ICO being done on a timely schedule. The ICO is still on schedule for 8/8. However the ICO offering will be extended 'open' beyond the one month period. We are also actively identifying an effective technical strategy for MNY distributions to COEVAL in a staggered distribution model on the Waves Platform, and are open to your helpful suggestions. We have identified a technical partner who may be able to assist us with the technical distribution of MNY to COEVAL holders in an automated fashion. We all sincerely appreciate the continued support and value that has continued to pour in from the Monkey Community. And we do want YOU to know that we are: steadily, and with re-dedicated focus and effort, absolutely committed, to seeing the realization of value to COEVAL, MNY and future ICO token holders through our dividend payment method to early, present and future investors in the Monkey Capital CoEval. This is and always will be our top priority. We are also finalizing our White Paper and Private Offering edits and many more questions will be answered therein. I understand that their may be some impatience associated with our questions and answers and that is why we are taking steps to do a weekly podcast and update our blog and otherwise with relevant content as quickly as possible. Please understand that we are sincerely working as hard as we possibly can with the core group that we have here, and that their may be delays in communication. We are employing a strategy to deal with that as effectively as possible for example setting up a shared office where the executive team and advisors as well as staff can better be directed to deal with specifics that arise such as this. I was hired as COO not communications director, so their is an obvious need for that position to be filled, as well as quickly identifying a new CTO, and filling those roles with qualified individuals. Thank you all for your kind support and consideration.   Quote . Gusmys I think it is easy:  COE will still give 10k MNY  Childrentokens will ONLY be distributed to MNY which are sold, NOT given for COE  Ultimately, posession of MNY (given or bought) will give dividends payed in COE.  COE will become more valueble since COE needs to be bought from market to pay the divs.  Childtokens will give extra divs (look at model Dan)  Easy? ",False

I like Waves as a platform but you're not going to get the big splash that other ICO's get forcing people to use Waves which is a pain to get started on (you can't even buy Waves on Waves and you need 0.003 waves to make a transaction). And there are some unanswered questions on when COEVAL holders will receive their MNY and when they can sell the MNY.  Anyone seriously interested in purchasing MNY would likely buy COEVAL instead, so the market for MNY likely has a soft ceiling based on the selling price of COEVAL. The speculation chatter is saying ""$1 billion hedge fund"" but this seems like a lot more risk and the more likely scenario is $25-100m raised in the MNY ICO?",False

There's nothing like that coming any time soon. It was mentioned as an idea, that could potentially be materialized when Monkey Capital tokens have so much value, that it would need to limit the amount of people to have access to the direct leadership through a Slack channel, hence introducing a fee for joining. Otherwise there would be a million people and many trolls in the channel, making the whole tool useless. Ill minded trolls especially when it's free to join. So a fee could lock those people out. And when people earn a lot with the tokens a fee for joining is totally justifyable, as it's easily covered by the profits. So, this is only a vision for a successful future. Edit: Or not a vision for the far future... looks like the channel is closed and one needs an invite now. Still doesn't cost anything to join. I guess it's an understandable move to keep trolls out. So who should blame MC.  So far I have seen a lot of positive things going on in the Slack channel. Many documents and background information is available. The only sad part is, that almost nothing of that information makes it to the bitcointalk forum - a strong indicator, that the leadership of Monkey Capital has challenges to deal with the huge user base of the crypto movement and concentrates on the finance guys of Wall Street and alike. This neglection might be a big mistake, especially of course in the eyes of most of the users here, as it is very different to almost every other ICO, who rely on average Joe to invest their few bucks. Well, future will tell how much of a mistake it was to partially neglect this channel here.  It's actually close to impossible to estimate the success this ICO will have. Average Joes like us have too little insight into the world of Wall Street and if they would jump on the Monkey waggon. The potential however is gigantic. And when an additional good number of average Joes also sees the potential, well then, sky is the limit. It doesn't stop at COEVAL and MNY either, that's just a beginning. Other companies already lign up to join the investment ecosystem MC is creating here. That's why I'm happily holding my COEVALs for now. Fingers crossed and no risk, no fun. That's my 2 tokens for today.  P.S. what nobody here noticed, as it again was only discussed in Slack, I wanna say a thank you to MC. They organized an airdrop of 200 COEVAL to every wave wallet that was holding COEVAL prior July 25th or something like that. The funds come from the personal wallet of the CEO, to say thank you to early adopters. They will be distributed tomorrow to 549 addresses.

I didn’t want to ask you this in open forum.. cause I don’t want to freak anyone out... but it appears to me that we will be closer to .01 btc/coebefore we are at 1btc/coe in 13 days - Slack Member""  ""Hi Slack Member,  Know that I really respect you. This is the only reason I am answering this as I would never ever answer any e mail about the token price. This is the only one I will ever answer and you may share it with whoever you wish for this reason (especially if you believe it will help with me not hearing about this subject in Slack; thanks. You may share your letter and this response in General Channel if you feel it will help; maybe so.)  First of all, I designed this token so that it had a limited number of units; I monitored it's price and selectively destroyed half the units. The other half of the active units (about 24k of them) never ever ever move wallets at all. None of this is an accident. I know where 90% of tokens are and what they are doing (not with me or controlled by me). I carefully set the whole supply-demand ratio in play and ""recklessly"" threw them to the masses, and then the whales, jealous bit by jealous bit, greedy token by greedy token. In reality, there's probably about 24k tokens that will ever see the light of the market at any one time -at least for years to com  It is designed like this for several reasons: 1. Human beings like massive numbers and when they see a big number getting even bigger, they feel a need to jump in 2. Human beings are jealous and thus hate it when someone else gets in on something else they didn't. So it needs to be something that at the start many many people can jump on and get frightened out of their mind by and jump out of with rapidity -this process of interchanging ownership is what creates volume and thus permanence in the market 3. Human beings often claim to understand things they do not; build something that shoots up and down very quickly and it has a sense of mystery and even spiritual value to it  So far, 1-3 have been effects that have been achieved as desired.  Of course the token will rise to 1 BTC; if it takes it 3 days to free-fall 80% and 1 day to spike 500%;why would it not grow 1000% in 9 days? I am amazed you ask, really.  But here is the main point: who gives a shit. The question of token design was one I have completely put out of my mind; it is after all doing its job. It is attracting greedy whales who want to be a part of the next big spike and freaking out undesirable short-term skittish investors and creating a lot of fuss and free marketing for Monkey Capital. Perfect -working just as intended!  Now -my focus is not on what it is doing (like I say it is working like it's meant to). My focus is on one thing only: BUILDING VALUE into the token (and other tokens). So far to do this I have:  1. Hired Josh Hawley, a massively capable and talented COO,to run ops which were growing way too heavy 2. Engaged legal council to put the token under Reg D so we are compliant with SEC legislation 3. Entered into the first ICO takeover backed by dividends in SEPTEMBER (NOT far) 4. Set up events for China investors and media in NY and Silicon Valley over the summer 5. Entered into discussions to partner with / consolidate 2 other companies in the industry thus adding more revenue channels 6. Got us on one other great exchange (tomorrow), and got recommendations from the highest possible people for Bittrex, Shapeshifter and Changely acceptance 7. Got another ICO to accept COEVAL as currency (if Shapeshifter or Changely works out) 8. Got a fantastic CFO with 20+ years of experience 9. Begun to formulate a consolidated HQ office location (SG) plan with respect to work and hiring work pass of employees etc 10. Managed to put into active employment more than 25+ members of our Slack on cumulative costs at my personal expense of $50k+ a month.  It is safe to say I know how this works. We are going to be ubiquitous in the token world. So what, you ask, if I am wrong  Fuck it, hold and you will still be mega a rich a few months later. Millions of dollars, hundreds of man hours of talent don't go into something and justend up as vapor.They end up like Google. That's what you are holding.  Sincerest Regards, Daniel""",False

He's been fairly responsive to members on slack, but has already issued a formal apology to the Waves community for the unwarranted negative  comments he made toward them earlier.  From what it reads like, he is looking to attracting big time investors to his project- there hasn't been a big push to crowdfund with nickels and dimes. The big holders appear to still have their Coeval, so the recent dumping doesn't appear to have come from there by and large. The  lack of communication with the larger altcoin community (or downright insulting remarks toward them)  and the push to bring in the big private investors, its certainly a setup unlike others I've paid into. Maybe I just don't get the mentality of those associated with big financials, but when you throw in the demeanor and actions of the leadership, the loose association to a cofounder working with folks from  one coin, the precipitous drop in funds leading up to their next ICO,  it just makes the whole thing smell fishy.

In fact I manage a private investment fund these days. That is what I do. The ICO is about investing, not trading. This is not a trading vehicle principally. About 30% of funds go into Blockchain related companies, about 30% go into traditional companies and about 30% go into new industry companies.  As to your point about granting old token holders new tokens, I agree with you: it does sound like a ponzi scheme. I actually thought about this when I put the model together in fact. But simply, it is not; it's more like a rights issue on a share, where only those participating get returns in the form of an option to buy into the next round at some preferred rate. But I am with you that marketing it in this way may be somewhat dubious. Further, I don't think these headline points make that very clear and I will be sure to emphasise that in the next version of the WP.

So here is my suggestion: I'll make the organiser behind this weird campaign against Marcelo an offer: take down all your slander about the guy, who did fuck all in this - absolutely nothing at all - and I will help you to ferret out, hunt down and catch the guy behind OneCoin.  Why would I be an effective ally in this respect? Let's see ...  I am a trained, professional successful investigative journalist. Go to a website I created, edited and ran: www.marxrand.com.  Just 3 of the stories I covered:  http://www.marxrand.com/archives/1365 - CHAIN REACTION - I wrote, researched and exposed this story, which is a 20,000 word piece on an automaker which was manufacturing cars all over South East Asia by using slave labour and those cars subsequently flew off roads when driven in the west as a result, killing people. This involved the obtaining of secret documents which showed how the automaker concerned bribed Chinese gvt officials (transcripts of conversations between Ministers and senior execs), lied about the reason for vehicle recalls and bribed US White House staff.  http://www.marxrand.com/archives/1499 - I commissioned and edited this expose of the FBI which was using a KKK leader as an inside informant when ALL other publications were too scared to (only after I put my balls on the line for my little online publication did Vice AFTER THAT step up to the line and commission it too. Written by Nate Thayer, the world-famous journalist (he doesn't give a fuck either) who interviewed Pol Pot. The ONLY western journalist to pull  that feat off in fact.  http://www.marxrand.com/archives/1230 - A release later in NewsWeek but first in MarxRand about how the FDA is approving drug price increases to Haiti so that women in Haiti get cervical cancer and cannot afford what is a 25c medicine for it. I edited and commissioned this story - again when no one else would - and it was a huge piece.  I have credentials. I have balls, I have brains. Let me use them to help you catch OneCoin. Condition: take down the stuff about Marcelo. Give me 3 months following the stop date of this ICO. I will succeed in doing this. If I fail put all that stuff over the web back up; if I succeed it stays down. NO COST.  I'd love to catch the guy. I am good at it and I love doing this sort of stuff. If the organiser of this weird attack on Marcelo does not accept my offer it's very clear to me it's just a petty personal vendetta and he is not sincere about the root cause.  If the response is no or silence then I have a hunch and that hunch tells me that this campaign is one to try and make Marcelo the guy who's responsible. In which case I am going after every single last one of you. You backed yourself into a corner here.",False

There are actually less ""hands in the pot"" on this than any ICO to date. Here is what you usually buy when you buy into an ICO; the vague and probably bullshit non-legally binding agreement that when Mr. Entrepreneur makes a profit he will pay you back. That's just garbage; specifically, it is not decentralised management, it is not in any way a value-efficient use of a token, nor is it really beneficial for anyone. Simply, the entrepreneur has no one looking over his shoulder, the investor is a nameless, faceless entity wherever in the world, and there is no agreement between the former and the latter. If that is not a recipe for loss-making then I do not know what is. Basically, on the slim a project does make money, what's the chance the entrepreneur will think to pay a nameless, faceless investor back before, say, buying their daughter a better birthday gift? ZERO. And that is perfectly natural, fair and justified.  What is wrong is not the token itself it is the fundamental way in which it is (mis-)applied to the value creation process.  How is Monkey Capital different? Well, first of all, as you indicate, there is a shit load of people involved in this. First, as by necessity in a crowdfunded campaign you are just another nameless, faceless investor, multiple separate parties working together under the roof of the project you are considering investing in should immediately be the first thing you are looking for; how many completely separate, unknown parties are involved in a project you invest in? Ask yourself this question first! The more there are, the more checking and double-checking and the less swiping from the till there is likely to be. This is simple human nature. Second, there is one fund manager in Monkey Capital. That is right - ONE entity manages the money; The FactoryBanking Company. This is outlined in the WP. The other parties have absolutely NO empowered management authority to move ANY cash ANYWHERE. The ONE manager is firthermore compensated on a fixed schedule, so there is no advantage in him cheating.  If you don't like the preponderance of so many different parties - multiple project parties, an independent administrative capital management entity controlled by an audit manager etc., I do not blame you. But this is what decentralisation looks like; it's jammed to the brim with different parties variously and alternately cooperating with one another and keeping an eye on another all the time.  If it looks any different, 99% chance you have lost your money. It's quite simple. I am not telling you this so you invest in this ICO (it sounds to me like actively managed ICOs are not your thing and you should instead focus on the digital assets that don't have these human variable factors in them; stuff like Statis, XRP, Peercoin etc., and if you have had success there so far, why change the damn formula now?) I am telling you this because any ICO with a management team, a simple, single-minded goal in place, and a straight pathway with minimal actors involved achieving it, is very, very, very unlikely to ever give you a return. You will be waiting 100 years and nothing will turn up, simple because no one is incentivised to make sure something ever does, at least not sufficiently so.  I am proud to have resolved that exact problem here. It is indeed, a fucking great achievement quite frankly, so I know exactly what I am talking about as I spent hours and days and weeks and more agonising over ringfencing this value proposition within the token.",False

Alright, here is the story - it is quite entertaining so I may as well let you in on it. First of all, I agree this One Coin POS is a fucking fake. He's horrible; he flies around South East Asia and stays in crappy 3 star hotels spouting bullshit about the Blockchain etc., etc. from what I can tell and what I have heard Actually, before I even knew that Marcelo had come across this fat fuck and his two Vietnamese sidekick prostitutes via an introduction from someone. Immediately I could tell this guy was full of shit.  Anyway, long story short, I ended up leaving the meeting early and I never heard from him again (I don't think he liked me very much either to be fair). He was so obviously running a ponzi scheme that I ... was amazed anyone believed him at all. Anyway, he did seem to have this weird network marketing business he was pumping etc., etc ... the whole morning over coffee with him and those prostitutes he brought to coffee was so tasteless I will never forget it.  Months later, I see this troll on the internet beating up Marcelo for apparently working for the guy. Which just doesn't make any sense at all. If you know Marcelo you know he is the kinda guy who won't even take $10 from a friend without knowing he has it at home first to pay it back. He's that honest. I am a bit more ruthless, and at times I guess that has got me into trouble (although I have never lost anyone any money - which keeps me safe I guess. Still, google the whole fiasco with ALD you will see what I am talking about! Details all at DMH&CO website on the front page drop down menu.) But Marcelo - he's the nicest, most honest guy you will meet. Let me give an example of this. Last year, he had a $250,000 check from an investor, but the check would only cash if he could find another $250,000 by a certain date. I told Marcelo, ""is the investor a VC or a private person?"" He said, ""a VC fund."" I said, ""Oh in that case just say 'fuck you, I am holding on to your money, you should not have put it in my account in the first place, and I will go and find the other guy you need to justify the investment later this year at some point."" I am just like that; I believe you have to strong arm people, you have to play rough at times to get ahead etc. Marcelo however, looked me straight in the eyes and said, ""No I won't do that. I refuse to do that. It's just wrong."" I emphasise I really tried to talk Marcelo into my idea as I firmly believed I was right here (although admittedly it was none of my business; this concerned a separate company Marcelo was running.) Marcelo actually handed back the check as well! I could not believe it. I was head in hands for him. I just cannot admit defeat that way; but he did so gracefully and honestly. (Marcelo and I are a good combo like this; aligned in interests but very different people. It often makes sense to work with someone who's your opposite, keeps you in check.)  My point is, when you know Marcelo personally, you know this is just ridiculous.  So I could not for the life of me work out what this was about when the guy came banging on a video  wall on my YouTube yelling about Marcelo and I asked him the other day ""what the fuck were you thinking working with One Coin? The fat fuck is a fraud!"" Marcelo would not tell me what happened as he was under an NDA!! But someone else (let's call this person a mutual friend) did tell me exactly what happened ... the fat One Coin fuck asked Marcelo to audit some tech for a week in the south of EU (I am guessing the guy probably was hurriedly trying to develop a Blockchain to cover his blatant fraud). That is it. That is the beginning and the end of the story.  I went back to Marcelo and said ""Marcelo, you have to denounce this guy!"" Marcelo tells me, ""I can't do that. I am under an NDA and if ... if it looks bad well, it was my decision. I have to face that. But I know nothing about the guy's business at all.""  Guys - here is the rule. I picked this team cause they are fucking honest and fucking brilliant. Come at me as hard as you want, but stay away from my team. They are good people, every one of them. They frankly are probably better people than I am. I just don't care about breaking rules if I feel a certain way. So here it is. That's the story. Funny maybe. Fraudulent? Nah.",False

The theory behind the White Paper is absolutely critical to a) the point of doing an ICO in the first place and b) the whole centrifugal argument as to how/why the thing is decentralised (as opposed to just being a fake IPO). Lately, it has seemed with ICOs that none of the writers have ever been to University and/or have ever read a White Paper (not that you need Uni to understand a WP but you DO need to understand that its primarily a thesis that is supported by some practical solution/application). We tried to get away as much as possible from the marketing brochure bullshit and really distill meaningful use-case solutions and options here with a view to evolving tokens as a suigeneric asset in and of themselves (ie not just a share or partnership unit rip off). We will be evolving the WP constantly as the ICO gets underway, too. And it may not even be fully complete as a body of watertight theory until the practical implementation of the multi-ICO strategy gets going over the next 6 months or so. What it will always have is potential solutions and not just sales pitches however. Cause you can always go and watch another infomercial, after all. Hopefully more ICOs will take heed. Knowledge progression and moving the dial is fundamental and key and I have zero tolerance for what looks like branding pap.",False
