Here is from their WP that I find it worth emphasizing for:  ""-All 4.5 billion users of mobile phones, tablets and other comparable devices are potential yappadappadoo customers. -The obvious advantages of the PWA technology over native applications will help generate positive awareness. -In growth markets (for example, China, India, Africa and South America), there is already significant awareness of the advantages of PWA technology. This is particularly relevant because of the restricted availability of high quality hardware and network coverage in those regions. -There is currently no app store offering PWA to a worldwide customer base. While a few small and mostly incomplete PWA listings exist on the Internet, the market-dominating App Stores have no interest in offering these applications. This provides the market opportunity for yappadappadoo. -The Blockchain integration in the yappadappadoo Store offers further advantages for all users, app-developers and –owners:  Transparent and secure payment in highly available digital currencies.  Transfer of apps and in-app content to other users.  Security of apps and digital content in the event of device-crash, -theft or -loss.  A completely trustworthy rating system. -With the yappadappadoo bootstrap strategy and attractive incentives for users, such as tokens for recommendations and reviews, we hope to achieve maximum awareness. Furthermore, we expect to cooperate with manufacturers of mobile devices (OEM). Preinstallation of the yappadappadoo Store on new devices would also help to dramatically increase awareness and use.""  Hoping that investors will come fund  this Yappadappadoo project that will bring valuable change in the apps industry.",True

Progressive Web Apps are developed with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript and they are known as ""Service Workers"" which sends requests and caches the responses.This is responsible for its offline feature. Here i found some explanations with regard to how PWAs work offline: ""Provide Offline Support One of the biggest problems with using the mobile web is that it must be connected to the internet. In order to provide a completely app-like experience, a PWA must be available and work offline. PWAs provide offline support via service workers, which are scripts that a web browser runs separately from and in the background of a web page. The service worker sends requests and caches the responses. In other words, a service worker doesn’t just store application data in random access memory; instead, it persists this data to the device’s file system or the browser’s internal databases. In the event that the browser’s internet connection fails, it can continue to operate offline. Service workers can also provide support for push notifications and updates.""

I think this is the reason why you need to install the application instead of using the web browser. There's a loophole on the web browser access until now. There’s no option for you to upload photos or watch Instagram stories. I believe YAPPADAPPADOO platform thru Progressive Web Apps (PWA) will have a solution for this.  Please see the article below for our reference:  Quote Use Instagram on Any Computer Like You Would on a Smartphone  Unlike Facebook and Twitter, Instagram lacks a desktop experience. The photo-sharing network limits users on how much they can post, see, and engage with if they’re logged in through a computer.  In a way, it makes sense that Instagram doesn’t want you uploading professionally edited photos from your computer. The app was designed to have you share instant photos and video clips of your everyday life.  If you login to Instagram on a browser, you’ll be able to scroll through your feed and like all of your friends’ photos. You can also access your notifications and the explore tab. But there’s no option for you to upload photos or watch Instagram stories. Until now.  Because everything has its loopholes, there are multiple ways you can still use Instagram on your Windows PC or Mac as if you were using it on your smartphone.

A quick refresher, AMP is short for accelerated mobile pages and is the technology produced by the AMP Project — an open source experiment started (and largely led) by Google. AMPs are just web pages.  They differ from other web pages in a few different ways, They simplify typical HTML by requiring rules to be followed for AMP validation including:  *ban inline JS *the AMP web components provide JS as part of AMP library *CSS can only be 50K *Google caches the content on a Google URL for quick access  PWAs are mobile web pages enhanced with features that provide an immersive, fast, app-like experience. This includes:  *the ability to access content while offline *the ability for publishers to send push notifications to mobile devices *more app-like interfaces (full-screen option) *faster experiences/transitions between pages  For more explanations about the differences and why PWA could possibly replace mobile applications in the future you may refer to the link below.   https://blog.ezoic.com/amp-vs-pwas-better-apps/",True

PWAs actually brings diversity in the apps ecosystem, it is not a predator set to kill & destroy native apps, rather, it promotes options and choices.  Read any article and intelligent studies on PWA will reveal that it has its own disadvantages against Native Apps, yet, it brings an assortment of goodies altogether.

Updated: Using service provider, your PWA is always up-to-date with the latest code. Means like an app, If you want to update code, then you need to create it and send a request to users to download the newly updated app. But in PWA, there is no need to send any kind of update request to the users. Whenever you upload code/patch on the server, it will directly sync with the user’s device.    Secure: PWA is always served using HTTPS (http will work well in development environment). So no one can interlope without proper authentication.    Easy to find: Using worker registration scope of PWA allows search engines to find them easily.    Push Notification: PWA has a functionality to implement Push notifications. So the user can easily connect to the application.    Installation: PWA installation is very easy. Just open the website ->Add to home screen. By this website will access from home screen without any hassles go to app store and download it. Then install it and access it.

There are of course home screen options for PWA launchers making the app easier to open, but current limitations of PWA with regards to hardware access might hamper the proposed apps to be develop.

Lightning fast actually refers to application launch and any related content download, not on the speed of the purchase process.  Any marketplace that offers app purchase will not simply ask you to select and click, there will be a series of prompts to confirm you are indeed intentionally buying the said app (unless in the case of iOS users where one can set his apple id not to verify anymore on any purchase to make the whole purchase experience relatively fast).

YAPPADAPPADOO really did a great job using PWA on their project. Updates are being done by the service workers when the application goes online. Service workers capability is using the cache mechanisms efficiently (this cache saves the data from using the application). Service workers allow error-free behavior during offline periods (it means that the application will function effectively even offline).,True

If they take advantage of the PWA technology, users can start uploading photos directly from their device cameras or from their galleries without having to install the native app.  Not really sure why instagram has not launched their PWA version till date, but i guess will soon see them with one.

When PWAs can already offer apps that can tap the device camera and could access the galleries too, i think it is unwise of instagram to hold back.  But instagram is also the perfect example of native apps advantage when it comes to marketing population reach.  When accessing their site through the browser, you will see the footer nag asking to download the native app from AppStore or GooglePlay, whereas native apps does not encourage PWAs at all.
