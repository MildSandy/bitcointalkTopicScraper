The company, Paraguay Mineral Mining S.A. (PMMSA) will distribute 45% of the Net Profits to all ORET Token holders. This distribution will be done on a weekly basis. As a result of the geological exploration of the area, our experts have calculated that the average gold mineralization is 7.5 g of 999 alloy of Gold per ton of ore. The calculations show that our projected plant will give a net profit of 2,517,500 USD per month of which 1,132,875 USD which will equally distributed among the 12,500,000 ORET tokens. That is equivalent to 0.09 UDS per ORET per month.   What is ORET?   Ore Token, a Kickstarter coin based on ERC-20, is the means for PMMSA to raise the capital necessary to buy the gold rich land plus acquire all the necessary equipment for our gold processing plant.   PMMSA (Paraguay Mineral Mining) Paraguay Mineral Mining is a Paraguayan company dedicated to the extraction of GOLD, located in the center of the Eastern region of the Country, in the city of PASO YOBAI.    About Paraguay and Paso Yobai The Company is currently exploring its 5-hectare Paso Yobai Gold Project. Two major trends of over 5km and over 14km where management has identified six large and highly prospective gold zones. Drilling highlights to date include gold intercepts of: •   25.5m of 4.09 g/t from surface •   2.13m of 94.6g/t at 34.6m depth •   2.7m of 107.7g/t at 83.3m vertical depth •   7.34m of 37.94g/t at 92.4m downhole depth.   How ORET works? 01 / INVEST Our company Paraguay Mineral Mining S.A. gives you the opportunity to invest and be part of our company by buying ORET Token, thanks to the blockchain technology. 02 / OUR COMPANY Our company will start activities once the ICO ends, starting with the acquisition of the land. Thereafter, the installation and start-up of the mineral processing plant. 03 / OUR INVESTORS RECEIVE THEIR PROFITS Investors receive 45% of the net profits of Paraguay Mineral Mining S.A company, directly related to the profits from gold extracted.  What is ORET tokens? The ORET tokens is the equivalent of having shares in the PMMSA Company. ORET gives the Holder the right to their share of 45% of the monthly net profit directly related to the extraction of GOLD.  (The example on monthly earnings is completely explained with exact numbers on our main page https://www.oretoken.net   EXAMPLE OF PROFITS BASED ON INVESTMENT   30 tons/hour         x   14 hours        = 420 tonnes of ore per day. 420 tons of mineral      x   22 days         = 9,240 tonnes of ore per month. 9,240 tonnes of mineral   x   7.5 gpt        = 69,300 g. of gold per month.   9,240 tonnes of mineral   x   0.4158 gpt expenses. = 3482 g. Total expenses.   69,300 grams      x   95.4% Recovery  = 66,112 g. gold recovered. 66,122 grams.      -   3,482 grams.         = 62.640 grams gross profit per month. 62,640 grams.      ÷   31.1 grams          = 2,014 Oz of gold per month. 2,014 Oz of Gold   x   1,250 USD Oz     = 2,517,500 USD per month.  - 45% of net profit = 1,132,875 USD profit for investors is divided by the total supply of ORET - 12,500,000 - 0.09 USD is the monthly payment per ORET Token.   Example 500 USD           =      1,000 ORET    1,000 ORET   x   0.09 USD   = 90.00 USD profits per month.   Mining costs as per the feasibility study are $2.68 per tonne mined, which, at a 1:0.2 strip ratio, comes to $3.22 per tonne of ore (1 tonne of ore plus 0.2 tonne of waste). Processing costs are $11.60 per tonne of ore, and general and administrative (G&A) comes to $1.90 per tonne, processed. This mining and processing cost of roughly $16.72 per tonne of ore now has to be subtracted from the value of the ore. Applying a 95.4% recovery to the average grade of 7.5 grams per tonne gold leaves us with a recovered grade of 6.74 grams per tonne gold. Assuming a $1250 Oz. gold price we get an average per tonne value of ~$270.90. Subtracting the $16.72 (0.1458 grams) per tonne production costs nets an approximate operating margin of $245.18 per tonne ($270.90-$16.72).

We have been leasing a small mine on the Main Gold Trend for almost two years now but we’ve worked on-and-off in Paso Yobai gold area for over 8 years. With ORET Token we want to acquire our own land and greatly scale-up our mining operation. Due to numerus circumstances, its fundamental to acquire a Mine before putting up a big Processing Plant. This is what we hope to accomplish with ORET.",False
