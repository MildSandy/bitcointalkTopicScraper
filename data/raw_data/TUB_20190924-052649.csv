Tubig Blockchain Limited aims to provide water infrastructure where people or communities can use Tubig coin to pay for clean water, water services and water technologies cheaply. Our purpose for using the Blockchain Technology is to remove any monopoly restricting water supply in any geographical location.   How many people have access to clean and safe water? Where do they get it from, and how much do they pay for it? Can the world be a better place if those with access to water sell to those without access cheaply through a decentralized digital currency at a very cheap rate?  Water connects every aspect of life. Access to safe water and sanitation can quickly turn problems into potential. Today, 3 in 10 people lack access to safe water or 2.1 billion, lack access to safe, readily available water at home. More people have access to mobile phone than clean water. We can change this. Letâ€™s work together to make clean drinking water available to all.  Tubig Blockchain Limited are going to partmer with Aquamat SA Pty Ltd, Veolia Water, Thames Water Utilities Ltd, Del Oro Water Company to make clean water readily available.      How many people use a source of drinking water that is protected from contamination? Photograph: WHO/Unicef Joint Monitoring Programme  https://tubig.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/water-graph.jpg   Over 663 million people in the world still lack access to improved drinking water sources according to World Bank (Jun 23, 2017). Tubig blockchain limited is poised to helps countries improve urban and rural water supply services delivery and improve sector performance through fund raising (ICO), with the Tubig we can meet the infrastructural needs for water supply in Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa, America e.t.c, this project cannot be possible without funds and we intend to help government and NGO's carry out water projects on there behalf and get paid based on agreement to be reached prior to the project execution.     Key facts     1. In 2015, 71% of the global population (5.2 billion people) used a safely managed drinking-water service that is, one located on premises, available when needed, and free from contamination.  2. 89% of the global population (6.5 billion people) used at least a basic service. A basic service is an improved drinking-water source within a round trip of 30 minutes to collect water.  3. 844 million people lack even a basic drinking-water service, including 159 million people who are dependent on surface water.  4. Globally, at least 2 billion people use a drinking water source contaminated with faeces.  5. Contaminated water can transmit diseases such diarrhoea, cholera, dysentery, typhoid, and polio. Contaminated drinking water is estimated to cause 502 000 diarrhoeal deaths each year.  6. By 2025, half of the world`s population will be living in water-stressed areas.  7. In low- and middle-income countries, 38% of health care facilities lack an improved water source, 19% do not have improved sanitation, and 35% lack water and soap for hand washing.
