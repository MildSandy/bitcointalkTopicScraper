They are using this investment and resources to build the system ready for launch in the UK. This is one of the reasons they are yet to release a public sale date, as they want to have a quality working product in place first to give potential investors and supporters confidence in the team project. Make sure to stay tuned for further updates and thanks for the interest",False

With regards to competition, while there's no other project doing anything like us, some indirect competition may include projects that tokenize renewable energy, since it's also a way to reduce carbon emissions.

Have you tried out the Zero Carbon Market demonstration platform?  I gave it a run earlier, it's super user-friendly with helpful prompts, and has made the switching over process to clean energy fun! 🙌🙌🙌    Test it out here, and follow the steps below: https://uk.thezerocarbonproject.com/  1. Your postcode: Input ‘W4 3UB’ 2. What fuel do you wish to compare: Select ‘Electricity’ (we will be including gas offset by carbon emissions) 3. Are you on Economy 7 Tariff: Select ‘No’ 4. How do you pay for your Electricity: Select ‘Monthly Direct Debit’  The system will now check all the energy suppliers in the UK market to find a list of existing tariffs that you may be on. This will be used as a benchmark to compare savings from zero carbon offers.  5. Who is your electricity supplier: Select ‘nPower’ 6. What is your electricity tariff name: Select ‘Feel Good Fix June 2008’ 7. Do you know how much electricity you consume: Select ‘Yes’ 8. Your electricity: Input ‘5500’ kWh every year 9. Click ‘See all energy plans’  The system will then search the market for the best energy plans and calculate your cost savings relative to your existing tariff.  You can then click the ‘Select’ button which takes you to a form to arrange your switch to the new energy supplier providing zero carbon energy. The form requests information on your site address, a direct debit set up form and terms and conditions.  Try it out and share what you think about the system!

The Energis token is an essential reward mechanism.  The Energis token aligns individual interests with societal climate change goals.  Secondly the Energis tokens are designed to be valuable by capturing the future utility value received by future customers from using the Zero Carbon market.  Other reward schemes just won’t be able to capture this future utility value received from the teams market service.  The future utility value is captured in 4 ways as follows: •    Transaction fees must be paid using Energis tokens •    Demand for Energis tokens grows along with customer base •    Supply of Energis tokens is limited •    Traded on liquid secondary token market   The ultimate aim is to have a global de-centralized energy exchange, which is the teams end game",False

We deliver lower prices leveraging international carbon credits and intense market competition, along with a valuable Energis token reward.

Also WePower are tokenising the electricity output from new renewables farms.

The world’s politicians have been working on regulatory solutions to the problem, the latest major milestone being the Paris Climate Agreement adopted in December 2015. However, evidence provides support that temperatures continue to rise, weather systems are becoming more erratic, Arctic ice-caps continue to melt, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide are rising and coal fire generators are still under construction. According to Adrian E. Raftery et al., it now seems unlikely that temperature increases will be contained below 2 degrees Celsius by 2100 but a more suitable planning benchmark may be a range of between 2 - 5 degrees. “The likely range of global temperature increase is 2.0–4.9 °C, with median 3.2 °C and a 5% (1%) chance that it will be less than 2 °C (1.5 °C).“  Check out Zero Carbon Project here 👇👇👇  https://www.zerocarbonproject.com/",False

International carbon credits are a mechanism to subsidise cheap carbon emission reduction projects.  Energy suppliers with Zero Carbon can compete with each other across the Zero Carbon Market by sourcing their electricity from the same cheap fossil fuels, while offsetting the carbon emissions using international carbon credits. The offsets are much cheaper than the premium for renewable energy and the Market's intensely competitive market delivers more than enough price reductions to cover the extra cost.  Consumers in these countries like you mentioned can choose from energy suppliers that are leveraging international carbon credits to offset carbon emissions. They can also enjoy cost savings since the prices offered on the Zero Carbon Market are competitive. Additionally, they will get rewarded with Energis tokens. These Energis tokens are required by the Zero Carbon Market from energy suppliers as transaction fees.",False

To an outsider, the electricity industry is technically complex, so the differences are not obvious. The simple answer is that our approach will make a more immediate material impact on carbon emissions, by delivering the lowest price of electricity, all around the world.  The recent energy blockchain projects that have had their share of success are based on conceptually sound ideas. These include leveraging blockchain innovations to support peer to peer electricity trading and to finance new renewables farms. However, in practice they will take time to scale because the underlying solar and battery technologies are still too expensive and will remain so for several more years. As a result, energy blockchain projects will be unable to make an early material impact on climate change as they will be more expensive than competing carbon based electricity; and therefore will be unable to scale fast enough.  The Zero Carbon Project has a solution to tackle climate change which will make an immediate impact because it is competitive on price outcomes and is globally scalable. It advances energy market democracy by working in partnership with members of the crypto-community as customers both during the token sale and also during the transition to zero carbon.  Our solution combines economic technologies that are being used for cost savings today, without the blockchain. These include online consumer switching sites, online reverse energy auctions and international carbon credits. We are enhancing these innovations by leveraging Ethereum smart contracts to create the Energis token which acts as a reward mechanism and the catalyst for change, for energy consumers in the crypto-community.  The Zero Carbon Project is also different in that we can only effectively tackle climate change by working in partnership with our customers who are energy consumers in the crypto-community. To be successful, we really do need to bring democracy to energy and blockchain.",False

The Zero Carbon Project tackles climate change by offering consumers access to low-cost fossil fuel energy suppliers. Suppliers source their electricity from the same cheap fossil fuels, while offsetting the carbon emissions using international carbon credits. The offsets are much cheaper than the premium for renewable energy and Zero Carbon's competitive market delivers more than enough price reductions to cover the extra cost. By doing so, the Zero Carbon Project provides consumers with the ability to have immediate and material impact on carbon emissions by choosing suppliers from their market.  The on-chain aspect involves creating Energis utility tokens using smart contracts, which capture the utility value that consumers can gain from using the Zero Carbon Market. Consumers are rewarded with Energis tokens as meaningful reward-based incentives for consumer action, such as agreeing to become a consumer, signing up to a new zero carbon energy contract through the platform, consuming zero carbon energy and nominating new consumers. Energis tokens are used to pay the transaction fees for using the zero carbon markets. On the other hand, in return for the supplier winning consumers across the Zero Carbon Marketplace, the supplier pays a transaction fee to the Project using Energis tokens paid into a smart contract. Up to 70% of this is recycled to  consumers through a reward pool smart contract.  These Energis tokens can then be traded in a liquid global secondary market, 24 hours and 7 days a week. This marketplace ensure that any customers receiving higher utility value from the service can purchase tokens from customers receiving less utility value, offering customers lower transactions than carbon based energy prices. The distributed ledger reduces transaction costs of managing Energis token transactions internationally across national borders. As consumers grow in number, the demand for Energis tokens to pay trasnaction fees increases. The constrained supply of tokens drives value into the token. This block-chain driven token economy creates the catalyst for change and empowers consumers to be able to reduce their carbon output by selecting choice energy suppliers that can offset carbon emissions through international carbon credits. Competitors are relying on renewable energy technologies which are still not price competitive with fossil fuels. Zero Carbon Project deliver lower prices leveraging international carbon credits and intense market competition, along with a valuable Energis token reward.",False

Well, here is the answer to that.  The Zero Carbon Project systems are fully developed and ready to be deployed as soon as the token sale is completed.  Our software will be launched as a hybrid system. This will include a centralised system for the Zero Carbon Market to match energy suppliers' offers with energy consumers; and a distributed settlement system using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to settle transactions and distribute rewards using Energis tokens.  The Zero Carbon Markets for business and household have already been developed as an online system, off-blockchain. The software is already being used in the UK by Zero Carbon Project's parent company with almost all of the active energy suppliers participating. This allows the  Zero Carbon Market to be ready for launch in the UK by October 2018.  This Market software will require some minor modifications to support each additional energy market prior to its launch. In addition, the software will continue to be developed.  Smart contracts have been designed to support the Energis token economy.  More information is available in sections 6,10 and 11 of the Whitepaper.",False

Main goal of the project — to reduce carbon emissions faster than renewable energy.  The Zero Carbon project consists of two parts:  Supply of energy at a lower price than the existing contracts from renewable sources and fossil fuels;  Involving people in the use of the Zero Carbon project by providing a reward-based compensation scheme to encourage consumers for their participation in the project and encouraging them to do so.
