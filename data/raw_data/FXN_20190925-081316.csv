INTRODUCTION FoxCasino is a protocol that defines the interactions between unreliable participants in the context of the online gambling industry. This includes two levels: the game level - the player's confidence in a particular casino operator in the context of the game (provably just gambling) and the level of the business model: that is, the game developer should not trust the casino operator to receive a reward. Simply put, all the participants who are needed for the functioning of the system, should not trust each other to cooperate.  A reliable third party that is needed in the traditional online gambling industry for work is replaced by smart contracts that act as stand-alone agents that automatically reward all key players: game developers, referers and operators of independent platforms needed to open the game. The fact that the reward system is fully automated and transparent allows you to enter the crowdfunding element into the bankroll of each game and to encourage security audits at the community level.  Obtaining the randomness necessary for gambling in a deterministic virtual machine is not a trivial task, therefore, in addition to the technical production of pseudo-random values, the level of economic incentive should be introduced. Similarly, unpredictable random numbers that determine the results in each game are provided by economically stimulated participants interacting with the PRNG contract. This system can provide the P2P market for game developers and support a large number of independent interface platforms where players can open and play various gambling games.  At first, we can expect that existing licensed online casino operators can integrate with the protocol to reduce costs, while long-term new rules can appear, more suitable for decentralized, transparent and automated systems. The long-term objective of the FoxCasino project, in addition to providing experimental software and implementing the main components of the protocol, is to promote the development of new forms of certification of online gambling. So far, gambling on Ethereum remains in the gray legal field, but this should not be so, since technologies such as Ethereum offer opportunities for much more effective protection of customers.  Internal FXN token - FoxCasino - is used as a system of points for stimulation, as well as the sub-currency that is used in games. The FXN Token is the standard Ethereum ERC20 token.  Goals of the FOX CASINO protocol -Remove the need for a trusted party in all aspects of the online gambling industry -Thus, reducing the operating costs of online gambling provides higher payouts -Reduce the risk of fraud -Remove the need and responsibility with online casino operators to maintain a balance of the player's account -It allows game developers to monetize their work while keeping their IP-address - Provides game developers access to the bankroll for their game without additional responsibility for managing it -Includes an open ecosystem, a provably honest interactive online casino  Integrate a system of replicated patterns and a stimulated audit so that game developers who are not familiar with Solidity can take advantage of the new paradigm of value transfer that Ethereum offers.  SECURITY FOXCASINO SYSTEM This is transparency, consistency and cryptographic verification of software used to automate processes related to trust and economic incentives for its participants. We will provide a sustainable model that will benefit all parties involved in the business processes of online gambling, as well as players.
