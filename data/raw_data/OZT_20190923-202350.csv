I am a senior communication professional with a solid career. I was contracted last November to promote a start-up project, which seemed serious, had a good team lined-up, and in which I came to believe in, but, unfortunately, it became a shady business.  I resigned from Flashmoni upon expressing directly to Serge Lobreau my utter repulse for his lack of transparency, multiple lies, potential unlawful practices, mismanagement and lack of human values he revealed.  This was the content of a personal message to him, that I shared with some people, but it was leaked to the internet without my consent. Still, it reflects my opinion and concerns.  Despite the disclosure of the company’s problems, I confirm some other information exposed publicly, by someone else, regarding this unfortunate case, as I have confirmed the situation with owners of some of the companies mentioned and some investors.  Meanwhile, I discovered that Serge Lobreau vilified me, trying to damage my honour and reputation. I will deal with his defamation with the help of the Portuguese judicial system.  I already filed at the police a criminal complaint against Serge Lobreau. He will have to respond in Court to the multiple charges against him.
