I believe that user information will be required to setup an account and use the Jehmi platform. I don't want to do the security protocol injustice so I will directly qoute the whitepaper: ""The Bezant blockchain will be created using the Hyperledger fabric technology as a starting point which provides for distributed ledger technology (DLT) enabling enterprise-ready network security, scalability, confidentiality and performance, in a modular blockchain architecture.  The Basic workflow of transaction on the proposed Bezant blockchain: 0) Assumption: User has downloaded Client and registered with Organization (channel) 1) Client A initiates a transaction proposal and send to multiple peers on the channel; 2) Endorsing peers verify (sign) the proposal transaction and submit to the Client A; 3) Client sends endorsed Proposals to Orderer as a transaction; 4) An orderer receives proposed ledger updates concurrently from many different applications in the network on a particular channel and packages these into blocks; 5) The final phase of the transaction workflow involves the distribution and subsequent validation of blocks from the orderer to the peers, where they can be applied to the ledger.""   Our scope is: Bezant as a payment solution. And Jehmi: ""1) Content providers, 2) Distribution partners, and 3) End users so that they can create a better ecosystem for the delivery of digital content such as games, music, and e-books that will provide for a disruptive solution to the incumbent app stores. ""  Let me know if you have any other questions!",False
