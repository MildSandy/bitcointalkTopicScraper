The reason why we do this is that all the money we have is going to be spent on nodes, which is what is really going to give us a great ROI, Cederis is not just an idea or a project, it's a reality, although the ico do not reach the minimum, we with our funds will continue working in cederis, that is the reason.",False

Like you know the ICO was successful at the end because a private investor bought 2 nodes directly. I asked for a certain kind of proof in order to be able to check the claim. This proof was given to me today and as far as I see it looks fine and legit. So from my side I can say the ICO really ended successfully.  This means I now follow the rules outlined in the escrow details at the start of the ICO. For this amount of invested funds it means that I will release the escrowed ETH to 0x19C9fff1BD730db8C7b1E8A39DC05d4daf51Fdc9, which is the address that was given to me to release the investments to. This will happen following the milesteps which say that a minimum amount of funds will be needed for the start to lift this project from grounds.  As far as I saw the team worked pretty hard. I saw their exhaustion and sleep deprivation during this time. So I hope they will be able to start this soon and bring everything to a great success.  Next step from my side is to release the invested funds. Which means the ETH and the BTC. I will still observe and help when an escrow is needed.  I wish everyone good luck with your investment and the project success.",False

Bonus : 40% January 16th to January 28th             20% January 29th to Feb 04th             10% Febrery 05th to Feb 11th             0% Febrery 12th to Feb 18th  Yes, you can see on top header, to the right, we are on round 2, 20% Bonus + annual revenues, all rounds have annual revenues to all investors Quote from: kyxap on February 02, 2018, 10:49:38 PM Quote from: PDAngel on February 02, 2018, 10:27:25 PM Quote from: rendravolt on February 02, 2018, 08:52:36 PM Quote from: mr.charming on February 02, 2018, 07:22:05 PM Quote from: steampunkz on February 02, 2018, 10:21:47 AM This project needs more impression to the internet, especially on the social network site. They can also advertise on google ad sense, youtube to gain more customers to support the ICO. Yes.the popularity of project is still not many more.many of people still don't know about the ISP project.so i also recommend you to promote  this project as more as possible so wr can easily get the more investeros.  Actually to promote it is easy only with social media like facebook, twitter, instagram and others, do not forget to always use the hashtag in your post because it will interest people. But maybe Cederis don't have any bounty or sharing their social networks. Lol, if you join their telegram group, have only 38 persons at here and all of them using Portuguese. And with what such small amount of people in telegram is connected? And why are some Portugueses? Developer, I think there are no problems to create one more telegram channel and to call there all interested?  From begining, people contact with us direct to whatsapp, telegram, twitter, or subscribing. On new group this people is joining the group. There are Spanish people, Singapor, Japan, Demmark, etc, Not all investors and subscribers is in.

Otherwise how can they explain it to the investors if they can not get the licence of their country? Just think about it ... exactly as it will be better to know which country is actually going to support cedris and wisp as from my guess not all countries can support this project and another thing is the project will actually help most rural community but at what cost  Although during 2018 the project was carried out in our country, we have a method so that anyone can invest in live nodes where they live. We will make available, in the platform, a series of nodes for sale, with all the information about coverage, users, population within the coverage, node price, and one or several users will be able to buy the node. These nodes will be for sale in our token.  For example: 1 node for 5000 population in coverage can cost 75,000 Tokens (0.10 each token), and among several users go buy their tokens and invest in that node. When the node price is reached, we install and manage it and a large percentage will be distributed among the owners of the node. So anyone in the world can participate from a living beginning where he lives.",False

Let's speak about minimum investments. The 0.01BTC were suggested by me. However we can speak about it. Especially the minimum ETH. Please consider that the Bitcoin transaction fee is nowadays insanely high. I saw transactions that had to pay $40 just to get confirmed. At the moment around $20 is needed for a transaction if you need to forward it in a single transaction and want a confirmation in the first block. Not risking that the transaction hangs without getting confirmed.  ETH is not that bad however they slowly need higher tx fees also. TX fees would have to be kept in mind for every transaction invested. They don't summarize like one bigger investment.  Individual work amount per mini investment is also something to have kept in mind.  So I will set this point open and decided by the issuer Cederis. I will follow his decision then.  Every investor would have to keep in mind that his investment would be only as high as the investment minus needed tx-fees.",False

Take the connection to each tower or office usually takes about 90 days maximum. (here you need building licenses)  These are the 3 minimum concepts to start being an operator and have active service.  Also, it is necessary to take into account the time necessary to reach each company, the corresponding department, to have the contacts, counting on all this, the time to invest to be able to start giving service is usually around a year.

Almost 60% of the world's population does not have Internet access, and of the remaining 40%, only half have connections of more than 20 Mbps. If we speak of rural environments, those who have internet, do so at no more speeds of 4Mbps, with our platform we want to break that barrier.  Solutions  Through the Cederis platform, any person, entrepreneur or company can create their own ISP (Internet Service Provider) through wireless (WISP), using the most competitive standards such as LTE or Wireles 5G Fixed.  We put at your disposal all the necessary tools to do it without having to waste time in bureaucratic procedures, such as the creation of a company, or the management of licenses, or the search for contacts, and contracts with third parties, without the need to pay abusive royalties to franchised companies that only think about their own benefit and not about the entrepreneur.  By using the Cederis platform, you will use our ISP licenses, and all the tools to set up your main node and its deployment, among which, access to thousands of telecommunication towers around the world and Fiber Optic T1 dedicated for operators in your central.  Thanks to the union and collaboration between all and the incentive of our token, we will ensure the quality and continuity of the project and all the services.  How it Works?

Why do I escrow this project?  I escrow this project because after asking many questions I believe there is a real team behind that is able to bring the project to realization. The team can be contacted in reallife also and it is an internet project.  Accepted Investmentforms  The issuer accepts the following investmentforms:  BTC ETH  Regarding investing with BTC  The escrow address is the direct deposit address. The escrow will only check who is the investor in case of refund. So when you want to send coins then take care of the proof the dev awaits from you for invested coins/token sent by you. Send the issuer a pm if unsure. ALSO make sure to send in a way a potential refund will be possible for you. Please check the part ""Investor verification"" here in the escrow details. The issuer will handle the payout of the Coins/token at the end of the ICO/IPO/ITO phase.   Regarding investing with ETH  The escrow address is the direct deposit address.

The issuer will handle the payout of the Coins/token at the end of the ICO/IPO/ITO phase.   Who am I?  I am SebastianJu an escrow on Bitcointalk since years. I am not connected to the issuer or the coin and I'm an independent third party who acts as an escrow in an attempt to make your investment more secure. See my Servicethread for reviews: [ANN] SebastianJu - Free Legendary Escrow Service - Escrowed over 8150 BTC.   Safety from Escrow and Investment Project Details  The investment will be open from 16th January at 12:00 and ends at 18th Febrary at 12:00 UTC.  The investments will be released in steps according to the roadmap you can read here:  1.- Watever the raised, 5% of the total raised will be sent to their wallet after ICO ended. (2% legal + 3% Team) 2.- If Raised $50k up to 150.000$ , additional to point 1 $50.000 will be sent to the issuer wallet, the rest remains in escrow until they installed 5 nodes. Once installed these 5 nodes, I will send $100.000 or the remaining rest to the issuers wallet to install the rest 10 nodes (milestone step 2) 3. - If Raised up to 1.5M$ ,  additional to point 1 $150.000 will be sent to the issuer wallet, the rest remains in escrow until they installed 10 nodes and launch the users/investor portal q3-q4 2018. Once all is done, I will send all raised on ico to continues global deployment (milestone step 2) 4.- Raised more than 1.5M$ , additional to point 1 $350.000 will be sent to the issuer wallet to install first 10 nodes (150.000) and 250.000 to take first MVNO licenses, the rest remains in escrow until they installed 10 nodes, and launch users/investors platform portal q3-q4 2018. Once all is done, I will send all raised on ico to continues global deployment.  Milesteps will help to provide further trust into the project by receiving something before more investments will be released. It can help to check out if the dev can really provide what was planned.  The minimum goal for the investment period is $50,000 and there is no hard cap.  In case minimum goal is not reached then all investments that reached the escrow address will be refunded to the participants minus refund fees and transaction charges.  There will be a minimum investment of 0.01 BTC and 0.2 ETH. Investments below that threshold can not be refunded nor credited. Investments does not summarize in this point.  Please note that the safety the escrow can provide only reaches up to the point where the escrow released the investments to the issuer.   Escrow Address   TO BE ABLE TO RECEIVE A REFUND please check out the text about verification and refunds in the details part ""Investor Verification"" and ""Refunds possible?"". Don't send to a quoted address. ALWAYS only check out my post directly and send to that check out there to which address you can send! And please check regularly if the escrow link or address was changed in the first post of the thread. Inform the escrow fast by pm, post in the thread about it and give red trust if possible to warn others fast then. If you sent the escrow a pm then he will know about it and can act by giving red trust to the issuer to prevent damage.

See my Servicethread: [ANN] SebastianJu - Free Legendary Escrow Service - Escrowed over 8150 BTC.  You can check a signed message very easy. The fastest way is to visit https://tools.bitcoin.com/verify-message/.   Investor Verification  This is important in case of refunds have to happen and you want your investment back. Please note that refunds are bound to a fee because of the immense amount of work refund an ICO/IPO/ITO means for an escrow. Please check out the following parts ""Refunds possible?"" and ""Refundfee"".  There are two ways to verify your investment which is important when, for some reason, the investment has to be refunded back to investors.  First way (Does not work with exchanges. Can't be changed anymore when you sent your investment already.):  Try to not send from an exchange. Only send coins/token from an address you can sign a private message from or at least where you are able to get the private key for that address! This is important since in case of REFUND you can't proof that you sent the investment. This is the case when you, for example, sent the investment directly from an Exchange. In that case it would be better to send the coins to your own wallet where you control the private key of the addresses first and then from there to the escrow address.  For information about what you need to sign a message you can check out this thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=990345  Second way (Works with exchanges. Can't be changed anymore when you sent your investment already.):  Another alternative to proof your ownership of a payment would be to send the last 4 numbers of your user id as satoshies(or corresponding decimals in other coins/token) in your transaction.  Move your mouse over my username on bitcointalk.org, see my profile id is 18640. You can see yours when you are in your profile and hover the mouse over the links on the left menu. Something like u=18640 in the links show your User-ID. The last 4 digits are 8640 for my username. When you add the 4 or 5 last digits of your userid as satoshies to your payment then it is a pretty strong proof that it really is your investment.  For example you want to send 2 bitcoins and your profile id would be 18640 then you send 2.00008640 Bitcoin.   Refunds possible?  Refunds can only be done in case the issuer agrees or there are reasons to stop the ICO/IPO/ITO by the escrow, because there came up doubts that make the project too insecure to proceed.  As long as you did not verify your investment transaction in some way I will see your investment as unverified. Otherwise it could mean a random person could claim an investment as his investment and steal it from the real investor. You wouldn't want this to happen with your investment also.  Refunds can only be done instantly when you can proof ownership of the investment. Either by signing a message from the sending bitcoin address or by your investment amount matching your forum user id. See description about verification above.   Refundfee  Because of the huge amount of work coming from refunding many individual investors, having to have a conversation with each of them and so on, I had to establish a fee for refunding.  The fee structure is meant per investor, regardless of how many investments happened by that investor, and looks like this:  Refund amount will be the amount that reached the final escrow address minus refund fee minus transaction costs to send the investment back. Transaction costs will be calculated based on the 3 block bitcoin transaction fee on https://bitcoinfees.info/  Minimum refund fee is 0.006 BTC / 0.06 ETH or the fee structure, whatever is higher:  10% on the first $100 5% on the next $900 (on the portion over $100 up to $1,000) 4% on the next $4,000 (on the portion over $1,000 up to $5,000) 3% on the next $10,000 (on the portion over $5,000 up to $15,000) 2.5% on the next $40,000 (on the portion over $10,000 up to $50,000) 2% on the next $100,000 (on the portion over $50,000 up to $100,000) 1.5% on the next $300,000 (on the portion over $100,000 up to $400,000) 1% on the next $600,000 (on the portion over $400,000 up to $1,000,000) 0.8% of everything over $1,000,000  Good luck everyone with your Investment and this investment project!  --------------------  Info to dev:  Please post in the OP something like this. You might lower the text size a bit but it must be near the escrow address or the link to the investment website:     ************** The investment is handled through a website held by you, the dev. So dev please post the following paragraph above the investment address the investor can see on your website.  ""ONLY invest after reading the escrow terms regarding how to invest so that in case of refund a refund can happen for you because you sent your investment provable. Check the safety I can provide, the refund terms and the refund fees, including the minimum refund fee: #####Link to my post#####""",False
