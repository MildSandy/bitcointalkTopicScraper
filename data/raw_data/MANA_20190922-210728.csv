As such, we believe this public virtual world should be ruled by open standards, shielded from the agenda of any central organization. In Decentraland, a blockchain-backed virtual realty world, users are land owners and have full control over the content of their tiles, as well as the interactions that take place there.  We are inspired by different visions of the metaverse, like those depicted in Snowcrash and Ready Player One.  Decentraland uses a blockchain as a immutable record of ownership. Our first experiments were focused on building our own blockchain, but we are now creating this world on top of an smart contract in Ethereum. Details to come soon!  We’ve been working on this idea for two years, but now we want to take it to the next level, integrate with other headsets (right now it only works on the HTC Vibe), and add scripting capabilities so that users can create any sort of application: gaming, social or art.  To do this, we're going to do a crowdsale and implement a system of bounties for artists and developers. This is a visualization of the current state of the network. We started mining a testnet in March; this is our second blockchain. The first one was a proof of concept that worked exclusively with a Browser over WebRTC.  We’re selling the first tiles of Decentraland in a public sale that will start in August. The proof of concept that we have right now uses mining on a testnet. It only allows for static content to be distributed through the network.  We will sell an ERC20 token named MANA, which can be used to buy LAND. More details will come after we finish our whitepaper.  I will keep you updated with more details as they come!   Try It Now  Github  Announcement on Medium  Forum  Slack",False

It's obvious that certain posts are ""sponsored"", paid with bounty tokens.  I always act with the highest degree of integrity and I'm thinking - maybe, just maybe, as a badge of honour, as a matter policy - we should actually require each social media / forum post to require honest explanation:  ""join our social media campaign and help promote the project""  It's pretty much true and at least we are not treating our friends like idiots, they know we have some incentives and here we have a chance of getting them onboard...",False
