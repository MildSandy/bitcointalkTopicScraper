We're not ""picking"" anyone. We simply see a pressing problem and we're offering a solution. That's the classic definition of making money - solving other people's problems. Lawyers and doctors make the most - because they solve the most serious of people's problems.  The ""unmotivated guitarist"" stereotype exists for a number of reasons. First on that list is the fact that anyone who owns a guitar is considered to be ""a guitarist"". Much like nowadays anyone with a digital camera is considered to be ""a photographer"". To actually become a guitarist takes years of dedication, practice, thousands and thousands of hours spent on ear training, developing proper technique, memorising countless chord and scale patterns on the fretboard, studying music theory, chord structure, the logic behind building chord progressions, learning how to improvise, disassembling the works of famous guitarists note by note, bar by bar to learn from them. It also takes tons of money spent on lessons with the right teachers, study materials, guitar equipment, recording hardware and software. The investment both in time and money is immense. Only those who have had the courage and perseverance to go through all this can really be called ""guitarists"". If you made an impulse purchase at Guitar Center - you're not a guitarist (yet).  Most people who are serious about guitar ""make it work"". If they can't earn by playing guitar - they teach lessons or start music related small businesses - such as music stores, recording and rehearsal studios etc. If that's not an option - they find a day job that allows them to play. Are they poor? Yes and no. The globalized world economy is quickly decimating the middle class in ALL countries, turning the USA, the United Kingdom and other former world superpowers into third world countries where society is divided into ""the very poor"" and ""the very rich"".  The global economy decimating the middle class brought death to the music industry and everything that comes with it. The super rich have other types of pleasures to indulge in, while the very poor are too preoccupied with their physical survival to have desire or money to spend on anything that's not bare necessities. Anyone else who has a job and can pay their bills is no longer middle class. Welcome to a brave new world of ""the working poor"".  BitChord aims to help the people who have already spent a lot of time and money on getting good on guitar. There are millions of them worldwide. They deserve to earn money with their skills. But the existing platforms (music content, video etc.) are targeted at EXPLOITING them, not helping them earn. BitChord is a revolutionary concept that has completely different social and business objectives.",False

On BitChord's platform great guitar players will be able to earn money by creating and submitting quality guitar related content - this may be a video performance, video lessons, an educational video course, an educational book in .pdf, a backing track, a quality transcription of popular (or some of their original) tracks in Guitar Pro. The main criteria will be ""usefulness to others"". After your original content is approved and submitted you would be able to earn money in different ways:  1. The platform will award you some of our BitChord tokens (BCD) which are already available to purchase. 2. Other users may buy your content. 3. Other users may decide to tip you as a ""thumbs up"". 4. BitChord takes NO fees from guitar players for hosting, advertising, selling and distributing their content. Guitar players always keep 100% of their product sale price. 5. Once we have developed viable advertising partnerships and strategic alliances with companies trying to market their products and services to the BitChord audience - guitar players hosting their original content on the platform will receive a share of the advertising revenue.  That's right - that's PASSIVE income (income you don't have to work for) for life. The amount different players earn will vary depending on many factors, but even if it's $20 a month - imagine no longer having to pay for your mobile service? That would be nice, wouldn't it?

We think so too. Freelance guitarists spend a lot of time and money on developing their craft. Guitar lessons with professional players, guitars, pedals/processors, amplification, strings, instrument setups and repair, audio recording hardware/software and other misc. equipment. The list can go on and on. Yet they're expected to play free gigs or as they put it in ABC's Nashville - ""playing for cold pizza and warm beer"". The biggest issue for most players is that while they're honing their craft they have to keep working at some low-paying job just to pay the bills leaving them stressed and unhappy. Which makes it even more difficult to persevere with improving their craft up to the point where they're ""undeniably good"". But that takes years. And many don't ever make it that far, pressured by a harsh financial situation, family and friends nagging them to get ""a good job"" instead etc. There are so many talented guitarists who were never given the opportunity to develop their skills and shine. It's sad really.  We believe that BitChord can change that. No other platform is aimed at helping guitarists earn. Even if it's not thousands of dollars a month - to quote a popular British supermarket chain - ""Every little bit helps"".  But yes, you're right - first they must learn about BitChord and the possibilities it offers - so feel free to share our website and this thread with friends who may benefit from learning about BitChord.",False

Thank you for your question. I'm sure that in 1876, when Alexander Graham Bell was telling people that they would be able to talk to each other without ever leaving their houses, to some people this may have sounded ridiculous. But look how that worked out.  One of the reasons why today a single Bitcoin is worth thousands of dollars is because it's a payment method, a payment system that's OUTSIDE the bounds of traditional banks and ""tried and true"" money transfer methods of the financial world. Those are under strict control that benefits the ""key holders"" of those systems.  The current systems that guitar players use do NOT benefit them. And that makes perfect sense because they were NOT designed to benefit anyone else but the platform itself. Look at YouTube earning millions by slapping targeted adds to people's original content and (in best case scenarios) paying them pennies. How about the well known ""guitar lessons"" platforms selling guitar player's hard work (their original content) to those same guitar players' followers and keeping 80-90% of the profit? How nice is that? Well it is, but not for the players. One of the many reasons this keeps on happening is because those platforms do NOT reveal the exact numbers - sales, percentages, fees etc. They don't want to. If that happens it's quite possible that everyone (buyers included) may see those systems for what they are - cash machines making money on the sweat&tears of guitarists who have toiled for many years, mastering a very difficult instrument while covering the ongoing cost out of their own pocket.  Blockchain provides for FULL TRANSPARENCY of all sales. All BitChord sales will be public information on the Ethereum blockchain. BitChord takes NO FEES and NO PERCENTAGES out of the guitar player's content price. Guitar players keep 100% themselves. Further guitarists would be able to earn money on the platform in different ways:  1. For uploading approved content the platform will automatically award you some of our BitChord tokens (BCD) which are already available to purchase. 2. Other users may buy your content. 3. Other users may decide to tip you as a ""thumbs up"". 4. BitChord takes NO fees from guitar players for hosting, advertising, selling and distributing their content.

The amount different players earn will vary depending on many factors, but even if it's $20 a month - imagine no longer having to pay for your mobile service? That would be nice, wouldn't it?  Considering that companies like CryptoKitties were able to raise $12 million dollars to bring collectable kitties to the Blockchain - we believe that a platform aimed at helping real people battle the modern day challenges of playing guitar while trying to stay alive and pay your bills - should get at least some support.",False

Currently, we have concentrated our efforts in the following areas:  1. Having our Content Advisors (musicians with experience and ties in the community) spread the word about BitChord's utility among their network of fellow musicians (who in turn will keep spreading it with theirs and so on). 2. Having our Advisors and Consultants approach large-scale investors, including music equipment retailers, producers and recording agencies who have a large following and can reach many interested guitar players. 3. Negotiating a deal with being featured in Guitar World and Guitar Player with a custom e-blast, page and target advertisements, social media shoutout and feature in their newsletter with a promised reach of their:  Facebook: 1.9 million followers YouTube: 500,000 subscribers Weekly email newsletter: 98,000 opt-in subscribers  These 3 components make up our 'target marketing' campaign for the time being (subject to changes, improvements and development). The next stage would be to run the Bounty Campaign, which in itself will contribute to generating publicity with relevant hashtags, content and posts.  Although there is a thread on every popular guitar forum, where users can share for free their backing tracks, lyrics, tabulatures and other original content, we do not plan on registering and approaching them directly as this community is a bit peculiar and you have to thread carefully We plan on letting BitChord's utility do the talking and show them that there is a way to profit from your content rather than give it away online.

The platform will always be FREE for guitar players to use. This is a platform that aims to help guitar players earn money, not spend it. However they can purchase our tokens and spend them on the platform any way they like - for example to purchase guitar lessons from other players or even to tip their favourite player. As far as it being a narrow segment - I advise you to go on youtube and type in ""guitar cover"" and see how many results you get.   There are millions of guitar players on every continent on earth and they all want  to be seen and heard. The ones playing at a higher level also want to earn money from their craft. That's precisely what BitChord has set out to help them do.  You - as a potential investor in this project don't have to ever have held a guitar in your hands. Just like people investing in oil rigs have never had to get their hands dirty drilling for oil. If you believe the project has potential - you can invest whatever sum of money you like and after platform implementation and adoption your investment may be worth significantly more. A story often comes to mind about a graphic artist who was hired to paint a mural on the office wall in a tech startup. They offered him cash or some company stock as payment. The artist who knew nothing about the IT industry took the stock and now he doesn't have to worry about painting for a living anymore. The company's name was Facebook. There are many more stories like this one.  We believe that in today's dynamically changing world the only way people can escape the rat race and actually live their life without the constraints of having to be constantly employed is taking calculated risks that may (or may not) pay out. Which startups to invest in is a personal decision everyone has to make for themselves. We - the project creators, have invested our time and money in BitChord because we firmly believe it's what the guitar world badly needs.  Hope I was able to answer your question",False

Something similar is already happening on YouTube - however the downside is - guitar players are doing it for free and there are tons of low-quality content that is not filtered in any way. The only one making any money in this situation is YouTube. Guitar players are just submitting their content for the ""exposure"". With thousands of guitar related clips being uploaded every day - the so called ""exposure"" is quite limited. Also platform users (aspiring guitarists) who want to learn how to play, have a very hard time learning in a vortex of never-ending content with often poor educational or production quality. That may certainly feel overwhelming to new players. How are they supposed to know what is good and what isn't if they're just starting out?  Our efforts at this time are targeted at bringing the idea to forward-thinking people who can notice the potential of the platform and more importantly the opportunity to create wealth for themselves as an investor in the project. Once the platform is developed and fully functioning guitar players will come to earn, to learn, to be a part of a fundamentally new type of a guitar community. You don't have to be a guitar player or even a music lover for that matter to benefit financially from investing early in the platform.",False
