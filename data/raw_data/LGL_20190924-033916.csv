Legal clarification for the crypto community  The world of traditional venture capital has experienced nothing short of a major technology disruption since 2016, with Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) raising massive amounts of funding for startups and new blockchain projects, far outstripping the levels of conventional financing.  The attention-grabbing successes of ICOs have raised alarms throughout the global finance and banking system, with regulators concerned over the legitimacy and security of these crowdsales. Apart from stepping up anti money laundering (AML) and know-your-client (KYC) procedures, however, the extent to which ICOs are legally compliant remains vague, as there exists no current national or international regulations that govern their regulations.  https://coinidol.com/smartone-ico-for-blockchain-legal-services/",False
