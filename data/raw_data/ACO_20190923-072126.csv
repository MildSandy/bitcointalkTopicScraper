DATE:21/02/2017 https://twitter.com/ample_ico/status/966405766897795072 =====================================================  <<WHAT IS A!COIN>>  Background  The animation market in Japan exceeded 1.8 trillion yen in 2015 amidst a record-breaking pace of sales over three consecutive years. The expanding market trend continues, putting annual value within reach of 2 trillion yen. Through the rapid penetration of VOD and other services future-forward, the distribution of Japanese animation content abroad is expected to increase; in turn, this growth will fuel the population growth of cosplayers around the globe. The cosplay and associated markets (enthusiastsʼ groups, cosplay apparel, maid and cosplay services) have actually grown year on year to comprise a market today of 130 billion yen.  The portrait lighting function implemented on the iPhone8 (announced on September 13, 2017) and other advances to mobile cameras as of late suggest that the creative activities of cosplayers will occur more and more within an immediate armʼ s reach.  Alongside these recent trends described above, the cosplay platform AMPLE! launched in 2012 under the mantle of bringing people all around the world together through cosplay and has grown to host 70,000 photos posted by subscribers in 70 countries. With the goal of evolving AMPLE! beyond a global cosplayer community through the introduction of AMPLE! Coin (ACO), a proprietary cryptocurrency, funding will be instituted through an initial coin offering (ICO).  AMPLE! Ecosystem Structure  - Overview of AMPLE!  The platform service AMPLE! is for cosplayers worldwide, and currently such cosplayers using the services are in Japan, North America, Europe, Asia, Oceania, etc. The specialty site for cosplay posts emerged in October 2012 to enable free expression of worlds held among cosplayers from around the world, and has operated with its purpose focused on compiling relatively high-quality cosplayer images.

Official site] http://ample-cosplay.com/   - Vision of AMPLE!  ""Turning 'Cosplayer' into a profession.""  To date, AMPLE! has operated its mission under the mantle of bringing people all around the world together through  cosplay. The effort for the next few years will be to develop professional cosplayers. Some cosplayers, in fact, have successfully turned their activities into a professional occupation; however, we believe there is considerable room for growth across the entire industry in this regard. As Youtubers have gained professional status, the entire cosplay market domain can be amplified to create a system to pay sufficient recompense that will lead to as many occupational cosplayers as possible.  - Stage Progression of Taking Vision to Fruition  [STAGE1] Provisioning a platform to create an economy around cosplayers globally [STAGE2] Cosplayers transform into content and go global                                         [STAGE3] Mainstreaming professional cosplayers                                                        STAGE1 Provisioning a platform to create an economy around cosplayers globally  The first course of action will be to provide tools that enable the 7,000 cosplayers currently registered to respectively procure funds. Fans will discover their favorite cosplayers located throughout the world and lend support with ACO, an easy wayto become a patron (supporter) of a particular cosplayer.  Cosplayers and fans connect virtually online as cosplayers express themselves freely on their own individual stage. Patrons can spend ACO to support their favorite cosplayers in real time. Plans call for active patrons to obtain exclusive offers from such cosplayers.  AMPLE! has previously instituted a loyalty program called AMPLE! Point System, whereby fans can send gifts to their favorite cosplayers. The points in circulation through this loyalty program, however, have been limited in usage for securing preferred publication space on AMPLE! The limitation has proven to be a bottleneck and a challenge that has thwarted circulation growth. What happened? In the past, monetary and legal hurdles impeded our desires to achieve a world that could uphold our ideals. This ICO process will enable funding to clear these hurdles. As we learn from past mistakes, the circulation of cryptocurrency ACO will support global, supportive transactions that will generate diverse expression. Moreover, as we strive to provide a world to enable free expression among cosplayers, those with particularly individualistic expression will be provided with a system to facilitate funding that will generate even more diverse expression. When our ideal world is created, AMPLE! will have become the platform representing cosplayers in such a way as to create an economy around cosplayers.   STAGE2 Cosplayers transform into content and go global  Registered cosplayers will provide live commerce services that enable a straight-forward global development of their own content. Fans from around the world will gain convenient access to information about their favorite cosplayers, and AMPLE! will spawn numerous small economies around such cosplayers with this service. The platform exploiting the latest technology will allow cosplayers to be their own curator and introduce various content and product as live video and VR video to their fans. Cosplayers to date have primarily performed in physical space, but with the latest technology the breadth of expression and means of delivering the art have enlarged. Consequently, cosplayers who couldnʼ t gain exposure previously have an opportunity to portray their distinctive world and gain support from many more fans. The real-time connection afforded between adoring fans and their favorite cosplayers will enable fans to purchase such content with ACO.  Provisioning a system to deliver content expediently and globally for all cosplayers wherever they reside in the world will seed small economies centered on those cosplayers around the globe. We foresee communities emerging with distinctive character tuned to each cosplayer in these economies, a world where cosplayers and fans mutually support each other. This is the world we currently are contemplating.  This process will solidify the status of AMPLE! as a platform that can generate cosplayer economies.  STAGE3 Mainstreaming professional cosplayers  AMPLE! intends to provide comprehensive support to cosplayers active on the platform. Funds procured for operations with take the form all efforts required in enhancing promotional activities and values for the entire cosplay industry. In the process of cosplayers engaging in activities on the platform described above, support functions will become necessary. Consequently, AMPLE! intends to offer the following support to cosplayers worldwide   ●Production and sales support of merchandise DVDs, photobooks, and figures of cosplayers attaining a certain rating level within AMPLE! are produced for sale on a global marketplace.  ●Live event support A system will be provided for live events to be held online through live streaming and VR technologies, so that distinctive cosplayer worlds can be shared globally  ●Phototaking event support Joint phototaking parties with popular cosplayers will be held periodically around the world.  ●Live-action anime After entering into collaborative relationships with rights holders, popular animation content will be produced as live action movies on a popular layer and streamed on VOD services.  ●Stage performances We will enter into collaborative relationships with rights holders and produce popular animation titles for the stage. Effective utilization of AR and sensor technologies will produce a stage integrated with the audience̶more than merely a platform.  ●Assembling of idol groups Selected members will form idol groups as part of establishing the “cosplay idol” genre and engage in activities beyond the confines of particular countries   - Usage of Cryptocurrency  The cryptocurrency AMPLE! coin (ACO) to be issued at this time will undergo circulation along the entire stream provided in the Stage Progression of Taking Vision to Fruition set forth above. ACO will be tendered across all layers worldwide for direct support, product sales, and admissions to exclusive events, and applied to diverse payment means in this space.  As shown in the figure, ACO is used chiefly among cosplayers and their supporting fans. We wish to enable ubiquitous usage of ACO in the space as currency. For this to happen, technical integration with other companiesʼ services without limitation to the AMPLE! platform will take place, while an enormous application array will be provided to cosplayers and fans on the AMPLE! platform. As cosplayers circulate ACO across the platform that enables unfettered expressions of their own worlds, they will enhance the quality of their creative activity, while strong ties between fans and their favorite cosplayers become possible. By connecting cosplayers and fans spread out globally through cryptocurrency unconstrained by national borders, the issuance of this cryptocurrency should contribute to enhancing the entire market, in our assessment.
