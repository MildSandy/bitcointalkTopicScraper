It takes a radical function to calculate a vote as the weight of each token declines as more tokens are committed by an individual. This way, pooled together, small token holders can have a greater impact than large individual holders. Additionally, to prevent large token holders from using multiple accounts to increase their overall weight, we add a reputation and identity score using different solutions such as Keybase, Civic, Uport and full KYC to increase the weight of one’s vote.  This model gives a greater voice to smaller token holders and brings balance to the ecosystem while 1 vote per token greatly advantages the rich.

Access is a governance network that allows users to vote on tools and solutions they need developed so that teams of developers can build them for the ecosystem. It aims to help the unbanked obtain the basic financial tools they need to bypass the current infrastructure. Though, a lot of them only have dumb phones so they can delegate their votes (a function based on reputation and amount of tokens held) to agents from their community who can then vote on their behalf. Agents never obtain the tokens, they can juste wield their voting power but users can retract those rights at any time if agents don't vote like they would have wanted to.",False

Quote from: Uthred on March 14, 2018, 08:12:55 AM What's the total supply of ACX?  Approximately 2bn ACX and the supply will slowly increase with the increase of fiat deposits with our network of agents and the development of new dapps & tools as we will gradually unlock the underserved exchange reserve and the incentive pool.  Quote from: SRBYN on March 14, 2018, 08:31:03 AM Quote from: oxhodler on March 13, 2018, 05:25:40 PM Quote from: btcltcdigger on March 13, 2018, 01:41:51 PM Is there any specific country in Africa where this will be tried?  Access' top priority is scaling Ghana and Senegal while next logical targets are Nigeria and East Africa. We are also exploring partnerships with startups in other countries such as Rwanda and Uganda to accelerate its growth in Africa. Additionally, South Africa has the fastest growth rate in terms of smartphone adoption and could become a logical target for expansion in the future.  Do you plan to spread in other regions too?  Of course, Access is a decentralized network tailored for the unbanked, a problem affecting 2bn people so the goal would be to spread worldwide. Africa is the easiest step 1 for Access since it already has operations but the project will welcome Agents initiatives all over the world to spread the mission of Access.  Quote from: PuryLock on March 14, 2018, 08:50:56 AM When you plan to get listed on exchanges?  We can't assure that we will be listed on any exchanges but some discussions are on the way and we are planning to release the tokens by the end of April.

Agents act as Fiat to Crypto exchanges. They are community members that manage fiat deposits into Access' wallets and credit users with ACX tokens. It's the greatest competitive advantage for Access compared to other projects aimed at the unbanked because they have an actual go-to market strategy, real liquidity providers on the ground.

Access is a protocol to vote and reward the development of financial tools for the underbanked, and a digital token for them to save and transact. Access was built by the team behind Atlas, the successful branchless community banking platform for the underbanked.  Currently, any person with a smartphone in West Africa can download the Atlas app and make money as a banker to their community. The moment ACX Network goes live, hundreds of Atlas Agents and thousands of Atlas Clients will instantly switch from digital fiat into ACX tokens, effectively turning all agents into ACX exchanges.  Quote from: nnekic86 on March 10, 2018, 07:01:33 PM How many tokens in game? I didn't find price of this tokens? How we can buy and invest?  Hi! There will be about 2bn ACX in circulation after TGE by end of April but there's is built in inflation through the incentive pool and the underserved exchange reserve to boost adoption and help the network grow. We will get to 6bn ACX in 10 years. Right now the tokens given away in the airdrop are priced at $0.025. Access is in private sale right now (message us on Telegram if you are interested in participating) and we will update the community on a potential public sale or the exact TGE date.

Testnet should be up by the end of March, join the Telegram channel https://t.me/acx_network to stay updated!

This project is no joke! I wonder if they will get anybody else on there...  can you explain why they strong? I didn't hear for them, but maybe if you can say project, maybe it is?  We are proud to have a mix of crypto experts and government officials that will help Access gain adoption throughout Africa. For example, Joe Urgo (founder of District0x) and Ryan Lackey (security expert for Tezos, ENjin, Blockstack) bring a tremendous background in the crypto industry while members of the parliament in Botswana and New Zealand give Access an edge when it comes to regulations.",False
