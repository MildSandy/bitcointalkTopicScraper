Bubblo is an AI-powered discovery platform that gives users a real-time ""Top 5"" of recommendations on restaurants, bars, or other venues based on a constant flow of user-generated data. Users are incentivized to provide this real-time data flow because they earn Bubblo tokens, which can be redeemed for discounts or other rewards at venues and merchants. For merchants and third parties, these tokens simultaneously represent the right to retarget their clients or to collect valuable market insight by exchanging the tokens with Bubblo. All parties thus have the ability to either monetize or protect their data via the token.    Crowdsale Information  Phase 1: Community Building Phase 50 million tokens (5%) We want to reward our users who are helping to turn Bubblo into a success. Therefor we allocated a % of tokens to our users. The more they help with populating our app the higher the rewards will be.
