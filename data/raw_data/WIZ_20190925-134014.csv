The registration process is simple and the user will need to only enter a valid email and password. There is a validation for the page in the following cases:  - user entered an email which is not valid - user entered passwords that do not match - user is trying to register an already existing user - user did not enter all required fields        Funds page Overview screen which displays the two available WizFunds which the user can Enter.  *for the Beta we will allow the users to enter both funds so that they can get a better understanding of every fund’s structure and how it operates.  The difference between the funds is related to the voting power which investors will have. In the first fund “The Fellowship of the equals” investors must have equal voting rights, while in the other “Game of tokens” investors with more tokens/shares will have more voting power  On the overview screen investors will see a short summary for each of the funds which include:  - Name - Description - Number of investors - Start date - Value of the fund in BTC - Token price in BTC - Change in token price for the past 24hours - Enter button which will send the user to the Fund room    Portfolio Screen  Portfolio screen is the part of the fund where the user can see the fund performance and statistic.  Fund Summary  Fund Summary section is the part of the portfolio screen where the user can see the performance of the fund and its holdings. Fund Summary section includes:  Value — Displays the total value of the fund Formula — Value of the fund = Holdings Value + Available to Invest Amount Holdings Value — Displays the sum of all assets’ prices if they are sold on the current market price Formula — Holdings Value = (Amount of Asset 1 x Current Market Price) + (Amount of Asset 2 x Current Market Price) + etc. Available to Invest — Displays free balance that is not invested in any holdings Formula — Available to Invest = Value of the fund — Holdings Value Return in % — Displays the return of the fund for the past 24h Formula — Return = (Current Value of the fund — Value of the Fund at the start of the day)/Initial Value of the Fund*100 Token Price — Displays the current token price Formula — Value of the Fund = Value of the Fund (at the current moment)/Total Number of tokens Number of investors — Displays the total number of investors in the fund Tokens in fund — Displays the total number of tokens in the fund    Fund Summary — (Pie chart) There is an icon with pie chart which will switch the entire Fund summary section to Pie chart displaying the assets bought. In the middle it is displayed the Return in percentage for 24h. The pie chart displays up to 10 assets. Example: If we have 10 assets we will display all assets with their respective names, If we have 11 assets we will display the 10th asset as Other and on hover we will show a small pop up with the assets that are included in the section.    Performance chart Line chart showing change of the tokens price. The user can use the zoom in and zoom out buttons for more in depth analysis of the performance  Fund holdings carousel  In this section are displayed all the fund holdings with their respective statistics. The number next to the name of the section shows the number of holdings  Asset — Name of the asset and symbol Amount — amount of asset coins/tokens in the portfolio Last update — time stamp of the last action with this asset Format: dd/mm/yyyy Purchase price — In case the fund has acquired several times the same Crypto Currency we will take all prices and make an average price on which the asset was purchased. Formula — Weighted Average Price = (first price x shares) + (second price x shares) …/total number of shares Market price — the current market price Profit — unrealized profit, the profit which will be realized if the asset is sold on the current market price Formula — Profit = (Market Price — Purchase price (if we have made several purchases of the same asset we will take the weighted average price)) Return — Displayed in % Formula — Return = (Market Price — Average purchase price)/Average Purchase price *100    Latest activity Table showing the last 3 proposals and their result.  o Asset — Symbol and abreviation  o Amount — Amount which was proposed to be bought  o Direction — Buy/Sell  o Vote — User’s Vote  o Outcome — approved or rejected  o Author — the creator of the proposal  “See All” link that will redirect the user to Proposition History for more detailed information on the ballots and their outcomes    Ballot Main purpose of this screen is to create investment propositions and decide if the ongoing investment proposals will be approved or rejected. There are two sub-menus — Ongoing and Upcoming.  Ongoing Here we will display all ongoing ballots.  Fund Holdings Section For user convenience we will display what are the fund holdings so that the user can easily refer to them without leaving the page. We will display Top 4 (scroll if there are more) and pie chart.  Proposal In this section the user will see details for ongoing proposal and be able to vote. The options in front of the user are:  Approve — positive vote Reject — negative vote Abstain — when the user wants to skip voting There can be only one active investment proposition for which users can vote. After the user has placed his vote he will have the ability to change it and be given the option to vote again.

Propositions are queued according to their time of entrance. We will show a timer to display the remaining time till the Upcoming proposal becomes active. The format will be DD/HH/MM/SS  List of upcoming investment propositions will include: Timer, Author, Asset, Amount, Direction, Description. On click on “Learn More” the user can see the full description in a pop up     History page  Section with the fund activity history.  Propositions history  This section shows the ballots that have passed. They are ordered with the latest expired ballot on top.

After the ballot expires depending on the voting results if the ballot is approved a trade is executed and a fund holding is obtained.  The table will show to the user the following information  Start Date — Date on which the asset was bought Asset Action Amount Buy Price — the price on which the asset was bought Sell Price — the price on which the asset was sold (will be available only if we have a Sell trade) Profit — Realized Profit — Will be calculated only when we have a SELL trade Formula — Profit = (Market Price — Purchase price (if we have made several purchases of the same asset we will take the weighted average price*) *the weighted average price is made from taking the orders starting from the one with the lowest price until the sell order amount is filled    Create Proposal form  Users are able to create investment propositions at any time by completing a form where they setup the proposal details.  To create a voting proposal an investor must define several parameters in the following order:  Action — buy or sell. Asset — what asset will be purchased or sold. If the user press on Buy he/she will see the offered assets that can be bought and if the user press on Sell — the available assets in the fund. Amount — how many units of the asset will be purchased, or how many units of the asset in the portfolio will be sold with a calculation showing what is the amount in the base currency. There is a validation on Buy if we have enough balance to make the purchase and for Sell if we have enough units to sell. Duration — proposal duration, during which all investors can vote for the active proposal. Description — In order to support its proposal, the investor must describe why his proposition will benefit the fund.    Account/Profile  The user has a profile icon in the header. There he has his first and last name displayed along with his balance. Balance showing what is his current balance based on the fund performance.
