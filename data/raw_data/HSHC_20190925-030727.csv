Along with grilling out and watching fireworks, you’ll also need to make sure your financial marketing and communications materials meet the new Mastercard® Brand Mark Guidelines.  Mastercard has been featuring its new look (see logo above) and name format (Mastercard with a lowercase “c”) for some time. However, the company is starting to require use of their new brand requirements as of July 4, 2017.  At image.works, we have a team of copywriters, proofers and designers to help your financial institution meet the marketing and communications guidelines on projects we create for you. Please note the following information from Mastercard on the new requirements:  - All new marketing and communications materials published on or after July 4, 2017, must include the new Brand Mark.  - Your financial institution should update marketing and communications materials at the earliest opportunity in the normal course of business.  - Issuers may update their digital card imagery (for use in digital wallets) at any time. However, these images must be updated no later than the update of the companion card plastic.  - All new acceptance decals printed on or after July 4, 2017, must include the new Brand Marks.  - ATM Acquirers should update their Acceptance Marks at the earliest opportunity in the normal course of business.  - All Mastercard and Debit Mastercard card proofs submitted for review on or after July 4, 2017, must include the new Brand Mark.  - All Mastercard and Debit Mastercard cards printed on or after July 4, 2017, must include the new Brand Mark.  - Issuers do not need to reissue cards already issued.  - Card manufacturers may continue using card plastics already in inventory until the stock is depleted. Note: An updated Card Design Standards Manual is also available on Mastercard Connect > Library > Publications > Card Design.  How should you use the Mastercard name in text?  Below is an excerpt from the Mastercard Brand Mark Guidelines:  Lettercase  When referencing the Mastercard name in text, use an uppercase “M” and lowercase “c” with no space between “Master” and “card.” The name should not appear with a capital “C.” The Mastercard name should appear in the same font as its surrounding text.  Registered trademark symbol (®)  In the first or most prominent text use of Mastercard on a page or screen (after use, if any, in a headline), the ® symbol is required. In subsequent use on that page or screen, the ® symbol may be omitted.  Read-through  The Mark may be used as a read-through in a headline, but may not be used as a read-through in the body of a communication. When used in text, it should be set in the same typeface as the surrounding text.  Trademark attribution notice  When the Mastercard name and/or Mark is used, the following trademark attribution notice (in a very small type size) should be included once in the communication: “Mastercard is a registered trademark, and the circles design is a trademark of Mastercard International Incorporated.”  Note: On digital communications and small-size marketing communications, the above trademark attribution notice is not required.  https://twitter.com/hashcard/status/992096966459850752   https://medium.com/@sm_46693/hashcard-cfo-pawel-goch-just-as-with-mastercard-issued-plastic-card-fc869d2ca856   https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/XEMbEv2VI5mxN6fIEtoJifhJRAFNTqgh5LS_iV7XaMh2ddNSR9uk7lD6HpfWwo-SZg=w720-h310   Quote from: finaleshot2016 on May 05, 2018, 11:49:29 AM i wanted to see a. actual card or an example card for us to see the full specification.. but the admin send me this    are they serious? it's a digital art.  and another thing is why do they keep covering the smart chip of that card?

Not that I want to spread FUD, but you are a small team coming out of nowhere, nobody has ever heard about you and in a couple of months, you have a product, a network, an ICO, a partner bank and cards ready to ship. In a couple of months, out of the blue, you pretend to beat Xapo, Wirex, TenX and a dozen of others who have been on the market for much longer and already have significant user base.  Again, I would love to trust you guys, but admit you are not making it easy. If you do have a deal (and cards), then it's the MAIN incentive for people to invest in your ICO. You have zero reason to conceal this information, especially not 2 weeks before presumably shipping the cards.  Crypto-cards are the Graal of the industry since January. Give us info about the cards, or ask your partner bank to publish a statement, and your ICO will go boom – and you will be the kings of the industry for the next months.

Quote There reason we are hiding the bank name is not because we are hiding anything from tha bank. The bank in fact knows everything. The reason is - we only have a preliminary agreement for 3K cards confirmed as of now. If we see the demand, we will commit to exclusive agreement that will protect us from competitors. Any of them would be ready to pay a million dollars to get a name or contact.  Some say that hiding the truth = lying  What baffles me is that no one is seeing that this lack of transparency is very strange and suspicious. I spoke to some admins myself as well as Mr. Goch. And my understanding, in summary, is that the main reason they are not disclosing the card issuer is that their deal is that they will obtain exclusivity once the 3K card milestone is achieved. They are worried that if they announce the bank, a competitor might try to close a deal with the same bank, making Hash Card lose the exclusivity.  The thing is that there are millions of crypto users around the world that would jump on this card, if only they had some confidence that this is not another scam or failed attempt like the many ones before.  If Hash Card announced the bank for investors to confirm, they would reach the 3K card milestone in a matter of hours! This would accelerate everything and Hash Card would be able to obtain the exclusivity much sooner before a competitor even gets the chance to meet with that ""Asian bank"".  Bottom line is that until Hash Card announces the card issuer, this will continue to look like another failed attempt (example TenX), or they only want newb unexperienced investors or worse, like a scam. Smart investors will not risk their money on this project, until Hash Card stops concealing basic information, especially with all the scams going around.",True
