Existing and newly launched programs may create ‘sovereign’ representations in DAO IPCI in the form of autonomies (DAOs), and link or sustain full independence.  DAO IPCI Mitigation Token (MITO) is sought to provide for exchange of numerous and diverse asset-based tokens representing societal costs mitigation outcomes. Namely and in the first instance, GHG emissions limited rights and reductions (carbon emission quotas and credits) are the assets that become fungible via MITO and MITO market. Distinctive characteristics of the two types of DAO IPCI tokens are that only one of them, MITO, is based on the protocol to integrate the ecosystem while the rest of tokens represent diverse regulated mitigation compliance units as underlying.  MITO is not a share of equity or any sort of a security. Mitigation Token (or MITO) is protocol-based token, exchange vehicle for assured environmental units, the key element to provide for transactions’ efficiency and integrity of DAO IPCI ecosystem. MITO is designed to serve a digital mitigation costs representation, carbon pricing instrument, and a digital CO2 cost equivalent.  Post-ICO MITO emission volume would directly correlate with the volume of assured environmental units accessible via DAO IPCI, serving as a hedging instrument and growing along with environmental market instrument.
