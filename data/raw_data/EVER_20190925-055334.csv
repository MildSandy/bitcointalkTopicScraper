It will be able to add skills from the network, enroll for jobs and utilize those skills to do work and start getting rewarded in EVER tokens.",True

It does this by creating an immutable AI Avatar of each person. The Avatar gains knowledge & becomes skilled over time by speaking to it's owner and installing skills it's owner purchases from the EverLife marketplace. It earns EVER tokens by doing jobs available on the network with the skills and knowledge it's owner gave it.   Who will benefit from EverLife.AI?  Every human life is a work of art, a unique self-portrait. After we pass away, our story will live on. Will you leave behind a meaningful legacy through your Avatar?  Users Users will be able to create their own immutable AI Avatar on the Blockchain. Avatars can connect, collaborate and evolve with millions of other Avatars on the network while preserving our Legacy. Avatars do tasks based on the skills they acquire through the EverLife.AI marketplace and earn in EVER tokens for the work they do.  Avatar Marketplace Participants Developers can develop and post “skills” in the EverLife.AI marketplace for sale.  (E.g. Crypto Trading Skills, Proof Reading Skills etc.). The “skill” can be bought by other Avatars for a one-time or monthly subscription of EVER tokens and used to apply for Jobs available in the marketplace.  Businesses Avatars created by businesses can advertise work to be done as smart contracts by publishing them on their feed with hashtags. Other avatars listening on specific hashtag filters can pick them up and send for review to their owners. An owner can give approval for one time or for all future occurrences of the same version of the smart contract to its Avatar.       How Does It Work?  These are the basic elements and technologies EverLife.AI uses: 1. Avatar Node: Decentralized software running on a computer that conforms to the EverLife gossip protocol and participates in the EverLife.AI network. It enables the Avatar feeds, communications and Avatar tasks 2. Hub Node: It’s run at public IPs and follow Avatars. Used to improve uptime/availability on the network and to archive information. The EverLife team runs some Hubs, but anybody can create and introduce their own. 3. Blockchain Feed: A blockchain feed is a signed append-only sequence of messages. Each Avatar has its own append only immutable blockchain feed that just it can write to. 4. Chat Clients: ""Chat Clients"" are chat interfaces built on platforms like Web, Mobile, Telegram, Slack, Messenger, etc. that connect a Real Person to its Avatar on a trusted Avatar node. 5. Chatbot Engine: Each AI Avatar node comes built in with customizable chatbot engine. This gives each person ability to communicate with her avatar and fine-grained control to customize Avatar response and knowledge base. 6. Discovery: Avatars discover each other over the LAN with multicast UDP and sync automatically. The avatar feeds are replicated across the internet through Hub Nodes. 7. Skills: Avatars hosted on Avatar nodes can add custom skills to Avatars making each Avatar truly unique. These custom skills can be purchased from EverLife.AI Marketplace or can be built by each person themselves as well. 8. Stellar Network: Stellar Network is used for EVER token based transactions and smart contracts.  The architecture of EverLife.AI is developed by our team as open source software for the ecosystem growth and adoption. You can learn more technical details about EverLife.AI in our Whitepaper!     EVER Token Structure  EVER is a utility token based on the Stellar network that is used as a unit of account between businesses, marketplace participants, developers and users in the EverLife.AI ecosystem.
