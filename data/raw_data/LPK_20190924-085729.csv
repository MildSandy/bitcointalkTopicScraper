Token Launch Summary Token name: KRIPTON Token ticker: LPK   Overview  Explainer Video   L-Pesa creates blockchain-based, smart contract loans enabling people across the internet to grow their businesses and become thriving entrepreneurs.Hopeful visionaries can take loans in Ether or Bitcoin and then participate in L-Pesaâ€™s curated marketplace facilitating peer-to-peer lending: the first crypto loan service in Africa.  By investing in the L-Pesa Coin ICO, you will be supporting the L-Pesa microfinance platformâ€”a platform intended to provide new financial tools to consumers and small businesses in Africa and Asia. In many cases, these consumers and small businesses have not previously had access to affordable financing options. By providing this access, L-Pesa is empowering consumers and small businesses to improve livesâ€”particularly for those paralyzed by poverty.  Ultimately, L-Pesa Microfinance is about allowing people to create opportunities for themselves and their families. Borrowers on the L-Pesa platform use funds to start or grow a business, pay for education, or support their ambitions in life via another avenue.    Purchasing Kripton  You can buy L-Pesa Coins through your L-Pesa account. You can also purchase L-Pesa Coins from our ICO registrar; the wallet address will be provided 15 minutes before the pre-sale starts on January 10, 2018.  There are only a few restrictions on participation. Most U.S. citizens can participate since the L-Pesa Coin is not structured as a security subject to SEC regulation. Almost anyone can invest in L-Pesa Coins. The minimum purchase is 5000 coins (price per USD .02). The maximum purchase is the remaining number of available coins, which will depend on when coins are purchased. To be absolutely sure you get the amount of coins you need, it's recommended you join the pre-sale early!    What is L-PESA Group?  The L-Pesa Group is a global group of companies revolutionizing financial technology and services in Africa and Asia. L-Pesa has built a sophisticated platform for issuing and servicing consumer and small business loans.  The platform has operated for 18 months in East Africa and over 25,000 loans have been issued. Due to sophisticated underwriting, the loss ratio is below 10%. This low loss ratio combined with the high degree of automation allows L-Pesa to offer low cost financing to a large number of users.  L-Pesa was founded with the vision to improve peopleâ€™s lives through efficient access to credit and related financial services. Itâ€™s about making the world a better place for everyone. L-Pesa started offering microfinance services in Tanzania in 2016 and has grown its service offering and geographic footprint at an increasing pace in pursuit of this vision.
