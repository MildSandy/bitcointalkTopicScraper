I recently was speaking with the founder (Chris) and they are trying to find any possibilities to continue with the project but I have no hopes on that. They still can not update us because they are working under NDA and when everything will be clear, it will be published on social media channels and website. Remember that for now bounty hunters didn't get any token for their job and I also didn't get any token for my 3 months of work with them. Otherwise, check their linkedin profile if you still have some doubts about the team.

In fact the BX ecosystem differs a lot from all other blockchain competitors! Let me point out the most relevant differences.  First of all BX is a fully decentralized peer-to-peer betting exchange, meaning its players do not bet against a centralized bookmaker at the end (advantages: no limitations for players, total transparency by removing the bookmaker, improved odds, lower fees, reduced operating costs). Basically the whole content of the ecosystem will be created, handled and voted by the community. The system automatically creates smart contracts for every step in the betting process, which makes it very secure at the same time. We have a great innovative superuser / market owner concept, that allows users to take over the role as a bookmaker and to earn extra BX tokens! In general, there is a lot of community engagement, which will contribute to a great social betting experience.  Furthermore BX will not focus on sports betting only. Financial and prediction markets will be the other 2 big pillars in the ecosystem. In prediction markets you can basically bet on anything! It's a very interesting and upcoming market. Also there are public and private betting markets. Private betting markets are only accessible via invitation and are great for closed groups as friends, colleagues, small betting communities, etc.!  There are many features that will make BX very unique and also extremely attractive for the giant betting market. Please take a look at the competitor analysis below. You can also find this in our well worked-out Whitepaper.     Let me know if there are further questions. Also please be invited to our Telegram group to get some good discussions around BX.",False

In a decentralized ecosystem, where users can create own betting markets, it's obviously very important to have a strong anit-spam and -fraud protection system. On BX.BET we developed a process, that keeps spam and joke markets to a minimum. Every market creator is required to provide a small deposit when creating a public betting market. In a second step public betting markets need to be approved by the community, before going live. We therefore have a separate category ""new markets"", in where the community can vote for an approval. If the new market achieves a certain amount of positive votes, the approval process is finished and the market is available to the public. In this case the BX smart contract will automatically refund the deposit back to the market creator. Furthermore he will also receive a share of all betting activities, which is the main incentive for users to create new markets.  Please see the abstract below.

I saw so many like this for this week. You should have your unique feature to be the best.  Hey Krezz2017, Hi Vuglusk  thanks for your words. Yes, you are right betting and sports is a really promising field.  Let me explain to you what makes BX.BET special and why we are sure that our project will succeed:  The highlights of BX:  a) Betting Exchange Functionality We are implementing the full functionality of a betting exchange with all its advantages, meaning full transparency on the order book, the opportunity for every user to place buy and sell orders, with your own odds.  b) Liquidity Concept With our Market Owner concept, we are introducing a solution for the liquidity problems in P2P betting markets. The risk with peer-to-peer betting markets is that due to low interest and low betting volume in certain events, no betting offers are available and no one is willing to continually provide liquidity. In the BX Ecosystem, everyone can become a Market Owner and thus act as a traditional bookmaker and create their own markets and directly participate in the success of the market. This concept will keep even small markets alive by incentivizing the Market Owner to provide liquidity at all times.  c) Social Betting We are creating the possibility to create private markets without any fees so that a whole new betting experience arises. It allows users to host and organize bet markets among friends, colleagues and other closed groups. In addition to its high customer benefit, this feature opens up a substantial cross-selling potential. The combination of an exchange and the private betting function will attract a multitude of users to the BX platform, and convert them into active bettors.  d) Multiple Market focus We are not focussing solely on sports but also on Prediction and Finance Markets. In addition, to complement the gambling experience, we will also introduce lotto and casino games, so that the ecosystem provides the full gambling experience.  If you read our whitepaper, you will find out that there are a lot more points, which set us apart from our potential competitors.  Additionally:  We are a team with tremendous experience in the betting industry. We worked for the most significant player in the industry, created several other betting brands and successfully established them on the market. Now ready to bring betting on the next stage. We know exactly how the gambling industry works and what it needs, not to just create a successful and easy-to-use user experience, but also to establish BX on the market as a fully-fledged alternative to the existing, traditional, non-blockchain based solutions by giving our users the possibility to experience a whole new level of betting with unique features and the vision to give the whole betting experience back in the hand of the players by providing a fair, transparent and extensive betting experience.
