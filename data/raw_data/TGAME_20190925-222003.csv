Because everyone knows 2 big obvious disadvantages of smart contracts: time and  ether gas consumption ?  2) Why truegame.io plans as high house edge as 14% !!! (see whitepaper) while the most of modern provable fair casinos has no more than 1% (see mentioned bustabit.com and dozens of others) ?  Why the players should choose truegame.io despite these 2 grand disadvantages ?

Nevertheless, in our team there are real sharks of this industry who have repeatedly launched large and successful projects in this field. They know everything about how to attract and retain players. Also, there is another feature in the industry - if the player trusts the casino, then he sticks to this platform and spends all his time there, as in order to switch to another platform, he first needs to overcome the barrier of mistrust. We offer a full openness and transparency to the players, so the trust towards our platform is higher than to most traditional casinos. Only a few companies have tried to make smart contract based games of chances, and no one has succeeded on such a scale as we have: only we realized instant wins, scratch cards, prize draws and integrated it into a universal blockchain platform. We thoroughly studied the sphere of iGaming, therefore before the start of the ICO, last year we tested it on long-time players and received a great feedback, and on its basis we develop our product further. So, in the context of the given question, we would also like to note the following undeniable advantages of Truegame: 1) Successful use of smart contract technology (apart from blockchain) 2) Totally unique content 3) White label solutions for other market participants 4) And many more (all the advantages you can find on our website).",False

Today, the realities of the market are such that larger exchanges require the presence of a certain trading volume on smaller exchanges. Hence, our strategy for listing the token is to approach crypto exchanges from the small and medium to large scale ones. We plan to list our token on several small and medium-scale exchanges, and after that we will try to get to large exchanges.  We are working to make TGAME available on big-scale exchanges as soon as possible but for this we need to consistently and successfully pass the listings on the small and medium-sized exchanges.",False

Quote from: strelok25 on April 12, 2018, 11:39:08 PM Good that you already have a working platform for games, tell me how long has your project worked on the games market? Than the you platform games is better from other decentralized platform games? How do you plan to attract many users to your gaming platform?  iGaming is a very competitive industry with lot of players in the market. Nevertheless, in our team there are real sharks of this industry who have repeatedly launched large and successful projects in this field. They know everything about how to attract and retain players. Also, there is another feature in the industry - if the player trusts the casino, then he sticks to this platform and spends all his time there, as in order to switch to another platform, he first needs to overcome the barrier of mistrust. We offer a full openness and transparency to the players, so the trust towards our platform is higher than to most traditional casinos. Only a few companies have tried to make smart contract based games of chances, and no one has succeeded on such a scale as we have: only we realized instant wins, scratch cards, prize draws and integrated it into a universal blockchain platform. We thoroughly studied the sphere of iGaming, therefore before the start of the ICO, last year we tested it on long-time players and received a great feedback, and on its basis we develop our product further. So, in the context of the given question, we would also like to note the following undeniable advantages of Truegame: 1) Successful use of smart contract technology (apart from blockchain) 2) Totally unique content 3) White label solutions for other market participants 4) And many more (all the advantages you can find on our website).

Ethereum meets our requirements and allows us to provide both a successful user experience for the player and an income for the platform. At the same time, the Ethereum network is not sufficiently optimal, so our specialists are constantly studying new technologies that would improve the game process and reduce transaction costs. Our platform allows to quickly transfer the entire architecture to new blockchain, whereas the user interface stays almost unchanging.

Quote from: PeToR on April 10, 2018, 02:17:40 AM By the way, what made u use blockchain? Wouldn't you be able to cover the same audience without it?  Blockchain technology implementation can change the industry dramatically, mainly through delivering a new level of transparency to the online gaming. The idea of combining blockchain and gambling lies at the heart of our platform. Truegame solves the issues of trust through its innovative use of blockchain technology and smart contracts.  Quote from: maAE$tRo$2000 on April 10, 2018, 02:34:05 AM You've already launched your platform, that's quite impressive! So are there any players on it now?

I wanna ask you some important questions. What about security? What have you already done to improve it?   We are very attentive to the security of our platform. Our infrastructure in its core is focused on the security of all interacting parties. Smart contracts and billing management in the environment of blockchain provide security to both the player and our platform. Nevertheless, we find it extremely important to have external security audit done by independent specialists and we contribute to this in every way. More information about the measures that we plan to take you can learn in our WP (page 24)",False

What do you think of it?  Truegame operates strictly in accordance with legal requirements. If a country restricts gambling, we will not violate the laws of that country. In countries where games using cryptocurrencies are not considered gambling, we will accept only cryptocurrencies. And we’ll accept fiat only in those countries that allow it. We will not violate any law of any country that forbids gambling. For us, that’s a rule.

Truegame does not disclose coin listing information until an official announcement has been made due to the policies of the exchanges. For example, Binance, according to its official policy, does not disclose coin listing information until an official announcement has been made. Additionally, if a project has announced listing on Binance prior to an official Binance announcement, they are at risk of disqualification.

Quote from: HuP9RX on April 04, 2018, 02:56:07 PM I don't quite understand,35% of funds are for jackpot, so what if someone hits jackpot just after ICO?  The amount of winning is determined by probability. For example, it's necessary to guess 6 digits out of 49 to get a jackpot in a lottery. Therefore, the opportunity to get all the amount of jackpot by 1 player is extremely low. In most of the scenarios, small parts of the jackpot are distributed among winners.  Quote from: Logan22 on April 04, 2018, 02:59:42 PM project is strong, but it shouldn't be only for crypto community, blockchain-based platform is good, but the biggest part of gambling community will prefer fiat  We have already developed a solution that automatically converts other currencies and Fiat into our tokens, which are then used in games.

The great strength and attraction of our project is that by using a blockchain and smart contracts logic we make games, lotteries, and prize draws completely transparent for the players. The results of each game are verifiable in the blockchain open registry. The winnings are distributed by the blockchain automatically, without the casino manager being involved.

That's unpredictable, but interesting.   We started with a focus group of several hundred players last year. Users play on the platform every day.

I asked before what does your github code mean? How to understand whether your word about guaranteed jackpot are true?!  Blockchain technologies and smart contracts play a vital role in determining the independence of number generation and ensure the rules are enforced. For all the draws, our internal utility token is used, through which all the interaction with the player’s personal balance is conducted. Each game is based on a separate smart contract, and the code for each of them is available on Github. The winning is accumulated and stored on a separate Ethereum account managed by smart contracts. In the case of a winning, its equivalent is automatically transferred to the player’s balance and becomes available for the withdrawal.

Nevertheless, in our team there are real sharks of this industry who have repeatedly launched large and successful projects in this field. They know everything about how to attract and retain players. Also, there is another feature in the industry - if the player trusts the casino, then he sticks to this platform and spends all his time there, as in order to switch to another platform, he first needs to overcome the barrier of mistrust.

Tell me please. Do US citizens could play your games after the crowdsale? When your platfrom fully works. It is a big deal.

Quote from: Tiamel on March 28, 2018, 11:22:52 AM Well gambling was always popular but still how can you state it will stay popular and especially why this platform will be popular?  The presence of experienced specialists in the team will allow us to implement an effective multi-channel marketing campaign to attract players with a low lead cost. When implementing the strategy, we will rely on the experience of team members and their competence in performance and email marketing, as well as leads generation for gambling projects. More about our marketing strategy you can find in the WP (page 28)  Quote from: Suarezzz on March 28, 2018, 01:12:42 PM Yeah, this project is already well known among the community but how are going to attract even more people?  We are constantly working on expanding our presence in different kinds of media and via partnerships. For example, in the coming days we will participate in two industrial conferences. Also, we posted articles in such a big scale media as Bitcoin.com, The Merkle, CCN and other resources, Cointelegraph is on the way. Plus, we've added a lot of local resources (Asia, Latam) to be present in the countries locally. We are also negotiating with several youtubers. And many, many more. Not to mention that we are present in the most well-known ICO trackers.  Quote from: CeNaToP on March 29, 2018, 05:19:50 PM I worry about security issues, are you planning to test your patform's vunerability  We are very attentive to the security of our platform. Our infrastructure in its core is focused on the security of all interacting parties. Smart contracts and billing management in the environment of blockchain provide security to both the player and our platform. Nevertheless, we find it extremely important to have external security audit done by independent specialists and we contribute to this in every way. More information about the measures that we plan to take you can learn in our WP (page 24)",False

Only a few companies have tried to make smart contract based games of chances, and no one has succeeded on such a scale as we have: only we realized instant wins, scratchcards, prize draws and integrated it into a universal blockchain platform. We thoroughly studied the sphere of iGaming, therefore before the start of the ICO, last year we tested it on long-time players and received a great feedback, and on its basis we develop our product further. So we would also like to note the following undeniable advantages of Truegame: 1) Successful use of smart contract technology (apart from blockchain) 2) Totally unique content 3) White label solutions for other market participants 4) And many more (all the advantages you can find on our website).  Quote from: thiendaicat on March 26, 2018, 06:11:46 AM I'm a gamer, This is a very interesting project. Do you complete your web platform or any MVP product so I and other could take a deep look about it?  Truegame is a truly unique, because of fully working iGaming product: users are already playing more than a dozen different games (scratch cards, prize draws, lotteries, giftboxes, etc.).

Quote from: KaDeGrOB(1) on March 18, 2018, 02:21:05 PM Hello! Do you mind negotiate any contracts with other companies that refer to crypto sphere? Some lending platforms, advertisers or even developers (I think you are the developers though). This could be reasonable to expand your project  We are planning several interesting partnerships with companies from the cryptosphere. Watch out for updates  Quote from: EnterTheLight on March 17, 2018, 12:39:02 AM Oh you accept LTC, what about Dash? Or even PayPal? You have so many versions of your website in terms of languages, are you going to add also some more ways to deposit money? Could you answer me please. I have an interesting question. For example you are successful in the sale period, but all the guys are nor interesting in gambling at all, only in bounties and speculating the token. So you have 0 to 10 users daily playing your games. So it's not enough to cover even hosting costs for you website. What is likely to happen to the token? Of course it seems like a fairytale, however, you indeed may have very small amount of users. What to do then? (I'm not interested in knowing your strategy like 'we do increase advertising' or smth). I just want to make it clear about what I should expect as a token holder.  - We will accept all popular crypto currencies to provide maximum convenience to the user. - We don't consider the situation that we'll have few players. We know how to attract players, and we will do it professionally.  Quote from: Jokerrr on March 18, 2018, 05:20:37 PM Well, what happens if crypto continues falling? Does this mean anything for your project?  Cryptocurrency is very volatile, no project is immune from this. But we calculated our business model in such a way as to be able to confidently develop even in the conditions of such volatility in the ico process.

Quote from: Drugser on March 15, 2018, 01:12:55 PM It seems like you are right about the high entrance fee for such an instant game, yes. I would recommend to lower costs just by gathering more people in a particular game at once. This could work and be as profitable as it was.  We have games with a low entry threshold. We recommend you try our scratchcards.  Quote from: Logan22 on March 16, 2018, 12:33:05 AM I understand the purpose of private sale, but why did you decide to divide ICO into pre-sale and the main stage? When does it start?  The main stage starts on 16th of April.This stage allows to participate in ICO with low amount of investment and  does not provide any bonuses. While pre-sale stage provides bonus, but in return for greater amounts of investments.  Quote from: Yoverdot on March 16, 2018, 01:58:48 AM On ICO listings I only found the similar info. You can google it if you want to find something really special.  I want to ask dev about the rewards. In what currency will it be possible to withdraw money. For example I play in casino sometimes and pay by a plastic card. Then I can get my reward directly to my card again. What if I deposit in ETH, will it be possible to withdraw in the same way?  We have developed a solution that automatically converts other currencies and Fiat into our tokens, which are then used in games. In the near future this solution will be launched and available to players.  Quote from: PISTON_1 on March 16, 2018, 02:10:37 AM In your advantages for token buyers there is : ‘Buying of tokens with no risk: in case ICO does not collect softcap, all the transfers are returned’ Ok, do you think it is exactly the risk? I don’t agree. The risk is auch that TrueGame token may cost at least less than I invested. How are you going to maintain an appropriate rate?  We have already passed soft cap and reached a one/third of our hard cap just for 2 weeks. Also, considering small hard cap and the level of product implementation and our future plans (new games, obtaining licenses, etc) - the potential of token's grow is pretty high. You can take a look at similar projects on the exchanges and compare their level of implementation to ours",False

I really like the style of truegame, but I’m still not 100% sure the product will be in-demand. It also would veeeery bad if guys from US are not able to play games. I don’t know in which country gambling is really popular, but American market is huge anyway.  We are already in-demand. We passed soft cap and reached 1/3 of hard cap in almost 2 weeks after sales had started. Moreover, we have step-by-step program to develope our platform and marketing campaign to attract and involve more people in ICO and platform as well. Yes, the US market is big, but it's hardly bigger than South-East Asian market, where people almost crazy about gambling. But Asian market is just one part of our marketing campaing, which I mentioned aerlier. There are almost all Europian countries and Latin America countries as our goals of marketing as well.

The TGAME Token will be listed within a few weeks after the end of the ICO on several exchanges. We negotiate with many exchanges from the top 50. The top 50 includes such exchanges as Kucoin and YoBit, cex.io and others. We have an expert on our team who successfully works for the Revain token listing on crypto exchanges (market cap about 500m now).

However, they have a strong team which is backed up by a strong core of known and respected advisors. I like the concept of insuring the integrity of prize drawings through the use of blockchain technology. They should strongly consider KYC for obvious reasons.  At the moment we are not planning to conduct a KYC procedure for all our users. However, due to LEGAL REASONS, we MUST reserve a right to conduct it as the regulations of the ICO are constantly changing and a necessity of the KYC may appear at any moment. Also, at the moment we are listing the TGAME token on the exchanges, and if any of the major exchanges require the KYC procedure, then in the interest of investors to increase the liquidity of the TGAME token, we will conduct this procedure, therefore we reserve this right. Hence, if you are not ready to undergo a KYC procedure, we do not recommend buying our tokens. Also, if it's important for you to undergo a KYC procedure BEFORE buying the TGAME tokens, we can do it personally for you. For this, you can write a request to our email: support@truegame.io.

Is it like a prize pool that will be divided and distributed among all the participants or is it more like a jackpot that one lucky guy could get? Surprisingly to me I found you gambling platform very attractive (I don't like gambling in general). I think I could participate in the main campaign. But if you tell me that jackpot is not for a single person then I think I invest now  The amount of winning is determined by probability. For example, it's necessary to guess 6 digits out of 49 to get a jackpot in a lottery. Therefore, opportunity to get all the amount of jackpot by 1 player is extremely low. In most of scenarios, small parts of the jackpot are distributed among winners.  Quote from: anchousser on March 14, 2018, 09:09:16 PM Tokens are sold wow!

The price of one token is fixed in ethereum, while the hardcap is mentioned in USD(T) -- this confuses me somehow. If we would assume that ethereum will drop to 25% of its actual value (what it won't, just to make my point clear) you could sell 100% of your tokens and still you would not have reached your hardcap.  Of course, it will not happen this way, but nevertheless, depending on the market in the next weeks, it could be possible that  a) all tokens (the mentionend 70%) are sold clearly before hardcap is reached  b) hardcap is already reached with 50% of the tokens being sold  --> the numbers are of course just random and mathematically not correct, but I think you get my point.
