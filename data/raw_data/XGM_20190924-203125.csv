Xaurum is the product of Slovenian development, which has, in contrast to other cryptocurrencies that exist in the virtual world, base and value in real gold. On the Forbes website, Xaurum has been labeled as one of the five most promising cryptocurrencies in the world, which gives added confidence to investors who have become more cautious due to recent market crises.  Xaurum is the first Slovenian and the only cryptocurrency in the world, which has continuously growing gold base was reported on TV show Dan. on Planet TV. “Regardless of the situation on the market, xaurum maintains a certain value due to its gold base,” explains the brand manager Jakob Kapus.

You can find Portuguese translation below.  Recent events in the crypto markets got extensive world media attention. First Facebook, and now Google decided to ban all advertising that is in any way connected to crypto projects. It is a matter of concern to promote potentially high speculative projects where users can be harmed.  Our team understands those concerns made by the public and the media. From the very beginning, we have been advocating for transparency and regulation of all operations in this industry, since we have also been experiencing the negative consequences of speculative projects which harm the reputation of all projects connected with cryptoworld.  We are aware that this is merely a consequence of the rapid development of an entirely new industry where rules haven’t been defined yet and some individuals and projects took advatage of it.  If we are talking about the future of the crypto world, we need to mention the two phases through which it went already. First, there was a period of cryptoprojects based on ideals and values. Basically it was a rebellion against the centralization and power of financial and political centers. The second phase was the phase of those who saw the cryptocurrencies as an opportunity for fast profits and the content of many projects was reduced to competition between different marketing approaches. This phase could be also marked as a gambling phase, where people threw so much money into crypto based just on the fear of missing out. We all know what happened afterwards. Some projects were not meant to succeed in the long run but there were invented just to gather money, with no real or any other value behind. Now we are in-between the second and third phase that is in its early beginnings. It is the period of reality check for all who wanted to bend the rules.  In the third phase, projects that solve specific problems will come to the surface and especially projects with intrinsic value. Projects that will retain at least some of their value regardless of the market situation. Xaurum brings a global solution for the problems of FIAT currencies, and it has a solid real or even better — indestructible value behind it — gold, which is know through all human history, as one of the best assets to preserve value.  We are strongly supporting all attempts for regulation and clarification of the situation in the crypto industry. We conduct our business in most transparent way and in accordance with all valid laws. Our gold reserves are audited regularly and we are the first gold based token which publicly shared this information.  For all of this reasons, we firmly believe that recent events will not harm the Xaurum project; moreover, greater transparency and orderliness of the crypto world will sooner or later only benefit good projects and separete them from the bad ones.  We are looking forward to the next months since we belive cryptoworld is taking decisive steps towards better transparency, efficient regulations and security of its costumers. We are here to lead the way.",False

We have determined that this is currently the only logical and realistic option in order to prevent possible damage to holders and keep their funds intact.  It is currently not feasible to continue the project in accordance with the initial plans, because the two fundamental conditions set at the beginning of the project - the financing and the schedule - have not been met. There was not enough funds raised to complete the project within the set deadline in order that X-Gamma project could be successfully launched and started to generate revenues in the 2018 season. The continuation of the project would pose a risk for the holders, as you could not be guaranteed the preservation of a value in the ratio of 1 : 1, as promised at the start of the project. It also seems fair to us, that the holders do not have their funds tied to a project that is idle, but have the opportunity to redirect their funds somewhere else.  More than 90% of funds were gathered in FIAT currencies and less than 10% in ETH and BTC. Funds were spend for construction. Deposits by holders will be valued in EUR and returned to the same extent as they have been invested. The means are provided by the mechanism of melting, which means that the gamma tokens are returned and destroyed.  The funds to return to the gamma token buyers will be provided by selling the villa Rustika, and the return procedures will start seven working days after the villa has been sold.  In case the villa could not be sold, the funds will be provided from other sources by 31 December 2018.  We thank you for the trust you have shown us and your understanding. We are convinced that we have proven that we are trustworthy, as we are committed to honoring our obligation of returning assets in the amount of 1 : 1 in the case of early termination of the project.

There is not a lot of trading going on. We can only assume why. First: People who invested in xaurum gamma business model (I gues mainly friend and family so far) knows that gamma token will start producing profit at the season start – reason is just few tokens on sell side. Imagine there will be summer season at this moment. Rent for one house for just one week would bought all the gammas that are on sell side at this moment! Price would go through the roof. Second: apparently there is no need for trading at this very moment. Prove for that is weak sell side. If you know gamma mechanism (rent - burning xgm constant demand 24/7 on exchange, basic & additional offer - xaurum backing) why would you sell xgm before season? Question for debate: after seeing there is only few gammas to buy on market and people are holding it for summer rental demand. Also there is way to buy gammas at production price. Do you think listing at this very moment on 2,3 other exchanges is game changing moment? Thank you for constructive debate.",False

December 2017  Dear friends, investors and everyone who follows our Xaurum Gamma project. The month of December is over and in this case from the XGM team which cares about the development of the project, we wish you a successful 2018 and we send you a warm summer vibe which is barely waiting for the first guests!  NEWS FOR INVESTORS and anyone interested in this business model:  In December we didn't rest. Instead, we made some crucial steps towards the desired direction for the successful start of the summer season in 2018. The XGM business model which works as a multiplier of your financial inputs recently gained some important components needed for the successful implementation.  New accommodation GAMMA XPERIENCE package and active holiday spending GAMMA ADVENTURE package:  We have put together an attractive experiential package which provides tourists with an unforgettable experience in the first crypto smart street and raises tourists vacations to an entirely new level. We strive to make those two packages a successful and well-known brand and set new measures for active and quality vacation spending.  https://i.imgur.com/sEQTYBz.png?1  https://i.imgur.com/su0Mk9A.png?1   New tourist website: https://gamma-xperience.com/  With pleasure and pride, we present you a new tourist web site. An attractive and luxurious project requires an interactive site at the level at which the visitor can receive all the necessary information on renting, offering and booking of luxurious villas. You can find all these new features on a new site that has come to life today. Attention! Since the site is still under construction few functions will be upgraded in the near future.  Crypto News:  Despite the fact that the price of XGM coins in this period until the summer season is not of primary importance - as the season will be the one that will affect the price with demand - XGM coins in the first month reached the price somewhere between 105 and 200 € which is expected. Among all the innovations in the meantime, there are also negotiations in progress toward adding our XGM coin on new exchanges.  Office Opening:  On December 20 we hosted the official opening of the office in Logatec where all the ideas necessary for the success of the XGM business model are created and implemented. At the event, we showed visitors our premises and talked about the potential of this innovative business model. The mayor of Logatec welcomed us and welcomed the fact that industrial zone of Logatec now hosts the first ""crypto"" office.

Then fill the registration form, let us know your wallet address and pay selected xaurum gamma order. Gammas will be delivered in a week. Save invoice, hodl and enjoy in productive summer season.    If there are more questions don't hesitate to ask.",False

ICO didnt start as they said they would, they missed the deadline for distribution of tokens, some of the investors still didnt recieve the tokens, they said 2 weeks ago that the following days the exchanges will come. They are just not holding to what they announce. How can you say you are delighted about your investment?!  Gamma cant go on bittrex becouse its a security. Money that will be used as an investment is a security. Even when exchanges come, there wont be any big exchanges involved trust me...  If you are building a project on crypto, you need to think of everything ahead. The exchanges are greedy? They should have known that beforehand...  Ehterdelta listing is free, why is gamma not on it?!  Gamma project is still very good. But management of the ICO is horrible. This was one of the worst ICO's ive participated. Post ico's is also horrible as well. I am one of the early investors, who invested before ICO started (friends and family period).

After Gamma is added to the exchanges, the production price will be determined according to the funds invested and the progress of the project.

There was ICO for Xaurum back in 2015 and for all the money phisical gold was bought and coins released which means the product was released and delivered. There was also RICO (Rebirth initial coin offering) in 2016 which was also a migration to Ethereum blockchain. And for money gathered in RICO again phisical gold was bought and coins issued as they are at every Xaurum mint. So I don't know what product are you expecting to be released by Xaurum team.  Xaurum Gamma is project related to real estate and it is a new coin with it's own features and most of all unique mechanisms that I believe you and the rest of the crypto folowers around the world have never seen before.

The goal of Xaurum projects is to preserve and increase value. The investments must therefore be long-term, relatively safe, yield the most profit and be augmentable by speculation. Real-estate is a safe investment, especially in a touristic setting.   We know that many real-estate icos are going on now, but Gamma offers something completely different. With Gamma token investors actually gain ownership of real-estate (villas) at 1:1 ratio from the beginning. Carefully thought out mechanics (burning of Gamma token when villas are rented taking it out of circulation, reinvestment…) will ensure that ratio will increase over time.

I went to official office in Logatec to get to know project details an it's amazing.    Just for the start. 5.480.000 € will be fully invested in villas. Because of great tourist location (even Brad Pitt is building hotel 20 km away) and luxury this villas could and would be estimated to more than 10.000.000. That's double the investment somebody makes on ICO. The mechanism that is incorporated in this crypto smart street will add value also.  Let us think about it.There are two ways that mechanism works in.  1. Tourist comes with eur, his money for rent goes to XGM at current market price and than into burn. Less XGM in circulation, more the value for rest of them. Tourist will eat, drink, and maybe rent some fancy cars, go diving and so on. For all additional offer XAUR are bought on market in the value of eur spend for this offer.  Now this XAUR used for additional offer goes 50% in the reinvest pool (new villas, bungalows...) and other 50% are ""sprinkled"" to all existing XGM.  So that each XGM gets some XAUR. After few rents XGM is not naked any more - 1 XGM +100 xaur.  2. Now there are people as myself holding massive amounts of XAUR and we can spend it by renting villas. In this case all the XAUR for rent and for additional offer are used for 50% reinvest pool and 50% for XGM sprinkling. So in short - holders of XAUR speed up the process of backing. 1 XGM +300 xaur...  In short: genius!  Hands up for such great pioneer projects and not just air marketing as we unfortunately see in era of ICO's.  I expect slow and stable rise. I am definitely in.

Xaurum Gamma is a commonwealth of the first private crypto smart-street, composed of six luxury villas on the island Krk in Croatia. It is a part of the Xaurum commonwealth and a source of wealth both for gamma (XGM) investors and Xaurum as a whole.                             Project overview  Xaurum is a crypto-currency with a continuously growing gold base. It has appreciated from the initial 0.00625 $ per XAUR to the current 0.30 $ and has increased its common gold reserves from 1016 g to the current 129251 g. Xaurum Gamma is a commonwealth within the Xaurum commonwealth, that applies the concept of Xaurum within its established economic framework, and benefits both. Gamma increases the use of Xaurum and its coinage, and Xaurum enhances the value of Gamma.  Xaurum Gamma is a commonwealth of the first crypto smart-street. It is composed of six luxury villas on the island Krk in Croatia, a prime tourist real-estate. The goal of Xaurum projects is to preserve and increase value. The investments must therefore be long-term, relatively safe, yield the most profit and be augmentable by speculation. Real-estate is a safe investment, especially in a touristic setting. However, the time required for profitability makes it infeasible for small investors and crypto can mitigate this downside. The creation of Xaurum Gamma, a crypto-asset that represents half of the profit (and accumulates it in xaurum), creates a way for investors to benefit from speculation. It avoids its potential downside by employing scarcity (the number of Xaurum Gamma tokens is limited), guaranteeing a minimal value through its use (Xaurum Gamma tokens can be used to rent a villa at the rate 1 XGM : 100 € or higher when recapitalized) and the growth of its xaurum reserves.  The transparency and speed of crypto will enable the project owners to see all the economic activity in real time on the Gamma platform. Gamma project profits and the acquisition of new xaurum reserves will be visible in real time. All villas, smart fridges, drones, etc. will be represented on the blockchain, where Gamma owners will be able to monitor all the transactions and profit creation of each individual object.  Half of the profit from the smart-street and its services will be reinvested in the growth of the project and the second half will be used to acquire xaurum (XAUR) for the Gamma commonwealth. The reserves of gamma (XGM) kept in xaurum will be increased as the project grows, and their value will grow as xaurum (XAUR) price increases. Gamma (XGM) itself is continuously increasing itself in value and size by the use of the crypto-smart street and its services. This increase will additionally speed up the process of acquisition of new xaurum reserves per gamma (XGM).  Xaurum Gamma will be recapitalized with additional funds when required, at the rate higher than the initial offer - the rate of issuing new XGM will be determined by the market, and the new funds will be used to grow the common real-estate assets. The ICO funds cap is determined by the costs required for the project, and all the funds will be used for this purpose only; once the development of the first Xaurum street is completed, the valuation of the land and the built objects will increase. The low ICO ratio, determined by costs, along with the absence of rewards for developers and marketing, make it an excellent opportunity for investment, that will benefit investors from the start of the project, and keep benefiting with the profits of the growth of the project and the gamma xaurum reserves.  Xaurum street will consist of six luxury villas of modern designs, equipped with the latest smart-house and crypto accessories, their own pools and lounge areas. The villas will be built to the highest aesthetic standards, with functionality in mind. They will provide their guests with the highest rate of luxury and privacy, while still being accessible and connected to the infrastructure. The first street is built on a premium location, in the south-west of the Island of Krk and is connected with nice roads, markets, fine restaurants, beautiful beaches etc. The island itself is well connected, accessible via highway from EU and has its own airport and plenty of ports. The street will be private, accessible only to Xaurum users and will include the possibility of renting luxury cars, yachts, boats, and drone deliveries.  The initial goal of the project is to secure enough funds to build the first private Xaurum luxury smart-street, and acquire the Croatian company that owns the plot with the first object already built. The completion of the building development is scheduled in May 2018, making it open for use and rent in the summer season of 2018. Because one object is already built, the profit from the already opened villa will start to accumulate soon after the ICO. After the final development of the initial buildings and infrastructure, half of the rent profits will accumulate, until the expansion of the street or a creation of a new street will be viable.
