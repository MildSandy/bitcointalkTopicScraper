2,msg45534886,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4767652.0,msg45506098,2998,Announcements (Altcoins),2018-09-11 13:12:30,ksystems77,Member,127,15,,[ANN] [ICO] K Systems LTD and KSYS ERC20 Token,"     Prologue:  ""Everyone earns as much as he can (or wants). The efficiency of such work is a bank rate: If you can put money in a bank, say, at 3% per annum, then any earnings below that percentage are considered ineffective. You can give money to the management of a financial company, and earn up to 10-15% per annum.  When a person decide to play in the market, it means he expects to earn more than giving money to the management. It's just logic. If it's about XXX - then it's just start-ups. ""  The problem is that an increasing number of these start-ups, even those with high ratings and a stellar team, turn out to be fraudulent projects, the creators of which, simply collect money from crypto-investors, then disappear without a trace, or drag out the development for an infinitely long time, dying slowly. Scam with money makes a loud false advertising campaign, without any development, and lures money from investors, while real innovative startups sit in the ass.  All this does not allow real innovations and promising industry solutions to break through the wall of misunderstanding and mistrust - often the market for such developments is highly specialized and not specialists prefer not participate and not even to read about what they do not understand. We tried to explain in simple words why our product and our ideas should not be compared in the main bulk of projects that try to get financial support from the crypto community.  Our project “K Systems” and our finished product KSYS1 are based developed and became possible due to the blockchain, that's why we launched  ICO as a method of attracting investments for the development of future innovations and introduction of the existing advanced developments in the aerospace and automotive industry capable of initiating the 4th industrial revolution.  Dear Bitcointalk community, we appeal to you to break the vicious circle of ICO degradation and provide public support in promotion and raise funds for the advertising campaign of the project “K Systems”. Including investing in ICO by means of the KICKICO crowdfunding platform or our own smart contract.  We invite promoters, people who know how to provide a start-up with qualitative access to the international market and  private crypto-currency investors to collect separate advertising pool (150ETH)  from $ 1000 per participant.  Our company is a registered British firm that develops and deploys dApps for the high precision manufacturing in aerospace and automotive industry (# 11291459, a unique taxpayer number 765811430 A)  More than 1,900 crypto-currencies are now quoted on CoinMarketCap and around 4,500 are currently trying to join the circle of favorites. The team worked  hard, for a long time to differ among thousands of applicants.  Globally, in the current situation on the ICO market, the escrow service is an extremely necessary saving solution,that K Systems LTD provides to its investors - our escrow agent is KICKICO who audited K Systems and agreed to launch ICO on its platform with an escrow service, the funds will be transferred to K Systems LTD after the completion of crowdfunding and after the distribution of tokens to investors. In case of failure to achieve softcap, the funds will be returned to investors with a 100% guarantee.  In other words, the situation of no targeted spending of funds during the ICO is completely excluded, besides, we have no debts! - We did not have pre-sales with the huge token price dump, we did not attract venture funds or other individual project supervisors in order to limit as much as possible the end users from excessive commercialization of products, because then we would not differ  from existing solutions. We tried to go this route, but when we found out the conditions -  immediately refused ,they are unacceptable to an honest company, predatory and simply leave any ICO and its investors without pants and as a consequence - the failure coin on the first exchanges. We suggest you divide the profits what private funds and the greedy big investors tried to take away from us at the beginning.  The funds that K Systems have available are already distributed among several funds: Developments Payment of team work Promo of the required entry level  In the current environment, we offer an alternative to the established practice of most ICOs:  K Systems is not going to spend people's money to appear on popular exchanges with wound up volumes of trades -KSYS token prefers to go out on adequate, simple and accessible, liquid enough, not filthy stock exchanges with a daily volume of 0.3-1mln $. With one such we already have a preliminary agreement. In all other cases, listing on exchanges will be decided by voting our community with a discussion of the conditions and possible consequences. It should be the exchangers who do not practice fraudulent schemes because this leads to the collapse of the economy of the token from increased volatility.  The team pursues the goal of organic, stable growth of the price of the token by equipping the industry with our advanced applications and also through the receipt of operating profit from the supercomputer store and the services of programming / audit of smart contracts. After the development of K-ATIA, the economy will be strengthened by a part of the corporate 3D modeling market. KAMPUS - the market of training and certification of specialists.  How are we going to become successful?  We have claims for a part of 4 markets - market of quality management systems for aerospace and automotive industry. market 3D modeling programs at the corporate level where the monopoly of 2 players dominates. market supercomputers for modeling and gaming. market of services for the audit and programming of smart contracts market training and certification of specialists.  The main means of payment for K System products and services will be the KSYS token.  There is an opinion that crypto-currencies are not suitable for mass settlements with counterparties, at least on the basis of Ethereum, but K Systems can work on any platforms that support smart contracts and dApps. In addition, the number of non-cash payments will not be as large as in the Amazon, for example, therefore, the token as the main means of payment in small and medium-sized campaigns is a perfectly applicable practice for settlements in a transition economy.  We envisage the possibility of working with large companies through fiat money, in which case the founds will still be directed to the capitalization of the token. We do not want to miss the big clients because of their reluctance to work with crypto-currencies.  What we have already:  The already developed and tested innovative quality management system in the field of High Precision Manufacturing of Aero Space Components  is currently used by Ingegneria Aerospaziale Torinese (IAT) S.R. in Turin, Italy (https://ico.ksystems.io/services/ksys1/) Experience in sales of supercomputers for modeling and gaming  - (https://ico.ksystems.io/services/k-supercomputers/) High professionalism in the field of audit and coding of smart contracts. (That's why the code of our contract completely reflects the company's policy - there is no influence on the tokens, there are no preferences for the creator in the future, which you can verify with Etherscan)  The already launched ICO, which was thoroughly audited by the KICKICO team. dApps can be hosted on private nodes and can function in any blockchain that supports decentralized applications.

This is the first time a combination of Ethereum Blockchain Technology, IPFS and crypto rewarding is implemented industrially, particularly aiming to ease the work of high precision Aerospace and Automotive industries. You can browse the Net in dept, but nobody has ever actually used Blockchain to build ISO AS/EN 9100 Compliant Quality Management Systems, CAD/CAM/CAE suites or learning facilities based on those products. The only thing I have seen, so far, are ERC20 tokens without any actual product behind, or financial products (...far too many...)  2. Smart Contracts, on a ERC20 Blockchain, are the most effective way to follow precisely the ISO 9001 Quality Specifications for high precision aerospace manufacturing. Combined to the Inter Planetary File System (IPFS), they just represent an unexpected and unprecedented innovation for the AS/EN 9100 standards' implementation, check what Adolfo GUBERTI, CEO of the first company implementing KSYS 1 had to say about it:  Quote Before the first test implementation of KSYS 1 within our infrastructures, I didn’t know what to really expect from it… I had been working in the Aerospace industry, and specifically on the ISO 9001 Standards aspects of it, since the early 70’s, and never came across something similar to it.  At the beginning, I thought this was just another attempt to introduce an additional licensing and maintenance cost into our budget, I did not know anything about this new Blockchain technology or any other weird application Mickael LEVY was talking about…  But I knew two things: K Systems had always been providing my company with what was needed, at the highest quality levels AND that the Industry needed at least an attempt to make things easier for what was regarding the AS/EN 9100 Quality Standards implementation.  What I can state now, nearly 2 years after I saw and used by myself, for the first time, KSYS 1, is that we will not switch back to the old Quality and Production procedures and Management Systems!  In fact, many times in the past, we had trouble in combining – well and all together – the construction of a batch of high precision flight components, the respect of our internal policies, the machinery workload, the human resources assigment, the traceability of the parts and many other production and delivery aspects… All this simply meaning: We had dfficulties complying to the AS/EN 9100 Quality Standards, in fact, these required standards are difficult to achieve even for big multinationals as all sectors of the company must know what the others are doing, how they do it and when they do it… As a result, many times we did not know where in the production chain the parts were, which milling machine was busy and with what, what the latest revision of a document or drawing was, where the dimensional control reports were stored, who was working on what, etcetera etcera… Oftenly, we had delays delivering the components and/or the parts were returned to us as they did not fully comply to the ISO 9001 standards.  Today, with K SYS 1, I just scan a QR code on my screen or on a label and I know everything about that work order, that part, even where the material to build it originally came from, at what price, how much of it is left… Everything! We just deliver on time (or even earlier), the parts don’t come back anymore… Actually, the only things that came back from our customers since the K SYS 1 implementation, were compliments and commendations!  3. K SYS 1 uses the KSYS ERC20 token to reward the suppliers that have submitted the parts, and/or the documents required by the project, and rely on a Clustered IPFS implementation to store the actual data (transport documents, drawings, emails, CAD files, invoices, CAM part programs etc.), K SYS 1 has a built-in penalty system for the suppliers or workers whom do not deliver on time, at the requested rate or at the required quality level. Every action is recorded on the Blockchain.  Also, all of the K Systems LTD products and services are only purchasable with KSYS Tokens.

I hope to build a strong community, made with people from all over the Planet, from any social background, race, belief (... or NOT belief). We work in the Aerospace industry since a long time, all this corruption made me sick, but aircrafts and space modules are still very obsolete, together we can change that and we can at least attempt to give a better future to our children, to the future generations.
