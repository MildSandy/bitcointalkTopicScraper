Thanks for approaching 1. We had stated in our social networks, that its not a strategic partnership, but agreement on technical cooperation. We had reached it with OmiseGo representators via e-mail. As we are young project, we decided  to announce that news, otherwise they didnt. To tell the truth, it doesnt matter a lot   If we will establish complex strategic partnership in further, pretty sure, both sides will make announcements. 2. Such decision was made by Sonder Team just  due to very unstable market situation. 3. Our Hardcap is not just numbers. Thats that amount we need to continue developing of our project. If ETH price will rise - great, we will reach cap earlier. If ETH falls - so, more  people will have opportunity to purchase SNR-tokens during ICO. 4. Unsold tokens will be burnt. We stated it many times   5. It was announced at the main page of the website that Pre Sale is extended. 6.You are free to contact each member of Sonder Team via Linkedin and ask him directly. As you could notice, we dont have e.g. paid superstars in our team like most of ICOs do. We are just team of professionals, who knows, how to develop the project, which will make crypto really useful in everyday life. 7. It will be published in the separete Technical Paper. 8. And once again, detailed description of the Sonder technologies will be published in the Technical Paper. The matter is most of investors are not so technically educated, so we decided to write WhitePaper in the most simple and acceptable manner, so everyone could understand what is Sonder about.  Thanks for your questions and attention to our project  ",False

I will appreciate your reply.  1. Where one can find the proof of the partnership with OmiseGo? (Like OmiseGo web-site, twitter or something like that, so far I saw nothing there about SONDER.)  2. There was a period during the pre-ICO, when there was a 10% bonus. Currently it is a 15% bonus because the pre-ICO was extended. Does it not counterintuitive – those investors who got 10% bonus are not happy now, aren't they?  3. Theoretically, there are two ways: a) a hard cap is in USD, and ETH that is risen during the fundraising campaign should be immediately transferred to USD, so the funding volume announced at the every moment does not change due the ETH price fluctuations, or b) a hard cap should be in ETH. But in case of SONDER it is that a hard cap is in dollars, but the price of tokens is in ETH, and hard cap is constantly changing because of the fluctuation of the ETH/USD price. Could you, please, comment that?  4. Furthermore, if the price of a token is in ETH, the number of tokens to sell is fixed and the hard cap is in dollars there is an obvious mathematical conflict here. I.e., 168M tokens price in ETH will be 11760ETH. With the hard cap of $6M it would work if the price of ETH will be fixed at around 510$. But it is not, so the hard cap will be reached faster than the 168M tokens will be sold. So, what will happen with the unsold tokens? I do not think that this important point is mentioned somewhere... Please, comment that.  5. The conditions of the pre-ICO were changed, but it was not reflected on the SONDER web-site and the whitepaper. Shouldn't the solid project avoid to have such unprofessional issues?  6. At the LinkedIn pages of Kenjiro Tamaki and Benjamin Li there is nothing said about participating in SONDER. (The latter also does not have the data about his occupation at all, so we do not have a proof of that he works at Beijing Honden Capital...) How come that even a co-founder did not mention such a crucial thing for the trust for the project at his LinkedIn page?  7. What is expected cost of a future SONDER master-node and its profitability?  8. Finally, the SONDER whitepaper is extremely non-technical, so most of the properties of the proposed blockchain are rather unclear in a way of achieving them. For instance, it is said that ""Immediate execution of transactions will be achieved due to a high speed of forming blocks, the consensus between the masternodes, reasonable emission schedule and the system-friendly rates"". Well, immediate execution means that there must be something like >100k TPS for the SONDER use case, but a) high speed of forming blocks is not a method for increasing TPS, but actually the same thing, b) consensus between the masternodes is a regular issue, alone it cannot give you 100k TPS, c) emission schedule point is a complete nonsense! because it is supposed to be zero! the total supply is already defined and what is the emission we are talking about then? In principle, there should be something like sharding, like in Zilliga, second-layer solutions etc. Nothing of that kind, not saying about something new, is proposed or even thoroughly described by SONDER.  Please, take my questions not as a FUD attempt, but a wish to become sure that the project is solid and it is reasonable to invest. Thank you in advance.  P.S. If someone could answer some of those questions, I would greatly appreciate it.",False

To reach this goal we are developing the package of API and SDK tools. Application Programming Interface will provide opportunities to connect Sonder Payment system to trading platforms easily and configure it to their own features. Programmers wouldn’t have to spend a lot of time writing down endless codes to make payments in cryptocurrency available for online-stores consumers. All that will be required for this is to use ready-made Software Development Kit and adjust it for the certain marketplace. When SONDER Payment system is fully developed, acceptance of payments for purchasing goods and services on the Internet with cryptocurrencies will become as fast and easy as with fiat money.    Security through anonymity Our team has been developing a number of technical decisions for achieving the highest standards of true privacy. Some of them will be implemented in the multifunctional Sonder Wallet with an optional anonymous mode and mechanism of addresses obfuscation. Enabling this mode, people will be able to hide any information about their balances status and disguise transactions addresses from prying eyes. Nobody will steal your money, if he wouldn’t know you have them!    Fast and cheap microtransactions Immediate execution of transactions in Sonder Network will be achieved due to fast speed of forming blocks and consensus between the masternodes. Besides, implementation of PoS will allow to reduce transactions fees to the minimum. As the network is incredibly light, the cost of nodes’ operations is practically worth nothing. After SONDER Mainnet is live, purchases on the Internet with SNR-tokens will be available almost without charges.
