Full disclosure. Best Reeves Collins segment imo https://youtu.be/Ft6IbUkUH7w?t=331  As a business model- Digital unique goods, think like cryptokitties for example. Now any business, Starbucks, Coca Cola etc. can create digital items that could be tradeable for their customers that wouldn't be limited to their own app. Think of what OmiseGo long term goal is- things like airplane miles tradeable for a completely different asset. The same thing could happen with VEE, but is blockchain agnostic. Watch this video posted by Patrickluberus if you haven't yet as an example of this! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnJwoWLdEjg&feature=youtu.be  The team has spent years building giving them a real first mover advantage that probably couldn't be replicated and built before they overtake if it works. This and is blockchain agnostic. A particular good case for EOS who can scale and has feeless transactions, and doesn't limit its use if a particular blockchain can't handle high volume. (Watch the few videos on this page and think of the possibilities. You see a coin like Lomostar- Now major companies who are starting to see the blockchain space as a business opportunity have a tool to access their existing customer base. They could put digital items on maps that customers could find and redeem in store.  Only on OkEx and Etherdelta. No major exchanges yet for big growth potential.
