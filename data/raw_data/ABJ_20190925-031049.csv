We do understand that the past season has been hard for the Abjcoin team and community due to several occurrences beyond our control which includes Coinmarkets closing up, Coinhouse offline and many more. This has also led to several of our team members and developers, exiting the project. The Abjcoin core team has thought of several ways to solve all these issues arising, and have even thought of making a second chain for the Abjcoin project to run side by side, to enable us have another fresh start. If we had gone ahead with making a new chain, all Abjcoin holders would have gotten part of the new chain on a 10:1 ratio. But after consulting our project advisors, we are made to believe that it will not be the best option. The Abjcoin core team is committed to this project and wants to see it actualize its full potentials. With that in view, the Abjcoin team has decided to restructure the Abjcoin project for better effectiveness and to actualize it potentials. During this restructuring we would be removing several arms of the project to enable us focus on the core. The restructuring will include; 1.   Abjcoin code update to version 2: We will be updating our code and core wallets to a higher blockchain version to solve conflicting issues as regards to mined coins, for better synchronization and transaction speed. We will be releasing a new core wallet version and also upgraded source code on Github. 2.   Abjcoin bug bounty: Before release of version 2 code base, we would be opening up the Abjcoin blockchain for a hacking test. This will enable us to have a better code system that can stand any attack. The bounty winner will be given $10,000 as reward for hack and fix. 3.   macOS Core wallet release: Due to high user demands, we will be releasing the Core wallet for macOS. 4.   Raspberry Core wallet release: Due to high user demands, we will be releasing the Core wallet for Raspberry. 5.   Abjcoin Pool maintenance: For security reasons we would be closing down the Abjcoin pool to solve several issues. Therefore we would require all users to withdraw their coins out of the pool. No new deposit or re-investing will be allowed till further notice. 6.   Telegram group deactivation: As a way to protect the community and new investors from wrong influence, we would be closing the telegram group and converting it to the channel(https://t.me/officialabjcoinchannel).  Users are advised to join the channel for latest info, and also to join us actively on twitter (https://twitter.com/abjcoinblockch). For all the users who are in the group to encourage investors, we do appreciate you, but we would be glad if all those post be done on other open social media to increase our presence. 7.   Project Rebranding: We would be rebranding our project image for better international standards, communication and partnership. 8.   Smart Marketplace App: We would be releasing a new Andriod and IOS App with a smart marketplace running on the Abjcoin blockchain. 9.   Recruitments: We would be recruiting new staffs for in-house work to increase our effectiveness as a team. After completing the above, we would suspend every other roadmap and focus on exchanges and marketing the use cases of Abjcoin. Love the Abjcoin project?

This has not only re energized the team members but has also ignited our creative confidence that Abjcoin was developed for greater things.  To this end, we have worn our creative caps to restructure the Abjcoin so as to fulfill all the promises we made to our investors.  Abjcoin will now have a side chain called Abjcoin Commerce (ABJC) , this will not in any way affect the operation of the first Abjcoin, but what we are trying to do is to right our wrongs with the Abjcoin C  The Abjcoin C will come with the following features      It will be listed in bigger exchanges (like you all have suggested)     It will come with its own IOS and Android wallets     Integrated with it’s own decentralized commerce chain in the mobile app, with the ability to sell and buy within the app.  ETC  The Abjcoin Commerce side chain will occur at a certain block on the Abjcoin blockchain that we would announce, and all Abjcoin holders will receive 1 ABJC for every 10 ABJ in their wallets.  The ABJ will also have a smaller supply of 21,000,000 as against the 30,000,000 of Abjcoin.  Secondly this restructuring is inevitable as it is our desire to give all investors value for their money and we strongly believe that will help us in achieving that.  To this end, we will restructure the Abjcoin websites and other social media handles to reflect this change.  We strongly believe that this move will make a difference and help us salvage the current situation. All we ask for is your corporation as usual and we trust this process will be seamless as ever.  We will update you subsequently about all that is expected to happen and how best our community members should position themselves to get the best out of this experience.  Thank You  -The Abjcoin Team",True

In this update we will be focusing on sharing an overview of our work and progress report of some of our projects. we will be giving you further details on the following ; • Abjcoin current price dip • The Abjcoin cryptocurrency Exchange • AirDrop payment Update  1. The Abjcoin current price dip; We are all aware of the current fall (dip) in the Abjcoin price, after a thorough research and analysis was carried out, the team came to a conclusion to the possible fall in price; • Over 500,000 Abjcoin was released to most persons whose coin where withheld to prove their ownership of the coins by conducting a KYC, probably most of these persons decided to dump the coins. • Most persons who got reward from the recent pool and airdrop also decided to sell their coins. • We also suspect that coinsmarkets.com is trying to sell off coins at their disposal. However, we have done all we can to contact them so they allow users to withdraw their Abjcoin but as sad as it sounds, all these have proven futile. However, our resolve is strong, we promise to do anything within our powers to get back those coins. Please don’t forget that the best time to HODL Abjcoin is now.  2. The Abjcoin cryptocurrency exchange; We promised our community to build a world class exchange platform for Abjcoin and other cryptocurrencies, this we have done and we will soon disclose it to the community. Security is one of the biggest features we want this platform to have, to that extent, we are doing all the necessary corrections and security checks to ensure its safety and that the funds of our users are well protected. As soon as the team of experts who are working on it are done, we will make it open for business.  3. The Air Drop payments The Abjcoin balance Airdrop has been concluded and payment made. However, most persons who participated In the airdrop are yet to receive their reward, also must person who participated did not stick to the rules of the airdrop. Incase you are part of those who participated in the airdrop and did not get your reward and you followed the rules, kindly send your wallet address that shows the required amount of coins to contact@abjcoin.org. After proper verification, you will be credited with your reward. We will keep you updated on all our recent projects and development.  Thank you for believing and supporting Abjcoin.",True

This is their third fork now I believe. The first fork the removed all ABJ that miners had accumulated. As mentioned before if they do not control a majority of the ABJ then they have no control over the price and therefore cannot give their naive investors the $5 in ABJ price that they promise.  Just cut your looses and move on or save all the chats and other information and expose them to prevent others from being scammed.  They should be doing another fork within 3 months based on the current track record, rinse and repeat",True

Following the creation and slow, but steady, rise of Bitcoin since 2009, various altcoins have been created with an estimate of over a thousand cryptocurrency specifications as of September 2017.      Now, ABJCOIN, from the heart of Africa, gives the opportunity to trade freely in the global market. Being the first of its kind cryptocurrency for trade, exchange and payment platform from Africa at large, ABJCOIN is truly Africa's blockchain solution for global payments.  As the major aim of the coin is to provide frictionless ease of transactions between Africa and the rest of the world, little wonder it is that the first African blockchain solution for global payment has made history again. In their bid to spread the good news of blockchain, ABJCOIN has extended its global reach to the United Arab Emirates. On the 6th of January, the whole crypto-community in Dubai came out enmasse at the Dubai mall to hear for themselves the numerous benefits ABJCOIN can do for the economy. Speaking at the occasion, the lead developer of ABJCOIN, Dr. Samuel Benedict said that the sole purpose of the ABJCOIN is to foster trade and commerce from Africa to the rest of the world and that Dubai has one of the most stable economy in the world, thus partnering with ABJCOIN will bring endless business opportunity to the Emirate. Speaking also, Al Mohammed, the group leader for the movement to promote blockchain technology in Dubai said that the blockchain technology is a tool which every economy must learn and take advantage of, and that he believes that ABJCOIN blockchain has a high prospect and would help Dubai achieve its goal of a decentralized system of payment. In addition, the managing director of Blockchain Tech Hub Mr. O. Osiobe also reiterated that the technology and consensus of the ABJCOIN makes it an economy friendly cryptocurrency in terms of transaction fees and speed which has been one of the biggest challenges of some well-known cryptocurrencies in recent times.     Since the proof of stake algorithm of the ABJCOIN makes it easy to mine and it has a transaction speed of 40seconds, this will make service delivery and transfer of value much better. The highlight of the event was the grand opening of the Abjcoin blockchain partnership, the partners are to drive the Abjcoin roadmap in the United Arab Emirate. The event ended with a syndicate session of training on how on to trade and how to create wealth with cryptocurrency. Already over 50 merchants and business in Dubai are ready to accept Abjcoin as a means of payment of goods and services.    https://abjcoin.org/abjcoin-extends-reach-united-arabs/",True

I got every coin i sent to swap back on the new blockchain.

I must however make 2 observations. Firstly publicity for this coin is very low. I only heard about it yesterday when a youtuber mentioned it in passing. Secondly, as beautiful as this project is, it lacks one important ingredient to truly make it the coin for Nigerians and Africans as a whole. That ingredient is the ability for Africans to buy this with their local currency. As it stands presently, an average Nigerian will still find it as difficult to buy this coin as it would be to buy any other cryptocurrency. I believe a solution to this would be to create your own in-house exchange that supports the buying and selling of this coin with the Naira at the CBN official rate. Imagine what this will do for businesses that depend on forex. The effect will be so profound. As an example, cryptopia (a New Zealand exchange) supports the purchase of cryptocurrencies with the new zealand dollar. QuadrigaCx (a Canadian exchange) also support purchase of cryptos with the Canadian dollar. You already hold the advantage of being a pioneer in a country of 180million people who desperately need a reliable and fair forex platform. Nigeria is your market so look no further. When you capture Nigeria, the whole world would notice ABJCOIN and come knocking on your door. Keep the good work.",True

The team has spent over $100,000 in restoring hacked funds but since hacker has refused to give up all coins, the team took out time to search through the block on which the hacked coin occurred and will be removing them from the chain.  We believe that spending more funds on the hacker will bring allot of harm to the community , as our road-map is large and requires allot of funds to fulfill them""Starting from the global fiat market, Debit cards, ATM machines and more"".  Therefore all users are required to transfer their coin from core wallet and every exchange into the wallet provided on the official website(https://abjcoin.org/wallet/) as all the exchange will be  pausing trade and put wallet on maintenance to successfully carry out this modifications. This however may also lead to a fork and old chain will be killed so there can be only one chain. On event of a fork, investors funds will be swap for a 1:1 on full KYC.  Modification or fork will occur from 9th December 2017 at 8am CAT. All users are expected to deposit their Abjcoin into the wallet here to be part of it.Completing fork or modifications can take up to 7 days, and then withdrawals will be activated  and new wallet software will be issued , that will be compatible with the chain.

Which inturn will improve the per capita income of Africans and Nigerians. With the above in mind every project coming out of Africa especially Nigeria must be TRANSPARENT, CREDIBLE, OF GOOD REPUTE and PROFITABLE  must show the world that indeed the African man can be trusted and can create TRUE value. Abjcoin is welcome once again but the developer has to be transparent all the way and carry the community along on every issue.

Below is an extraction from your WHITE PAPER. What has been achieved and what is yet to be achieved? Abjcoin's success is the success of all Africans and indeed Nigerians.  All funds raised will go straight into furthering the development and security of AbjCoin 20% of all funds raised will go directly into development and expanding the team behind AbjCoin. 10% of funds will then go to legal’s to make sure AbjCoin is compliant in all countries. 20% will go into technology improvements such as upgrading servers, purchasing EV SSL certificates and much more. Another 10% will go towards marketing AbjCoin to gain awareness about the platform and gaining more users, 10% will be distributed to one or more private security specialist firms to make sure AbjCoin is free of any bugs and exploits.

Because Bitcoin is so big, it takes too much time for people to agree on innovative changes. This is why there was a huge surge in alternative currencies last few years.  AbjCoin focuses on privacy and transaction. Therefore makes use of the Scrypt POW/POS algorithms, as against the POW of bitcoin that gives big miners the ability to decide the outcome of bitcoin without the masses participating.  AbjCoin proof of stake algorithms makes everyone a miner , through a system called staking.  Proof of Stake verse Proof of Work                                                                                                                                                Proof-of-Work was a fantastic innovation that formed the backbone of the original Bitcoin protocol. The idea is that by solving a computationally intensive math problem, one can prove the effort they’ve done to secure the protocol. This is how a blockchain is generated, and the effort that is required to perform this computations contribute to a coin’s scarcity and value.However, Proof-of-Work eventually becomes an extraordinarily expensive system.Proof of Stake solves this issue in a very elegant way. Rather than using computer power as a scarce resource to generate security, Proof of Stake uses the scarcity of the coin itself. A user may choose to “stake” his coins to generate the next block in the chain, and his chance of doing so is basically proportional to the weight of his own coins.  Proof-of-Stake is eco-friendly and efficient, and avoids the vast waste of energy and hardware overhead of Proof-of-Work based networks. AbjCoin however combine both",True

Point to the publication you made on Bitcointalk or your website. You made no publication on any public sources because you know what you did is a scam  ABJ Coin team did not give 1:1 coins to everyone that originally mined. We have to take their word for it. This is the scenario that happened.  The ABJ Coin team allowed mining before and into the ICO, the coin later switched to full POS.  This is the real scenario  1. A miner accumulated a lot of coins probably 500K - 1.5 million ABJ 2. This individual then started dumping the coins on all exchanges which will impact the ABJ price 3. The ABJ coin team panicked and wanted to control this and so decided to immediately fork the chain privately  then claiming they sent  ABJ to all ICO participants. 4. They have not sent 1:1 ABJ to any miners and have destroyed all coins that were mined  ABJ Coin team did this secret fork because they want to have 100% control of the all of the coins in circulation which allows them to control the price of ABJ.  If you did a fork like every coin before then all holders and not only those that bought in the ICO should be compensated 1:1 .  If the fork was due to a hack like you said then why have you not sent 1:1 ABJ to all other holders?   What this shows is that the ABJ Coin team will fork for no reason. All ABJ Coin holders can easily loose their coins.  What ABJ team did is unethical and it will be flagged as scam.",True
