Those that have interesting projects without the means to bring them to life will have an opportunity to make their dreams come true. We are creating an ecosystem that will allow entrepreneurs to manage their businesses remotely and securely, giving them the opportunity to expand and maximise their profits with the help of cutting-edge technologies. __________________________________________________________________________________________ Solving market problems  Monopoly solves four major problems of investment funds 1. Raising funds for start-ups MNP allows a start-up to be placed on the platform and to attract fund investment through decentralized investor voting. the funds enter escrow and unlock partially when the team performs tasks within their road-map. 2. Appropriate use of funds Not all the start-ups show the same profitability. At the selection stage, we not only evaluate projects in context of formal requirements, but we also usea neural network to analyze their reliability and profitability. the revenues received from the projects are distributed through a decentralized platform for participant voting. Thus, we not only ""collect and invest"" funds for the purpose of general enrichment, but we also can justify why this particular project was admitted to the fund-raising stage. 3. Development and scaling of projects The most promising and profitable projects are scaled by decentralized voting of participants at the stage of profit distribution. Failure to comply with funded processes leads to termination of financing, which stimulates the start-up team to perform tasks properly. 4. Safe investment in projects Fund investment decisions are made by decentralized member voting, which reduces the risk of making a wrong decision. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ The Main Idea  The main idea of the Monopoly project is to organize a remote and secure interaction between investors and the most profitable projects in the cryptocurrency market, to build transparent relations without risk and with maximum profitability. We are creating an ecosystem based on a proven business model for attracting investments in cryptocurrency, which has justified its existence in the construction of mining farms.  • The Investors. It is important for every investor to preserve and increase their capital by investing only in projects that will develop and generate income. • The Projects. It is not always enough to have a good idea to create a business and start earning; first of all you need funding to begin and mentors to help you avoid making the wrong choices.  To attract a large number of investors and promising projects to participate in the fund, MNP must provide a decentralized software solution for the safe and transparent relationships of the participants. To this end, we created a mobile investment decentralized blockchain-based platform, where users can make their decisions about the creation and development of businesses. This will change the way investors interact with ideologists of new projects and make these relationships more valuable and effective. We are launching the MNP project to expand opportunities for interaction between these parties. MNP tokens (ERC-20 standard) will allow access to the Monopoly platform. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ How it works  Project scoring and neural network. In order for Monopoly to develop and show a large return, it is important to avoid mistakes while selecting a project. That’s why we have introduced a two-level scoring system. • When a project sends us a request to participate, an initial profile will be created that includes all the necessary characteristics. Then the platform itself decides the status of the scoring, according to a priority scale that contains both key and less important criteria. • We will create an evaluation system that examines working profile analysis data using a neural network (3 factors, 1 answer). The neural network is also used in voting as it helps to foresee more details thanks to its big data underpinning. We will receive an answer like ‘there is a 71% chance that the project will succeed’, and therefore we will make decisions based not only on our own experience or on expert advice, but using a multi-factor analysis. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ MNP token sale terms and conditions  CROWDSALE TARGETS Soft Cap (minimum) - $ 1 000 000 Normal cup - $ 5 000 000 Optional cup - $ 10 000 000 Hard (maximum) Cap - $ 25 000 000 TOKEN DISTRIBUTION Distribution principles For every 70 tokens sold, an additional 30 tokens will be issued for the foundation.

Subsequently the decision to begin developing a unique cooling system was made. 2 - July 2017 Submersive cooling system research & development begins. Tests have proved to increase profitability per mining unit through overclocking ASIC chips by Innosilicon 3 - August 2017 Successful testing of the unique submersive cooling system 4 - September 2017 Launch of the first ICO – TerraMiner, based on the experience received over the previous months that resulted in creating a concept of a mobile mining farm inside a cargo container utilizing a unique submersive cooling system. Located in China, near an ASIC manufacturer INNOSILICON on a guarded compound, which solves the issue of logistics, electricity price and makes the launch quicker. 5 - Late December 2017 TerraMiner 1 ICO successfully ends raising around $850,000 that went towards fulfilling the obligations given during the campaign. 6 - 30 December 2017 successful launch of the TerraMiner 1 project, the mining farm is commissioned and ASIC overclock procedures begin. 7 - Early 2018 TerraMiner 2 project launch 8 - January 2018 TRM1 token holders begin receiving payouts 9 - January 2018 Testing and launch of TRM1 proprietary mining pool 10 - January 2018 First batch of hardware preordered for TRM2 11 - March 2018 first batch of ASICs for TRM2 arrives, research & development of a second generation submersive cooling system based on the experience from the first farm. 12 - 15 March 2018 MONOPOLY decentralised blockchain fund conceptualized to be an ecosystem for investors and start-up projects.
