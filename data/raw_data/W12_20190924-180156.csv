We would like to inform you about the development of the W12 platform and the main directions that the W12 team is currently concentrating on.  The project team: 👉 Connecting charity foundations. 15 agreements have been signed. 👉 Preparing detailed information on the charity foundations and their projects for placement on the platform.  The development team: 👉 Focusing on the release of the W12 platform for charity and social projects (project page, personal account, connection to accept payments in fiat) 👉 Developing “accounting using blockchain” service and testing it, which will allow recording all fiat transactions in the EOS blockchain. 👉 The second version of the W12 blockchain protocol has been developed and has successfully passed a security audit under which the purchase of tokens is available for W12 ERC20 standard tokens and stablecoins. 👉 The next blockchain version of the W12 protocol is being developed under which oracles will decide whether to continue funding the projects.  The marketing team: 👉 Preparing the launch of an advertising campaign to attract private charity projects. 👉Preparing for the launch of a PR campaign platform in the general media. 👉 Preparing for the launch of an advertising campaign to attract donations to the platform. 👉 Preparing an advertising campaign for the target audience of traders, which will start before listing takes place.  Before the end of March: ➖ An AirDrop for premium accounts; ➖ Removal of restrictions on the transfer of the W12 Token and listing on the first exchange; ➖ Release of the alpha version of the platform for charity and social projects; ➖ Launch of an advertising campaign to attract private charity projects to the platform.  ⭐️⭐️⭐️By the end of March 2019, the platform will be released, allowing to attract funds to socially significant projects around the world using blockchain technology.  One of the important technological advantages of the platform is “pay only when done”, which allows transferring funds to the project only when all the conditions stipulated in it have been fulfilled. For example, a new vaccine has been developed, a new technology has been tested, water purification or improvement of the area has been implemented.  This solution is based on W12 smart contracts and will be available this summer. All calculations in the system are carried out using the W12 Token.  🔥By mid-2020, the W12 team plans to raise $100,000,000 for charity and social projects using the platform and the technology developed for its implementation.  ⏭⏭⏭ Buy W12 Tokens https://w12.io/premium",False

This year, we are planning to develop a protocol in four main areas 👉 social fundraising (or charity), crowdfunding, tokenization and real estate trading, and STO. Each direction we be allocated on a separate platform. All of them are based on the W12 protocol, which is based on the W12 Token. The W12 Token will be used on each platform. The ability to use the W12 protocol in a wide range of projects will favorably affect the distribution and use of the token.  The platforms are allocated according to the types of audience, its interests and activities.  ☑️ One thing remains unchanged, and that is the full transparency of all operations, minimal infrastructure costs, decentralization, the lowest possible risks compared to centralized counterparts.  👉Below is a brief description of the main areas of application:  1️⃣ Platform for charity and social projects Non-profit organizations, foundations, and individuals can organize charity fundraising for good deeds. The W12 protocol provides targeted use of the collected funds with transparent reporting fixed in the blockchain.   2️⃣ Crowdbuilding Is a platform for collective construction and real estate investment without leaving home. It starts from 1m2. It is available from anywhere in the world. The interaction between the participants is carried out using the W12 blockchain protocol. A test version of the site is already available at crowdbuilding.io. We will tell you more about the work of the platform in more details in the next announcements, so stay tuned!   3️⃣ Crowdfunding on the blockchain Is a platform that allows users to raise funds for the implementation of any project and the production of a new product with the release of tokens in a matter of minutes. Users will be able to buy any products or services using a special option like purchase using an escrow based on the W12 protocol. Not only products from the classical markets will be available for purchase, but also the launch and sale of tokens of new blockchains, various technological solutions such as crypto cards, hardware wallets and much more.   4️⃣ The STO Is the platform for security token offerings. Projects will be able to produce and offer Security tokens for sale by presenting customers with more rights and guarantees compared to the classic model. The project will be able to withdraw part of the collected funds for the established purposes only with the approval of the customers or their representatives.   For the transparent functioning of each of the projects, we have developed a service of accounting on the blockchain‼️  After a series of short tests, we will publish it. This tool allows users to record all the movements of the funds between projects in the blockchain. Such transactions are available for verification by any user anywhere in the world.",False

This letter contains a brief digest newsletter of the developments of W12.io over the last month along with announcements of upcoming events.  1. We hereby announce that the Crowdsale stage has been completed. Total funds raised by the end of this stage amounted to 7,311 ETH.  2. The release of the token into public circulation and its use will take place in Q1 of 2019.  3. The second version of the blockchain protocol will be released prior to listing. The protocol is ready and is now undergoing testing and a security audit. The second version will offer the possibility of payment using the W12 Token and ERC20 tokens, including stablecoins.  4. Defreezing and token operations will be made available on the day of listing.  5. The start date of the long Token Sale is postponed from February 15, 2019, to the 2nd quarter of 2019. The burning of the tokens is planned after the end of all stages of the Token Sale. All relevant information is available on the website and in the White Paper. The tokens allocated for the Token Sale cannot be transported anywhere else. They can either be sold or burned.  7. The Post-ICOstage starts now and will last until token listing is achieved. The stage will involve the active development and promotion of the product, as well as some draws and handouts of premium accounts and gifts for our community.  8. Due to the extremely high volatility of the ETH exchange rate in recent months, we have decided to fix the rate of the W12 Token in USD for the next stages of the Token Sale. The rate will be 8 cents or 0.08 USD per W12 Token.  9. At the moment, the development of the blockchain accounting service is also underway, which will allow charity and social projects to transparently conduct necessary reporting using blockchain technology.  We would like to express our sincerest gratitude to all who have supported W12 as we are continuing to move forward!",False

You just need to follow this link, https://tokensale.w12.io/?utm_source=telegram&utm_medium=premium08nov   If your predictions on the crypto market are long-term, now is one of the best points to enter the market.  There are 3 key points to pay attention to:  1 - W12 Tokens allow users to purchase the tokens of other projects using the W12 protocol and secure token sale model;  2 - The funds raised by the project will be converted to the W12 Token if the project chooses this financing model in order to reduce the platform commission.  The project independently chooses which cryptocurrency the collected funds will be converted to for storage in the project fund. The more W12 Tokens are used by the project, the lower the commission it pays;  For example: if the project uses 50% or more W12 Tokens, the commission is 0% 30% W12, the commission is 6% 0% W12, the platform commission is 10%  3 - W12 Tokens are used as fuel in a decentralized network of oracles W12 Tokens will be required to reward oracles for their actions. Oracles will need to keep deposits in W12 Tokens to confirm transactions and roadmap steps in order to receive rewards online.  Thus, after defrosting the tokens upon completion of the Token Sale, no operation performed on the platform will take place without using the W12 Token. And with any transaction, it will automatically be redeemed by the robot on the exchange.  Fundraising for projects on the platform using the W12 protocol directly affects the economics of the W12 Token, just like the fundraising of ICO projects affected the token economy of Ethereum.  It is noteworthy that when we talk about the W12 platform, we are discussing a solution to the problem on markets with a total volume of more than $800 billion.  Based on analytics, the solution developed by W12 or similar solutions may take up 5-10% of the total market volume in the coming 5-6 years.  The decision is yours.

The part of project tokens will be also distributed between Premium account holders according to its status.  The CargoCoin platform links the physical world of trade and transport with the blockchain.  👉Reducing Fraud — CargoCoin minimises the risk of fraud and in many cases completely eliminates it, by not releasing any payments until the counter parties’ pre-set conditions are met & publicly available proof of the payment has been made or secured in a smart escrow utility. Payments will be guaranteed by default. Fraudulent endorsement and duplication of ownership documents is ruled out.  👉Lowering Costs — CargoCoin will significantly reduce costs, compared to high percentages and other fine print fees that are charged through the whole process by banks, couriers, insurers, brokers, agents, lines, etc. Guaranteed payments will not incur any costs, as it is the case with Bank L/C at the moment.  👉Minimising Delays — CargoCoin avoids the delays by providing instant exchange, review and approval of documents and payments between the parties involved. Further delays are caused by different time zones, different public holidays, etc. The blockchain is always at work 24/7 and does not depend on human intervention. It is 7 www.thecargocoin.com estimated that payment delays alone cost around $19 billion per year (*UNCATD) in losses.  👉Increasing Trust — CargoCoin relies on the public infrastructure of the Ethereum blockchain, backed by thousands of people in a peer-to-peer decentralised infrastructure. Using a proven and trusted technology speaks for itself.  👉Securing Information — CargoCoin is naturally secured. It relies on the blockchain’s proven hashing algorithm technology. There is no possibility of sensitive commercial information leakage by intermediaries, such as banks, brokers, agents, etc. While it is fully confidential it also allows for full publicity of the transactions details that are to be visible by all parties and the public.  👉Safe Archiving — CargoCoin, not just allows but fully relies for full historic storage of all transactions ever conducted, thus avoiding risks of physical loss or destruction of paper documents, while at the same time allowing for easy searching and reviewing past information stored in the cloud.  👉Flexibility — CargoCoin is flexible and allows the parties involved to easily select the terms that they choose to interact with. Options for standard or custom negotiated terms, conditions and forms will boost the user experience. Elimination of language barriers will further facilitate the eco-system participants.",False

The first projects are already selling their tokens using the secure model.  They will be joined by several more projects throughout the week.  The W12 blockchain protocol grants the opportunity to buy project tokens and make individual decisions about the return of funds in case users decide that the project is not fulfilling the terms stated on its roadmap. For example, in most projects, users can return 95% of funds 3 months after the end of the project's ICO.  Please note that on the W12.io platform, many project tokens cost much less compared with the price on their project's website. We tried very hard to get exclusive conditions for our users (not available even to large buyers of tokens).  At the moment, the platform uses the first version of the product. The second version is already fully prepared and is undergoing a security audit.  We have also prepared a surprise for our users. Not only the tokens of projects that conduct an ICO will be sold on the W12.io platform, but also tokens of projects that have already successfully completed their ICOs. But we will not reveal all of the surprises until the time is right. Stay tuned for our news and updates.",False

Token Buyers   • Installing MetaMask: a cryptocurrency wallet plugin for Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Brave browsers. • Acquisition of test ETH: for paying commissions and buying tokens in the Rinkeby test network. • Purchase of tokens   Projects   • Installing MetaMask:  • Issuance of project tokens • Configuration of the sale of tokens and transfer of tokens by the project for subsequent sale  Now users can browse through all the projects placed on the platform and thus protected by W12 Technology in order to buy their Tokens.    The project’s card contains all the necessary information, including visualization and graphics, which will improve your user experience.    In addition, each project has its rating and comments from community members covering advantages of the projects and ideas on future market potential.     Exclusively for W12 Platform Users projects offer special discounts for the purchase of their tokens.   Given the freeze periods and opportunity of getting the tokens of dozens of projects on the platform is a considerable boost in attractiveness for W12 Tokens as long-term portfolio additions.   Of course, we have implemented a KYC process which stands for ‘Know Your Customer’. The process of a business identifying and verifying the identity of its clients. So, every person that wishes to contribute in Project’s Token Sales will need to go through this process.

Xtribe is an M-Commerce company that takes advantage of geolocation technology to match supply and demand of its Users.

Xtribe’s service is offered through a free smartphone Application (currently available in Italian and English) which uses an active geolocation tool. Transactions are done directly between party and counter-party. The proximity between buyer and sellers allowed Xtribe to conduct its business without the need for intermediaries or commissions.

Currently, payments cannot be completed within the App. Instead, they are completed in-person, directly between parties involved in the transaction. Integrating blockchain will allow us to maintain zero intermediary fees, increase our security and speed, and as a result, increase the scalability and reach of our service.

W12 Team would like to present WRIO project that will launch its Token Sale on our platform in October.  The World Wide Web is a paradox. The sites you visit everyday use natural language, but they are written in code and run by machines. Even though machines play a key role in creating and maintaining the web, the computers themselves really can't make sense of all this information. They can't read, see relationships or make decisions like people. Web 2.0 is focused on the ability for people to collaborate and share information online. But the problem with Web 2.0 is that computers simply display blocks of data as instructed by code. The machines cannot understand the meaning of what they are displaying. They only know how to display it.  The next evolution of the Web is the Semantic Web. The Semantic Web proposes to help computers ""read"" and use the web more like humans. The idea is pretty simple — metadata added to web pages can make the existing World Wide Web machine-readable. This isn’t artificial intelligence and it wont make computers self-aware, but it will give machines the tools to find, exchange and, to a limited extent, interpret information. It's an extension of, not a replacement for, the World Wide Web. The Semantic Web improves web technologies by helping computers interpret the meaning of words, rather than relying on keywords or numbers. So the Semantic Web is, in a way, a huge engineering solution.  ✔️Project on the W12 platform: https://w12.io/project-card/wrio/  👉  Please find a detailed presentation here: http://clc.to/bd8-Qw  👉 Project’s video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBg5s8rKZQk   W12 Team would like to present Sidera project that will launch its Token Sale on our platform in October.

The Problem Parking is a frustrating process, especially in downtown and city center location. Finding a free parking spot is so challenging with day by day increase in the demand for vehicles and parking spots. Our present infrastructure is unable to re­establish the balance of demand vs supply in this ecosystem. Also, there is very little what authorities can do to solve this evergrowing problem.  PARKRES is the all­in­one parking solution, bridging the gap between cryptocurrency, blockchain and parking system. On Parkres platform users will be able to find and reserve parking spot anywhere anytime, pay from their mobile wallet using either fiat (AUD, USD, etc.) or cryptocurrency (BTC, ETH, etc.) and even with Parkres tokens (PARK) with discounted rates, find traffic updates to their  parking spot, manage  parking  bookings, register their  parking space  on the  parkres  ecosystem to make money like parking Airbnb. The Parkres system solves several  critical  pain  points  that  exist  in  present  parking system  –  as  it  provides  user­centric  design, monitored and controlled parking spots, ease of payment with just a flash/tap, solves traffic problems and ecosystem friendly, saves loss of fuel, saves lots of time and avoids traffic congestion thereby helping the consumers, providers and authorities alike.  ✔️Project on the W12 platform:  https://w12.io/project-card/parkres/  👉  Please find a detailed presentation here: http://clc.to/V6FnpQ  👉 Project’s video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjXkAoQo4J0",False

The fundraising campaign may be of any type: Charity, ICO – both utility and security, Crowdfunding and any other crowd sourced fundraise and governance.  Fundraisers set up a DAO, publish a roadmap and work in according to it. The Oracles or community of token buyers check if the campaign is reaching the milestones and release funds in tranches, only when the milestones are met.  The W12 protocol is designed to be easily integrated into any existing business, platform or organization. Inside of W12 ecosystem any of the parties can easily set up a DAO of the required type: contributor, receiver, fund or supplier. In addition, W12 provides a token sale platform, through which projects can sell their tokens and easily launch fundraising campaigns based on the W12 protocol.""",False

The protocol consists of smart contract templates (no programming skills required), DAO governance and a decentralized oracles network that controls execution of the project roadmap and milestones.  Such solutions protect any fund contributor from intentional SCAM and unintentional failure, reduce risks and expenses, consequently ensuring trust and transparency between projects and token buyers.  The fundraising campaign may be of any type: Charity, ICO – both utility and security, Crowdfunding and any other crowd sourced fundraising and governance.  W12 is a decentralized infrastructure where the parties do not need to trust each other and any controversial issues are resolved transparently, quickly and at a lower cost.  The W12 protocol is designed to be easily integrated into any existing business, platform or organization. In addition, W12 provides a token sale platform, through which projects can sell their tokens and easily launch fundraising campaigns based on the W12 protocol.  W12 total addressable markets (TAM) = $800 billion  We believe that W12 or solutions similar to W12 can claim 5-10% of the market in 5 to 6 years respectively.  W12 is a commission-based service. As projects acquire funds via our platform, W12 charges from 0% to 10% of the total funds raised. Depending on the amount of funds stored via the W12 smart contracts, the commission is raised/lowered. The more funds are stored with W12, the lower the commission. Also, there is 0.5% commission for the use of the protocol.",False

To create a token, the economy of the project must be taken into account, which influences the economy of the token itself. Moreover they can be of different purposes (security/utility).  The growth potential on the initial stage is much higher for limited emission tokens, therefore, as a rule, their price is overrated initially and may not stay at the same level even since the moment of actual appearance of tokens, nevertheless, the limitation overestimates the token’s initial cost any way.  Another factor that can greatly change the price of the token, if this procedure is provided. Mechanics can have several varieties, but the final meaning is quite simple: the total capitalization is distributed between all issued tokens, i.e. each of them has its own unit cost.

The solution consists of a blockchain protocol, allowing the creation of digital contracts and a decentralized oracle network ensuring their execution.   Main markets for the integration of the W12 solution:  ICO Market / 12 bn. USD (forecast: 56 bn. USD in 2021) Crowdfunding / 40 bn. USD (forecast: 60 bn. USD in 2021) Charity Market / 700 bn. USD (forecast: 1 tn. USD in 2021) The GIG Market (Freelance) / 1.5 tn. USD (forecast: 3 tn. USD in 2021) P2P E-commerce / 4.2 tn. USD (forecast: 7 tn. USD in 2021) Construction Market / 9 tn. USD (forecast: 10.2 tn. USD in 2021) And many others.    The W12 solution is a tenfold improvement over existing centralized analogues, offering the market a transactional model with a commission of just 0.5% (instead of 4-20%) which can be integrated with existing platforms and enterprises on each available market.   For the effective implementation of this solution in the traditional economy, the team will launch its own blockchain based on the proof-of-authority consensus with the ability to guarantee the privacy of contracts signed by the parties, the low cost of executing digital contracts and the storage of data in the blockchain. In addition to this, W12 provides a decentralized oracle network, audited and trusted stable coin, and a protocol allowing users to create peer-to-peer digital contracts. The W12 solution allows us to reconsider the role of the state as an arbiter in relations between parties and to relieve part of this capacity from state institutions, shifting it to peer-to-peer digital contracts and self-regulated decentralized organizations, thus creating the basis for building a decentralized digital economy.   The W12 solution has already been recognized in a number of international conferences: - Won 1st place and best ICO at World Blockchain Forum, New York. - Finalist at Icorace, Switzerland (selected by a jury among 140 ICOs). - W12 was marked by Silicon Valley experts at the Blockchain Economic Forum, San Francisco.

The system allows users to create contracts with any logic necessary for their execution without programming skills.  The execution of scenarios programmed in digital contracts confirms in W12 decentralized oracle network.   W12 solution includes: protocol layer, open-source framework, token sales platform.    We're building a decentralized blockchain infrastructure where trust between parties is not necessary, and any controversial issues can be resolved quickly, transparently and at low cost. You don't need to trust the counterparty when you can trust the code and decentralized systems. Using a blockchain based on the proof of authority consensus allows this system to execute digital contracts faster and cheaper.    The W12 solution allows us to reconsider the role of the state as an arbiter in relations between parties and to relieve part of this capacity from state institutions, shifting it to a digital contracts and self-regulated decentralized organizations. This peer-to-peer system is an integral part of a new decentralized digital economy.   In addition to the ICO market, solving the problem of mistrust between token buyers and ICOs, the W12 solution is also planned for integration in to the following markets: - The GIG (Freelance) Market - P2P E-commerce - Charity Market - Crowdfunding - Construction and many others.  More information on use cases and integration can be found in the project’s White paper. The total volume of these markets is currently estimated at more than $15 trillion USD. Moreover, the problem solved by W12 is one of the largest existing problems in the traditional economy. The W12 solution significantly improves on existing centralized analogs, offering the market a transactional model with a commission of only 0.5%.  For the effective implementation of this solution, the team will launch its own blockchain based on the proof-of-authority consensus, a protocol that allows users to create peer-to-peer contracts and a decentralized oracle network that confirms the execution of the milestones in contracts and the transfer of funds to the other party of the deal in accordance with the conditions set within it.  The W12 solution has already been recognized in a number of international conferences: - 1st place and the best ICO at World Blockchain Forum, New York. - Finalist at Icorace, Switzerland (selected by a jury among 140 ICOs). - W12 was marked by Silicon Valley experts at the Blockchain Economic Forum, San Francisco.

According to the DAICO idea, the tokens buyers can return their unspent funds only in the case of 51% or more of the participants vote for the refund. This model is quite inconvenient for the investors and carries out the risk of the fraud. The 49% minority can be subject to the scam in case of the fraudulent agreement of the team with the part of investors. In the W12 model each token buyers acts independently. These increases the degree of the protection and autonomy of the decision making process. The token buyers can decide to retrieve the unspent portion of their investment at their own discretion, without explanation and at any point in the project road map. For example, if the project fails to fulfill its obligations set up in the milestones or the token price went below the original ICO price on exchanges. 2. According to the DAICO idea, the project must be financed only with the certain method on 100%. This is suitable sorely for a limited number of the projects. The W12 model allows the projects to receive the funding in any quantity and amount they need, regardless the other sources. The projects can conduct the traditional ICO or attract capitals through the placement of the equity. The usage of the W12 model as an additional source for the funds providing the diversification of the risks and financial channels. The W12 model is an infrastructure for the decentralized venture capital and can be used for the project necessity in any area of financial needs. 3. The idea of the DAICO concept was announced in January 2018. It is applicable to the Ethereum network. While the W12 model embedded in a cross-block platform that integrates many popular blockchains such as Ethereum, EOS, NEO, Cardano, NXT and the others. It offers user multifunctional solutions to many needs.",False

Mainstream Adoption With the launch of Bitcoin Futures across both the CBOE and CME markets, investors are approaching Bitcoin as a more viable investment opportunity, increasing the digital currency’s visibility and credibility at the mainstream level, and winning over some of its biggest skeptics.  Furthermore, regulated exchanges like LedgerX, (and tZero, which is expected to launch in early 2018), are reducing risk, boosting liquidity, and drawing more institutional investors to the cryptocurrency space.  Digital currencies have gained traction in the political realm, as well. Last September, the Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act was introduced as a way to create a taxing structure for purchases made with cryptocurrency and would allow customers to make purchases up to $600 without burdensome reporting requirements. “By cutting red tape and eliminating onerous reporting requirements, it will allow cryptocurrencies to further benefit customers and help create good jobs,” Colorado Representative Jared Polis said in support of the Act. Although it was not incorporated into the tax bill, it remains up for discussion and indicates a tremendous level of interest in streamlining processes surrounding digital currency.  Global Prominence Bitcoin is being used all across the globe and it is more widely distributed today than it has ever before. Nothing has stopped the massive upward trajectory of cryptocurrency, not even China’s crackdown. Although the price briefly dropped following the news of China’s ban, Japan and South Korea picked up the slack and Bitcoin rose to another all-time high quickly thereafter.  All around the world, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a whole are rising in global prominence. Japan currently accepts digital currency in over 260,000 retail stores. In Venezuela, amidst the hyperinflation of the Bolivar, Bitcoin is used to buy food, plane tickets, and pay employees, and is referred to as a lifesaving currency.  All signs point to the fact that digital currencies are not a passing trend and are here to stay. In a recent survey of different cryptocurrency investors around the world, 90 percent said they believed in the future of Bitcoin and are investing with a long-term perspective.  Diversification of Your Portfolio Diversification is an investment technique to reduce risk by allocating investments among various financial instruments. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is one of the best ways these days to diversify your IRA or 401k. Bitcoin’s growth potential is greater than that of any traditional asset class. As Bitcoin legitimizes and stabilizes it will pass traditional investments.  With analysts predicting Bitcoin’s price to hit in the tens of thousands in the near future, it is certainly a portfolio diversification opportunity that will add value to your account.  Gold 2.0 Bitcoin and gold have many similarities. Both have a limited supply, involve mining, and are not controlled by the government. Anti Danilevski, CEO of KICKICO, a Russian blockchain platform for initial coin offerings, explained how Bitcoin patterns parallel those of gold in financially problematic times. “During the last year S&P 500 index was decreased, gold increased by 14.4%, whereas Bitcoin increased by 74.9%, during the last five years, S&P 500 increased by 68.8%, gold decreased by 26.5%, whilst Bitcoin grew by an impressive 24.9%,” Danilevski said.  In the volatile political climate we currently live in, investors are flocking to gold and Bitcoin as safe haven assets. And while cryptocurrencies are a younger asset class than gold, they have already demonstrated enormous growth and a continuous upward trajectory.  Blockchain Innovation The growing influence of the blockchain and its technology is transforming the way people are doing business. It is increasingly transforming peer-to-peer interactions in the digital world, disrupting traditional processes.  The implications of this technology go beyond finance. Although finance was the first industry to embrace encrypted, distributed ledgers, other industries are adopting the technology as well. Recruitment and human resources departments are using blockchain CVs to verify qualifications of applicants, and intellectual property law, which involves tracking transfer of ownership, is also employing the technology.  Much more than a digital currency, Bitcoin can be thought of as the basis for a groundbreaking technology that many consider the greatest innovation since the internet.  Beyond Bitcoin: The Rise of Ethereum and Other Currencies Bitcoin is not the only digital currency with a massive upward trajectory. In fact, many experts are now wondering if Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, may surpass Bitcoin.  There is a community of enterprises, academics, and Ethereum subject matters who comprise the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, an organization dedicated to learning about, and building upon, Ethereum’s capabilities. Ethereum’s technology is built upon smart contracts. A computer protocol dedicated to digitally facilitating, verifying, and enforcing the negotiation or performance of a contract, smart contracts are the building blocks for decentralized applications. By presenting a new way of processing agreement that removes the verification of a middleman, Ethereum is disrupting the way business is run, and all signs show indicate that this won’t be letting up anytime soon.",False

Let's take DAICO as example.  3 main advantages of the W12 model over the DAICO idea:  1.   According to the DAICO idea, the tokens buyers can return their unspent funds only in the case of 51% or more of the participants vote for the refund. This model is quite inconvenient for the investors and carries out the risk of the fraud. The 49% minority can be subject to the scam in case of the fraudulent agreement of the team with the part of investors. In the W12 model each token buyers acts independently. These increases the degree of the protection and autonomy of the decision making process. The token buyers can decide to retrieve the unspent portion of their investment at their own discretion, without explanation and at any point in the project road map. For example, if the project fails to fulfill its obligations set up in the milestones or the token price went below the original ICO price on exchanges.  2. According to the DAICO idea, the project must be financed only with the certain method on 100%. This is suitable sorely for a limited number of the projects. The W12 model allows the projects to receive the funding in any quantity and amount they need, regardless the other sources. The projects can conduct the traditional ICO or attract capitals through the placement of the equity. The usage of the W12 model as an additional source for the funds providing the diversification of the risks and financial channels. The W12 model is an infrastructure for the decentralized venture capital and can be used for the project necessity in any area of financial needs.  3. The idea of the DAICO concept was announced in January 2018. It is applicable to the Ethereum network. While the W12 model embedded in a cross-block platform that integrates many popular blockchains such as Ethereum, EOS, NEO, Cardano, NXT and the others. It offers user multifunctional solutions to many needs.",False

Low transaction costs, simplicity and convenience of usage, regardless of customer’s experience are additional boons.  The W12 platform allows token buyers to receive the refunding in case of the project’s scam conversion or token trading on exchanges at a lower than original price. Unlike the traditional ICO model where buyers are not provided by any protection, the W12 platform take security measures.  All the funds raised by the projects on the W12 platform are disbursed to the project team at a certain stage. The token holders take the decision of this stage-wise disbursement. Each decision is based on milestone of the project road map marked in the smart contract of the platform.

The protocol consists of smart contract templates (no programming skills required), DAO governance and a decentralized oracles network that controls execution of the project roadmap and milestones.  Such solutions protect any fund contributor from intentional SCAM and unintentional failure, reduce risks and expenses, consequently ensuring trust and transparency between projects and token buyers.  The fundraising campaign may be of any type: Charity, ICO – both utility and security, Crowdfunding and any other crowd sourced fundraising and governance.  W12 is a decentralized infrastructure where the parties do not need to trust each other and any controversial issues are resolved transparently, quickly and at a lower cost.  The W12 protocol is designed to be easily integrated into any existing business, platform or organization. In addition, W12 provides a token sale platform, through which projects can sell their tokens and easily launch fundraising campaigns based on the W12 protocol.  W12 total addressable markets (TAM) = $800 billion  We believe that W12 or solutions similar to W12 can claim 5-10% of the market in 5 to 6 years respectively.  W12 is a commission-based service. As projects acquire funds via our platform, W12 charges from 0% to 10% of the total funds raised. Depending on the amount of funds stored via the W12 smart contracts, the commission is raised/lowered. The more funds are stored with W12, the lower the commission. Also, there is 0.5% commission for the use of the protocol.
