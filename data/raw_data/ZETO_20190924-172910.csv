In terms of competitors: Our main competitor would be someone like Ambrosus.  The key for us is that ZetoChain is being brought to market by a team that has previously developed and delivered a market leading solution. We're building on top of our existing IoT platform and our existing customers are poised to trial and deploy the solution as soon as it is ready. The cold chain for the global retail market is a complicated industry that Zeto has deep expertise and experience in.  I'm not sure that I understand your question about the token. Could you elaborate just a bit?  Thanks.,False

I notice that Walmart and IBM are trying something like this and that's what caught my eye with this. What makes you think you can be competitive with them?  Correct, Walmart are investigating this area, so too are Carrefour and many other of the worlds largest retailers. Walmarts solution will be for Walmart only, we differ in that, like our current IoT platform, we will build a product available to any retailer and retail group such as our existing customers. We will not be directly competing with them as they will not be selling their product to their competitors. They also will not make the information available to consumers and they don't monitor environmental data (temperature etc.) in real time.   What exactly is zetochain?  ZetoChain is a blockchain solution to ensure food safety from farm to fork. It will track traceability information and environmental data (temperature, humidity etc.) as product moves from the factory all the way to a store. When you scan the ZetoLabel with your phone, you can see when the item was packed, what temperatures it was stored at etc. and be confident that what you are purchasing is safe and fresh.  An example of one benefit to the cold chain is a reduction in stock loss. Because we are building it on our existing market leading IoT platform, a truck driver can get an SMS informing them their door isn't properly secured, a warehouse manager can get a phone call in the middle of the night telling them their freezer room has lost power, a retailer can get an email informing them a freezer is in need of maintenance etc.  So customers can verify their food is safe, and everyone in the cold chain saves money.
