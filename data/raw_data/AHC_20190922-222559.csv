The Adherence (AHC) Token allows for patients to provision access to their data. It will also be used to allow the patient to buy down their prescription co-pay. The ScriptDrop medication reminder app helps the patient to stay adherent through daily on-time reminders. As the patient interacts, they unlock additional tokens.
