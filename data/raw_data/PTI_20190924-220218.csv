In this material, we want to answer most frequently asked questions about how different Paytomat tools can be useful for merchants work.  Before our detailed review, it is important to make one remark. The central element that works in conjunction with all the methods described below is Merchant Web Panel. It is a personal merchant’s account, where users can track sales, performance in various cryptocurrencies, manage payout methods and configure Paytomat settings. The second necessary element for every merchant is a crypto-wallet that supports crypto in which users are going to accept payments. Though it can be any program that meets the requirement above, we recommend using our own Paytomat wallet solution for correct and hassle-free work. Now let’s jump straight into the methods.  https://medium.com/paytomat/paytomat-ecosystem-merchant-interfaces-942ac7ea82ab",False
