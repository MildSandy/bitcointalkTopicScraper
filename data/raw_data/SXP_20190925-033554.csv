If you Google Julien Chalte in the news, you also get this : https://www.nouvelobs.com/politique/20151028.OBS8477/le-cabinet-noir-de-la-sarkozie-finalement-condamne.html  Now I don't speak French, but a quick Google translate shows that the guy was involved in dark places in French politics... I would not be surprised if he just left France because he was blacklisted over there. Julien Chalte is clearly a scammer and dangerous.  Raphael Tant is a scammer too I think. I managed to talk with an ex-team member a few months ago, he would not chat with me because he did not want anything in written. What he said on the phone was that basically, when the ether were raised, there were promises made by Raphael that were never kept. For him, it started to look like Raphael wanted to scam everybody and keep the money and run with it, so he left the company.  Looks like it's exactly what Raphael did. Pathetic. But what did you expect from people who are apparently mixed with shady individuals. Hopefully nobody invested large sums in this project.",False

In this case GAS, Augur fit this mold. Gas has 10,128,375 circulating but has 17,190,378 total supply. As to Augur, it is 11,000,000 with no total supply.  Gas = $11.23  Argur= $31.49  I picked this coins for two reasons,  1. in top 100  2. not a scam, unlikely to fail  So, I'm going to assume that each SxP token price will range between $20 to $50. The reason is that not all 10,000,000 will be on the market which means less supply. Selfpay reserve 20% for the team member/partners  which leaves out 80%, that is 8,000,000 token. Not all 8,000,000 will be on the market, let say half of the token holder decided to sell, so basically that is about 4,000,000.

I have one question though: why are you so bitter if you got a refund already? Which, by the way, proves that we are not a scam, right?  Despite what you think, yes, some discussions take a very long time to close. But it's not only about these discussions, as explained in our latest Medium article.  Now let me explain you a few things: this is a business. Like every business, sometimes industry parameters change, and we have to adapt. You said ""more cool features? don't need cool features"". Really? I thought an ICO was about building a solid long term project, not flipping coins at the listing on exchanges. At least that's what we're working on here: building a service that people will like and use. The ICO is just a means to this end, let's just be clear on that.  A year after Pre-ICO? So what? There is no predefined timeline for each step of a life cycle of a company. As much as I do understand the impatience it might trigger for some of you, we have to do what's best for the company, with no personal emotions involved, from any side. This is the wisest approach, and the most long term viable option.  Let me ask you this, and I wish to get an honest answer from you: should we rush, burn all the ETH we got to try and do a quick & cheap ICO, just to say we did it? Or wait until the market recovers a little to spend our contributors' money wisely and responsibly?",False

Example, Selfpay sent out this email in Oct 2017.    Dear Subscriber,  This is an official announcement from the SelfPay's team.  Given the recent regulation issues related to tokens that are considered as securities, the fact that most of the exchanges are now reluctant to accept such tokens, and also to make sure that SXP token holders will always find a buyer when they want to sell their token,  we have decided to set up a buy back program  to replace the previous model based on profit sharing.  As a direct consequence of this, we have decided to reduce the number of SxP in circulation in order to sustain the buyback program. While the percentage of distribution remains the same, the maximum supply will be reduced from 100 million to 10 million.  The good news for the token holders is that it will ensure the token will be sold at a minimum price of 300 SxP for 1 ETH, and also, as less tokens are in circulation, prices are likely increase.  To give you an example, while before, with 10,000 SXP, a token holder was holding 0.1 % of the total SXP tokens, with the new system, this same token holder will hold 1% of the total token supply, so  10 times more  than before !  Finally, we are also making another change to make sure that SxP tokens are going to appreciate in value. SxP tokens will also be accepted as a form of payment, at SxP market price, by our network of merchants, ensuring that contributors will be able to buy on our market place using the SxP token without having to pay any fees.  The English version of our whitepaper has been updated to reflect those changes, feel free to have a look.",False

You again It's been a while! Just a quick question before I start: do you have any personal feud against us or against a member of our team? I mean, come on, creating a profile solely to intervene here and throw some FUD... Well, anyone enjoys spending his time as he wishes, after all     We can't control who comes and go, it's a public forum. We are indeed increasing our reach and this must be a consequence of it.   Also, I am just baffled that they have not changed their prices. I already believed 300 tokens for 1ETH was high when the ETH was worth around US$ 200, now that the value has tripled, their token is still worth the same? That means the token value is around US$ 2? When very successful tokens like Ripple started at US$ 0.0X? That must be a joke, right?  You do know that what matters is not the price per token but the total market cap, right? A bit like the price of a company share, where the total number of shares multiplied by its unit price defines the company's market cap, and then, supply and demand playing its magic, the price goes up or down, regardless of the supply (as long as it's fixed to avoid dilution). And for a project like SelfPay with all its regional implications, a total market cap of a bit more than 33,300 ETH is definitely reasonable. But, I shouldn't be telling you this, you should be well documented on that topic before saying nonsense, right?   This is my personal opinion but I'd stay away from that project, not convincing at all, and I am not sure the team knows what they are doing.  Oh, based on the nonsense you said before? Right.   I am curious too, what if the ICO sales fails to reach the minimum cap? Will they reimburse people from the preICO sales too? Because if not, I will say it again, it looks to me they're just trying to do an ICO knowing it'll fail, keep the previous found, and go ""oh well, it did not work, bye bye""    We're not keeping any funds for ourselves, we're utilizing it as any regular company would do, to run its operations.

Only one liners, asking questions with obvious answers, while others answer with one liners as well... smh  Either the SelfPay team is having a laugh and making these comments themselves, or they've hired someone to do that and create a fake hype around the project. The truth is, their telegram channel has gained about a few dozen users, and their social media posts have a handful of likes/retweets...  Also, I am just baffled that they have not changed their prices. I already believed 300 tokens for 1ETH was high when the ETH was worth around US$ 200, now that the value has tripled, their token is still worth the same? That means the token value is around US$ 2? When very successful tokens like Ripple started at US$ 0.0X? That must be a joke, right?  This is my personal opinion but I'd stay away from that project, not convincing at all, and I am not sure the team knows what they are doing.  I am curious too, what if the ICO sales fails to reach the minimum cap? Will they reimburse people from the preICO sales too? Because if not, I will say it again, it looks to me they're just trying to do an ICO knowing it'll fail, keep the previous found, and go ""oh well, it did not work, bye bye"" ",False

I used to be part of the Telegram channel until it disappeared one day (Or I got kicked out, I am not sure) But if you look closely, the address you are giving for your Telegram channel Julien is different than the address you advertise for on your twitter/facebook feed. So clearly, it is a new Telegram channel. Why lie about it?  You guys keep on claiming you are not a fraud, but you are shady as hell and lie to your investors. Clearly not a good sign.  I also remember Raphael mentioning on several occasion on the Telegram channel, that the pre-ICO was meant to raise funds to invest in marketing/PR in order to do a full ICO campaign in 2018 and raise a lot more. You guys are announcing the ICO just a month before it happens, but no campaign has started, nothing on your social media accounts/websites, you're not participating to any blockchain events, etc. I am having difficulties seeing how you are investing the money you raised and that was close to 200 ETH (worth about $100K right now) in a non-existing campaign.

It is not a new channel, merely the old one renamed (as well as the invite link). To check this, just scroll up and you will see the whole history. There's no lie.   You guys keep on claiming you are not a fraud, but you are shady as hell and lie to your investors. Clearly not a good sign.  Based on what, sorry? Oh, the lie that wasn't one? What else?   I also remember Raphael mentioning on several occasion on the Telegram channel, that the pre-ICO was meant to raise funds to invest in marketing/PR in order to do a full ICO campaign in 2018 and raise a lot more. You guys are announcing the ICO just a month before it happens, but no campaign has started, nothing on your social media accounts/websites, you're not participating to any blockchain events, etc. I am having difficulties seeing how you are investing the money you raised and that was close to 200 ETH (worth about $100K right now) in a non-existing campaign.  And that will be the case! Marketing is being rolled out and will kick off next week, in preparation of the ICO launch on 25th May. Just wait and see for yourself  But guys, some of you complain because the ICO takes too long to happen, some others complain because it's too soon. We visibly can't satisfy everyone, so we're making the best possible compromises here given the circumstances, previous communications, state of the market, etc. And keep in mind that I've just been onboard for not even a month. We're preparing this the right way.   What is the wallet address where the funds have been raised? Are they still in the wallet or not? Because if not, chances are you are just pretending to do an ICO you know won't raise anything, just so you don't have to reimburse the investors of your pre-ICO, and the money has been long gone.

In terms of payments, when it's online or in small shops, people are still reluctant to pay by card in Southeast Asia. Not because they can't, but because of the trust factor. Think about Europe and the US a decade ago, when internet payments started to be the norm. At first, people were still hesitant to make payments online because they could not trust that everything would be ok. Now people don't think about it that much.  Well, Southeast Asia is still in that phase where the trust for online payments is not there. The same goes with shops that are not big renowned chains.  SelfPay will help with this because everything happens on the buyer's device when it comes to payment.",False

The seller get 20% of the transaction fees reward in crypto, and 40% goes to the SxP Token holder.  The seller is happy to get a selling reward, and he is even more happy to use the solution again !  Keep in mind that  any seller can use the solution, even in brick and mortar shop, it s not just a new online payment, the seller do not need to have a web site to use it, it is a far bigger market than just the online market, this is something new and fresh !  As far as I am concern, there is a lot of competitor on the online payment space, but I failed to find any competitor that : offer a offline and online fiat payment and reward the sellers by using crypto currency.  Don't take me wrong, Today, while I am writing those lines I am sure that other companies will have the same idea, but for now there is none that offer the same advantages than SelfPay.

The project seems serious and like you said, you've spent time on it.  Why are you doing a pre-ICO rather than directly an ICO since you have an MVP product already ?",False

Thank you for the comment. Yes, we spent time on the whitepaper as well to make it as clear as possible.  Our idea behind the pre-ICO is that we will need a first round of funds in order to run a good marketing and PR campaign, so when we launch the ICO itself, there is some awareness about SelfPay, and we can raise as much as possible to be able to give a higher reward to our token holders.",False

Thank you for your comment. Yes, the project is not from last month indeed, because we took the time to develop an application and test it on a small scale in Asian countries. We see so many ICOs selling dreams based on just concepts that we did not want to do the same thing. The idea might seem simple, but for us, the real revolution is the payment in real time with cryptocurrency.  Regarding pictures, if you are talking about pictures about the product, you can find some on our website",False
