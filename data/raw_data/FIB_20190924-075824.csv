If it were possible to fully automate grows there would not be so much invested in labour and training in the cannabis industry.  If you'd done your market research you'd know that the margins on growing equipment in Canada and the US are surprisingly low even if you import direct from the manufacturer. There is quite literally no way you're going to disrupt a well funded industry with promises of technology that does not even exist (yet).  Nutrient monitoring systems that adjust hydroponic reservoirs nutrient levels/ratios are wildly expensive, require constant maintenance, and would be completely necessary in a fully automated system. That is just one of many, many issues that are glaringly obvious here. If you're talking about a system where you add premixed water to a system with a pump, it's the exact same as 100s of other systems on the market. That is just one of many simple, yet obvious problems with a ""fully automated"" grow like this one.  If it's not fully automated you're just tricking people who don't know any better.",False

We left it deliberately as an original name of our project was ATF. Facing utterly unexpected duplication of our content by scammers we had to commit re-branding campaign to avoid misunderstanding and possible negative consequences for the Fibonacci brand image.  As a typical project indicating an extremely high economic potential, we were targeted by hustling groups easily practisizing copyright infringement (sailing close to the wind indeed  ) All background will be explained on our corporate site tomorow. Do not panic, all con artists commited the certain tricks will face criminal cases.  ",False
