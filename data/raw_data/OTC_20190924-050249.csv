Have you thought about the fact that probably all of these channels offer some kind of paid endorsement? Maybe a paid pinned post, maybe just ""mentioning"" of a project one too many times. And again you must follow 20 channels on telegram and youtube and blogs, etc. We put everything in one place and we remove the bad low-quality promotional type of information that aims to trick you into believing that the project has long-term potential. Maybe it doesn't, a lot of projects has this potential but this still doesn't mean we should not challenge them and dig deeper and deeper to learn more about their product, strategy, and fundamentals.  What we are getting ready for is the next stage of the crypto market. The stage where all we become more mature, we understand what we are dealing with and we take more professional approach. It's not a coincidence we compare the crypto space to the wild wild west. It is. But when the community gets bigger, when we are more educated when we see more regulations, you will not be able to just hype and promote. You will need to work, you'll need to show what you are capable of before collecting $40,000,000 for an idea that will never become a business.  Try to find information about any public company trading on NASDAQ. Now try to find the same amount of information about a company traded on Bittrex. Don't you think there is too much of ""Guy, they are building a great product, they have so many partnerships, this is the next big thing"".  Again, this doesn't mean there are no good channels and group who are dedicated to help, educate and do proper research. But nothing is what it seems it is in this market. 20 000 telegrams channels with fake members, 300 pages on bitcoin talk full of shills, 20+ videos on youtube for 1 BTC each. Believe me, if you now develop the best algorithm, 10 times faster than BITCOIN, 100 times more secure and private than monero, with the lowest amount of fees and no need of POW, no one would ever do a video about it until you somehow reach top 10 all of a sudden. Because most people don't care about this and don't review quality projects if they don't get paid.  The community now only sees a good project in the ones that have crushed their campaigns, collecting $30m for 7 minutes. How great is this project, huh? We think a project is great only because everyone keeps repeating how great it is. In reality, it is probably a scam with a very good marketing strategy and a million dollars budget for the advertisement that should actually be more than enough in many cases to build the product you need the funding for. But people are greedy. We need more tokens we need more speculation and even exchanges can't handle the number of requests so they just charge $2m for listing. And we pay them, we bend over and we give away our capital without a fight and our investors are happy about it because they get to sell and speculate. They don't care what you are building, they don't care about the product. Welcome to what we have created because we think everything is fine as long as ""I made 10x on my investment"".  Come back in two years and you will see what Otcrit has become and how valuable the platform is.",False

Second, we are truly concentrated on the adoption of crypto in real life. We will be listing only projects with solid teams and business plans, the assets of which you can utilize to pay for actual services and products. There will even be links on the exchange itself taking users to the websites where the purchased tokens are accepted. The companies that we have allowed on the Otcritex will be tracked and if we see that a project is not living up to the promises that they make to their supporters, we will be temporarily delisting them.

Transparent, open. 2. Found, discovered.  WHITEPAPER  INTRODUCTION  The new crypto-economy is growing exponentially with unprecedented speed, and the market is soon to hit one trillion dollars market capitalization. However, the biggest issue in the cryptocurrency market is the lack of transparency and authentic information. Our platform allows serious investors to receive expert reports for the projects and companies they are interested in. It also allows less experienced users to get their hands on easy to understand material and not gamble with their money. The project merges traditional and over-the-counter trading while giving its users access to detailed expert analyses and reports about various blockchain projects.  An important part of the Otcrit platform is our cryptocurrency exchange (Otcritex), where only projects reviewed and audited by our security experts and analysts will be available for trading. A percentage of the collected fees will be distributed between all OTC token holders. The Otcritex will also pay commissions to all companies listed on it and, by doing so, reward them for their transparency and dedication. We are against the current model where companies are required to pay, sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars, to be listed on other exchanges and not get a share of the profits that they could put into development.  COMMUNITY REPORTS  Users will be able to create their own reports on the platform by following our guidelines in the special templates we have created for each category. This way they will be rewarded for their work and have the possibility to sell their studies. Anyone can hire experts or community analysts, request reports from the community, translate existing reports and rate the content creators. The exclusive ads revenue on the platform will be shared with our token holders and community authors.  EXPERT REPORTS  Otcrit plans to issue different reports and analyses regularly in many categories, like company assessment reports, community-based reports, technical analyses and more. These works will be prepared by experienced specialists and available on our platform. Our team will constantly strive to update the information we provide, and all updates of the purchased analyses will be sent to the customers via email at no extra cost. We will publish these papers, not only in English, but also in Russian, Chinese, Japanese and other languages.  Otcritex  The Otcrit exchange will list only projects audited and evaluated by our research team and certified partners. We give users 3 ways to pay fewer to no fees while trading. This is possible by being active, by inviting friends and by using our tokens. If our users go over their average monthly volume, we will remove their fees until the end of the month or when they go over it by 50%. 10% of the digital assets, collected from fees on the platform will be distributed to our token holders. These rewards will be sent out simultaneously every week via a smart contract  WHY OTCRIT?  We understand how difficult it is to spend time following all the market changes and project developments that are necessary to make a good investment. The information is scattered all over the internet and people cannot be sure that the articles, reviews and analyses are objective. This is why we will give not only in-depth assets analyses and evaluation but also a different independent perspective that investors can rely on and profit from. Our customers will have everything they need, from quality information platform to secure trading exchange in one place. The cryptocurrency market will continue to grow rapidly as it has been doing for the past few years and more people will join this industry, making the demand for quality information and transparent exchanges much higher.  FEATURES  Code: --Reports and Analyses  --Community Reports   --Hire Specialists --Request Analyses  --Events Calendar   --Over-the-counter Marketplace --Token Rewards          --Ads Revenue           --Cryptocurrency Exchange --Benchmark Services  --Otcrit Top 100 Index   --Otcrit Database  Bounty Program/Job Interview  The Bounty Campaign will have two levels, a standard one with stakes, and exclusive one only for our platform users. During our bounty campaign we will collect valuable information about the community users who post objective, high quality reports and technical analyses. The top authors, who are available, will be offered to join our experts team and start working for Otcrit full-time. This way they can continue to share their knowledge and always earn from it.  TOKEN DISTRIBUTION  The total tokens distributed to the public will be 83% of the total supply of 100m. Our main and pre-sale will collectively sell 70% of the tokens, and 8% will be sent out in bounties for the next 1 year, for content creators, authors, found bugs, and other initiatives, during and after both funding campaigns. Our presale will issue up to 8,5% of the total supply with the intention to use the collected funds to expand the Otcrit team of developers and analysts and finance our marketing strategy, legal and license costs.  The presale event will have the following rules:  1 ETH will give participants 5000 OTC tokens with a bonus of 20% for the first week.  With special “Perks” for our presale investors, published in our Whitepaper.

I see your point, other exchanges have introduced higher fee shares before us in terms of percentage. However, I must add that we will be having 5 sources of income in total, including our bench-marking services and subscriptions and they will all be included in the reward distribution. The ad revenue is also very high considering the high demand and the exclusive service it will be - limited only to high-rated projects and ICOs. We are positive that the unique features of our exchange will make it really desirable among traders and that a significant growth of the traded volume could be reached from the very first year of the exchange's existence. Furthermore, our team will keep a only small amount of the tokens - 10%. Launching a trading platform is costly and we will be having quite a lot of expenses when it comes to maintenance and development and our business would be unsustainable if we were to give out 50% of the profit. Please let me know, if you have any other concerns  ",False

Quote from: varandas on January 10, 2018, 11:36:45 PM Hi there, what specialists you will hire?  There are no limitations to the number or variety of specialists we will bring on board for our ""expert reports"". Because we are taking a very serious approach when it comes to analyzing a project, its industry, competitors or business plan evaluation, we will hire many experts in crypto, finance and even politics. A lot of people have been crying about this market and calling it a ""bubble"" but the truth is it will continue to grow and the demand for high quality and objective information will not be met with the current standard of reviews or even technical analyses. Edit: Participants in our extended bounty campaign for creating content on the Otcrit Platform, who receive high ratings and provide good reports and analyses will be hired to work for our team full-time.  Each and every one of the Otcrit experts will follow our guidelines and templates when writing a report for any existing project or an ICO so we can be certain our works are always solid, recognizable and cover all necessary viewpoints. These templates will also be applied for our ""community reports"" where anyone with enough understanding and knowledge about the market can share their works with the community, grow their following and be rewarded it.  We are introducing many ways for everybody to join the platform, even people with less experience in the field who can participate by translating reports or when being hired to do so.  Otcrit is building a platform where anyone can quickly find the information they are looking for or hire someone to do it for them. We are also working extremely hard to bring the Otcritex exchange to the public and give them a trading experience they haven't had before. Updates, News and Demo of the exchange will be available in the upcoming weeks and months.  An early version of the platform should be online at the beginning of February.
