We plan to take advantage of the phenomenal growth of digital currency by installing and operating over 3,000 machines across the UK and Europe, as well as develop the most secure multi-currency, multi-crypto mobile app, using its own proprietary blockchain technology, so that by 2023 all financial activities can be done even more securely, instantly and on the move.  .COVERAGE.       .GROWTH. 60  ATMs In April of 2017           7.43  ATMs Installed Daily  Additionally, our blockchain will be self-policing, constantly updating, with a database that is incorruptible and uniquely transparent.

Investing in BCB ATM now offers the chance to share in this dramatic development.      Currently most cryptocurrencies are either used for speculations or for a specific putpose. Bitcoin was created as a new payment system to overcome the inherent problems in the current baking system, but its use is limited.

As more countries come online the more opportunity will exist for users to buy and sell crypto and make arbitrage.

The title reads ""Bitcoin boss WAS LINKED to torturers"". Landry was arrested but found Not Guilty for the particular crimes mentioned in the article. He served 2 and a half years for crimes unrelated to those mentioned. Prior to this, Landry had spent his teenage years studying at Kaplan business school for his ATT and in 2008 began his accounting degree at London Metropolitan University with an ambition to become a fully licenced ACCA accountant.  Landry was interviewed by the Daily Mail for this article and gave the facts of the case proceedings that they chose to omit, instead of misquoting for sound bites.  Landry has since turned his experience into a positive, using his time to study and on his early release for good behaviour, Landry began apprentice work coaching children in football and other skills as well as other volunteer jobs working with young people.  His experience motivated Landry to make a success of his life and he founded BCB-ATM in 2015.  Since then the business has grown dramatically and is now the UK’s largest operator of Bitcoin ATMs in the UK by working to high levels of ethics and compliance. BCB-ATM is regularly in conversations with the Police to ensure BCB-ATM’s are not used for nefarious purposes.  BCB ATM is a well-respected and trusted operation which now has high ambitions to expand the business and bring digital currencies to the high street, making it accessible for people of all backgrounds.",False

Usually on ICO's there is chat on the site or better contact information to ask questions which is more convenient than signing up to forums such as this but never the less after googling I am here now.  I presume The CEO is taking the newspaper to court? Getting linked to criminal gangs who torture people really is not good if they lied about that there should surely be a huge court case.  With regards to the project I have questions and they may seam sceptical but I do expect good replies please so we can further evaluate our stance on the project:  1. How can 1 blockchain process transactions of coins faster than their native chain? (I think you cant.). You can have 1 million tx per second but without bitcoin keeping up what is the point? 2. Why is having 1 private key in control of all your crypto safer (it isnt especially on mobile phones)? 3. Selling my Bitcoin at specific ATM's and making Arbitrage? Where exactly does the Arbitrage happen? 4. Is this the same guy who did an ICO for Ethbits? Dmitry Sergeev https://icoindex.com/profile/ethbits-etb? I quickly checked Ethbits it is an exact copy of iq options and it is not even finished. Is there any other way to analyse this developer? 5. What exactly is the point of this ICO? It seams it is just raising money to expand the number of Bitcoin ATM's and make the company even more money. How will the ICO participants benefit from any of this? 6. Will there be a chance to meet the team?  I will check back in a few days for the answers. Thanks in advance.",False

You join our telegram group and share any thoughts or concerns amongst other inquisitive minds. Further more we have a contact us form on our home site bob-atm.com, here you can also find a contact number to customer service team.   I presume The CEO is taking the newspaper to court? Getting linked to criminal gangs who torture people really is not good if they lied about that there should surely be a huge court case. The headlines is correct I was “Linked” to this crime. However I was not convicted for the crime. I served 2 and half years in prison for a different crime but that story is not as juicy as this hence why it was not mentioned. The reports use clever language to mislead the reader to thinking I was involved. But in fact articles which have not been archived describe a more accurate account of the case. I have tried to dig up the archived articles with no avail - I welcome anyone with better journalism skills share these articles if they can.   1. How can 1 blockchain process transactions of coins faster than their native chain? (I think you cant.). You can have 1 million tx per second but without bitcoin keeping up what is the point? Look at EOS and Stellar. These blockchains are much faster than Ethereum or Bitcoin. We will use DPOS consensus. It is much faster than bitcoin or other POW systems. We will use Combine of it. One of the best example of combine consesus it is GOLOS project. Did you read our whitepaper? We have technical part of it where we described it in technical and more simple words about Treasurer and Ascend.   2. Why is having 1 private key in control of all your crypto safer (it isnt especially on mobile phones)? This simplifies and makes it for comfortable for users. Use one key instead of the headache many of it.   3. Selling my Bitcoin at specific ATM's and making Arbitrage? Where exactly does the Arbitrage happen? Arbitrage allows you sell your crypto via ATM in many different countries and get profit from differences of currencies rates.   4. Is this the same guy who did an ICO for Ethbits? Dmitry Sergeev https://icoindex.com/profile/ethbits-etb? I quickly checked Ethbits it is an exact copy of iq options and it is not even finished. Is there any other way to analyse this developer? Dmitry is the CTO and technical advisor of Ethbits. If you have any questions about Ethbits project ask it in telegram group - this is BCB ATM project.   5. What exactly is the point of this ICO? It seams it is just raising money to expand the number of Bitcoin ATM's and make the company even more money. How will the ICO participants benefit from any of this? Very good question, since the birth of BCB ATM we strive to bring back a sense physical community. As more and more services move to online platforms we are slowly losing the face to face interactive community. Hence our slogan “Bringing online currency to the local high street”. Not major high street but local. We place our machines in local communities. Giving the local store owners an oppotunity to play a major roll in the adoption of crypto for the masses.   6. Will there be a chance to meet the team? Yes - today. Come down have a drink, some food and find out more out the project. Our BLOCKCHAIN Meet Up is this Wednesday the 21st of November in Central London please register HERE: https://bit.ly/2CTd1Xi We have limited spaces available!
