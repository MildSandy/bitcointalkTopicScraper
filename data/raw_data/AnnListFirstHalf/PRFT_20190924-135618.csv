First off, we are very sorry for the lack of updates , I am in contact with the original poster of this thread and we will be updating the front page with new info shortly.  We indeed failed you for not being more forthcoming; but we are a very small team undertaking some big projects at the moment.  However, this is no excuse for my own lethargy in keeping you all up to date.  I would like to use this post to elucidate on the current state of development as an olive branch moving forward.  To put it quickly: we divided up the overall AMP project into 3 parts: a token issuance platform (togen), token exchange (AMP), and asset information (Avocado) datastore.  First, AMP has released as a very early beta.  It has not implemented the rewards contract yet (https://github.com/ProofSuite/proof-cryptodollar/blob/develop/contracts/Rewards.sol) so token holders cannot make use of the rewards function yet for a couple of reasons (as you can imagine, the tokenomics of the space have changed quite a bit since we first wrote our whitepaper).  The first is that we have postponed the 'cryptofiat' integration in favor of a more established support token in the form of USDC and DAI so some of our initial liquidation plans fell through.  Second, development on AMP has been slow as the small teams we had organized for open source development fell apart with the collapse of the crypto prices and interest in developing for blockchain fell out amongst certain members, so David is pretty much managing that entire platform's development.  Please be nice, he is working himself to the bone and I am extremely protective of his mental state.  If you need to vent to or attack someone in Proof, I volunteer myself as tribute.  Now, to address the Avocado in the room.  Avocado is the 'Assurance' side of the Assurance Marketplace Protocol (AMP) ecosystem (https://www.avocadoterminal.com).  It occurred to us that validation through a fully decentralized 'Augur' type of system was not going to cut it and rather that sentiment surrounding upcoming tokens was not just based on market effects but a bevy of other factors from basic site analytics (ala alexa siteranks), to social media buzz, to the projects/companies themselves.  Keep in mind this is about more than just analyzing an initial offering but also the longevity and output of a project in order to avoid this exact situation we find ourselves in.  To address this subjectivity, we began building Avocado.  In order to allow for the best assurance voting on the AMP marketplace we needed a market effect of users sounding off and broadcasting opinions about specific assets in a given time-window in the market.  Initially we wanted to keep it on brand and call the platform X2-Assurance but settled on the more succinct 'Avocado' because we are Millenial brats after all  There's a pre-alpha of X2-Assurance here: ""https://x2.proofsuite.com"" Keep in mind the above is not the platform which can be found here: https://www.avocadoterminal.com   Although it may seem that we have diverted resources from the AMP exchange to Avocado, Avocado is not a Dapp and therefore is much much easier to develop for.  We began working on Avocado after AMP but it passed that project due to its ease of development and it consists of a team smaller than AMPex.  We developed Avocado as our unifying piece between issuing new assets (togen.io) and placing assets on a marketplace (amp.exchange); you can even access these platforms on Avocado with commands 'togen' and 'amp'.  Likewise, we have envisioned Avocado as the central place where we will be placing any alphas/betas of awesome skunkworks projects our community or ourselves are working on rather than releasing a bunch of new sites.   Now, for the connecting piece: as teams enter the ecosystem we will add them as 'Institutions' whose members you can chat in realtime with as well as see our automated analysis score for the offering (there's a preview of this on the 'analysis' section of the avocado dashboard).    As we move forward, we will be adding a 'vote' command and section to the site allowing people to sound off with their voting on new STO, IEO, and regular ICO assets in a kind of 'augur-lite' way with the outcomes witnessed by other institutions and the issuing institution itself (letting any team 'face' their detractors) with percentages of market activity funneling back to token holders.  Of course, this isn't a good enough usecase for creating a platform unless we want mass bounces.  We need the network effect first-- so we are focusing on getting both retail and institutional level investors on board so we can mine the most well informed opinions and generate the best insights.   Finally, I would like to use this post to announce that we will be rolling out crypto payments for Avocado subscriptions by the end of Q1 2019 (tentative barring any major technological set backs) and any full token holders of PRFT will be able to use their tokens for a PRO account on Avocado for as long as they keep the token locked in the escrow contract associated with their Avocado account (the architecture of this is probably going to change but as it rolls out more info will be available.  We are also considering a burning method as laid out by Vitalik but we are still debating the details) as well as allow for priority voting on the vote module of the platform and a possible revenue share of the PRFT-basket as it grows (like a closed-end structured offering.  The details on this are not final.)  Hopefully, this will help to ease the wait as we build liquidity on the full AMP ecosystem (great place to get USDC btw) and get the more robust rewards contract deployed alongside the exchange.  So in summary, here are the projects' (in various states of dev)  URL's for the curious:  AMP (early-beta.  We are still trying to crack the DEX egg and refuse to give up because the concept is just too cool.  Visual and UI/UX enhancements on the way) - https://amp.exchange  Token Generator (beta.  This is the closest we've come to replicating our original proof asset dashboard with better support for minting contracts and proper erc-2X token issuance) - https://togen.io  Avocado (V1 release.  This is the beginning of our data services platform specifically tailored to analyzing market data and allowing people to hear about new issuances amongst many other uses)  - https://www.avocadoterminal.com  Apologies once again for the lack of announcements on here.  We are trying to take our time with a steady stream of releases but are indeed a small team so things come in fits and starts. We have a new discord here: https://discordapp.com/invite/eChaHFk where I am available to talk to anyone and address any concerns.",False

It's only a matter of time until a big-name company fully realizes the potentials of Proof Suite's existing platform and tools. Even if big companies do not, there will certainly be countless success stories of start-ups and/or SMEs.

But note that there are quite a number of notable advisors within Proof Suite.  As such, 'incentivizing' to attract companies is a rather cheap option which greatly undermines the innovations of Proof Suite. Marketing push is great but the priority should always be in keeping the project's reputation in line with its overall mission & values.

Also, comparing just real estate features misses a lot of the other benefits of Proof, because Proof is so much more than real estate. They started with a solution for real estate and quickly found that the platform was viable for just about any type of crypto asset. Proof is a full-featured ""mission control"" platform for many of the challenges faced by the crypto community today. Having this stack of features beyond real estate is what gives Proof so much value.  There are other coins with some overlapping features and maybe a similar pitch, but the execution and presentation of these solutions is what will set Proof (or any other system) apart.

Also for 1.  A good reason would be to participate in the development of the AMP and support the creation of a fully autonomous crypto-asset marketplace while also picking up a token which allows you to gain value in Ether based off the growth of that marketplace.  As for the second part, I think the token is going to fulfill many areas of interest for a diverse assortment of token purchasers with different goals.  That said, our low cap of a little over a million tokens and relatively high price may be a little prohibitive if you aren't somewhat experienced in the crypto-space and crypto-trading.  2) Since your links were removed,  I'm entirely sure what you are asking, however, if it's about the overall space.  I would say we would like to be leaders in the decentralized marketplace space but it's pretty crowded but since there is such a large market opportunity, there is definitely room for a diverse assortment of platforms catering to different niches.  We also have some interesting partnerships we are gearing up to announce soon in the development space that are going to help us push our Smart Contracts out as a development standard for certain kinds of functionality.

I think it could be improved by adding some more information and analysis of the other groups besides Atlant, and show a more complete comparison by including a more clear and accurate overview of the other projects. Proof has an internal marketplace and a very viable business model.  Also, comparing just real estate features misses a lot of the other benefits of the platforms like Proof, because Proof is so much more than real estate. The chart compares only in one area of capability (real estate). Proof is a full-stack platform not only for real estate, but for many of the challenges in the crypto community today. Having this stack of features beyond real estate is what gives Proof so much value in the crypto space. Cheers!",False

Hey, I really like your chart and I looked over your whitepaper, cool stuff indeed.  In fact, you highlighted some challenges we had when we were building out the real estate portion of our platform and I think you and your team did an admirable job of addressing these issues.  That said, there are some inaccuracies in the chart I think we have some suggestions for it that may help you out in building a more accurate scope of the landscape.  First, we do indeed have an internal exchange. In fact, it is one of my biggest headaches as a developer-- as you probably already know.  Building a utility exchange has all number of issues, especially when you allow users to control their private keys completely.  Likewise, we already do have a 'viable business plan' (partially based off the exchange) which has evolved from our past 6 months running Proof as a crypto-business (the token-sale is more about building the technologies to take ourselves entirely out of the equation and create a self-regulating fully automated marketplace).    The chart is indeed accurate, however, in the sense that we do not have P2P rentals since one of our core principles is about ownership.  We believe people should own their crypto-asset.  Now, this presents some challenges as far building an internal ecosystem, however, we are adamant about allowing users to move their assets wherever they want even if it's out of spite over our marketplace.    The final bit of inaccuracy in the chart comes from the section about prototypes.  Regrettably, we do not have a prototype.  We finished our POC phase last year and launched our public beta at the beginning of 2017.  Currently, we have around 6000 active users each day building communities, deploying theid own ICO's, keeping our customer service staff busy, and helping us plan for the future.  So, for the sake of accuracy, I think it may be best to uncheck that box.  We understand that finding info on our platform is kind of hard ,and for that, we apologize.  We are a company of developers-turned business professionals and are still working on certain aspects of the blockchain business/marketing space.  However, if you head over to https://beta.proofdashboard.com and just poke at it a bit you can invest in some real estate, or other crypto currencies, or bonds, or commercial paper, or utilize our wide breadth of tools to make your life easier as you launch your public offering next year.  Thank you for the breakdown nonetheless and I hope our insights can help you continue to build a plan for an excellent real estate platform.",False

For information, here are the official contract addresses : - *Tokensale Contract* : https://etherscan.io/address/0x15eac74d043d9945823afd171677ab2f72215003 - *Proof Token Contract* : https://etherscan.io/address/0xc5cea8292e514405967d958c2325106f2f48da77  A few important guidelines: - Only send ether to the *tokensale contract* *(0x15eac74 ..)* or via our *tokensale portal* (the link will be shared shortly) - After contributing, you can verify your token balance on the Proof Token contract (*0xc5cea8 .. *) - Do not send any ether to the Proof Token contract  Also, feel free to ask any questions. Cheers !        Proof is a blockchain-powered marketplace for the masses.  Our goal is to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to own and trade a part of any real asset.  We created ten easy to use tools that leverage blockchain technology to empower everyday transactions.  Over the last year, Proof Suite has empowered blockchain entrepreneurs with their applications and educational material, including ICO makers, a blockchain-backed asset marketplace, token legal agreement generators, a mobile app, and more.  Our growing community has guided us the entire way, helping with testing, building alongside us, and deploying assets on our core product, The Proof Dashboard.  We would love your feedback and to collaborate with you to take the next step on our path to democratize capital markets.  Our already released flagship platform creates ERC-20 compliant tokens backed by real assets, allowing low barrier investing and the definition of a high number of assets and traunches paid for by fiat, Ethereum, or Bitcoin.  Likewise, since all users control their wallets and private keys, the tokens they issue truly belong to them.  As the centerpiece, the dashboard and marketplace will be the core of the exciting changes we have planned as the tokensale allows for mass growth due to the introduction of mass exchange liquidity and verification capabilities.    Test Run Our Flagship Tool     We are now working on V1 of our many beta projects, after having learned a bit from our interactions with approx. 5,000 active users on our platforms. Today, anyone can create an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency on our platform. Users can tokenize property investments, company equity, community currency, securitized debt, and more. However, how can you validate the value and competence of issuers without a centralized credit agency or compliance board? Today, we have a simple reputation system, but reputation systems can be gamed especially if their rules are known and participants do not place stake alongside their assertions. We developed the the Assurance Market Protocol to eliminate the trust that is required to make investments around the world.  Although the dashboard has seen steady growth and shares many elements of centralization of other blockchain asset platforms.  Our whitepaper presents an outline on how we intend to automate even the most subjective of processes using all parts of the blockchain.  From the emergent incentives and value transfer of tokens to the automated logic deployed on a public chain offered by smart contracts, the AMP system laid out in the paper empowers the 'wisdom of the crowd' to verify assets in a self regulating way.        Team      Advisors          TaaS is the first closed-end fund for blockchain-based assets. TaaS plans to leverage Proof's upcoming AMP protocol to trade not only traditional cryptocurrencies but real-world assets and securities that are making their way onto the blockchain via Proof. TaaS has already purchased 884 ETH of Proof's presale token. This is what TaaS had to say about Proof:  ""Through this new innovative platform, real estate, businesses, interest-yielding business loans and even commodities can now become ownership tokens, available for anyone to buy. Proof provides seamless access to investment deals by using smart contracts on a decentralized platform.""     The public sale begins 1ST NOVERMBER 2017: Countdown & Signup Here.  Proof token (PRFT) holders earn 3% fees (instantly) from the resolution of investment prediction market events, as well as .5% fees from crypto-USD and crypto-fiat purchases.  All fees will be paid in Ether.  Proof will offer for sale 1,181,031 PRFT tokens out of a total minted of 2,362,062 PRFT.  Now, how are the rest of the tokens used? We are in the same boat as you. Proof Suite earns revenue from our decentralized marketplaces and crypto-fiat which contribute earnings to tokenholders.  There will be no more tokens issued after the initial token creation.   The Half of Proof's tokens that are offered in the public sale, are used to seed crypto-fiat support token smart contracts which protect against cryptocurrency price volatility. This crypto fiat can be held in EVS-compatible smart contracts in insurance mechanisms, investment vehicles, and prediction markets. This way, users are investing trustlessly on the blockchain, without investing in BOTH the underlying assets and cryptocurrencies at the same time. This will bring many more funds, individuals, companies and others onto the blockchain and power the future blockchain-based economy.  Proof will not offer these tokens public exchange for the foreseeable future as they are the core revenue mechanism for the platform itself, meaning that Proof operations will be funded after the initial token sale by the activity and success of the market itself.  We look forward to your feedback, criticisms, and suggestions.  As we are mostly developers on our core team, we seek help especially in marketing. We are hiring.  The Public Presale has ended.  Upon purchase of presale tokens, ERC-20 placeholder tokens will immediately be deposited into the sending Ethereum wallet.  Upon the beginning of the Public Tokensale on November 1st, Tokens will be sent out to the addresses of all Presale tokens (PPT - temporary) at a 1:1 ratio and the exchange token (PRFT) will be deposited.  Details of the token SALE/ICO are available here: http://www.proofsuite.com/ico/   If you are interesting in getting involved:   Proof Slack: http://slack.proofsuite.com/  If you are interested in a bounty program, we have a #bounty channel where we would love to hear your ideas and contribute to you in both Proof and ETH to help push our initiative.
