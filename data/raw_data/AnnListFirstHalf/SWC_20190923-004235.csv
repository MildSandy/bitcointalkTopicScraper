Until then, read our whitepaper : A blockchain-based protocol stack for global commerce and supply chains.  http://<img src=""http://image-store.slidesharecdn.com/8448f1f0-878b-4e0b-8f1b-aeebad2550b4-original.png"">  Whitepaper Abstract:  Blockchain innovations are expected to have a profound effect on the $13T global financial industry.  In this paper, we present a vision for applying blockchain technology to an even larger opportunity: supply chains that manage two-thirds of the $75T global GDP.  Sweetbridge is a technology stack and project alliance that solves four basic problems:  Lack of liquidity in supply chains, by creating an innovative collateralized liquidity economy; Resource underutilization, by enabling asset sharing across organizational boundaries; Suboptimal supply chain operations, by providing access to liquid professional talent and creating incentives for supply chain professionals to provide services based on objective measurements of outcomes; Accelerating pace and scale of change, by creating more flexible and adaptive supply chains. To address these problems, Sweetbridge proposes to create a layered blockchain-based protocol stack in the service of a broad ecosystem of supply chain projects. The Sweetbridge project is a combination of bottom-up technologies together with a consortium of project alliances managed by a nonprofit foundation.  The Sweetbridge protocol stack will be composed of five layers for (1) liquidity, (2) settlement, (3) accounting, (4) resource-sharing, and (5) optimization.  This work first provides a high-level overview of the Sweetbridge vision and explains how it improves upon existing solutions applicable to supply chains.  Next, we focus on the liquidity layer as a first step in the implementation roadmap. Subsequently, we present a proof-of-concept implementation of the liquidity layer using cryptocurrency as collateral. We conclude with the structure of our token offering that is designed to both help fund the project and jumpstart its ecosystem.  This effort is the first in a series of projects that will lead to a new economic framework for all commerce, compatible with existing economies and regulatory frameworks but rethinking implementation with a heavy emphasis on next-generation technologies including artificial intelligence, internet of things, and blockchains. The Sweetbridge protocol provides a better way to finance commerce, efficiently utilize assets, and compensate participants.  Whitepaper Excerpt:  http://www.ryancharleston.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/bitcointalk-sweetbridgeIG1.png  ----  Sweetbridge sponsors the development of blockchain-based economic protocols and applications to transform high-friction global supply chains into Liquid Value Networks. The Swiss-based non-profit foundation is gathering interested industry technologists, blockchain projects and open-source contributors from around the world to form a blockchain alliance. The shared goal is to transform brittle, industrial-era commerce through decentralized industry ecosystems that create a faster, fairer value exchange, unleash working capital, better utilize resources and optimize talent for the benefit of all participants.

BridgeCoin is being used publicly by another project already.  it will just be confusing for their users and others to have 2 BridgeCoins.    The term BridgeCoin is not novel as it was used more than 3 years ago as well.  In any case it is already popular and associated with CryptoBridge regardless of SweetBridges pedigree,False

An exchange that allows users to stake their BCO Bridgecoin and earn a share of 50% of profits. I Came here looking at Sweetbridge TBH, and am considering their product. I also use Cryptobridge exchange and see very good things coming for them and ppl who have the coin staked. I just thought that issuing a coin which is already traded under the same name would not be good for Crypto in general.",False
