NXC will only have value if it's traded with volume on exchanges. NXC has been delisted by several major exchanges and was last trade for a few hundred satohis. Once delisted which coin has ever been relisted by Poloniex and Bittrex again? And with this poor track record why would they even list NXC again lol. The developers don't communicate and won't keep their community updated. Nobody even tries to speak here directly. Never forget what scam coin this was. They used ICO for their funding only and after that shut down after a few months. And now you want to support them again?!

Don't put any money into marketing or advertisement. Hire amateur devs and a useless marketing manager that probably got paid in now worthless NXC. Main goal is keeping most of the ICO funds.

Can't say that I'm happy but it's my own fault in the end believing in this. But it's also the devs fault. You should be ashamed! This project is heading to obscurity!",False

It brings the MOBA genre with its RTS origins back together in a 1 vs 1 space war. It's free to play and downloadable on Steam in early access since october 2017. I invite your to try the game here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/700570/Beyond_the_Void  The official release is scheduled for October 24th, 2018, on Steam. Check this article published by CryptoGamer Community to know more: https://www.cryptoandgamers.com/single-post/New-blockchain-game-on-Steam-Beyond-the-Void-on-its-way-to-Gamescom  To reply to your comment, our game is a moba/rts, it's not the type of game that you can develop in one week or even in one year with only one dev. Our team has been working hard on the last two years to develop it. Now the early access period (1 year) draws to a close with an official release on Oct 24th, 2018. We're proud of the work we've done designing this game. I agree that those figures on steam charts are not the best ones, far from here, but remember that we're still in early access. This situation is usual for an early access game in the indie community and can't be compared to already released games.  Since a few months the community is growing, and it will increase with the release. We've organized tournaments (https://www.toornament.com/games/beyond_the_void), we've been to games fairs to present the game, we've made several press release to keep the community updated, ... We keep going with those actions we'll increase their intensity with the release and after it.  Amongst our early players, some are new, some are following us since several months, they believe in the project even if the match making time is longer than expected and are eager to see the future of the game in the next few months.   As you may know, Beyond the void's business model is based on the sale of decentralized game items. Some alternative spaceship appearances and avatars are already on sale on the shop (https://shop.beyond-the-void.net). This is where the NEXIUM is used! The Nexium will be the only token used in the shop to buy limited edition game items.   We're currently going further by developing more than a shop, we're deploying a cross-gaming ecosystem, called Nexarium, designed around one coherent storyline using a pool of blockchain game items. The player will be able to bring his favorite spaceship inside several games in the Nexarium. For example, the Junkalibur game item can currently be used as a war spaceship in Beyond the Void, or simply used as racing spaceship in the runner game we’re developing.  We've been sharing the Nexarium project, where the Nexium token plays a strategic role, in our last speaker slot at the Blockchain Gamer Connect in Helsinki, 2 weeks ago. We're going to share more new about this cross gaming ecosystem at the Blockchain Game Summit on September 25-26 (Check the program here: http://blockchaingamesummit.com/). As organizer of this event, B2Expand ""goal is to push for the creation and implementation of common industry practices in favour of players and thus build a collaborative market to make videogames more democratic."" says our CEO Manon Burgel in the lastest press release (read more here: https://goo.gl/ZgG95K).   Follow our Twitters accounts for more news about: - Beyond the Void game : https://twitter.com/BeyondVoidGame - B2Expand studio : https://twitter.com/B2Expand?lang=en  We hope that this update with links to tangible projects will give you the information you were looking for.

We can't say it doesn't bother us that the coin isn't used but we understand why it isn't so at the current state of the project (as the Nexarium isn't operational). We truly believe that with the development of the Nexarium, communication campaigns, evolution and release of Beyond the Void, the development of the second game, development of B2expand activities and reputation, Nexium will finally find its purpose and will be used in our ecosystem for many games. It'll be both profitable for crypto enthusiasts and crypto gamers and accessible for more ""standard"" gamers that don't know anything about blockchain (or few).  To understand why we don't communicate directly about the nexium you also have to take into account the fact that regulations toughened.

I was patient and was observing the recent developments since beginning of the year and I have to admit that the overall progress ( mainly crypto) is slow. Even if we don't speak of the price ( which is falling through major support lines and is about crash further) you failed to attract more players and crypto investors to your game/store etc.  Your communication channels are very inactive: You gained 7 new users on Reddit in the last 2 months even though I can see you restructured the subreddit. There is not a lot of communication on discord (mainly devs, admins and madfox) which is becoming an echo chamber without any interest. Even your bagholder eseses has left BCT after he sold for breakeven. Not many people playing the game according to Steam statistics either.  Another criticism is the roadmap which got delayed for weeks before suddenly being revealed. Not very professional imo. Fails like that cause harm in crypto space! Don't give dates if you can't make it in time! The roadmap itself mainly contains updates, new upgrades and models to the game itself. I hate so say it but that's not interesting for investors. Also I see that you mainly tour around France (Lyon) to promote your game which will attract French gamers but has no effect on the worldwide market.  The shop: It looks very good and works fine. Not many items yet but I guess it will change in time. I also like that you introduce new characters and storylines. There are not many people buying the items as there are just a handful of people playing this.  I have to say that I'm close to closing my investment in this project as the crypto side of the whole game is just not very profitbable anymore. With this small volume it is even a big risk to be fully honest. The full game release itself will be at the end of the year which is an extremely long time in crypto. It's sad but true as cryptocurrencies rely and live on news. I don't see a lot of attractiveness for outside people to invest in Beyond the Void.  I understand that Beyond the Void is a game and the focus is mainly on the game development side. I wish of luck for the future but I already lost too much on this and don't see the upside!  best regards",False

Globally nxc has always raise by waves with $ its due to some investor who keep and thats good and some trader who make fluctuation.

I remenber all ripple man and nem man who sold 10million of this at 34sat 62 sat for 3000$ profit and now he regrets cause he would be milionairy.  Nxc have few supply and make something usefull and concrete and exchangeable in the best exchanges! That's great!    Well a good project is always good to keep for a long time!

And with the possibility to transfert the items, changing game this is huge!  Ubisoft is big compagny. Artist of the team are good. game is cool. More game looks very interesting. Using a crypto for a game and sell the asset is very cool. the burning of half on the value of the item is cool too.  I follow the team from the beginning and always the work was done with a good energy.  So i would say good job ! Working paid. Hodling  payed. Never sell a good project Keep it like this and now the price is rising it was less than 0.08$ at the begining when i saw it now its globablly up its very nice! Support a project like this is nice with real people who work. They were engaged this years. Some developer and programer and member of team are very cool and talkative when you speak with them. So i just will do your maximums guys! Continue i really want to play more  May with game with some cooperation or team game could be cool. Not only one vs one. And it in the brain.

A supernova has just exploded Beyond the Void, leaving a white nebula in its wake across the galaxy. Thankfully the Archbaron has produced an ambrosium aura, protecting the planets from the white nebula and preserving their existence. We added some visuals in-game and bonuses for the White Nebula Event: - Gifts, snow, and glitter in space and in the lobby. - +20% Battle Points at the end of each game. - Earn a special edition holiday title for winning two games (ranked) while defending the galaxy from the white nebula! This event will end on January 3rd. Enjoy Winter!  SHOP AND GAME We updated our way to log in to the game. Now you have one account to log everywhere: in the game (regardless of the region) and in the shop. This way the assets bought in the shop will be automatically available in the game.  LOBBY The lobby has been improved, you can now see news, last patch note, event, skills collection, tutorial, etc...  TUTORIAL (PART ONE) We finally did the first part of the in-game tutorial! Now you have the opportunity to learn more easily the basics of the game.  BATTLE POINTS Now you earn Battle points (BP) at the end of each game against a player. This BP can be spent in-game to unlock the free to play content. You are now able to unlock new skills with your BP.  EXPERIENCE You no longer gain XP with rings. Now you gain XP when destroying stuff: Ship, motherships, War tower, etc....  NEUTRAL CAMPS All camp have been reworked now with the new system. They will receive a visual update soon!  SKILLS All skill have been reworked! You can see them all in the lobby now in the “Collection” tab. Most of the skills can be used on structure now (turret, war tower, etc). Mark system We reworked all the skills and introduced the “mark” system. How does it works? Each skill is based on one element: Fire or Cryo. Each skill applies one (or many) mark when you hit the enemy’s mothership. If there is enough mark of a type on the enemy’s mothership, the skill will consume them instead to do an additional effect.  Scaling Now all the skills are scaling according to your level. To make it simple: you will deal more damage at level 15 than level 1. In a game, you can use [Alt] key to see the formula of a skill in the tooltips.  VISUAL UPDATES Wall-k2 received a light visual update. The War tower have been reworked and decorated for the “White nebula” event.  OTHER Now you can use a combination of keys in the settings to map your shortcut. All shortcuts have been reset. Echap now opens the setting menu. The fighters now spawn every 20 seconds (was 30 seconds previously).",False

The game    Beyond the Void game released its brand new patch, including:  - Skills gameplay update  - In-game tutorial  - Battle points  - Content to unlock  - White Nebula Event for the winter holidays (12/20 - 01/03)  For more details you can read the patch note.  Your community feedback has been valuable for our team to develop and implement new features. We have since added game improvements for new players and welcome you to join our community on Discord.  As our player-base increases we will be putting more effort into advertising and growth campaigns to significantly boost our community. Expect exciting updates starting in February 2018!  Spend NxC at the Store     The Beyond the Void Shop comes out on January 10th!  Buy, Sell, & Trade Your Digital In-Game Assets  This is the birth of a revolutionary concept in gaming - true ownership of your digital assets. Everything you own in Beyond the Void also exists outside and independently from the game platform.  With traditional game platforms, you leave your winnings, skins, and any other game assets behind the moment you leave it. With Beyond the Void, your blockchain-enabled game assets such as your avatar, motherships, skins, and chests are 100% portable. Your items exist outside of that world, so the time you spend enjoying the game will translate to ownership of the things that make your playtime unique.  You own your skins and can do anything you want with them. Buy, sell, and trade them directly with other people, or put it up for sale on our own Black Market.  Introducing new features, with more in 2018:  - The Corporation Shop is where you can buy and own new items in Beyond the Void Note: Every time a newly created item is sold in the corporation shop, we burn half of the NxC received.  - A variety of assets: check out the latest mothership skins, avatars and chest available.  - True ownership: Your assets are yours. You decide when, where, and how to buy or sell a game asset.  - Come on the Black Market: Trade with other players, name your price and sell your assets. Buy assets that are no longer available in the Corporation shop. How does it work? If you have a Metamask account, just login and start trading! If you don't, create a shop/game account and a wallet with our built-in wallet feature. Then, buy assets and store them in your wallet as you wish.  - More free and premium content will be added on a regular basis thanks to the great work of the development team.   Introducing the Nexarium  The Nexarium is the ecosystem created by B2Expand to distribute products based on the same Ethereum blockchain technology.  Unique login  Your Nexarium account will be used to connect to all the Nexarium games and apps: Beyond the Void, the Store, other games that B2Expand will develop or publish etc  An ecosystem of games on Blockchain  As an indie studio, as artists, as gamers, we strongly feel that an ecosystem of games should have a consistency and an artistic direction to it. This is why we chose to develop and/or publish several games carefully chosen by ourselves. The new games should work well within the lore, the background, and the atmosphere of existing games like Beyond the Void.  We will announce new projects for 2018 along with the new BTV development roadmap released in January 2018.  Every new game published by B2Expand will use the same crypto-token, Nexium (NxC).  Having the games in the same Nexarium ecosystem will also allow cross-gaming of in-game items, meaning that the same item will be available in different games.  A more detailed post about the Nexarium will be published in January, in the meantime we wish you very happy Winter Holidays !  As usual, you can reach us on Discord, Facebook, and Twitter",False

ICO money was welcome though.Sad!) - team holds 50% of the total supply - no players (2 people playing this game currently) - no volume - no market maker - only one lousy shill (hi madcuck)  I wish bagholders good luck with this coin. I think one exit pump is possible before it gets delisted in ~6 months. I already marked this date for nexium on coincalendar and kryptocal. Even your cryptofriend Mougiyahar is losing his patience and downsizes the index weight. This should set off your alarms. So I don't see any reason to hold this coin longterm with this kind of behaviour and inactivity by the team etc.  This is my last post in this thread. I already sold a long time ago and made back the money I lost on this and even more with far better coins (nem, sc etc.) If you want to buy a game based coin then just buy GAME. They have a superior team/active community who actually take crypto seriously and notice when their currency falls and try to answer all crypto related issues with care and dedication instead of deflecting or doing nothing at all.

This mobile free-to-play massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) bases its economy on an open market and trading between players using a cryptocurrency token called LordCoin (LC).  Active Games is holding an LC ICO to fund Lordmancer II’s development. The current price is 2376 LC for 1 ETH. As the ICO has only a few days left, they are making a free airdrop of 15 000 LordCoins divided among the backers of Beyond the Void’s ICO. The amount of LC you receive will be proportional to your investment in BTV ICO.  LordCoins will be distributed to the wallet address you created on the Ethereum Blockchain for the Beyond the Void ICO. So, no action is required on your part. If you are interested in acquiring Lord Coins, be careful to use the same Ethereum wallet you used for the BTV ICO. This way you’ll be able to receive an additional 10% of purchased LC after the end of their ICO. This offer is valid for LordCoin purchases from today till December 19, 11am GMT.  As a backer in the Beyond the Void ICO, you understand the real value of a digital second-hand market for in-game assets and true ownership of digital assets.

In our vision, every game published by us is carefully tested by ourselves, and we chose each and every game we want to work with. We are not a platform for all the developers to publish their game, we have an artisitic direction in what we do. We know that players love lore, background in games, and the aim is to connect each game to the others through cross-gaming assets, and a shared marketplace.  So the result will be an ecosystem with less games, and more quality. It's not better or worse than Gamecredits, it's just a different way to see games Also, gamecredits, from what I saw, are little games, mostly on mobile, and while we'll probably do mobile games as well, we're more focused on the ecosystem story than game distribution platforms.

Sorry about that. I'm not ignoring any question, I'm trying to keep up with all the things I have to do.  So now the answer:  Yes, the plan is to create an ecosystem of games using the same token, Nexium (NxC) and the same economic features (items exchange directly from the store, cross-gaming assets etc). The token we created has (or will have when the awaited store comes out) real functionnalities within our system. We'll use it for every transaction made in the store.  While developing Beyond the Void we are also thinking about future games, either developed by us from scratch, or published by us and developed by indie studios that we think are good. We're not worried about the funds, what we have left of the ICO will last at the very least a couple of years.",False

So what will make you different from GAME(credits)?  I think part of this struggle for some is that it's not entirely clear the vision of the Nexium coin (or company). I was under the impression that the vision was to be the first game successfully using blockchain tech. But if its purpose is multistore currency under your brand, that brings up my previous question.  If that was clear to everyone, I think there might be a little less FUD or questions. If there was an answer that makes you different, we could properly understand the role BTV plays in that.  But if everything lives and dies on the game, I think it'll be hard to keep investors happy. They need a grand vision. A vision that is beyond just a game.  I'm one that can see beyond the void of a product (<- someone please tell me they laughed at that) if there is something bigger.  I'm a holder and will continue to hold. Because even if you aren't that different from GAME(credits) as a token, your token is highly undervalued. Although the price might actually reflect the product, at least you did deliver on a product.  I would still like to know what makes you (your token) different from GAME though.",False

They want to earn money through their shop (how they will do that with 6 active players atm is beyond me). So a low btc price is an advantage as it encourages more micro transactions with a stable ~ 20 cent price tag. If they really think that anyone would buy a lame ship for 100.000 NXC then they're extremely delusional lol.  Second thought: Devs are behind this massive manipulation and are slowly selling off private funds until they're ready for the big exit pump.    They themselves stated that they have no income right now. So why shouldn't they use one of these options to increase funds? Also in an older slack post their CEO said that ""from now on they only have NXC to spend"". Funds must be drying up as they sold a large chunk of it before the big crypto boom earlier this year. The lack of marketing efforts also indicate they're running out of cash.  Would you trust a team that acts in such a manner?  ",False

Statements made on slack on May 26th:  eburgel 1:19 PM  @spoorburger :  Why we won't retire now.  1) We had to sell half of the Ethers to sustain the developement effort.  2) We don't own directly the Ethers : the compagny we created for the project owns it.  3) The funders have only NxC to make money in the futur.  4) The NxC will never have value if the game isn't a success.  5) We really want to make a great game and be proud of it.   He admits that they already sold half ot the ETH they got from the ICO. That was before it mooned. So funds must be low right now.  The only option to increase funds is through selling/manipulating NXC.  Beyond the Void is currently played by 6 players according to Steam statistics. Judge for yourself if it is a success or not. NXC price definitely reflects that.  ,False

It explains well why we need to polish the game before we can do broad marketing, and the positive thing is that all the issues the author talks about are know issues, and we're already working to fix them.  Here is the link, and a TLDR:  https://mmohuts.com/news/beyond-the-void-early-access-preview/  ""As amazing as the framework is, the game is clearly still budding. Discerned from just a match or two, it’s pretty evident there are a few crucial updates to come.""  ""Similarly tough to tackle in the development cycle is the hurdle of getting players to stick around. Introducing someone to the game is easy. After all, the elevator pitch and pretty environmental graphics alone are notably worth the attention. But the more pressing issue is in convincing someone to come back again and again. Unfortunately, from my time with the game, each of my few-and-far between matches with another player came with a hefty thirty minute queue timer.  And it’s fairly easy to see why if taking my first hour is anything to go by. The lack of a proper tutorial and having a metric ton of information coming at you from all directions is enough make anyone dizzy.""  ""Furthermore, even when the in-depth mechanics are learned, matches don’t leave much of a lasting impression due to a distinct lack of excitement as a result of the gameplay. Take a big teamfight in League/Dota for example: they’re often accompanied with hard hitting sounds, dazzling visual effects, informative on-screen UI elements, and an epic announcer making the entire experience immensely exhilerating. I got none of that here. While I absolutely believe BtV will have its time in the spotlight – largely due to its innate marketability – I think some adrenaline pumping features embedded in the design is necessary for casual and competitive longevity. Of course, it’s in early access so it’s probably not high on the priority list, but it’s something that I feel is unmistakably missing when compared to the competition.""  ""Beyond the Void is an incredible foundation of something truly great in the works. Its well-executed concept showcases extensively thought out mechanics, eye-catching visual design, and the seamless blending of two distinct genres. I expect a lot from this game in the future, however, for now, most people may find it too early to get on board with. I myself will keep a close eye on this title as it gets closer and closer to carving out a sizable niche in the Twitch streaming and competitive eSports scene.""",False

Well - hucksters are the same, they only have fast profits on their minds.  Regarding our project now:  I took part in the Ru-Tournament last Sunday.

The game itself is addictive and does not tire, rounds lasting 7-15 minutes are comparable to a cup of coffee at breakfast. Rating in Steam, perhaps, reflects also my personal impression of the game for today.  I`d like to ask: 1) Is it possible to add to the game modes (or may be as separate game tied with BTV )with a global map of galaxies or star systems that can be attacked and defended by players, and this map can represent a variety of possessions of individual players, some of which will be pirates, some starry knights (took an example from your introductory cartoon )? 2) How about implementing a ""weather"" into the game - I mean -  meteor shower, black hole, white hole - these random events can increase or decrease players' resources. 3) Will you increase abilities of the Wall-K2, it seemed to me very weak and unbalanced. Maybe I just could not study it properly))",False

In the future, we'll rather make big updates with a lot of changes, this way we can do marketing around the update to convert new players, and as an incentive for existing players to come back and check the game.  The shop is actually ready, like I said earlier, but we can't release it yet because we are missing the login feature. I know it sounds really silly, but the biggest workload at B2Expand at the moment is to make an application that can connect to the game, to the shop, and generally speaking to all other games that we will develop/publish.

It was very interesting, I met an associate producer of one of their big prod, and he had amazing insights of how a video game studio is managing its production pipeline and workflow.  Anyway, I went through all the messages that were posted here since last Friday, and I can understand if you are confused. People have very strong and different opinions, that's the least we can say...  Nexium is and will be a speculative token until the shop with in-game items is out. That's not really what we want, but we have no choice in that matter. What we can do however is to continue developing the game until it is polished enough to have a good retention rate, and to develop the shop as fast as we can. The shop is not the only thing we have to develop as a matter of fact, we need assets to sell in it. That's another big subject at the moment, creating good in-game assets that will interest players, while still being reasonable in development time. Once we got that, then we can let ourselves go on the marketing campaigns, and reach to a maximum of players.  Beyond the Void has a 73% rating on Steam, which is good for a game in Early Access. And it is a truly Early Access, not a disguised soft launch. Meaning that of course it misses features, in-game content etc. We are aware of that, and the players feedback, both on discussion channels and directly from our datas, is really important for us to keep going in the right direction.  About pump&dump talks:  I really have a few things to say about this. The first one would be that we said from the beginning that we would not share personnal addresses. When you buy a coin, you have to read first, and do your own research. That's why I'm always referring to the rich list, because I know that the founders have a significant amount of NXC for some of them, and that it can be a cause of worry. The second thing is to remind you that we had pretty big backers during our ICO (one has even more NXC than the biggest holder in the company, true story....), and that everybody is entitled to do what they want with their coins. Some of the criticism here is that we don't do marketing towards traders, for people in blockchain to be aware of Nexium. It's true, we don't advertise the Nexium so much, and that's because we are not traders ourselves. We use the blockchain for the amazing possibilities it brings, and we believe that value is brought by good work and products, not speculation. However, we will scale up the marketing for players once we are reassured that the retention is good enough.  I answered the best I could without falling into the endless spiral of comments that was going on here this week end and on Monday. I hope it is satisfactory for you. Otherwise, let's keep a healthy discussion happening here, or you can talk with us more directly on our Slack/Discord.",False

If you look at nxc on 1day candles for the whole time since nxc added to the exchange, u can see nxc is probably gonna start another period of pumping, for the range of the next 1 or 2 months ahead (maybe even more). one of the most important things right now is that the volume won't decay back under 10btc, and that depends mostly on if new sell walls would be build and destroy the potential liquidity, and not enough people joined the last pump so if serious sell walls would be build before another pump, u can be sure it's devs who build them.

Meanwhile this is normal when price charts are going down, investors think maybe it is a sinking ship. Game will either be successfull or not and nexium coin depends on it so that is one of the weak points because if game fails whole project is done. One of down side is that project was aimed towards Steam platform and their response is that they do not support this project even if devs claim that they do. Steam has denclined nexium and market cannot be used from game but 3rd party website. I have expected that already because why would ""Gaben"" allow such a thing while Steam is earning from trading fees + they want to have everything under control if something shady happens Steam could not be blamed for. On the other hand devs should aim wide range on gaming platforms and wide circle of players.  From my point of view there has been some hype about project and release. Once game gets into final shape with market and nexium tokens being implemented then you can see if this game has a chance to grow.

But if you look at the Nexium rich list, you will see absolutely no tangible movement of token coming from the company addresses... And the four founders don't manipulate the market in any manner either (of course we did not share our private addresses, so you can take my word for it, or not). It is quite useless to argue about this and anyways, if we wanted the money for ourselves and not do anything we wouldn't be here more than a year after our ICO.  Our token is not just for one game, we want to build an ecosystem of games, some developed by us, some by others (so we'll be publishers too), using Nexium as game currency. But you are right, the token price is completely linked to the project's success, as it should be. By the way, we're also thinking about developing other games very soon.  About Steam: it is great news for us that Beyond the Void is published on Steam, because they hold 99.9% of the video game digital distribution market and being released there has a great impact on our reach. A lot of video games have their own third party shop, it is not unusual at all. And it's ok, we can't make it work until Steam accepts Ethereum tokens as payment (they already accept bitcoin, why not Ether ? It's a gamble on the future that we are willing to take, because even if they don't add this payment method, our shop still works anyway).  When we did our ICO, it was to put the token in circulation, and to raise funds to start the project. Is the goal to spend every cent until the ICO money is finished in order to deliver our first product ? Of course not. We are thinking in the long term. We are thinking of ways to make revenue, with our games, with our Ethereum shop, with our skills so the company can last and develop itself properly. We don't want to sit on a pile of crypto, develop our product and be done with it. We have a vision.",False

All the teams (dev, marketing, legal, finance, everybody) in B2Expand want it to be out and running. NXC price doesn't concern us too much, it's true, but liquidity is important and in that I agree with you. It will prevent us to be unlisted from exchanges, and a healthy token should be liquid. We hope to achieve that with the store. Reddit is not really used in Europe, but I know that it is a top website in the US, so we'll try to focus more on that.  We don't share reports about our finances and expenses because we are a private company, developing a product to generate revenue, and we don't feel the need to report to the community the details of our business. We are as straight forward as we think is good for everyone.  I have a question for you guys: as you well know the company kept 15 million NxC for promotion and bounties. We spent a few million already for the ICO promotion. Back then, we had partners that accepted tokens as a payment because they were in the blockchain space already. Now, we need video games marketing, but PR agencies, marketing agencies with reach in the gaming community mostly don't accept crypto as payment and if they do, it's Bitcoin, not Nexium.  So the question is: how do we spend money on marketing, while avoiding to dump NXC on the market ? We never dumped tokens, and that's not the goal. Of course, there is still the ETH from the ICO, but then we are limited in what we can spend for marketing. Because we more than doubled the team, we plan to hire more people still to be able to deliver the product we think the community deserves. For now, we're ok because the crypto market is good. But we can't forget the risk tied to the blockchain tech/market.  I don't expect that you have the perfect answer, but I'd like to have your opinion. Cheers",False

Should we do more marketing ? Yes. But at which cost ? We can't wait until the game is fully ""polished"" before making noise, in that we all agree. Otherwise, we'll have a great product with nobody knowing about it !  But on the other hand, the retention at the moment is really not good enough, and we think that even if this is an ongoing issue for all games, we can make it a lot better in little time. So why not wait a little bit longer and make our budget worth its spending ?  About the ETH question: yes the eth price went to the moon since we did our ICO. We had to spend a lot of them before the price went up though, so we don't have as much as if we spent nothing in December, January, February, March.... But still we have a nice decent budget to make this adventure happen. We need to prepare in case the market goes down though, we can't be careless and spend dozen thousands $ in marketing, especially since we have the NXC from the ICO dedicated to promotion and bounties.  So what we decided for now is that we wait until devs implement at least game points and ranked games, and in the meanwhile we do small tutos in the new lobby page that is upcoming. While we do that, Camille, who is working full time for B2Expand and has a degree in marketing, and myself (Manon, cofounder), will plan a marketing strategy for December, January, February. We will ask Ubisoft to help us on that matter too, I'm sure they have great advices for us. By the way, I also requested the help of a data analyst from their team to help us understand and implement the right things at the right moment.

Reasonable selling at some precise times is an option. But yes, we would like to spend as much as we can without selling them. Actually, when we work with another company (last tournament for instance, video editing, musics etc), we always ask to pay with NxC and I'd say that it works most of the time. We didn't work with very big agencies yet though, so we shall see what they will accept or not. We're already working with a press agency accepting Bitcoin.  Game points, or battle points as we will call them, will be used to unlock in-game content. This content will be different than content from the shop though. You won't be able to unlock the same content with battle points than you could by purchasing with NxC.  Game points and ranked games are being tested today as a matter of fact. So if everything is good, we could implement this pretty soon, maybe next week.",False

Too many people will take a look, leave and never come back IMHO at the current state.  Is it already possible to gain in game points? If not you should wait at least until this is implemented before going big with marketing.     Agreed.  From an investment stand point it's better to have and keep players, then it is to make some noise, for the sake of making noise.      I don't think you understand. It's an early release and even with a finished product ""polishing"" will be needed in form of patches, updates etc. should we wait until every single fix has been implemented until marketing starts? how do you even define the term ""marketing""? It's an ongoing progress which at the moment is toned down. It's not ""making noise for the sake of making noise"". Advertisement and other efforts are very much needed now for the sake of the whole game experience because players are waiting 30-45 minutes to play a single game! And that (player numbers) my friend is not a thing which can be fixed solely by ""polishing"" Have a look at this for orientation: http://steamcharts.com/search/?q=beyond+the+void  Update: I waited 21 minutes this session.  I fully understand, i played the game and i know i would not comeback. I will only check the game again regular cause of my crypto addiction.

More than 6000 accounts were created, most of them after downloading the game on Steam. We effectively reach to players, and we can now speed up the game improvements based on the data we gathered from them. Amongst those account creations, 25% are created in the USA, 7% in France, 7% in Russia, 6% in China. With downloads in more than 63 countries in the world. Our international community is growing! The gaming events we organized (Great Nexium War, Early Access launch at the Meltdown gaming bar, etc.) are effective: They attract players, and there is a good correlation between the number of downloads and simultaneous players online. At the moment, only a quarter of players are coming back to the game more than once.   These numbers show that B2Expand succeeds in converting new players worldwide to Beyond the Void, with the major part of our community in the USA. However, too few are staying in the game at the moment, and that we don’t have enough players to lower the queue time significantly.  To optimize marketing costs, we need to improve our retention rate before starting large marketing campaigns.   Conclusion and next steps:  Making short tutorials available from the tutorial tab in the lobby. We will also make an in-game tutorial, but as it will take more time to develop, GIFs and bullet points are a good start. This work will help players to understand the basics of the game in a snap. Add in-game content to improve player engagement such as ranked games, game points, items to unlock, etc. Increase our conversion efforts to lessen the queue time and get data for further improvements in the game.  Beyond the Void is in Early Access and not fully developed at the moment. We are missing content and gameplay depth. Therefore, our efforts towards conversion should aim at an engaged community of players ready to follow the project and help us improve the game.   See you in December for the next stats update! In the meantime, follow our progression on Twitter and Facebook, and reach us easily on Slack (blockchain oriented) or Discord (game oriented).",False

We are just saying that marketing should adapt to development. At this stage, features for broad adoption are missing, however, it is a great project for players who like getting involved early in games, and help with their feedback. Reddit is used in the US, but in France nobody knows about it. Medias are different in some countries. We should do more reddit, though, but we shouldn't make assessments on how well the community is responding looking at one media channel.  We're not publishing reports on the funds we have left from the ICO or otherwise. We said we would share information about the game stats though, and we did. You know now where we are standing, development wise, and marketing wise. The features we are talking about, improving retention, are scheduled to be released soon, so it makes sense to adapt the marketing for the time being.  About NxC price: it is our concern that we deliver the product we said we would develop, and that everything is working fine. We are an indie studio, and it makes sense for us to do marketing towards our players. NXC market belongs to NXC holders. The whole plan is to make a great game, have players, and then the Nexium can have more use and liquidity.  That takes us to the shop development, which is a real question. What we can say right now is that the shop is developed and functional. But it is not enough. We need some additional features before it can be released, and some content too which takes time to develop as well. It should be released by the end of the year, but it is really difficult to estimate the time it will take considering that very few people in the world developed on the same technology (I don't know a running decentralized shop for in-game blockchain assets on Ethereum right now, if some of you do, please drop the link in the thread).

It's just very quiet on most of your social media channels and not many outlets or people talk about this project yet. So attracting new players who might get deeper involved proves to be difficult without the publicity. Fair in France Reddit might not be used that much but it's still important especially with all crypto fans worldwide going there second after going to the homepage/twitter or BCT thread. It should be more on focus especially regarding your international community.  The price and volume should be a concern. Low volume coins and tokens get delisted fast and the NXC market although it has massive potential is unfortunately very illiquid. THere have been projects before with dedicated developers, ongoing development and a great community who got shut out of Poloniex just because of low volume. Although it's sketchy and never explained it's their business practice. Don't take a listing on this exchange for granted. You put effort in it (and probably paid a lot of BTC to be lsited) so please don't pretend that the token price development is not a concern for you. When you talk of backers you talk about investors too. I don't mean to anger you it just has to be said.  The fact that you don't report about expenses or remaining funds is unfortunate but I guess we have to accept it. A lot of crypto start ups (Lisk, AMP etc) do it to show their transparency towards their community in real figures. So it's not uncommon and streghtens the bond between all parties.  I get the impession that you were getting annoyed by the questions about the store. Don't be. Again nobody except for obvious fudsters wants to offend you. The store is just the only news we can grip until a new roadmap has emerged. And let's not pretend the price won't be affected by it. Not every investor is a gamer and not every gamer is an investor.

We sell them once, and after that people will trade them themselves in the exchange part of the shop. Event cards: we implemented some for the open beta last June, but we noticed that it was not working very well in terms of gameplay, so people wouldn't have much incentive to buy them. This is why we are re-thinking them at the moment. There will still be cards for the game sold in the shop. We are just redesigning them in term of gameplay.  In the shop the prices will be fixed.  Nexium price won’t change instantly after we fixed an asset price, so there is time before the price moves too much. If the Nexium price increase over time, the price won’t move as it is fixed. The assets all belongs a specific limited edition. We might sell another asset in the future with the same effects, and for a different price. This system will work because we only sell cosmetics in the shop. It doesn’t prevent players to have the real game experience, even if they can’t afford a specific skin or holotag. If players want to unlock a specific mothership, they can do it by buying a skin for the mothership. But they can either buy an expensive skin, or a cheap skin.  We can't control the volatility of the price.

From what we know we will be the first game with a crypto economy to be published there, and we are proud to be one of the pioneers company in this industry. We hope that other great Blockchain and gaming projects will emerge in the future.  We’ve seen a growing interest for the project these past months, and Ubisoft’s decision to include B2Expand in their Startup program at Station F, Paris, confirms it.  “When we discovered B2Expand was one of the first in the gaming industry to complete a successful ICO, we were eager to meet them to understand what they would do with the blockchain technology. We were also surprised to see what a great vision of the future of their company the Fab Four (Manon, Eric, Rémi and Maxence) were foreseeing. We think BTV could be the beginning of something big in the gaming industry.” Nicolas Pouard, Research Director at Ubisoft Innovation Lab  NOW, you are wondering, what are we going to do ?  Here are the next steps we need to take:  Publish our game store  While a beta version is online already, we’re aware that it doesn’t contain all the features and designs that are necessary to bring gamers attention.  This is why we are completely reworking it at the moment, including new features and great designs !  This shop rework will also include the implementation of backer’s blockchain in-game assets in the game, and the release of new game items for all players to purchase and exchange.  We’re close to release it, but we are not able to share a date with you yet. However, we will update our community on our progress regularly.  Add content and in-game depth to Beyond the Void  We already had great feedbacks from the community, and from Ubisoft on the game itself. We are working to improve the User Interface, and to add in-game content. Now that the core gameplay is stable we can develop new motherships, rework the skills, and generally speaking make Beyond the Void even more fun and addictive   Maxence’s patch notes are full of great info about the latest improvements, implementations and fixes. You can find them here  Reach out to players  Players need to be aware of Beyond the Void project! This is why we are planning to:  Relay on streamers known in the gaming community to put the word out about us Organize online tournaments, with prizes, focused on different regions of the world Organize live tournaments and events in Lyon, France, to stir up the local community Reach out to gaming press Set up social medias campaigns    Next events:  October 28th: Online 16 players tournament, global but focused on the US community  October 31st – November 2nd: Participation to the Blockchain & Gaming panel discussion in the Future games Summit, London, UK  November: French streamers will discover and share Beyond The Void game with their community during the whole month.     We plan to share with our community information about number of players and other statistics at the beginning of each month, starting in November.

At the moment $NXC is oversold. That's a fact. Another fact is that you delayed the early access in june to streamline the process with your planned steam release. And now nobody knows when or if it will be released. People that buy shitcoins don't necessarily believe in it but just want to profit or catch a wave. That's why a lot of investors in your thread are pissed while the believers are shouting ""good price to buy now"" or ""to the moon"". Whether you sold fractions of your own coins or not ( I believe so though your team would never admit it.) I'm sure you knew beforehand that the Steam release would be delayed but didn't say anything to let $NXC pump near the end of September. You sold off the rise after that. I used to believe in your project but after my observations (market movements, late announced delays, failed steam release date, no news articles since may, no transparency, rare updates on your blog) I just hope to let people know about the risks they're taking when investing in your token.

The steam store page is online, they are reviewing our build at the moment. Our business model for this game is cosmetic assets sold in our store. The model is similar to League of Legends, although we are not on the same scale speaking about number of players and popularity. Esports and competitive games market is growing, but again, we're not commenting on investments. We wouldn't dare to deliver a statement about market growth.  About our store: it is based on an Ethereum smart contract, burning half of the Nexium we receive when we sell a newly created item.

About Steam:  When we submitted the store page for review for the first time, they sent it back and we had to make some modifications on the page to comply to Steam terms of use. Now our Steam store page is online    We also sent Beyond the Void's build for review, and it also came back for compliance reasons so we won't be ready on Steam tomorrow. It should be soon, but we don't want to publish a date and postpone it again should it take longer. Thing is, the store page needs a release date for the build.... So we'll put it farther away and hope that the game will be released on Steam sooner.  On a (very) positive note, Steam is aware that we have a third party shop and they are allowing it, we just have to remove the Store link from the game's lobby. This is because they don't want Steam users to go directly on a third party shop from their app. Players will have to come from a web page to access the store, and we have no doubt that they will find it should the game be successful.",False

Not every game wants to make all its transactions on Steam, for various reasons. We are not the only ones, by far. We have other ways to advertise our shop than our website. Players are used to free-to-play with shops. Nothing new here.  All the transactions will be made in NXC in our store, that's the point. Beyond the Void items won't be sold elsewhere. Items won't be sold on Steam until they implement ERC-20 tokens as a payment method (on a side note, if we ever decide to do that, we would just burn the corresponding amount of NxC. But that's not the plan for now).  If Steam didn't accept third party shops, we wouldn't be on Steam. We would have to distribute the game somewhere else.  A reminder of what we do:  - we enable a second-hand market for players using our store based on the Ethereum blockchain - we burn half of the NXC we receive every time we sell a newly created item in the ""corporation market"", which is the official BTV market (this is a smart contract on Ethereum) - we plan to enable NXC purchase for fiat currency in partnership with a third party company, or several. We are working on this at the moment and can't share news about it yet.  About the steam store page: we HAVE to put a date, that's by design on the page, we can't publish it without it.

A lot of players won't come and post on Bitcointalk, it is not their channel of expression. https://discordapp.com/invite/C7TqmaQ  We've had great feedbacks on the last gaming events. Yesterday in Geneva, a kid even came back 7 times to play. He was not the only one, players said the game was good, and came afterwards to our Discord to keep track of the Early Access release. On Friday night, at the Arcaneum (a gaming bar in Lyon, France), we've had good feedbacks too. Sure, the game needs polishing, the balance is not perfect yet and we miss some content. It's all planned to be added and balanced in the coming months. We listen to player's feedback, and the game designers/devs implement the changes we need to improve the game experience. Even before the EA, we hosted playtest in our offices in Lyon every week on Wednesday evenings.  Bottom line is, we care about producing a quality game. On a side note, players liked the designs very much, so we're not worried about that. Maxence is a great concept artist, you can see his work here: http://www.maxence-burgel.com/",False

They can exchange them within our shop without any additional fees from us (except the usual blockchain transaction fee), but also also outside BTV context as our assets are Ethereum ERC-20 compatible. Our shop is working with an Ethereum smart contract, and all the transactions are completely decentralized.  The second one is to create cross-gaming assets. As these game items are blockchain assets, so public & open source, anybody can choose to implement a corresponding functionality in their game or app. Of course, we try to develop partnerships with other indiegames to make it happen (we already have a partnership with Spells of Genesis, a counterparty based trading card game). We also plan to develop other games with the same background and to make a whole ecosystem of games using the same game assets, all exchangeable with our Nexium tokens.  So not only a player will be able to use his purchase in several games, but he will also be able to sell it back on the market.",False

However, given the following favorable conditions, we’ve decided to move Early Access to September 2017:  Because Beyond the Void was Greenlighted for release on Valve Steam, we are implementing additional Steam components in our game. For efficiency, we need to promote and launch the Steam and Early Access releases at the same time (instead of duplicating the effort for two separate events). With the rise of Ethereum’s value, we’ve increased the scope of Beyond the Void’s software development and community aspects. To fulfill these expanded goals, we’ve hired three people and need the additional time to bring those efforts to fruition. We recently joined the Lyon Game Lab, a video game studio incubator, gaining an incredibly talented and experienced group of mentors. As a team, we need more time to learn and apply the lessons they’ve shared with us.   We’re reworking our Marketing and Communication strategy to engage a maximum of players and create a growing community of Beyond the Void! In consequence, the beta will be closed between mid-july and the Early Access in order to organise private tests to polish our game.  Our team is always available to answer your questions.",False

Now, there will be three control points around each planet. To conquer a planet, players must conquer each point by staying on it for 3 seconds. The control points form a triangle that always points toward the sun. Entering a disputed zone interrupts the opponent from conquering a control point. If the opponent leaves the control point before they are done a, their charge from the control point diminishes slowly until it reaches 0. If you stand on a control point that was partly conquered by the opponent, you have to discharge the point before conquering it. If the planet already belongs to a player, it attacks the opponent when the opponent tries to conquer the control points. Conquering a planet destroys its rings.   Aside from shooting at nearby enemies, Planets can have skills that derive from the rings you’ve built around it.  Military ring: Fires on the enemy’s ships, causing zone damage. A warning circle appears before it fires so you have time to dodge.

Thanks everyone for all your support, here are some news:  We were added on Bittrex as you may know already    We have a new trailer:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKOnLI7AmY0  Another one is on its way, no ETA at the moment.  Here are development news from Maxence:  Version 0.1.5  New Content  We’ve added an advisor to help you understand the game. This is an early version. We’ll improve it along the way and will probably add a voice to it for the release. We completely reworked the AI. It has three levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal and Hard We’ve added Fusion, a new mothership. Animations for fusion will come with the next patch. When a player is casting some skills, you’ll see a casting bar over a mothership. When you die, you can buy back your mothership for 300 cubes.  Fixes & Changes  In this version:  The mothership bonus camp displays a visual effect on the mothership. The base research time has been reduced from 180 seconds to 120 seconds. The cost of research has been reduced from 300 cubes to 200 cubes. A minefield takes 2 seconds to cast. Mines last for 120 seconds. The game remembers the last mothership you were playing. The respawn time has been increased. The healing rate of the “Repairer” has been decreased from 50 to 10 hulls per second. On the minimap, your move/camera orders snap to big objects like planets, motherships, camps. This should make it easier to use. By default, the local map (top right) is less zoomed in so you can see a planet when you are on the edge of its territory. The AI of pirates from the “Space Pirates” card has been improved. Fixed some minor issues with creeps. You can click a planet “portrait” to move the camera to it. A damage marker has been added to the planet panel. Cubes are now displayed under your name (middle top). The “mouse over” ship & other entities should work properly now. The cursor turns red when you can attack a target or use a skill. The game shouldn’t disconnect a match any more. Fixed crashes & fancy bugs here and there.  Version: 0.1.4  Fixes and Changes  Now, by default, planets spawn 3 harvesters and 1 fighter, while the mother planet spawns 5 fighters. Harvesters gather a lot fewer cubes now. (The previous rate of harvesting was ridiculously high.) The “Space Pirates” and “Techno Singularity” events are working. The creeps damage and health has been reworked as well as their AI. The warp should work properly in every situation, and the “Warp loading” bug has been resolved. The bug that was preventing players from building rings on conquered planets has been resolved. Fixed several crashes on the servers.  New Content  A message has been added when a card is activated. Added the Mad rockets skill. Added the Gas Giant event card.  We are getting ready and polishing the last details for the Open Beta on Wednesday next week (May 3rd)  We created a wiki: https://beyond-the-void.net/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page It should be available in Russian too very soon.",False

Well, what do we see now after a half of a year from ico? As for me – I look at this young game team and feel a joy ( and i`m a bit envy in a kind way), they keep going to the target, gradually gaining the confidence of the community. I remember evil suspicious comments and scammy cryings. Well, look around! You see billion Ico`s, greedy faces of mature `developers`, promises of new (or meganew) tech - and people keep bringing money to their projects. What do we see here? We see small team trying to combine blockchain technology and a game. It`s hard work even for large company. But I see right steps – team selected good Ethereum blockchain technology for token part of idea, they selected nice space subject for gaming part. They are working bees in this crypto-world. They are trying to introduce crypto in our real world. That’s great. They need to work here, there and everywhere to catch promised milestones. Just give them a chance, forgive some delays. Look at Eric, Manon, Remi, Maxence – they have to develop a game, but they`are flying around all these exhibitions trying to present project. In the same time they answer our questions, even stupid questions. They gave us some bounties. And look at us! How did we do our job? We showed our greed! We devided blog posts into four parts to earn more tokens, we posted short stupid articles just to reach the required limit of 300 letters. We exploded Manon`s brain – she had to read all this stuff. And she did it! Only few guys honestly made good reviews based on real game experience. I think we need to support this project by real deeds – we can make promo videos, translations, good reviews. Don`t look from the side – take part! Awake and understand - Beyond The Void team are real people making real game in a real world without help of `mighty uncle` - large game corporation. They did a lot and still on track. Good luck guys. Forgive me my `international english` emotions! :-)",False

To clarify, because web-based games don’t sell shrink-wrapped software, a release is a Marketing event, not a Development or Logistics event.

We’ll be participating the whole Insomnia gaming festival in April, and also at the Norwich Game Festival in May. These are two big gaming events in Europe, and a great way for Beyond the Void to reach out to new players.

During this phase, the game will be feature-complete and accessible full-time to players, as planned, but not formally released.

Here’s are some updates about our development schedule. We are pushing back the second and third milestones by one month.  The adjusted schedule is:  2nd milestone: May 3rd 3rd milestone: June 28th  Why? Our development schedule slipped by almost 3 weeks in January causing us to reschedule the first milestone, and we haven’t caught up since then. Considering the number of events the whole team is involved with in April, we are rescheduling the second milestone to avoid any timing issues. To reflect this, we’ve adjusted our schedule by +1 month.  Early Access  We’re changing the name of the third milestone to Early Access. During this phase, the game will be feature-complete and accessible full-time to players, as planned, but not formally released. During Early Access, we will respond to actual demand by gradually scaling up the sizes and locations of our game servers. This will make the game available and responsive to the growing player-base. Every bullet point on the Milestone will still be met.  Adjusted Marketing Schedule  To participate in more events, we’ve adjusted the formal release date from June 6th to September 6th. To clarify, because web-based games don’t sell shrink-wrapped software, a release is a Marketing event, not a Development or Logistics event. For both developers and players, who continue playing the game before and after “release,” the concept of “release” doesn’t have much impact. We’ll be participating the whole Insomnia gaming festival in April, and also at the Norwich Game Festival in May. These are two big gaming events in Europe, and a great way for Beyond the Void to reach out to new players. We will also have a stand at the Japan Touch Haru/Geek Touch Festival in Lyon, in April and we are planning to participate in the  Gamescom 2017 in Cologne on the 23rd of August.  Here’s our current Marketing schedule:  April 6th: Exhibition booth at Blockshow, Munich (Germany) April 7-8th: Exhibition booth and conference talks at CoinFest, Manchester (UK) April 9th: Indie Game contest and exhibition stand at Evry Games City (France) April 14-17th: Exhibition booth at Insomnia gaming festival, Birmingham (UK) April 22-23rd: Exhibition booth at Japan Touch Haru/Geek Touch Festival in Lyon (France) Mai 31-2nd: Exhibition booth at Norwich Game Festival, Norwich (UK) July 15-16th: First Beyond the Void tournament, details coming  soon August 23-26th: Gamescom 2017 in Cologne (Germany)  More events will be scheduled soon.",False

NXC has not big capitalisation - 4 million cap is good for moving. It is more simplier to move on 4m to 8-10, than top volume project. In 1.5 month it will be open beta. Big news i think. And in 3 month it will be release. After it BTV can be added to STEAM.(it will be added, more worse games were added, so BTV will be there, i am sure). this is my opinion. and again, remember - FUDers and trolls, that just make panic here, do not want to ""help you"" with their advices.

And even more thanks to the person who has been dumping a few million into Nexium. I am writing this post to respond to the person who is attempting to trash Nexium because he isn't getting the return he wished for quickly. Let's think about this,... Now I am not a huge investor, I am new to the BitCoin market, I really don't know to much about how this all works; however, I am learning quickly. The Game comes out in June, so why would anyone think that there investment will have maximum potential before the release? Just a no brainer in my opinion.      So,Mr. Nexium who has dumped milions, I have been watching you since you came back in early January, very closely actually. I know when you are active, I know when you sleep, and I know when is the best time for you to pump NXC. I have been watching your patterns so close that when I have told my friends about your next move, and they made money. In return, these friends, who are a friend of a friend, lol, have decided to help me out because I made them money. They know I am a poor white man from Washington State, U.S., and they have decided to get together and help pump NXC to where it should be. I wish I could say when, but I don't know. All I know is that I bought 10,000 NXC literally right before you pumped NXC over $0.02 a share, I bought in at $0.019, and I appreciate everything you have done. Yes, I am making out pretty good with my pennies. I know you have been working long hours to build the Nexium shares, and I Thank You.      To the non-gamers out there. And I am kinda one of those non-gamers myself, although I have been involved with EverQuest for over 15 years now. In EQ, since the beginning, Gamers have been trying to make actual money playing the game, by selling items they have looted, or with the in game money Platinum. It is against the rules in EQ, and many other mmo games to trade, buy, or sell anything outside the game for money. What people don't realize, is that there is a huge demand to make money playing a video game. Millions of  people wish such a thing existed, and Beyond the Void is providing that option. Not to mention, that what I see in this game, is what Star Wars should have been when it came out a few years ago. You have created a ""Brilliant"" platform for doing so, and I think the BtV is something that people are waiting for.      To wrap this up, Mr. Nexium has at least 2.5 million to play with NXC, and the sooner, not later, would be a great time to invest. March will be good news, and will start to shine the light on the subject. So, don't listen to a person who only has money on his mind, listen to people who actually have an idea what the impact of this game will have. I have no experience in BitCoin trading compared to the whales, but I have a lot of experience with these types of games, and my experience says Beyond the Void nailed it. Good Job!",False

If everything you wrote is factual, just know that you are putting yourself in a precarious position. You have to hope that ""Mr. Nexium"" is a supporter of the project and not just an opportunist. (Maybe I'm jaded, but I tend to think he's the latter.)  If you think that he's just buying and holding indefinitely, you aren't thinking about his personal endgame. He either wants a ton of in-game currency, or he wants to turn a profit. Most whales in this space don't like to take a long time to cash in, too.  All of that said, just buy and hold NXC because you like gaming and you want more developers to consider true ownership and blockchains as they develop their game.

Your negative response has no bearing on my money. I will not feed into that nonsense. And to be honest, I really had no intentions of playing Beyond the Void, but I think I will just to have fun. After all, fun is the name of Mr. Nexiums game. As for his investments, don't you think he would be a fool to not invest in his own creation? It's called protecting your interest. If he has millions already, how much do you think he cares about what the NXC shares are worth? It's a game! Just like trading Coins, it's a game, you win some, and you loose some.

Does that make the weed taste better? or does the weed help Bitcoin? Yeah, you invest in a game, it's the game that you have money into, not so much the BitCoin market, but an individual item. There is no need to be negative, or put any person or coin down because NXC isn't a money maker for whales. Whales are dealing with BitCoin, Ethereum, and so on, those Coins are for the technology itself, and they are getting paid because they know what they are doing. They are not buying into anything and everything wishing that it all pays off well. The people who are doing that are scavengers, bottom feeders, who are taking advantage of everything they can. And then get upset because they didn't really think about what they were getting into, it just sounded good at the time, right?

It cracks me up how you act like your word have meaning or value, and others don't. Here you are responding to me, stating that you don't respond to people like me, but yet you continue to insult me. Here is an insult for you. As you are doing what you say you don't do, you are criticizing yourself, frankly ruining the credibility of your own words. So, why would anyone care about your opinion? As you post a silly cartoon that you most likely got from Facebook. If I had to guess, you are the kind of person that post crap on FB all day believing that they have some powerful knowledge that the whole world needs to hear. I have been positive, you are negative, your opinion has no value as you respond to me simply because you claim not to feed into this sort of conversation, as you are doing it. You have only contradicted yourself. Sounds like a kid to me, a person with so little experience in life trying to sound like an adult. Truth is, I am laughing at you right now because you are taking this so serious! I came here to show Thanks, what is your statement, or goal to your comments? Telling me what people don't do is pointless. I rather be positive, maybe mention something that people do, or should do to better themselves is worth listening to because it has a positive message with value, some sort of actual meaning. The difference between you and I are simple, you would say people don't cross the road with their eyes closed, that doesn't help one bit. I would say, look both ways before you cross the road. Point being, your words do not help one bit. Keep on dreaming. Thank You Mr. Nexium.",False

There is a pretty toxic aspect to this community being full of amateur wanna-be traders. Keep in mind that the most useful currencies in history have generally been stable and inflationary; basically the worst kind of asset to speculate on. With notable exceptions, such as BTC, usefulness and profitability have most likely been negatively correlated.  My greatest hope for NXC is that it becomes a useful way for people to exchange value across gaming platforms, not that it becomes the next big ""win"" for non-gamer speculators.

However, you are right when you say players won't buy ETH + NXC. Average players are not aware of crypto, so we need to work on this and propose a easy and user friendly way to purchase assets. We are looking at the moment for partnerships in order to achieve this.  Why did we create NXC: because we wanted to create a token specifically for a blockchain & gaming ecosystem. And because we don't want the price of the token we use to depend on announcement in ETH community. We want the Nexium value to depend on the quality of the products.  It is still early in this project, lots of things have to be achieved, we are aware of this.

That's when you know what your next move should be. With the BTC rise of 6%+ over the past week, other altcoin pumps ( and dumps) NXC has actually been going up strong for the past 2 weeks. the ups and downs are for people buying and priming for a pump. Pretty obvious. Be it in 2 days or after the beta, either way it'll be here as expected.  The daily ups and downs are for the little profiting between people. Again, nothing new. IF someone is worried about the short-term price, just sell outright and find a less stressful past-time .  We could have another fun ride like what happened with PASC a few weeks ago coming. (Went 50x+ vs 3 or 4 months ago.)    And remember, NOBODY will tell you to sell a stock/crypo from the goodness of their hearts. Most of all not on this forum. People who are cheer leading a stock/crypo are the same way. Do you own serious DD, look at the charts, buys vs sells, buy and sell walls and you can figure out what might be comping up.  Heck, also I know I have been stuck bagholding an alt that crashed for months only to find it got pumped and actually made money in the long term.

Who want to buy cheap - do it, but not push price. Then, u wrote here with an optimistic message. This message should give hope to people, and people should buy nxc after it. And who will sold them? simple question, i think. Guys, do not forget the main rule - when somebody make profit - others have loss. So man, who is making profit will never tell u about his true plans. For me everything is clear - after wall appearing i sold the half of my coins.

They're really buttoned up. I like that they have a solid road map, with a lot of avenues for promotion. The fact that they're making the game a free download is a really smart, and well thought out part of a plan to make the game a lot easier to market.  It's also great that the team is european, the competitive gaming front for RTS is really strong in Europe, non competitive as well. One of the best Starcraft (another RTS game) players, Stephano was French/Tunisian, so france itself has an affinity for these style of games. I think that growth for BTV seems incredibly natural in the european market.  Europe is largely responsible for the growth of esports into a world market. You look at the way professional european soccer clubs are buying up esports teams, and the success of teams like fnatic, maybe the most popular esports team in the world based out of the EU, and you can see why its really advantageous for BTV to be in france.  It's being said that by 2019, the e-sports industry will be worth over $1.2 billion and viewership will have increased to around 303 million. That's insane growth from what it was just 5 years ago....  I also think that european pro gamers might be more open to embracing a competitive game started, and based out of France.  And thats not to say there wont be a push here in the states too, I know i'll certainly be playing and trying to promote the game, along with a lot of others here, but it just ads another wrinkle that the team can tap the EU a lot easier than if this game was based out of the US, and that they're multilingual. It all helps during promotion.",False

It would be interesting to see the revenue of each one of them and then see for how much they sold for those that sold.  I would bet that for some of those, sale prices relate less to revenue than to data obtained and network effect. Compared to blockchain based games, how much games such as BtV the company or EDS sell won't matter to any of us as asset holders.  How much revenue BtV is making doesn't affect us either.  Only network effect matters to drive the price of our assets up in addition to assets' specification and cross game acceptance.

I have found that slack, though a great tool, can also be problematic for coins looking for new investors.  Why is that?  Here is my theory.... Every coin has a slack now, it's a great way to build a community, but I think it's tough to get brand new investors to join a slack even tough its just a click away. I think BTC talk is still the best tool for people to make an impulse investment on a coin (which there is a lot of in crypto). When I'm on polo, and I see a nice chart... I want to do some basic reading, see the specs of coin, and get coverage on any new news/hype. You can do it on slack, but i feel like i'm always scrolling through pages of conversation to get to the legitimate info. I'd also say a lot of investors in crypto are lurking, they don't even want to be known, they want quick info, and boom, they want to decide if they're trading or not. Polo pumps are so quick currently, a lot of investors are in and out, so it's important to have some good stuff here to get those impulse buys.   I'm probably going to hold almost all of my NXC for the next couple months as the beta gets ready to drop, so slack is a good option for me, but for other coins that i'm trading day to day or even hour to hour... I don't want to join every slack for every coin i'm getting in on. Like pascal. I wouldn't waste my time joining the pascal slack... but I was on the btc talk page the instant it started pumping.  Even though this site is still trashy, and its not as convenient to have a large group discussion...I still like coming here and saying my piece, because this is where the investors come first, and in crypto that first impression means a lot.",False

For now, BTV is like the free MOBAs out there mixed with with an RTS... there are no advantageous upgrades, It's essentially skins like counterstrike or overwatch, which have been extremely profitable for those games .Thats different from clash of clans and all the other In game purchase app games.   I think it's a great choice for the first version, because it will attract a lot more longterm user. If I can play a full version of a game for free, that's much more exciting than having to pay to compete like you do in clash of clans  My theory though... is that if the game is successful, you probably will see a spin off game, or a campaign mode... where the devs take advantage of the popularity and create a game with ingame purchases, and a full backstory for the game, because that could generate an enormous amount of money... and i'm sure the  dev team understands that.",False

But it is not.  Money can be divided into two categories: IOU (currencies) or assets (gold).   If Nexium was an IOU (which it is not) then I could take your example and rephrase by leaving the dollar out as it only adds complexity:  “if you assume the game is worth 1000 units represented by 1000 nexiums.  Now you add a mothership worth 10 units or 10 nexiums.  The value of the game is now 1010 units, but the number of total nexiums not only remains at 1000 but decrease by 5 through burn, then you end up with 995 nexiums to represent a game worth 1010 units.  Since the game value increased 1% and the IOU (nexiums) did not reflect the increase of 1%, but decreased half a percent, you end up with a deflation rate of 1.5%”.  This is how it works with national currencies except that the central banks usually create more money than the increase in GDP.  But since Nexium is not an IOU, it can only be an asset.  Being an asset it can only be part of the game, and not being a reflection of the game just as gold is part of a country's assets among many other assets and their qualities, and not a reflection of its economy.  All things considered, Nexium can be considered like any other cards of the game without its qualities.  But BtV could just as well create a card with all its qualities including for the purpose of trade. Lets say that the Satoshi cards with all its qualities was actually the asset of choice to trade all other assets (cards) of the game.  Then it could be used as a card within the game as well as money within exchanges.  it is not because you put a nice piece of art on an asset that all of sudden it cannot be used as money.  So we certainly could conclude that Nexium is a “card” without its qualities and its piece of art.  To understand the above logic, you need to not only make the difference between IOU money and asset based money, but you also need to differentiate between Value (qualitative) and price (quantitative).  In my own opinion, price never meets value and this is disputable.  But the reason I believe that, is because too many outside factors (speculation) distorts price which makes it impossible for price to reflect value.  In the example of Bitcoin, people say the value of bitcoin is volatile.  But what they mean is the price is volatile.  The actual value of bitcoin has been constant and up.  Value of bitcoin being based on degree of decentralization, network effect, and security (hash rate).  I also like to add that I agree with those posts (mostly from fudders) that Nexium is totally useless for the game as XCP could have been used on the counterparty exchanges (in this case ether on the Ethereum exchanges).  To raise money for ICO, the exchange of Bitcoins and ranks with all its goodies could have been made directly.  Or BtV could have used nexiums temporarily and then have it burned after final exchange with rank title allong with all the goodies.  Actually I would go as far as to say that adding another altcoin to a game is a distraction away from the game and hurts the price of newly created assets as most traders (especially the fudders here) only focus on the nexium price without any regard of the game asset (goodies) price or the game itself.",False

They're are no Real Time Strategy (RTS) games that are free to play, and have a chance to gain a marketshare of the competitive gaming market.  It's important to understand some history surrounding competitive or professional gaming...  Originally RTS games dominated the market. Star Craft (an RTS) was incredibly popular in Korea, to the extent that it the best players became national celebrities similar to sports heros in the US, the game was also quite popular in france, and seems to of left an impression on the Dev team.  but anyway Starcraft one was released in the late 90s. It blows up, everybody adores the game. Everyone thinks RTS games are the future of competitive because of how much fun they are to watch compared to other games. There is an awesome amount of build and suspense in my opinion compared to other games...  RTS games have a problem. Theyre expensive to produce or at least for something as intricate as the starcraft gaming series. It takes a lot of time as well. Star craft 2 was released 15 years after the first star craft. That's a serious problem. It's also an expensive game to buy. Over 60 USD when it first came out.  There was a ton of hype in the gaming community for the release, but it turned out to be a bit of a letdown. Why? Because while star craft 2 was taking a decade and a half to  develop a new game arose to take its place. MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) games were quick, simple to learn, hard to master, and free to play. DOTA and league of legends (two MOBAs) gained wild popularity because of this. All of the sudden anyone with a computer could get one of these games for free, and jump into a game where they could possibly turn professional. These games took a huge chunk out of RTS market share of competitive gaming. They basically killed off Star Craft 2 before it even started. Yes Star Craft 2 does get played on a professional level, but it's not the giant that star craft 1 was.  What does this have to do with Beyond the Void?  From what I can tell BTV has a chance to be a hybrid between a RTS and and a MOBA. It's taking some of the best aspects of an RTS game,  and its making it free, easy to play and learn. I havent really seen a whole lot of games in that market. I think the potential for a strong competitive RTS game is huge, and it looks like the BTV team has their shit together interms of making a game thats fun to play  The guy comparing it to an android game doesn't understand why this is much much better, so I will explain. The andriod games that he's talking about.. (i'm assuming) Mobile strike, Clash of Clans... These games suck on a competitive level, because they have in game purchases, basically these games are on a timer. To do anything fun you either have to wait, or pay to build your armies. The ""best"" players end up paying large sums of money to even have a chance to win.  Beyond the void doesnt do any of that shit. It's straight up aptitude. If youre the best player, your the best player. The pure competition, and the fact that the game is free to play is what separates BTV from all of the trash apps out there.  I hope everyone thinks about that...This is going to be a rare type of game, if the game grows large following, NXC will have a pretty massive rise. I'm thinking somewhere around .0007 on release, and if the game is good, which I think it will be... who knows how high this could go.",False

I think if you can get the competitive version balanced properly, and it's fun to beat an opponent the door is wide open for possibilities with in game purchases for a campaign mode, The team seems to be on a pretty tight deadline for this first strictly competitive version, but if it's successful this game could expand in so many different ways. Story growth in particular, spin off games of a different genre. So many games get successful, and then generate huge profits outside of the original game.  Angry birds is an optimistic of an example, but the amount of revenue they've generated from what was a free game shows why BTV is so attractive for the value of NXC. They made a fortune from the game, and the spin off versions, they made a fortune in merchandising, and they made a fortune for selling the movie rights.  Here is the thing about people calling calling this a coin worthless. Their whole argument banks on the idea that this coin is just a ETH copy. That there isn't anything innovative about NXC. They don't account for the possibilities after the original release of the game. This could easily spawn into an entire franchise. If you create a successful game its incredibly valuable.  I was a little disrespectful earlier when I explained why this game wasn't just another Android app game, but lets examine one of those run of the mill android games...Clash of clans is made by supercell. They make a lot of run of the mill, basic, in-game purchase, shitty app games. They couldn't be a big company could they i mean those games can't really make money, right?  Supercell, generated $2.3 billion in revenue and profited $964 million last year. The $5.5 billion-dollar gaming company is worth more than Evernote, Eventbrite, and BuzzFeed combined  Each EMPLOYEE at Supercell is worth more than $5 million. yes, not owner, every single EMPLOYEE is worth 5 million dollars.  The people who attack this coin are missing the best part about this coin. The gaming industry is massive, and it's growing rapidly everyday. You don't need to be anything special to have a massive hit, your game just needs to be free, and decently fun to play.  Clash of clans is a trash game Boom Beach is a trash game Clan royale is a trash game  I don't even know people who play these games, but supercell is making Billions of dollars off of them. I tried clash of clans for a day, and deleted it, because it was that boring. Anyone trashing what this coin is based off the tech is completely ignorant of what the BTV team is trying to do.  When BTV releases the open beta in a few months this coin is going to enter a global market that is has been growing at an explosive rate for the past 30 years. it's not a niche market coin like almost all of the crap on polo. If the game has any kind of success this coin is in for a wild ride.",False

I believe your assumption that Nexium is an asset of the game is incorrect.  If you assume the game is worth $1000.  and there are 1000 NXC available each would be valued at $1.  Now you add a mother ship worth 10 NXC. or $10.  The value of the Game is now $1010 and the number of Nexium goes to 995 (50% of 10 burned).  So now a NXC would be valued at $1.015   ($1010/995NXC).      You could also counter and say once the mother ship is sold it is no longer an asset of the game.  I could believe that too.  In that case the game would still be worth $1000 but now there are only 995 NXC so each would be worth 1.005.  Still a gain but not as great.  Assuming the base value remains constant, if you decrease the basis of value (NXC), the value of the remaining basis should increase.      Think Stock by-backs.  If a company is worth $1000 and has 1000 shares of stock, each share is worth $1.  But if the company buys back 500 shares, there are only 500 remaining so now those 500 shares are worth $2.            Maybe I'm missing something but it seems deflationary to me.   ",False

Nexium is actually part of the game just like any other game assets except that it is used as money. Let's assume that the game is worth 100 units (game and its assets).  If the game devs are adding 1 asset (like a mothership), then it is increasing the value of the game lets say by 1 unit.  Then the game is worth 101 units.  However if you are burning another asset (Nexium) worth equal to what is added in value, then the game is back to worth 100 units. The question now remains whether burning only 50% of nexiums' revenue from sales of new assets is worth the added value, is less than the added value (inflation), or is more than the added value (deflation). I believe that new assets sold in the early stage of the game will add more value to the game than assets sold in the later stage.  However the burn rate will remain the same resulting in inflation in long term.  This is why I don't believe the Nexium or Bitcrystal economy is sustainable over the long run unless the game devs acting like the Fed decided to intervene and adjust the burn rate at will. Please note that the network effect (popularity) increases the value of the game.  This also will cause nexiums' price to increase in the early stage. One other thing that might increase the value of the game is whether the issued assets become collectibles.  I am not certain that beyond the Void will have this benefits, but cards like Force of Will, Spells of Genesis or Age of Chains will. The advantages of those cards is that they are on the Bitcoin blockchain.",False

You don't believe anymore?  Quote from: Beyond the Void on January 24, 2017, 02:28:35 PM Quote from: Beyond the Void on January 20, 2017, 08:57:57 PM Alright guys, I am back here.  The reason why we are not on Slack/Bitcointalk 24/7 is very simple: we are 4 in the team, and only 3 people full time. We have work to do and a game to develop so we can't spend that much time on forums. We also have families and lives outside the project.  We proved many times in the past that we were answering questions, and that we made ourselves available to discuss things with the community.  Asking a question about why we move funds to Poloniex should be very simple and quick. Making a post screaming scam is an obvious way to manipulate the price.  Now, answering the questions:  If you go on the Rich list: http://nexiumstats.com/, you'll see that the Initial address, the one that created the tokens, still hold 8,715,621.127 NxC. That's because some members of our team didn't even take the time to distribute their share of Nexiums like we announced we would. So for the most part, the ""hidden"" 15 million are still on the initial address. That should show everybody in which ""hurry"" we are to sell coins    240 days ago was the end of our presale... So no worries there, everything looks normal.  Now the last transaction: Rémi, our blockchain developer on the project, wanted to send some of his OWN Nexiums to Poloniex but didn't distribute his Nexiums from the Initial address yet. So actually he took them directly from the initial address... That was maybe not the best thing to do on his part, but it is still his Nexiums, and the amount was not big either. He is entitled to do what he seems fit with his NxC. This Nexium repartition was announced from the beginning, before the presale, and before the ICO. It is stated very clearly on our website.  We, as team members of Beyond the Void, understand that dumping a lot of tokens on Poloniex or any other exchange would put down the price and kill the project. This is NOT what we want, therefore we are NOT dumping Nexiums.  One other thing: when holding a big amount of tokens, it is very recommended to separate the amount on several addresses, for obvious security reasons... We are not doing that to hide anything. Everyone can see the blockchain, and it is even easier now with the richlist.  Again, I would like to remind everybody that we have videos showing the game on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD1IdjsnzXFdOarY20gMPQQ  We have a very busy schedule in the next few months, and I invite you all to check on us at these up coming events:  January 27th:               Coin Interview, a live interview on YouTube  February 17th-18th:     EDCON in Paris, France  March 3rd-4th:              Lyon E-Sport #10 in Lyon, France  April 6th:                       Blockshow Europe in Munich, Germany  April 8th :                      CoinFest UK in Manchester, United Kingdom  On the 27th of January, the interview with Coin Interview will include a LIVE DEMO of Beyond the Void. If anyone still had any doubts about the product existence after the live demo with Shaban Shaame from Spells of Genesis last October, they should not have any after the 27th of January.

EDS and BtV are closely related and how the coins function within the games are similar.  I don't believe that either EDS or BtV got the economy right, but it is a nice way to test it.  I believe that in the LONG RUN the value (price) of the coin is not sustainable.  Nexium will certainly reach a record high, but after that I believe that the coin's value depends on the BtV team, just as the price of BCY depends on the EDS team.  When you only burn half the price of a coin it equals to the Fed creating inflation.  In other words, EDS and BtV are actors similar to the fed.  The reason why BCY  price went down is because they had record card sales.  When BCY price goes down, you have the option to either sell BCY at a loss or buy cards that are pegged to BCY.  The incentive in this case would be to buy the cards which in turn create more inflation and which result into a downward price spiral.  Only when EDS stopped converting their earned BCY into BTC did the price go up as of late. I hope that in the future a game will come out with a different economy for the coin, or even better, without any new coin.  It would be interesting to see through facts which coins fare better. Also interesting to note is that EDS recently launched a new coin called Musecoin which is pegged to the Swiss Frank.  It would be interesting to see if it keeps its price when it hits the exchanges.",False

The reason why we are not on Slack/Bitcointalk 24/7 is very simple: we are 4 in the team, and only 3 people full time. We have work to do and a game to develop so we can't spend that much time on forums. We also have families and lives outside the project.  We proved many times in the past that we were answering questions, and that we made ourselves available to discuss things with the community.  Asking a question about why we move funds to Poloniex should be very simple and quick. Making a post screaming scam is an obvious way to manipulate the price.  Now, answering the questions:  If you go on the Rich list: http://nexiumstats.com/, you'll see that the Initial address, the one that created the tokens, still hold 8,715,621.127 NxC. That's because some members of our team didn't even take the time to distribute their share of Nexiums like we announced we would. So for the most part, the ""hidden"" 15 million are still on the initial address. That should show everybody in which ""hurry"" we are to sell coins    240 days ago was the end of our presale... So no worries there, everything looks normal.  Now the last transaction: Rémi, our blockchain developer on the project, wanted to send some of his OWN Nexiums to Poloniex but didn't distribute his Nexiums from the Initial address yet. So actually he took them directly from the initial address... That was maybe not the best thing to do on his part, but it is still his Nexiums, and the amount was not big either. He is entitled to do what he seems fit with his NxC. This Nexium repartition was announced from the beginning, before the presale, and before the ICO. It is stated very clearly on our website.  We, as team members of Beyond the Void, understand that dumping a lot of tokens on Poloniex or any other exchange would put down the price and kill the project. This is NOT what we want, therefore we are NOT dumping Nexiums.  One other thing: when holding a big amount of tokens, it is very recommended to separate the amount on several addresses, for obvious security reasons... We are not doing that to hide anything. Everyone can see the blockchain, and it is even easier now with the richlist.  Again, I would like to remind everybody that we have videos showing the game on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD1IdjsnzXFdOarY20gMPQQ  We have a very busy schedule in the next few months, and I invite you all to check on us at these up coming events:  January 27th:               Coin Interview, a live interview on YouTube  February 17th-18th:     EDCON in Paris, France  March 3rd-4th:              Lyon E-Sport #10 in Lyon, France  April 6th:                       Blockshow Europe in Munich, Germany  April 8th :                      CoinFest UK in Manchester, United Kingdom  On the 27th of January, the interview with Coin Interview will include a LIVE DEMO of Beyond the Void. If anyone still had any doubts about the product existence after the live demo with Shaban Shaame from Spells of Genesis last October, they should not have any after the 27th of January.",False

Two different projects with different people.  We chose to develop using the Ethereum blockchain for the smart contracts, for the transaction speed, and also because we believe in this technology.  Why did we choose to create Nexiums instead of using Ethers: thanks to Nexiums we could have an ICO, and get the funds to develop the project. That's the start of everything. One other reason is that we wanted to have a token separated from the Ether thus create a market with the Nexium value depending on the project's quality and not Ether or Bitcoin directly.  ""What's the point of digital assets if I can only use them in one game?"" : our plan is to develop partnerships with other games, or even other blockchain projects, related or not to gaming (if it fits). This way, Beyond the Void assets can be used not only in our game. Also, we could give value & existence to other assets (like Spells of Genesis assets, it's already the case for Crystalibur) in our game. That's what we call cross-gaming. It's the possibility to create an entire ecosystem using the same assets, not only ours, but from other games & apps as well.  These questions are the heart of Beyond the Void project, and we like to talk about it with the community. If you have questions or suggestions, we would like to have you on Slack.  http://beyond-the-void.signup.team/  Edit: about your post on replays, I think this specific question should be asked to Rémi directly.

You could have used Nexium the same way as you used Protonexium to raise funds through an ICO.  Nexium could be redeemed for ranking and then burned (the same way Protonexium was burned).  The disadvantage of using Nexium for game asset sales is that you will have to exchange it for bitcoins and/or fiat in a thin market.  Why not just get bitcoins instead?  I believe that this is also why SOG sold their most valuable assets in bitcoins rather than bitcrystals on black Friday such as the Satoshicard.  Another disadvantage is that the more assets get sold and the more nexium will hit the market which will drive the price down.  This goes against your interest because your revenue in fiat term will diminish as you sell more assets due to nexium price decrease.  On the other hand, if asset sales decrease, then price of nexium goes up, which then will lead people to sell their nexiums rather than use those nexiums to buy more assets from you, which in turn will again decrease your revenue.  I can take my case an as example in SOG.  I bought loads of BCY when the price was cheap a few weeks ago for the purpose of buying cards.  However the price has increased so much now that I am instead thinking selling my BCYs rather than buy more cards.  In conclusion, adding another currency into the market adds unnecessary complexity.  The only thing of value in the game should be game assets not including another shitcoin.  This attracts speculators and day traders who are more interested in making quick money out of a pump and dump at the expense of collectible game assets.",False

A bad game is bad forever.” ~ Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto  Hi, this is Remi. A little over a week ago, we brought Johan Dufour on board to be our front-end advisor. His first project is to help us bring out the second major iteration of our shop. I built the first iteration in October, but it just wasn’t good enough! (My strengths are in blockchain smart contracts, not e-commerce front-ends). Johan and I have paired up as a team, and are applying our combined talents to creating a much nicer version of the store. Therefore, we are rescheduling our first milestone from February 8th to February 22nd.  So to summarize, here’s our updated development/release schedule:  ● We’ll distribute the backer’s assets and provide a check balance tool on February 1st ● We will release the new version of the store on 22nd of February  Please keep in mind that we’re holding a live demo with CoinInterview on January 27th where we’ll demo what we’ve developed so far and provide an update on the project. Then, on February 1st, we will distribute the assets along with a tool for you to be able to check your balances. Then, we will take a few more weeks to release the shop. We also plan to present the finished shop at the EDCON on February 17/18 of February in Paris. Although these types of delays are common in software development, we understand if some of you feel a disappointed or frustrated by the delay. We care about your thoughts, so we are bringing you news of this delay sooner rather than later. We hope you accept our apologies. Please know that we will continue working hard to make things right. Sincerely, Remi, Johan, and the other team members.  PS: Keep in mind that we are still going to the following events, which will include live presentations of the game and the store:  ● January 27th:   Coin Interview, a live interview & game demo on YouTube  ● February 17th-18th:   EDCON in Paris, France  ● March 3rd-4th:   Lyon E-Sport #10 in Lyon, France  ● April 6th:   Blockshow Europe in Munich, Germany  ● April 8th :   CoinFest UK in Manchester, United Kingdom",False

Having a pro gaming background, this is something that would have incentivized me hardcore to play, practice and get better. Living as a progamer couple years back, I loved it, only problem was it was increasingly difficult to earn a living from it. I streamed with viewers topping at 5k and earned a bunch from coaching but it would be much more rewarding, I believe, to actually earn money for talented players.  Could this be put into consideration? Possibly set a seperate ranking systems so players have a choice whether to pay and compete.  Another thing I would like to put out there are replays.  Replays are downloaded thousands of times, the good ones can reach millions. Point being, my replays were always demanded so people could study them to become better players. It would be mindblowing if players could sell their replays for whatever price they deem worthy. This would also have helped me further my progaming scene.  Etherplay.io records all of their games on the blockchain, I mentioned this idea to them and they said its something that could be added... Could this also be something you would add in the future? After all, you guys are creating a competitive RTS MOBA and if  Beyond The Void picks up steam, the same thing will happen thats happening now in E-sports, everyone wants to be a pro-gamer, they will study replays to the core. Thats what I did, I would have been fine with paying a minimal fee to download replays knowing im also supporting my favorite gamers!",False

It's clear that you don't know how these markets works.  ""Overvalued"", ""inflated"", ""pumped"", it's all the same. Big players generate big volumes, buy walls and other known tricks to make little investors think that it's a good moment to enter, when reality is that they are buying at high prices given the current status of the project.  Even if everything was 200% transparent, price wouldn't had sustained 5-7K levels, because there was absolutely no reason to do so. People who bought those at those prices, you included, bought coins giving the project a market valuation of 2,5M-3M $, when just a day before it was valuated at 400K $. Next time, think a bit before investing in a project man.   You need all the information & all the cards in the table to decide if a project is trustworthly or not. Well that's not going to happen, if you want some extra info you will have to look for it.  This is the essence of VC investing, to trust or not to trust. If you're not good or confortable in that kind of ""intuitive"" analysis, go back to big corporation investing.

When you release dev wallets public, and those have a big % of shares, any minor movement will be used by the whales to dump hard the price.  I tell you what I think, they saw inflated prices at the start and decided to sell a small part, like 2-3M. And it's a clever decision, because NXC in the launch at 5-7K was overvalued. Now they don't wanna show the wallets because those 2-3M would be missing, and FUD would go to the next level. ""Look at those, dumping dev coins to the investors!!!""  Lots of well-known and reputable projects have been dumping coins secretly for development. And now you say: Yeah, but that was the first day! And I say: yeah, but the price was clearly manipulated high and the volume was big. The moment to sell some was then. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not defending a full dump of 15M. That would be a disastrous behaviour. But I defend a 2-3M dump, because funds are for that, and the price was too high.   I was following the price action and the orderbooks all the first day man. It was a clear whale manipulation to make noobs buy ""the new polo thing"". Everything was bullish until they put a 150 BTC sell wall and crashed the price. The following days, they kept dumping, dried the buy orderbooks and so on. In addition, BTC was rallying hard in that time so it was more easy to supress the price.  That is the classical price supression dumpage after Polo add man. Important projects that now are rocking hard followed the same pattern. Factom, XEM, AMP, ETH, ... were all dumped to hell during weeks and months before making the big rallies. There's nothing strange or suspitious in NXC behaviour that we haven't seen other times.   To finish. I agree with you, there should be a richlist and full list of transactions. But all this complains, you should ask them personally, instead of spreading the FUD here. You're shoting yourself in the feet. Whales are very aware of the emotions that bitcointalk topic shows. If they see FUD here, they will supress the price even more and make scared little investors sell at a big lose.      ",False

What is the difference from that from what happened when it went on the exchange? Nothing. It works just as good on the other way around to say that they cannot see the wallets so they might just dump anytime.  You cannot simply say that something is ""overvalued"" there is a supply and demand, the price it gets is the correct one based on that. Which well-known projects are you talking about that dumped secretly?  I know very well how the markets works but that doesn't change what I've stated before, if they dumped 2-3M or 15M it doesn't matter. It is the thing that they might have done it and are hiding from telling the truth and keep using the lame excuse ""privacy"" when you asked for people's money.  The other coins/tokens you bring up there at least had full transaction list/richlist of all funds, nothing hidden so you could track it and do your own judgement if investing was a good thing or not.  I should not need to go to them personally to ask them for a richlist/transacations or their wallets, this is something they should had provided from day 1 when it went on the exchange or even before that.  Just a reminder to you, this is not FUD, it is a fact that they are hiding 15M coins or less if they sold it and refuse to show it publicly.

If the devs don't have anything to hide, why not post full details of the addresses they hold all coins, expense reports...etc  I also would jump really quick if they sold their shares in NXC that just shows me they don't believe in the project.

If it were based on zcash or monero I would understand your concerns.  I have been checking out the nexium blockchain in the last 2 days and all my questions are being answered by the team.  I think it is possible to have transparency while at the same time have privacy.  I watch the addresses of the top ICO investors, but I don't need their names. So far I found out that what caused the Nexium price to decrease when it reached Poloniex on 12/20 was caused by three whales (of which two have connections) having more than 1/3 of today's total balance on Poloniex. I can imagine that on 12/20 they probably had closer to 90%.  But I would not know this because I cannot see the complete history on Etherscan (only shows 200 transactions).  If anyone can help me to find a way to get those hidden transactions I could find out more. I agree for transparency, but especially regarding bigger issues.  Half of our money is being taken away by criminals through what they call taxes, and we don't even know what they do with it.  Reasonable guess would be that they squander it to promote war and regime change all over the world.  So being upset at a small team because of some petty cash we invested is not my priority.  Besides, they have a reputation to maintain especially since they are somewhat connected to Everdreamsoft.",False

You can go to Lyon-France and visit them if you want.  Second thing, you are angry because you made a bad decision by buying at 6K-7K when there was any rational reason to do so. You should investigate more before trading because this world has nothing to be with blue chips of S&P 500.  Third thing. I explain you, because seems that you don't know how this works: Devs hold a big % of shares in this project. In these wild west markets, ANY minor thing will be maximized. Any minor development will push the price high, and any minor FUD signal will push the price down. Devs have 15M of PERSONAL coins (yeah, it was in the ICO, that is their share. If you don't like it you shouldn't have bought). Now imagine that in 6 months, Devs decide to sell 1M, just 1M. If this information goes public, believe me, there would be a MAJOR unreasonable dump. How I said, this markets are full of whales and they will take advantage of any situation. The FUD appears quickly, and devs dumping coins generates tons of FUD and inestability in prices.  So yeah, I prefer that they keep those wallets private. They are developing the product, and I understand that they should have a major share of it, as any other business.

They made a product and I pay whenever it is ready to use. They asked for money, got the coin/token listed on an exchange and possibly sold alot of their holdings without telling anyone because it is ""privacy"" to hold 15% of the coins/tokens. Do you know how weird this sounds? That is red flags all over.  How come this project need privacy with their devfunds when projects like ETH/ICN/Waves and other ones does not? What makes this project so special that they cannot show their wallets or just tell us how much they sold if they sold. As you said, it is a different scenario because it affects my money and I/others should be able to know if 15M NXC will hit the market.  It doesn't really matter to me if it is successful or not, that is not the point. Even if they keep developing that doesn't make up for possibly selling millions of NXC when it hit the exchange, that is a classic shady move. Think about how many people that bought NXC when it hit the exchange and lost money because they possibly hit the market with millions of coins/tokens. You can take it as being smart, I see it as greed and that you have no respect for the people that helped you with money to build the game.  They avoid the question about their wallets and adresses, they even said they have no intention to sell, then why hide it? Why can we not see it?

Here is the repartition of the first 15 Million NxC between the 4 teammates:  Maxence 6 Million Eric 4 Million Rémi 4 Million Manon 1 Million  We are still separated entities, so nobody holds more than 6 Million. Also, there are backers that hold more than us (more than 6 Million). So Maxence, who is the original creator in this project, actually holds less than our biggest backer. We actually worked a lot to bring this project to life, including lots of months where we weren't paid and we chose to be rewarded for that. This is a matter of choice of course so there is no point in discussing it now on bitcointalk.  The next 15 Million Nexiums are meant to be spent on promotion (we already spent some on those, and I'll publish soon a marketing strategy & budget). We promoted the ICO, we are now published on Forbes, listed on Poloniex and so on.  We are not interested in dumping Nexiums on the market. And the value of the Nexium is tied to the success of the game so we are focusing on releasing a good game and on time.",False

Backers BOUGHT those tokens/coins from you, those who bought during the ICO has nothing to do with this, dont really know why you would take that up.  Why shouldn't we discuss this on bitcointalk, isn't that why you have a thread so people actually can talk? I think it is fair for everyone to see discussions here just as much as the people on Slack.  On your own site it clearly states the following:      Allocation of Nexiums:         15% for the founders.         15% for promoting the game.         70% for crowdfunding and other backers. ""We created 100 000 000 Nexiums using a smart contract (the amount is fixed).""  This was what everyone bought into, knowing you would have 15% for the founders and 15% to promote the game. But now when you burned 30+ million and still keep the same amount of coins for founders/promotion it is not 30% in total there anymore, it is closer to 50%.  I hope you informed everyone that you would do this before they bought the into the ICO because that is very shady way of doing business.  I find it weird that you justify the amount of coins you kept because you didn't get paid the first months. If you are not going to sell it, why do you need it? Why didn't you ask for more money during the ICO to pay everyone that has been working during these months?",False

The table on BtV website should have shown the details as they are important: 15% Marketing, 15% founder's share, 7% minimum ICO  (based on 110,000 Euro minimum funding requirement), and 63% burn or additional funding TBD in the future.  So the only unk nown was how much would be burned and how much additional funds would be raised.  The rest is pretty much set and cannot be changed.  The way it should have been read at that time is that 40.55% go to founders, 40.55% go to marketing, and 18.90% go to ICO investors.  After ICO completion, the final shares changed to 22.55%, for owner, 22.55% to marketing, 10.52% to minimum ICO requirement with a balance to additional funding of 44.38%.  I agree however that the original 40.55% to 4 founders (I can only see 3 on the website) is a lot, but that might be the reason why only half of the available ICO coins were sold.  Had there been a better balance between those percentages, I believe BtV would have been able to collect more funds.  Now we are at least aware than 22.55% of Nexiums are owned by 4 big whales.  I mean it could have been worse.  But I am sure that this might be a cause of concern for long term investors as we don't know when or how much anyone would dump.  However I doubt this will occur before the game launches and any such dump will be visible on the blockchain.  In regards to the marketing funds (22.55% as well), it all depends what time frame is used in their budget.  If it will be used within a year, then that will cause a major downward pressure on Nexium, but if those funds will be used during the course of 10 years, then there is no need for concern.  Also coinmarketcap doesn't show these funds on the market yet.  It would be great if BtV communicated to us the details of their marketing budget sometimes when it has been decided.  As a last note, I think that owner's share, or at least part of it, should have been included as a percentage of total ICO funds collected.  Also take note that the above percentages aren't accurate as I estimated 7 million Nexiums for 110,000 Euros.",False

ETH Price during ICO : $ 10.837 Initial 5M offer : 700 NXC/ETH Final  5M offer : 425 NXC/ETH 575 NXC/ETH (Fail, go to http://beyond-the-void.net/index.php/nexium-price/ and see for yourself)  @Initial 10.837/700 = 0.01548142 USD/NXC 0.01548142/800= 0.00001935 BTC/NXC  @Final 10.837/575 = 0.01890956 USD/NXC 0.01890956/800 = 0.00002364 BTC/NXC   So now that your shit accounting demonstrates your lack of intelligence or your intend to FUD (I think it's more option 1 than option 2), let's put the REAL FACTS in the table:  Now we must be below -20% of ICO prices. There was a huge whale that bough a big % of these 365 BTC raised, and these two days he has been cashing out at a profit while some suckers bought him at X5. Easy money. Now a lot of these suckers are shouting SCAM, SCAM, SCAM and are panic selling their positions at a loss to the same whale. LOL  FUNDAMENTAL BASIS: Price will go ABOVE ICO prices, when the info and the releases provided for the team will be more valuable than the info provided at ICO times. We don't have major impovements right now, what do you expect, to everyone win magically an X5 because it was added to Polo?¿? These crazy days are over people. The coin will gain value when this value will be justified, that means to release a good game and a good platform in general.  About the confidence in the honesty of the team, do some research, go to fucking slack https://beyond-the-void.slack.com and ask them questions. They should post more here, we already said that and they are gonna do it, so stop fucking around with free scam clams.  COLD MIND VIEW: Current Market cap is around 800-900K $ counting the dev and bounties fund, and around 400-500K $ without counting it. They have a cool game that it's already in advanced development. ONLY 6 MONTHS for FULL RELEASE. Really you cannot wait 6 months and make a X5-X10 profit?¿? Are you fucking kidding me? Want a reliable antecedent? Look at Bitcrystals (BCY), it went up 15M$ market cap without even beeing the Full release done, and excuse me for them, but Beyond of Void looks much cooler and solid model than Bitcrystals.  Crybabes, crybabes everywhere... In 6 months you'll be buying our NXC between 10K-20K sats, mark my words.  ",False

However, one can also decide to use BTC as a unit of account and compute market rate of Ether or BCY straight into Bitcoins completely ignoring what the price of any of those coins were in USD, which makes things much easier to understand for some.  Price of BTC/BCY was 0.000255 and BTC/ETH was 0.015.  This result in a Protonexium (1 Proto was 0.0714 BCY) to be priced at 0.00001600 BTC and in an ETH based Nexium (700 NXC to 1 ETH) to be priced at 0.00002140 BTC.  This resulted in a price difference of 33% between a BCY purchased Protonexium and an ETH purchased Nexium.  Please note that the Protonexium price was increased to 0.0833 after they replenished the swapbot.  The question is why were more people buying Nexiums through ETH rather than the cheaper alternative.  I believe that the obvious answer is laziness or assumption.  People just assumed that Beyond the Void had priced them equally, especially that there was no announcement that one would be cheaper than the other one, something that Maidsafe announced during their ICO when buying with Mastercoin (OMNI) was way cheaper than with Bitcoin.  Now considering that today's price of Nexium is about 0.00001265, people are whining that the price is below ICO price.  I actually disagree.  ICO price should not only relate to the coin, but too all the benefits that came with it.  So 1.6 Bitcoin gave you 100k of protonexiums which in turn were converted into nexiums and a rank.  Since we got only two items (nexiums and rank), we only need to know the price of one item to guess what the price of the other item is.  The market is telling us that ICO investors were ready to sell their nexiums after obtaining their rank at 1,265 satoshis.  It would be reasonable to assume, based on that, that the market price of the rank is then 335 satoshis (1600 - 1265).  Of course, this logic won't work once we get a secondary market (people who bought nexium on poloniex instead of original ICO investors).  So a Moon Administrator is priced at 0.335 BTC, a Planetary Regent is 1.34 BTC, a Star Baron is 2.1775 BTC, a Constellation king is 3.35 BTC and a Galactic Emperor is 5.695 BTC.",False

Is worth of read and think about it.  As i see, BeyondTheVoid crowdfunding is almost identical as was in Spells of Genesis. Maybe right now there is way more interest for such project and you will gather way more founds. But in case you dont, please dont repeat same mistake as SoG made and not burn proportional part of 30% reserved fro development and promotion.  You minimum goal is 110.000 euros what you get once you sell about 8,000.000 Nexium. Lets say. That is it. That is how much you sell after crowdfunding finish. So 62,000.000 Nexium gets burned. And there is 8,000.000 Nexium in hands of backers who founded making of the game. 15,000.000 Nexium is on wallet ment for promotion. 15,000.000 Nexium is on wallet reserved for future development. So out of 38,000.000 Nexium, the game or the development team holds 30,000.000 Nexium or almost 80%. This will latter on discourage many to even look at the coin. Since they will be afraid that at any point developers dump coins.  Solution to this is to burn same % of Nexium in development and promotion vallet. Same % as will be burnt of unsold Nexium in crowdfunding. So if you sell 35 million Nexium in crowdfunding and burn other half you also burn 7.5 million from development and 7.5 million from promotion. And that way you  keep 70/30 ratio.",False

Let me explain. In sports games, you have the concept of ""home"" which refers to the siuation where a team is playing in their usual surrounding with their fans in majority with the other team being a guest, which is referred to as ""away"". While this is mostly psychological, the idea that one team is playing on their turf while the other team is visiting creates an asymmetry which changes the game balance, with the ""home"" team having maximum fan support but also maximum pressure not to lose the game on their own turf.  This can translate in a space strategy game by using planets. You could have a ""deep encounter"" mode where armies confront in deep space. And an ""invasion"" mode where one team invades the other team, with maybe a small asymmetry in the formations as one team needs to defend their planet on top of making sure they aren't destroyed. This could be compensated by some tactical advantage TBD.  The point is that, from the moment where you allow player to have a ""home"", that is to say a planet they own, you create the opportunity for players to show off proudly their planet / star / star system Planets could be run-of-the-mill average planets for non-paying players. But they could also be unique, one-of-a-kind planets that will surely make an impression, or even massive star systems made of multiple planets and, why not, a twin star or any other oddity. This would sell very well because the whole theme of the game is for an opponent to invade your turf and your turf is all around the place ""in your face"". That's the absolute best opportunity to make sure your turf is an interesting experience for your opponent, and could very well give you a psychological advantage, which remains entirely compatible with the free-to-play model. Just look at how easily ""games"" like secondlife have been selling real estate. Planets are likely to be perceived and valued as real estate by players. You can even create continuous interest by selling limited edition planets and star systems and/or creating tournaments with an awesome unique star system at stake.",False

Nexium are designed to be burned upon use, so they will get increasingly scarce over time.  Beyond The Void, a new RTS-MOBA game, is about to storm the gaming industry backed by an initial coin offering (ICO) and ethereum blockchain tokens. This free-to-play game wants to be the first competitive real-time strategy (RTS) multiplayer online battle arena game (MOBA) to combine a blockchain based ICO with a blockchain token economy.  Read more: http://bitcoinprbuzz.com/e-sports-game-beyond-void-launch-worlds-first-moba-gaming-ico/    The Nexium price for the ICO    The original Nexium price on the crowdfunding opening will be 700 Nexiums/Ether. However, this price will increase every time we reach 5 million Nexium sold, as stated in the chart. See more right here: http://beyond-the-void.net/index.php/nexium-price/       Don't miss!

Instead of ETH I think is much better to use Counterparty. Even if you are a supporter of ETH, for the moment I consider  Counterparty and BTC blockchain a better option, and I'll offer you a few reasons for this sentence:  1. ETH blockchain is under attack right now, and it's shows a lot of vulnerabilities last time. We'll see a new hard-fork (maybe others) and your project will be affected by their technical issues;  2. Last ICO's on ETH blockchain were dumped hard, so investors lost enough money (SNGLS, REP, etc.);  3. Counterparty already support ""Spells of genesis"" (your partner in this project), a successful project until now, so you can learn a lot from their experience;  4. With Counterparty you can use Indiesquare wallet and Book of Orbs, also tokenly, for safe sales of your assets or to exchange them;  5. With Counterparty you already have a lot of people which experienced this kind of project with Spells of genesis, so they can understand easy and can invest in your game also;  6. In Counterparty (Book of orbs) you already have a market for ""in games digital assets"" for Spells of genesis and Force of will, so players can exchange or sell your assets more easy, or you can make partnership with other games to use some legendary assets in more games;    Another objection is regarding your partner ranks. I think is not a correct correlation between investment and bonuses ; ex. Moon Administrator 100.000 investment/ 8% extra bonus and Galactic Emperor 17x (1.700.000 investment) and only 2x (16%) extra bonus. The rapport 1:17 is too much in partner ranks, a normal rapport for 5 ranks could be 1:5 - you can start with 200.000/400/600/800/1.000.000.  Good luck!",False

ETH blockchain is under attack right now, and it's shows a lot of vulnerabilities last time.

Last ICO's on ETH blockchain were dumped hard, so investors lost enough money (SNGLS, REP, etc.);  The token value is not in correlation with the techo used, but is inherent to the projects themselves.  3.

In our ICO, a smart contract will be used as an escrow. It is written in the smart contract that we can't get the money if the 110 000€ goal is not reached. This smart contract will be published for everyone to see before the crowdfunding starts. Our marketing is being taken care of by our partner Openledger and the Decentralized Conglomerate. We might do bounties for translations, but we'll let everybody know when that happens.  Best regards",False

Couple questions.  Why should I invest in the game. Am I paid part of the future game revenue? Or is the ICO aimed for people who are willing to play the game in future?  How the value of Nexiums in circulation can grow?  How one can buy Nexiums in the game after the ICO, and who is the seller?  Are Nexiums used only between the players, or can you buy ie. Skins from game shop? If items are bought from Game provided shop, what happens to ""used"" Nexiums?",False
