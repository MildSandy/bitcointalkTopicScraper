Well, I fully understand your concerns, and agree that it's not a bad idea to err on the side of caution. From what I understand, it seems Canada's Ontario Securities Commission is saying they encourage this new form of raising capital, so you might want to check with the OSC. There have been a few publications on this matter, this is just one article I found. https://news.bitcoin.com/canadian-securities-commission-cryptocurrencies-icos/  I suggest you do some more research for yourself, but I would like to say that we have used quite a bit of resources on a legal team, and according to Norwegian securities laws, which are very similar to those of northern America, we are not classified as a security.  As far as in the future being classified as a registered security, I've stated in other posts, this is something we hope to accomplish by the start of the mainsale. Some small changes would be made to our underlying concept if this is the case.  I encourage you to follow along, and if you haven't already done it, create a BullToken account so you are added to our mailing list. All updates regarding this will be published via our newsletters, and having a BullToken account is definitely 100% free and legal  Best Regards, Louie",False

Thanks  Great question! Our first priority is running a safe and secure ICO. The github repository links for our ICO smart contracts will be published after a code audit, giving ample time for a bug bounty before the pre-sale begins.  When it comes to running an Interactive Coin Offering, this is still something we are working on, and we hope to be able to do this before the start of the mainsale. Before the pre-sale begins we will be publishing the pre-sale AND mainsale smart contracts, for obvious reasons of transparency.   If we manage to create a successful InteractiveCO in time(while keeping priority 1 in tact), then we will do the same as we are doing now. We will have a third party code audit, then run a bug bounty. Then we would need to publish, loud and clear, that our original mainsale smart contract has been changed in order to support the Interactive protocol.  So just to quickly summarise, everything right now reflects our original plans of an Initial Coin Offering pre-sale and mainsale, but our smart contract developers are still working on making an InteractiveCO in time for the mainsale. Our number 1 priority is first and foremost security. Fairness will have to take a backseat to an unhackable smart contract  We are confident that the Interactive protocol will be coded into our smart contract before mainsale, but we also did not want to start the pre-sale without having a working mainsale smart contract available for all to see.

I'm a newbie in the cryptocurrency world, just joined in last week. Being busy with exams I haven't had the time to read as much about them as I wish. Been putting some cash into IOTA so far as it seems like an amazing project. Wanted to dip into some ICOs as well when I stumbled upon BullToken. I'll probably try to participate in the community some, but mainly I just really like the thought of investing in a fund for ICOs. Seeing how many there are and the explosive growth of some of them, I feel like there's just too much to tackle as an individual. So relying on a community that properly researches them all and manages to catch on to the successes sounds amazing, even if a large percent might fail.  I know you haven't advertised much yet, but still the community as of now seems extremely small. While this will likely change as the project nears the main sale I still have to ask, how well can the project function if you only barely manage past phase 1 (past the guaranteed money-back) and don't get the community needed for your planned systems? Will the currently in place IBAs still manage to keep the ship sailing?  And I'm asking because of my own ignorance here, but is there any chance of survival if blockchain happens to die? Like, will you spread out to some other techs and investments, so you don't 100% rely on blockchain staying healthy? From what I've read so far I find it hard to believe blockchain has a permanent future, with tech like the tangle on the market. Can't help but think one day the biggest non-miner bitcoin investors will swap over to the tangle, or some other new tech, creating seemingly insurmountable sell walls, causing the new bitcoiners who's just after a quick profit to sell as well, and starting a complete crash of the blockchain alltogether. Though I'm not expecting it any time soon, and it might very well be my paranoia speaking.  Lastly, I'm not seeing any referral links in this thread. Apparently both the parties get a reward during referrals, so if anyone needs one then you can use mine: https://bulltoken.tech/PreRegister/Register?refCode=2f7678e2009afb1ec641",False

Thanks for getting in touch with us. So let me start by saying welcome to the community! Cryptocurrency community, that is. Hopefully soon, you'll be joining ours too. BTW, I also have invested in IOTA, and by no means does that translate to a non-belief in the future of blockchain  Ok, so I'll start from your first question, How well can we possibly do if we only reach phase 1, which results in product guarantee? --- First, I want to just commend you for getting that far into the details. Even though you're a ""new"" investor, we'd be honoured to have you as a member of our community, with due diligence skills like that!  To answer your question, the project will absolutely still do well in the off-chance event we only reach the phase1 product guarantee line. At the time of writing my ICO prologue, I had an idealistic vision of how I wanted to run the marketing campaigns before the pre-sale. We honestly held out as long as we could trying to reach members of the crypto community via non-mainstream tactics, but humans have this sort of innate quality to not want to make a move if they are the first ones to do so. Try to google ""how to start a movement"" and that's a PERFECT example of how we as a species act. I hope I don't offend anybody, but humans are pack animals by nature. Nothing wrong with that! And although our thread hasn't had TONS of traffic yet, which btw ICOs manipulate by hiring bitcointalk thread posters, we have received an overwhelmingly high rate of positive feedback about the BullToken project. Actually, the only negative feedback we've gotten is from Facebook trolls putting silly comments on our ads. Bulls--t token, things like that. So all in all, we know we've done a good job, and it's just a matter of time  I have not given up on my first ""idealistic marketing strategy"", it just takes longer than a ""normal marketing strategy"" to execute correctly. ""Normal marketing"" is btw active and ongoing until the end of the ICO mainsale! The last thing I'd like to mention about our marketing strategy, we have a few tricks up our sleeves, and once those are disclosed, its like a domino effect. I see BullToken as 2017/2018 ICO sleeper of the year! Just wait, you'll see  Having said that, we did have today/yesterdau (it's now tuesday 03:15 dec 5th) over 2000 pre-registered ICO investors. How many of these investors will actually invest? Nobody knows. Will you invest? I hope so! But once I activated our marketing campaigns, traffic started flowing, and since then, 2000+ people filled out 2 pages of information to be ready for the pre-sale, just like you did to access your referral code. So we are not worried at all about only filling phase 1. And as you stated, this will change as the project nears the mainsale anyway. This I promise you! As the CMO, I won't rest until I've filled the entire project hardcap. Today I got into the office at 5am, and now I'm still here almost 24 hours later, and expect to be back in my chair tomorrow morning at 8am. As long as there is something to do, this entire team is dedicated to making sure it gets done! I have a 2 week vacation coming up soon, so I'll rest on the plane  As far as the blockchain dying, and our chances of survival if that happens? --- I'm willing to bet my life that Blockchain technology is here to stay for a long long long long time.  But, because here at BullToken we appreciate honesty and transparency, I'm going to give you an honest answer to that question(which today is probably very far fetched). Will we survive if the blockchain crashes and dies? I think if any blockchain based project could do it, it's BullToken. But, how could we? In the unlikely event that happens, we're also looking at the vast majority of our underlying assets also disappearing into thin air. Having said that, if the blockchain is showing signs of withering away, I don't believe something like that can just suddenly happen overnight, and we would definitely adapt as a community to whatever changes are happening in the cryptosphere. So I'm going to officially say, yes we would survive. I think our community would do everything in it's power to survive a drastic landscape change like that.  Xytech, I hope I answered your questions well enough, and I hope everyone here uses your referral link! Thanks for your great questions! Very unique, and obviously well thought out. You're not paranoid, just trying to soak it all in and process the vast amounts of new info  Take care, hope to see on the BullToken Community Platform! Any more questions, shout em out!

I understand that you are looking for people who are committed to the community and have developed a Karma System which will provide value added opportunities.  For the token itself, my understanding is as follows.  Please let me know if this is correct.  By way of example, I invest one Ether and receive 500 BullTokens in the pre-sale.  Let's assume the community invests my one Ether and earns 10 Ether.  How is that investment returned back to me? My understanding is that your advisory board will petition the community to learn how to best distribute that 10 Ether.  Some of it will be used to buy back BullTokens and ""burn"" them, or permanently remove them from circulation.  As a result, the supply of BullTokens will become more limited and the market value will increase.  In that way my BullToken value will reflect profits received from the diversified investment in community chosen ICOs and altcoins. It's not a direct return, but an indirect return by limiting the supply of BullTokens.  I hope I understand this correctly.  I'm also wondering if this is a long-term sustainable practice.  Thank you for your help.",False

Thanks for the question! You're definitely on the right track. So instead of using your example as a single investor, I'm gonna use the whole community so it's easier to understand in relation to how things are going to function. But I will say that you are understanding the gist of it.  So your question is ""How will the profits from the community investments be returned to the investors?"". For legal reasons, we need to be very careful about how we explain things, but as a ""hypothetical example"", do you understand the basics of an ETF fund? This is not much different, but at the same time it is very different, because we are officially NOT an ETF fund  The BullToken token represents each member’s share of all assets we as a community invest in. Since we don’t pay out dividends, an owner can sell BullTokens on major exchanges, as its exchange value goes up and down, if they so desire. As the value of our Community Investments increases, the value of BullToken will also increase.  As far as the BullToken buy/burn strategy, it's only a mechanism to ensure its liquidity on exchanges. This is something we may never need, but it’s in place and ready to be voted on by the community if needed.  And then there are a couple of other investment strategies to mention here as a supplement to what's already been stated by you and myself.  In order to distribute risk, we have 2 main investment strategies. The first investment strategy states that we will invest a maximum of 1% of our total Assets Under Management (AUM) in new blockchain projects, and not hold more than 5% in any one investment. Whenever an underlying asset increases to more than 5%, BullToken will partially sell itself down to 5%, and repurpose 80% of those gains into investing in new projects. The second strategy is also investing in established cryptocurrency assets. Our current guidelines state that a maximum of 20% of the total BullToken Investment Portfolio can be established cryptocurrency assets.  The last important strategy to mention is flexibility. Every day is an exciting day in the world of cryptocurrencies, but nobody really knows what will happen tomorrow. In order to be able to adapt to this fast moving industry, BullToken has set guidelines, not set-in-stone rules, and is willing to adapt by including our community in future strategy planning. Although this wasn’t part of your question, this is a very important reason for why BullToken is not a 100% blockchain project, but a hybrid. All transactions that need to be stored on the blockchain will be there for all to see.  As far as we can see, as long as there are innovative projects to invest in, then this is definitely a long-term sustainable practice  I hope I've answered your question well enough. Anything else you'd like to discuss, we welcome it with open arms!  Will I be seeing you on the Community Platform? I hope so!  Best Regards, Louie",False

COME JOIN THE COMMUNITY  shortcut to the whitepaper: https://indd.adobe.com/view/2ff28c3d-68bc-46ab-a29e-b797315829a1  -or-  Read the PROLOGUE about why BullToken is the new breed of ICO  We're looking for some quality due diligence from the crypto community, whom we also hope will join ours. It's no secret that our entire concept is dependent on you guys. Soon you'll see why.  We feel our overall strategy is solid. We've used thousands of painstaking hours to get where we are today, but we are purposely leaving some details as ""?s"" to be determined IN COOPERATION with you guys.  I honestly believe that transparency is key, so I'll be posting my personal social media accounts at the bottom of this post.  A QUICK PERSONAL INTRO: My name is Louie Procopio. I'm a real guy, most would say I'm also a real nice guy, and I like to skip. Like the song(skip to my Lou), not the rope. Skipping makes you happy, and those around you too. Especially seeing a grown man skipping with his kids. We share smiles with strangers, and it makes us all feel good! You can see all about me and my skipping fetish on facebook. But I'm not here for that.  I just turned 33 a few days ago. I'm born and raised in LA California, and I moved to Norway in 2009. I have a Norwegian wife who I asked to marry me the day after we randomly met in Hawaii, and two beautiful Norwegian daughters as a result. I work hard as the head of marketing for a Norwegian software dev company, and we are about to start an ICO in December which we are very excited for!  QUICK INTRO-CONCLUSION: I'm a real guy with real feelings, I'm putting myself, my family, my job, my colleges, and our vision out for you guys to critique(well you don't have to critique my family), and I just want to remind everyone again that I have real feelings too. So let's just be civil and stick to the subject, please  WHY AM I POSTING THIS? 1. Feedback in the hopes of making something ALL OF YOU would want to be apart of. 2. To get valuable information from the community we feel matters most, in order to make critical changes to the plan (if neccessary) 3. Exposure  THE VISION: I'll let you read our Whitepaper soon, I promise  The vision here is to gather all the ""right"" people into a special community, with a bi-product of safe and responsible gains on (mostly) ICO investments.  The implications of that happening, and all of us working as one giant, efficient, friendly, and symbiotic ICO analysing/investing machine.... well, we think the implications of doing that can be a HUGE positive impact on the crypto and ICO space, and also for all the new investors entering this space. We also wouldn't mind showing the rest of the world that we can govern and regulate ourselves! --> #WeCanRegulateOurselves  So in short, we want to make a positive impact on the growing crypto community (yes, while we all make money). We want to be the standard for future ICOs. We want to bring transparency and legitimacy to the ICO market. We want to combine the ""power of many"" to craft well deserved and responsibly gained influence.  We are also working out a strategy for running an Interactive Coin Offering. Vitalik and Jason's Whitepaper on this was very inspiring, but came long after we set plans for the ICO. We dumped ALL OF OUR PLANS and went back to the drawing board last week. (potential for ICO ""raincheck"" is extremely small, but we want to make sure we are doing this correctly and will push back the ICO if deemed the right thing to do)  EDIT: We have since decided to move forward with our original dates. Before the pre-sale starts we will run a bug bounty on the pre-sale and mainsale smart contracts, which currently represent the standard Initial Coin Offering protocol. We are currently still working on a mainsale which follows the InteravtiveCO protocol, and when this is completed, we will be running a third party code audit, bug bounty, and of course the smart contract will be published for all to see before the mainsale begins.  WHAT AM I SPECIFICALLY HOPING TO GET FROM YOU GUYS? answers on the following...(although, just come with what your heart wants to) 1. What would you change to make it more ""you""? 2. Are we missing something huge? 3. What kind of questions are you sitting with after reading the Whitepaper? 4. What do you HATE about the project? 5. What do you LOVE about the project? 6. Would you be interested in joining our community?  So guys, I'm here to answer ALL questions. If you don't get an answer right away, I apologise, but I'll be checking in as often as possible. I will answer EVERY question you have. Transparency is key. We have nothing to hide.  Just know that our strategy has been crafted to be able to listen to you guys, the crypto community that cares about the health of the community, that also enjoys making money on good investments, and finds satisfaction in helping others to do the same.  I already see one issue with the Whitepaper, but I'm missing reliable data to make a better statement. We say 10% of ICOs are scams, but now that number is WAY off. We just didn't want to seem like we were using scare tactics at the time, but these days it just seems like reality. Any details you find in the Whitepaper that should reflect a much higher % ratio of scams, 90% like I've seen many places, let me know!  This may be the first crypto project that is hoping to do a lot of the critical shaping in cooperation with the early believers. Hopefully we did a good job, and you'll see what I mean as you read the Whitepaper.  ONE LAST ""BEHIND THE SCENES"" INSIGHT We are purposely NOT NOT NOT flooding centralised giants like google and facebook with advertisements. The time from today until the project potentially goes online, is what will shape the rest of its life!!! Right now at this stage, we want to appeal to you guys and nobody else. We'll take care of ""social proof"" and mass marketing only after we have what's most important to us!  So the hard core, due diligence doing, Whitepaper scouring, long AF forum thread reading, HODL meme posting, Lambo grabbing, crypto community member, is by far, conceptually, the most important aspect. Coming in at a close second though is the REST of the community which would also benefit from us doing our thing, the way WE ALL envision doing it.  EDIT: since posting this we have run a successful campaign on Facebook, and have purchased advertising space on icoalert.com. Unfortunately in today's overfilled ICO space, it's basically impossible to get your word out, no matter how good it may be. This is a decision we stand for, and have decided to be transparent about it. You can decide if that was wrong of us or not   EDIT Google adwords has also been added to the list. On the one hand, it saddens me to feed the centralised giants that are Google and Facebook. On the other hand, we're getting tons of traffic and pre-sale registrations. it is what it is.  ONE LAST REMINDER I'm looking for constructive criticism. If enough people tell us we are doing it wrong, our ears are wide open and we are super flexible. We want to GET IT right. Not BE right!  I want to thank all of you for your time and feedback. It is very appreciated and positively welcomed! Remember to ask questions if you are unsure about ANYTHING! I hope you guys are half as excited about this as I am.  So if you think its share worthy, please by all means, let your friends know. Thanks again!  * Github links will be posted directly after our code audit * We are still working on the advisory board, so I apologise before hand. We can't disclose any names as of today. * Please come with solid reasoning for your opinions. Good, bad, or ugly! * Anyone interested in joining our team is welcome to contact me directly. Doesn't mean we'll say yes, but any die hard believer deserves a chance to prove themselves.   You can quote me on everything I've stated in this post.  AND IT'S TIME!

I'm really glad you like the concept. Not to boast or anything, but we've literally poured our hearts and souls into crafting a concept we think the hard-core crypto community both needs and would enjoy being a part of. We've also gotten a lot of positive feedback from the ""classical"" investor community in our network here in Norway and Western Europe, but like I said, we really need to appeal to you guys here first. So, its very nice to hear that this community sees this as something positive. At least the few that have posted so far. Lucas, I appreciate you commenting  As far as the ""physical"" product goes, we have started some minor development of the actual platform, but it's mostly mockups and user stories right now. We've funded the project ourselves up until this point. The 2 reasons we needed to wait with product development are as follows; The first is mainly because we will be funding all of our development costs as part of the pre-sale event. The second reason is actually the most important. We really want to involve our early believers as much as possible. We have a set of features we know we will make, but there's always a possibility for doing more, especially if the community can, as a community, get behind the ""wants and needs"" of the community. Haha. A lot of community here, but that's the whole point.  As far as bounty program, yes! On page 24 of the Whitepaper you can see how we plan to allocate all funds. During the pre-sale we will be raising funds for product development(first iteration release is set for Q1 before the mainsale begins), media/marketing for the mainsale event, AUM (Assets Under Management), administration, early backers (yes we want to give back to our early believers right away), and last but not least a bug bounty.  Feel free to write about the project! We would absolutely welcome and appreciate the attention  BTW!! If you want to pre-register now, you can. We aren't excepting any contributions or investments until the pre-sale starts, but we are already keeping track of referrals. We have a referral program you can access on your profile page. That will be going from now until the ICO event is over. So basically, your unique referral code will give you the opportunity to start accumulating Karma. Which you can either use as weighted influence on the platform, or to sell back to BullToken in return for ETH(or both  ). For a blogger with a nice sized reader base, this will not only help us to reach more of those we are trying to reach, but you and all of your referrals will benefit too  Lucas, thanks again! Hope to hear back from you soon! Take care  Best Regards, Louie",False

That's a fantastic idea, and we do address that in our Whitepaper. On page 20, there's a paragraph with the heading ""Cryptocurrencies"".

What we have decided at this point is a maximum of 20% of our AUM (Assets Under Management) may be invested in what the Community believes to be strong and promising cryptos.

Awesome question! We appreciate the curiosity  In the ""Tokenomics"" section of the Whitepaper, on page 23, you can read about our ""buy-burn mechanism"". We have purposely decided to stay as far away as possible from fiat investment models(for reasons we all understand), and will therefore not be offering any dividends. BullToken is utility token, not a security meant for trading.  Our ERC20 token will be listed on major exchanges with the ticker symbol, BULL, and the way we will facilitate a deflation-situation is by buying BullTokens from the market and burning(destroying) them. At the end of each year the BullToken Investment Advisory Board (IAB) will propose multiple buy-burn strategies to the Community. We will then vote on how much of the year's revenue will go towards this purpose. The result is an increase in the value of BULL still remaining in the market, because of an artificial deflation-situation we as a Community create for ourselves.  Feel free to come back with some more questions like this! Even though we address it in our Whitepaper, I'm sure it's something many are wondering about, so thanks for asking  Have a nice day, stallon!  Best Regards, Louie",False
