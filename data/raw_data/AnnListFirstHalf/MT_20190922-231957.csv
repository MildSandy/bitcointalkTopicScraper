But I warned everyone about the risks and treated this type of earnings as a gamble and all the people who worked with me earned. Now I work in the field of cryptocurrencies which also bring not only high income, but also high risks. In addition to mining, I have my own pamp-group with which we collectively buy cryptocurrency and collectively sell it, and earn on it. For this reason, all the people who work with me constantly earn money and so many people turn to me for advice in this field. If you want to get into the team of successful people and start earning, then join us. Regards, Anton Zaitsev.",False

Mining company MoneyTechnology,"To be honest, I think your intentions are good but this really isn't a unique idea and has not been properly put together and prepared for us to make an informed decision.  The premise of your ICO and company, in general, is basically the same as cloud mining company Genesis mining (buy hash rate, get profit). All you've really done here, in my opinion, is added a blockchain feature to this concept and expected everyone to go crazy for it. Imagine, for one second, that I was looking at my computer, wanting to earn income by mining through a third party, and I came across your company, MoneyTechnology, and well-known company Genesis Mining. What would compel me to choose your company over a well-known cloud miner like Genesis Mining? What UNIQUE features - nevermind the ""it uses the blockchain"", I'm talking about unique features to the mining/cloud mining industry - does YOUR company have that makes you better than competitors like Genesis?  I would suggest you abandon this current idea, and rethink an even better one, something that could disrupt the mining/cloud mining industries. As well, your announcement page should be much more professionally designed and written if you are to expect any investments.  Thanks.",False

Mining company MoneyTechnology,"  Our team appreciates your opinion. The idea of mining is not a new one, but at the same time quite profitable. We came up with the idea of ICO not to be compared with other real or cloud mining companies. The idea was absolutely different. We have got great experience and good results in so-called home mining, people knew about us and suggested to enlarge our mining process to an industrial scale by investing tens of hundreds of dollars. Thats what we've done. Besides, we give an opportunity to people who don't have enough money to organize their own mining farm to be a part of the mining company. They can get as many tokens of MoneyTech as they can afford and then receive monthly dividents. So many people, so many minds. Everybody is good at what he is doing. This is our first ICO and probably something is not ideal, but we have taken it into account and use this knowledge in the following mining companies which we planning to do in Europe.

Mining company MoneyTechnology,"MoneyTech is going to launch ICO on June 28, 2017. In the pre-ICO period, we plan to give information on the leading portals devoted to blockchain technologies, videoconferencing with the opportunity to ask questions in real time, as well as presentation of the company development plan and acquaintance with the management team. Our mission Give everyone the opportunity to become the owner of a mining farm. Due to the high demand for components, this option is not available to everyone today, even if funds are available. In fact, every token holder becomes a co-owner of the company, as he gets the right to define the development strategy, receive dividends on a monthly basis and earn on the capitalization of crypto shares. Our plans We plan to equip the premise, which corresponds to its technical characteristics for mining on an industrial scale. At first stage 70 mining machines will be installed in this room: 35 of which will generate ETH and 35 — ZCash. After the change of ETH mining algorithm, the released capacity will be used for mining other liquid cryptocurrencies. The POS technology of mining will allow to continue generating ETH by means of home PC. Target audience People with small and medium income who are looking for a stable developing company with monthly paid dividends. It is very important for us that each token holder can express his opinion and apply his experience for the benefit of the development of our company. Business model According to the current rate of generated cryptocurrency and the complexity of mining algorithm, we plan to mine coins for 56,000 dollars a month. The generated coins will be distributed the following way: 50% — monthly paid dividends. 30% — monthly purchase of new equipment 15% — operating costs for maintaining farms 5% — founders’ income Due to the monthly purchase of the new equipment, we can achieve a real reasonable increase in token cost by 60% for the first year without taking into consideration the monthly paid dividends.
