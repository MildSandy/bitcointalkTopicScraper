with asterisks duplicate entire conversations, sometimes replacing only the poster names and times.  if i consider all of these accounts as fake and then count all of the posts made by them (not just the duplicates), they constitute 12.64% of all of the posts in this forum which precede this one.  some sites such as coingecko use the total number of posts to indicate the popularity of a coin - for example, see here : https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/taklimakan-network/social#panel., so the posts from these accounts can mislead people who are dong their own research before investing.  here are

Taklimakan Network swaps TKLN token to TAN token! The main reasons for swapping tokens are as following:   1. Many irrelevant functions will be excluded in TAN tokens, such as: double spending, ICO operation functions, toggleTransfers. Removing these functions will reduce transaction gas costs.   2. Smart contract of TKLN token has been repeatedly cloned. One of these fakes was added to the Yobit exchange, thereby affecting the price drop of the original token.   3. Many participants of bounty and airdrop campaigns were scammers. By creating fake accounts in various social networks and completing tasks they have received tokens. Consequently, they began to transfer them from multiple wallets to one and sold them at a greatly reduced price. But thanks to the blockchain's transparency, our monitoring system found those fraudsters who violated the rules of participation and suggested us to double-check all bounty / airdrop participants before sending them a TAN token. This measure would benefit true token holders and honest bounty / airdrop campaigners.  Conditions for obtaining TAN tokens:   21.01.2019 10:00 UTC We will make a snapshot. All token holders must have TKLN on their own ERC-20 wallets. If you have TKLN tokens on BitNaru exchange, you might withdraw them to ERC 20 compatible wallet or keep them on exchange balance. TAN tokens will be distributed accordingly. Then, in a few days, TAN tokens will be sent in the equivalent of 1: 1 (1 TKLN = 1 TAN). We will also preserve the TAN emission equivalent to the current TKLN emission.  Conditions for obtaining TAN tokens to bounty and airdrop campaigners:   In order to exchange TKLN token for a TAN token the token holder must fill in a google-form before 19.01.2019. Those who do not fill out the form will not receive new tokens, therefore we ask everyone to treat it with complete seriousness and understanding.  The form for the participants of the Bounty campaign - https://goo.gl/T6B4xh The form for the participants of the Airdrop campaign - https://goo.gl/35GZ6A  After the swap, the TKLN token will be deactivated!

First of all, we would like to express our great gratitude for your sincere interest and cooperation with our project. We truly appreciate it and want to preserve that close relations with our community going forward. We are happy to announce that soft cap of 5 mln USD has been reached during the main sale stage through your contributions to our project. We would like to congratulate all of you for such a great milestone that we accomplished together!  One more thing you might love to hear is that Alpha version of our product would be announced in the next couple of days with superior updates from demo version. Step by step, we are approaching to build absolutely unique and niche product for crypto markets. After long discussions and negotiations with team members and taking into account renewed strategy of our business, we came to the conclusion that main sale stage should be extended till the end of August. The reasons behind this decision is as follows: • As some of you might be aware current listing fees on major crypto exchanges are ridiculously high, whilst listing on small exchanges with no liquidity possess high reputational and investment risks for our token holders. Hence, to assure listing on major crypto exchanges the soft cap amount would not be sufficient, considering product development and marketing costs. • Moreover, according to our marketing strategy we would like to expand our product globally from initial stage. At the current stance, we have over 100 000 committed users of the platform, but to fuel our ample ambitions this number will be not sufficient. We are aiming to attract at least 1 mln users in the short term and certainly that might possess high marketing and product development costs.    Considering above facts and current market situation, we decided to reduce our hard cap to 17.5 mln USD, whilst tokens equivalent to 10 mln USD (200 mln TKLN tokens) would be kept in reserve fund for attracting new users to the platform and to compensate most active users. We would like to be transparent with our community and respect your opinion. Therefore, to keep it fair, we are glad to announce 20% bonus tokens for all token holders invested to our project during pre-sale and main sale stages. All payments from user who did not pass KYC will be refunded and payments to airdrop and bounty holders will be distributed within 2 weeks. If you have any questions, please contact support@taklimakan.io Thanks for your understanding and believe in our project. We are happy that we reached a great milestone of soft cap with assistance of our community. But given the ambitions and necessity of the project in this market we would love to bring it to the new heights together with you. Stay tuned!",False

Be careful.  We want to warn you about the fraudulent activities which periodically occurs on the Yobit crypto exchange. Taklimakan Network’s ICO main sale started on 9th of April and will continue for 2 months. On 27th of April we were surprised to see that our token was already added to the Yobit crypto exchange. They put an official post on their twitter account announcing that our token and other tokens like Binance (BNB), LAMBO (LAMBO) and Loom Network (LOOM) are listed on their exchange.   Subsequently, we have appealed to the support service of Yobit crypto exchange, but the answer was never received. On 8th of May the active trade with TKLN tokens began with a daily volume of 127 BTC and a total issue of 1 billion. All our tokens were allegedly transferred to this exchange and were traded at price tens of times cheaper than the price for ICO.  We declare that the Yobit crypto exchange, or someone else, has created a duplicate of our smart contract and has released TKLN fake tokens that cannot be used in the Taklimakan Network ecosystem and accordingly our original tokens cannot be launched on Yobit.

Be careful.  We want to warn you about the fraudulent activities which periodically occurs on the Yobit crypto exchange. Taklimakan Network’s ICO main sale started on 9th of April and will continue for 2 months. On 27th of April we were surprised to see that our token was already added to the Yobit crypto exchange. They put an official post on their twitter account announcing that our token and other tokens like Binance (BNB), LAMBO (LAMBO) and Loom Network (LOOM) are listed on their exchange.   Subsequently, we have appealed to the support service of Yobit crypto exchange, but the answer was never received. On 8th of May the active trade with TKLN tokens began with a daily volume of 127 BTC and a total issue of 1 billion. All our tokens were allegedly transferred to this exchange and were traded at price tens of times cheaper than the price for ICO.  We declare that the Yobit crypto exchange, or someone else, has created a duplicate of our smart contract and has released TKLN fake tokens that cannot be used in the Taklimakan Network ecosystem and accordingly our original tokens cannot be launched on Yobit.

A series of live presentations took place as part of extensive roadshow covering different geographical locations.  CEO of the project Rashid Yussup and Business Analyst Berik Yernazar were presenting the project in front of big audience.  Hong Kong is a special autonomy within the Demographic People Republic of China, which was under colonial rule of British empire for over 100 years  . This aspect forms a completely unique blend of business styles, traditions, and also leaves an imprint on all aspects of Hong Kong's business activity. In just three days, we presented our project to investors from Hong Kong, China, Morocco, the UK and Singapore.  Hong Kong is called the gateway to China. Many Chinese crypto investors act through Hong Kong. And the meetings held by the project attracted investments from this location. Such investment channels will require additional work, but in the end they will surely bear fruit according to team members.  Berik Yernazar successfully delivered a presentation of the project at the international blockcahin conference called """"Financial system and hi-tech: new strategies of investment"""", held on April 26 in the start-up center """"The Wave"""" in Hong Kong. Visitors from different countries appreciated the presentation approach and contacted with the team for further collaboration opportunities.  Agreements were made to promote the Taklimakan Network project in Asia. The team expects a significant return from Asian investors for its ICO, which officially began on April 9 and will commence on June 9 of this year.  Hurry up to participate in this promising ICO.

Taklimakan Network and CCINT have entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that will enable us to collaborate on our research and development efforts. MOU will allow both companies to expand product development and marketing capabilities.  Taklimakan Network was conceived as a knowledge portal that provides tools sophisticated enough to attract skilled traders and analysts who are willing to share their knowledge within the ecosystem. CCINT aims to be the go-to platform for accessing immediate media sentiment data and analysis. As with Taklimakan Network, their project is powered by a utility token (also known as CCINT). The CCINT token provides access to current data and a quantitative analysis of sentiment values in the media about various exchanges and tradable tokens. Data is aggregated using their unique natural language processing technology, which is then quantified to deliver a range of data feeds with the lowest latency rates possible. Token holders will be able to bid on the lowest latency feeds, while delayed feeds will eventually be available for anyone to access.  The MOU was signed by Taklimakan Network and CCINT in order to lay out a framework for collaboration, since both companies’ research and development programs aim to address various trading signals applied to blockchain technology. We further along our start-up roadmap, as we have launched our ICO, as well as a demo version of our platform. Our CEO and co-founder, Rashid Yussup welcomes this new relationship with CCINT, which is a platform that dovetails perfectly with the aims of his company’s overall project. “Taklimakan Network is being developed so that anyone anywhere can become a player in the cryptocurrency economy,” he says. “Our strategic relationship with CCINT will help us to expand the offering for our top-skilled expert community members in terms of low latency media sentiment and analysis. For our part, we are working to create an audience of traders and investors who will search out tools like CCINT’s in order to increase their trading success.”  Bram Stalknecht, CEO CCINT.IO, says that he is pleased to collaborate with the Taklimakan Network. “The Taklimakan Network provides true value to its user base by bringing in the wisdom of the trading crowd, while limiting risk in this volatile market”, Bram says. “CCINT’s unique sentiment signal provides additional trading knowledge, before the market moves.”  CCINT plans to launch their ICO later this year.

Taklimakan Network is an investment educational platform for interaction of traders, investors, analysts, and managers through the channel of communication between beginners and experts. The main services of the platform include the following: a social network for crypto community professional and beginner members; aggregation of general information and news on cryptocurrencies; the analytical center where analysts conduct analysis of the crypto market and ICO projects; education center with a library for professional development; trading instruments consisting of trading signals, strategies and recommendations from the platform traders; investment pools with an integrated rating system for managers; collective forecasting (collective voting system); the intra-platform payment system.  The launch of the platform alpha version for testing is scheduled for April-June 2018, according to roadmap. The project’s GitHub page contains the code of the smart contract for the crowdsale. Information about the independent safety audit of the smart contract is missing in official sources of the project.  Part of the team responsible for the development has more than 10 years of experience. Its members are representatives of the company UseTech, that is listed on the Taklimakan Network project's website. UseTech has implemented solutions for a number of large and well-known Russian companies in its portfolio.  The only means of payment within the Taklimakan Network is the ERC20 TKLN token. Participants will be able to pay for subscriptions to analytical materials, trading signals, and strategies or individual expert advice with the help of TKLN. In addition, TKLN owners will have the opportunity to vote for innovations introduced on the platform.  All funds received from the TKLN token sale will be placed on escrow accounts and transferred to the team in accordance with the roadmap, that will limit the risks for investors.  Taklimakan Network is implemented in highly competitive promising fields of crypto trading and investments in cryptocurrency portfolios and ICO projects. The main feature of the project is the complexity, simplicity and variability, that will ensure the functionality of the platform. The launch of MVP is scheduled for April-May 2018. Professionals and newcomers will have motivational incentives for effective interaction within the project. The legal structure of the company is transparent, and the use of an escrow is realized to reduce investment risks. The main disadvantage is the incomplete competition strategy, that can become critical for further development in a highly competitive field.

Be careful, no one is immune from mistakes. But still, knowing the basic principles mistakes can be avoided. Speacialist in analytics Kyle Proto conducted a detailed analysis of cryptomarket, revealing several key areas where traders make cognitive distortions in thinking. 1) Accessibility heuristic refers to a process in which a trader assesses a situation depending on how easily such situations appear or pop up in memory. 2) The anchor effect, or binding effect, lies in the fact that in the process of assessing the situation, especially when it comes to numerical values, traders ""tie"" their opinion to some estimates that were obtained earlier. 3) Bias of confirmation. Traders tend to encircle and limit themselves only with information that would confirm their own view. These prejudices deprive new investors of the opportunity to make an objective assessment of the market reality and do not allow to take into account all important aspects of the current situation. 4) The error effect, the player is often faced with in gambling, sports, business and even in everyday life. This effect reflects a widespread misunderstanding of the randomness of events. According to the player's mistake, people will unjustifiably overestimate the probabilities of random events, which ""have not been there for a long time"" 5) The illusion of control is expressed in the tendency of investors to believe that they can somehow influence the events taking place in the market, which objectively do not depend on them or depend to a much lesser degree.",False

Now, let's discuss several lifehacks which will help newcomers minimize their risks. Before investing in a promising project or currency- make a careful investigation: 1) White paper. The mission, goals and project main objectives  Assess its actual value in the market. 2) The team. Study the project's whole team, find out what kind of specialists they are. What kind of experience and reputation they have in the market. 3) Advisors. Another important component of the team is its advisers. Make the same research for them. 4) Study the project listings and ratings, read articles about it on third-party resources. If there is not much information- the team professionalism could be doubted. 5) Listen to yourself. Why do you want to invest in this project? Is this an impulsive decision? Did you just like the project or your decision is based on a solid research for all of the 4 points?  And the most important question is whether this investment will benefit you. Of course, luck is also an important aspect of an investing, but it is careful analysis and logic which significantly increase the chance of it. #blockchain #cryptocurrency #bitcoin #ethereum #ICO #trading #Taklimakan",False
