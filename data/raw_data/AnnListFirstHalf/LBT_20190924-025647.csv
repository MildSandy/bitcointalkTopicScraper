Unfortunately, attracted funds are not enough for the development of such a project. We come to a decision to return all cash to ICO investors within the next 14 working days from the date of this statement. The cash we have received during Pre-sales as well as our own internal funds was spent for ICO preparation, marketing activity and promotion. So these funds are nonreturnable. Loanbit will develop further only under a new name. We now plan to launch our platform during the 4th quarter of 2018. This new platform will have slightly different features from the one we envisaged in our ICO’s whitepaper but will achieve its aims of providing a global, fair and representative P2P Crypto lending and exchange platform. So it’s only pause not the end. All Pre-sales investors are able to withdraw LBT in your dashboard. In the future you can exchange your LBT to new tokens of rebranding platform. LBT will not be listed in any exchange in view of returning cash to ICO investors. We always value support. All our many supporters who have joined our Airdrop and Bounty Campaigns and who have worked hard to spread the news about LoanBit all these months will received new tokens upon launch our platform during the 4th quarter of 2018. We always value all of your past support and we hope for continuing support, so keep following us in our current social media, Telegram chats and don’t forget to visit our website for new developments.

It will be convenient for investors, borrowers and traders. Investor with BTC will be able to convert and  invest into Eth or USD loan. Trader will be able to receive trading loan when he needs additional working capital. 2. Safety fund. One of the important advantages of the LoanBit platform is a safety fund for partial insurance of loan granted on the platform. The existence of a safety fund will attract more investors to LoanBit.
