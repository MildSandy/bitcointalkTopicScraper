I think the main thing for the project now is to see SME and Taurion released.  After that, then it makes more sense to look at exchanges. The game releases will make listing much easier as the exchanges will see the concrete results and have greater faith in the project and its potential.  But, that's just my personal take on it. I'm looking long term as I fully expect us to be around for a very long time.  I think perhaps THE major hurdle is for people to actually understand what blockchain is, and then to understand what we're doing with it. Nobody else is doing what we are. It's unique and the nuances are not always easy to explain.  For example, exactly how computationally complex games are possible on XAYA but not possible on Ethereum is very clear to me, but explaining that requires certain background information that I think many people are lacking. That makes explaining it difficult. The tl;dr there is that computation is done ON the blockchain in Ethereum in smart contracts, but XAYA offloads computation OFF the blockchain so you don't run into things like it being impossible to have a chess game because check mate is too computationally expensive and gas prices would be insane. That offloading of computation is really important for computational scalability.  I believe that we'll see CHI on CMC, but just not right now.",False

Specifically, we’ve been working to integrate human readable .luxe addresses for use with Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses, which aren’t human readable.  Minds + Machines Group Limited (MMX) is a leading domain registry centered around geographic, professional occupation, consumer interest, outdoor activity, and generic top-level domains, e.g. .london, .law, .cooking, .yoga, .fishing, .vip, etc.       XAYA is proud to partner with MMX in order to help bring their customers new functionality that integrates traditional domain names with blockchain technology.  MMX will add in functionality for .luxe domains to contain special data, such as Bitcoin addresses for payments, contact information, and other data. This data will be stored on the XAYA blockchain while .luxe-enabled wallets and applications will read that data and provide secure and seamless integration of .luxe domain names with blockchain technology.  Blockchain Gaming Alliance  We are proud to announce that we have joined the BGA, an important industry association for games that incorporate blockchain technology.  http://blockchaingamealliance.org/     The Blockchain Game Alliance (BGA) is a coalition of game and blockchain companies committed to advocating for blockchain technologies within the game industry since it offers significant opportunities for innovation. The BGA provides an open forum for stakeholders to share knowledge and collaborate on research which fosters new ways to create, publish, and play games.

The game design has changed massively and it's going to be really exciting. It's also being re-branded - and the new name for the game is:  Soccer Manager Elite.  A bit of unreleased information - The Game will only allow up to 300 Managers of the teams... BUT... the game is still playable by 10000s+.

You can keep up to date on the Treat Fighter forum section.  XayaID XID  We've finished the first implementation of XayaID. You can read the readme here > https://github.com/xaya/xid  In a nutshell - his allows for the creation of secure IDs on XAYA to login to websites, games, chat systems and more.  We have already implemented this into ejabard opensource XMPP server. https://www.ejabberd.im/  This will allow for secure real-time chat (and other things like trading and more..) in and out of games using your XayaID. It will also allow for encrypted end to end chat using Xaya's blockchain for security and human readable names along with the scalability of XMPP.  You will know that the person you are talking to IS that player and with encryption, your plotting and plannings won't be eaves dropped..  Group, faction, global chats.. ejabberd is used by large players in the gaming space, such as CCP for their chat system in Eve Online.

There is a new update for the XAYA wallet. This fixes the wallet crashing after restarting it which was due to a new stratum mining pool and some changes that were done in the last hardfork to make it possible to mine with stratum with XAYA's unique Triple Purpose mining technique > https://github.com/xaya/xaya_docs/blob/master/mining.md  This update requires you to sync from scratch so you will need to delete your chain. In the electron wallet you can go to settings and press delete chain. If you are using another client you probably know what to do. Just don't delete your wallet..  You can download the updated Electron and QT wallets here:  Electron >> https://github.com/xaya/xaya_electron/releases  1.1.1a QT/xayad >> https://github.com/xaya/xaya/releases 1.1.1  The good news is that there is now a new pool launching where you can mine CHI http://bsod.pw/ with stratum.  The miner details will be released very shortly  Kind regards,False

XAYA is unique in that it is the only gen 3 blockchain geared towards blockchain gaming. That means it's the only project, right now, taking on massively scalable blockchain gaming in every capacity. Treat Fighter is showing us that the system works, and the growing community of gamers participating and profiting from XAYA gaming will only grow. Keep in mind that Soccer Manager Crypto will be unveiled very soon, and the team has also mentioned they are cooking a game of their own.  Before you know it we'll be joined by developers curious about blockchain gaming that will inevitably choose the platform that allows them to develop in the languages they are comfortable, rather than trying to maneuver their way around Solidity or other universal languages that seriously aren't designed to build games. Of course, this growth will also be accompanied by the addition of game channels, which are a novel tech for the crypto space in general, not just for gaming.  Anyways, I think 2019 is going to prove to be an amazing year for XAYA where we all get to enjoy some of the first full fledged blockchain games that are, above all, fun to play (while also very rewarding $$)",False

The Growth Engine will enable XAYA to continually grow our community and provide targeted activities for members to stay engaged with one another and the XAYA team.  The Growth Engine is the collection of tools that Refereum used to orchestrate a successful coin offering that focused on community development and engagement. Refereum maintains one of the largest Telegram communities, and holds the achievement as the first blockchain company in Telegram to reach the maximum population of 100,000.  The Refereum Growth Engine allows XAYA to unify community, modes of communication, and promote engagement through the gamification of user activities. The gamification involves awarding points for simple activities: signing up on our forum, retweeting and sharing content, referring new users to join our Telegram and our social networks, among other actions. Accrued points for each individual will rank them among different tiers and as top community members. Points will accumulate throughout the duration of each campaign. The initial campaign will last until the start of the main sale, on August 29. At the end of the campaign, rewards of CHI token will be designated to each tier and Chi tokens will continue to increase the following campaign, further rewarding active community members.  Through this initiative, XAYA is aiming to grow into a massive, active community of avid gamers and game developers. Very soon, these activities will expand to incentivize user-based content creation, such as meme submissions,video and article creation.  The main sale will run from August 29th to October 10th on the Qryptos cryptocurrency exchange. These are just the first of many exciting events for XAYA, and with the help of Refereum’s Growth Engine, we’re excited to grow and engage our gaming community in meaningful ways. https://medium.com/@XAYA/xaya-partners-with-refereums-growth-engine-ce1ae6b1ecc4",False

The only downside of doing so would be that HUC holder on Polo would have to manually register themselves through that interface to claim their coins and you would have to manually exclude Polo from the airdrop.

Now or after the main sale?  I can talk to Polo (now Circle). I think it's likely they will help with distribution in some way as Tristan originally said. They probably just want to let a little time pass to make sure everything is smooth. Maybe they are running it by ""legal"" as well.

As the scope of the Chimaera project has expanded, we’re entering into new areas where there are projects and companies with similar names. With the best interests of the project at heart, we’ve decided to rebrand the project in order to avoid confusion and limit potential legal issues further down the line.  Additionally, Chimaera represents a project that is cutting-edge, blazing fast, and truly a pioneer in its industry. This project is the future of gaming, and the name should read as such. With that, we are pleased to announce that Chimaera is being rebranded as Xaya. Hopefully the community will share our enthusiasm for the new name and brand. The rebranding is purely cosmetic and has no effect on any technical capabilities.  Xaya is pronounced “zay-yah”. The ‘X’ is the same as the Greek letter CHI (X), and Xaya will retain CHI as its currency ticker.    Xaya Mainnet to Go Live  We are pleased to announce that the mainnet will go live at 3 pm UTC+2 (CEST) Friday the 13th of July.  With this, game developers can begin looking into the project and brainstorm ideas on how they can take advantage of the Xaya platform and ecosystem.  The reserve currency and “fuel” for the Xaya ecosystem is CHI, its native cryptocurrency.  Wallets will be available for download and those wishing to mine will be able to do so.    This is an important milestone for the Xaya project.  Further details on the wallets, mining and more will be available shortly.",False

Almost a year ago the CHIs were due to be released 'soon' and now all I can see on the CHI website and their newsletters are promotional content for their endless ICOs (pre-sale, closed public pre-sale and so on... ironic of course ;-))... I said it already but I hope the team is not losing focus on the initial goal which is to build the project as for almost a year I haven't heard about any technical update  From the outside it starts to look more and more like a dead project, desperately moving its arms to keep it from drowning (in that case that means struggling to raise funds after the storm).  In September last year I was already telling that time to market is critical... if they miss the 'wave' its too late so don't get me wrong I still hope they deliver but I'm sharing my thoughts with the community and hope it will help us get some more technical updates instead of the almost year long financial ad campaign... Deliver a good project and money will come, remember what you did with HUC, no need for crazy ICOs, you missed the timing for that (ICOs) so focus on the product as it alone can save the project.

I can take into account bad fees during the fall of bitcoin, but now when the situation starts to improve, to collect for about half a year about $ 2 million, it seems to me this is a failure (given your bonuses on the presale). While other projects for a month gain $ 10-20-30 million, you probably will not be able to do it for a year. I do not say anything about the quality of the project and the idea, but you mast understand that this should not be so, you can see somewhere that a gross planning error was committed.

Reasons for that are richly diversed, but it doesn't take away the underlying tech, the legitimacy of the project, the integrity of the people behind Chimaera and the hard work they put in. Chimaera is flying under the radar, but it's mainly due to the fact, that they concentrate on developing rather than creating all kinds of hype with a non-product like other projects do. So the average get-rich-quick investor might be disappointed, but everyone who is doing a bit of research should be excited of what is to come in the future.  The numbers you mentioned for hardcap are not valid anymore - those were the numbers from crypto-craze last autumn and early winter and we all know how the markets have been going since then. Hardcap was reduced to something between $20mln to $30mln (depending on BTC price) and there is literally no softcap; Chimaera will be developed no matter the outcome of the ICO. All unsold CHI will be burned and the sold CHI will be around 40% of total supply (40% mining, 20% for team, advisors, legal costs, bounty, bonus etc.). So you as an investor shouldn't worry about what has been raised in the ICO; you should only care about the tech and there is no doubt that Chimaera belongs right there where all those wannabe hype-projects pretend to be.

We have done very well thus far in that:  We have done everything pretty much in house.  What you find with the ICOs in 2018 that raise 50 million or 10 million is they put in millions for marketing in which the entire plan of their project is to make money from the ico with no need for the blockchain in their project. No one really needs 50 million.. or 10 million.. We did not want to risk spending all raised funds on marketing when we could actually do what we needed to do with what we have.  We have self funded the project thus far because we believe in it.  Most icos now receive funds from private backers who want equity and kickbacks. We turned down all VCs and we have none on board which is a massive achievement in itself. We never brought anyone else in, by choice. And we had several opportunities for selling our souls.  Without mentioning any names..a recent gaming project raised around 17 million. 15 million of it was from 2 people who run the company. they only raised 2 million in the public sale.  We've got this far from Hard work by ourselves for a project that works and needs blockchain. You won't find a dedicated team and blockchain project like this one elsewhere anytime soon.  This isn't a popup ICO erc20 token project.  Note that the 155btc from the private sale was worth nearly double at one time  Secondly there was no marketing for the private sale pretty much. 80% came from people who have followed us in the blockchain space for several years as they know what we are capable of.  The hardcap is about 15million I believe.   Hope this helps.",False

There is literally nothing you have to do to get your SMC, this is what Andy (snailbrain) wrote about it in telegram:  Quote How it will work (probably) for you to receive SMC is :  The address you enter in the Token Page for Chimaera (when the wallet is released) will need to be kept safe until SMC is released.  You will then be sent a special coin/name (similar to a namecoin name) which will hold both the coins you are owed and the legendary player.  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  For anyone doubting the Chimaera project, here is some statement from Andy about how are things are going and what is up for Chimaera in the future:  Quote We will deliver and it will be better than you could imagine. Making blockchain games on Chimaera will be simple and orders of magnitude more powerful than on other platforms.  We've been a little slow with documentation etc as we've been all hands on the ico with everything you see done all in house. Daniel Kraft our lead developer only becomes full time on June the 1st. He's currently in the last couple of weeks working for Google in Switzerland.  We've taken some wage cuts as we are passionate about the project and have what it takes to make this a success. We have had 4 of us working full time for over a year unpaid.  We've also have plans for some amazing games which make uses of game channels that are going to blow your mind, be fun, competitive and immersive.  We also wanted to focus marketing etc on blockchain gaming .. but Chimaera can be used for dapps and other things which are again much more powerful that other things on the market.  We are also only in the presale and we will be discussing how to proceed into the main sale or if we leave a private sale open in the coming period. For example.. it would be more smart to raise extra funds once we have some examples and documentation etc in place to show what we are capable of to those that don't know our experience in the scene.",False

That bit Andrew mentioned about dapps is hinted at in the White Paper, but never explained.  And the level of power and flexibility in there for dapps is just beyond crazy. Really, there are no limits. Or rather, the only limits are what you can imagine and actually write code for.  Here's one bit from in the Chimaera Telegram channel:   Quote Q > Hi, I am wondering for Chimaera if there is any information on whether there is a programming language involved with making a blockchain based game. Thanks!  A > Chimaera is language agnostic. So if you can build a game with a language, and that language has the proper tools to interface with the Chimaera API, then you can use that language.  So, for example, you can't program a game for Chimaera with HTML 4.0 because it's a declarative language. However, if you have a rendering surface for that HTML 4.0, and you have another language that can interface with the API, then you can use HTML 4.0 as part of your toolchain for a game.  Some languages that are commonly used for games include C++, C#, Delphi (less now), Python, etc.  If we want to go really wild and freaky, anyone with the skills to do a port and recompilation could create gamified dapps for smart whitegoods. That is, you could put Chimaera blockchain games on a refridgerator or washing machine. (Most likely you'd want to run with Tizen and target manufacturers like Samsung.)  However, some platforms are locked down and not open to third party developers without an agreement with the manufacturer. Automotive is like that.  Now, I don't think it would really be a good idea to just do some of these things ""just because you can"" as it would largely be just for learning and fun. Few people will want to run gamified dapps on their smart appliances. At least for now. That's coming in a few years though. Maybe 5. Maybe 10. But it's coming.  In any event, that just puts the versatility of Chimaera into a bit of perspective.  To be more practical, just look at your average, run-of-the-mill languages people use for games right now. As above, C++, C#, Python, ASM (assembly), Java, HTML 5 + JavaScript, etc. Quite often a variety of languages are used for varying reasons, e.g. you might use a functional language such as F# for some DSP if it gets you a good enough performance boost (which is a good bet in many cases).",False

With this implementation, thousands of leagues and players can be supported via a serverless network using blockchain technology.  Different than other games, Soccer Manager delivers a blockchain-based approach, players have complete ownership of their football credits, players, stadiums, and any value in the game are all capable of being transferred, traded, or sold. For the first time in history, gamers can utilize a real transfer market, where every win they achieve carries a real-world value.  The platform is run on a Blockchain platform, the Chimaera blockchain, that takes blockchain gaming one step further than just secure asset storage and management. Chimaera allows the actual game worlds to run simultaneously on the blockchain. This advance in technology provides users with ease-of-play, no need for servers, and no downtime.

Our team was flooded with fantastic questions by event-goers, and our team was beyond excited to chat with fellow crypto enthusiasts about our latest project updates.  CIS is the largest crypto and blockchain event for investors in the United Kingdom. It attracts a wide range of people from industry veteran and angel capital investors, to crypto beginners and the crypto-curious looking to find out what all the buzz is about. The hall was packed, and it was clear that more people showed up for CIS than there were tickets.  Andrew, Nick and Ayalies explained to exhibition attendees about the problems that Chimaera solves, and the new gaming genres and markets that it enables. Our booth was incredibly busy, and people often waited for several minutes to get a chance to talk to one of the team members. We received a lot of very good questions. Attendees found Human Mining and DAUs (decentralised autonomous universes) of particular interest, with their next questions most often either where they could purchase CHI or when they could get access to the SDK/API and developer tools.  When asked, “what is Chimaera,” Andrew Colosimo explained, “At a very high level, Chimaera is a blockchain gaming platform that provides the tools game developers need to host entire game worlds on the blockchain. These games can range from simple turn based card games to entire VR worlds that we call Decentralised Autonomous Universes. It facilitates new gaming genres and never-before-seen gaming economies where real wealth creation enables play-to-earn gaming models.”  He continued, “At the heart of Chimaera is the blockchain. What we’re doing simply isn’t possible without it. For us, blockchain technology isn’t some novel way to launch a project; extending blockchain possibilities is the project. Our past creations and innovations in blockchain technology include methods to eliminate fraud entirely, called Atomic Trading, and a method to reach near infinite scalability for games and MMOs, which we call Game Channels.”  We are excited about the token sale starting on March 23rd and will be joining other industry events and exhibitions in the coming weeks.  https://medium.com/@Chimaera_Tech/chimaera-exhibits-at-crypto-investor-show-9af71a850ecd",False

We're happy to announce that the Chimaera private sale has sold out.  Over the term of the private sale, we've been primarily working on organising everything for the pre- and main sale, as well as Chimaera Core mainnet. All our traffic this year in the run-up to the end of the private sale was organic, so we're pleased to see the private sale sell out.

Funding for the pre-sale is overwelmingly through our primary multi-sig address, with a small number of funds arriving through other channels.  Exact numbers will be announced in a few days once we've tallied everything. In the meantime, we estimate that about 15.3 million CHI were sold.

There are some coins that didn't have a pre-mine and were good, but... they're often either gone or relegated to the crypto-history dustbin of distant memory and obscurity. Development takes time and effort, and everyone has bills to pay.  For actual crypto projects, the ICO route can be a fantastic way to launch a good product/project. Right now it has the obvious problem of being diluted with a huge amount of noise and very little signal. Everyone and their grandmothers have jumped on the ICO bandwagon, which makes it much more difficult to get any traction for real crypto projects.

Loyalty programs for publicly traded companies don't need a blockchain. They're inherently centralized anyways, so decentralization only adds on the negatives of decentralization with none of the advantages. Or, at least I can't see any strong advantage (technical advantage that is), other than perhaps, like, well... hey... a 50% jump in stock price is pretty sweet.  I don't know if it's realistic for projects to get launched the way they used to. Things have changed a lot.

While Chimaera does have a currency, CHI, it's a complete platform to fully decentralise games entirely.  Now, that doesn't mean that a game that uses Chimaera must be decentralised. There are options for devs there, and they can use as much or as little of the platform as they like.  As far as I know, right now Chimaera is the only project of its kind. There are some projects that have some of the same features, e.g. a cryptocurrency, but none actually let you put a game on the blockchain.   All that being said, some of the unique things you can do with Chimaera are pretty wild. Are you familiar with Huntercoin? Chimaera lets anyone create a game with that sort of economy, i.e. one where in-game assets have real world value. Now, while Huntercoin is a relatively simple game, you can probably imagine how that economic paradigm could be used in other games. The possibilities are as exciting as they are endless.

They are entirely different, and both will exist alongside each other.  We can't say for certain that CHI will be listed on Poloniex. Only the people at Poloniex can say that. However, I don't think that it's out of line to say that we believe CHI has significant utility, and will be attractive to more than enough people for one or more exchanges to list it.  MobileGo is quite different from Chimaera. The primary aim there is to provide a payment gateway system. From their White Paper:  Quote After two years of development with gaming industry leaders, Datcroft LTD., Gamecredits is near completion of development of the first crypto mobile gaming store. This mobile gaming store has a proprietary payment gateway that allows gamers to use Gamecredits to buy in-game content. Gamecredits can be acquired with credit cards and other local payment methods within this gateway. Over 300 games from 150 developers are already signed on and the Gamecredits Mobile Store is scheduled to release in early Q2 of 2017.  The MobileGo crowdsale and MobileGo token issuance will help fund marketing and branding of the Gamecredits’ Mobile Store and the development of smart contract technology within the platform using the Ethereum blockchain.  MobileGo tokens will be used to gamify the mobile platform, and to incentivize gamers for loyalty and participation through rewards. MobileGo tokens will also allow for smart contract technology. MobileGo tokens will allow for the development of a decentralized virtual mobile gamer marketplace, the ability for gamer vs. gamer decentralized match play, and decentralized tournaments run on smart contracts.  They also plan to do a decentralised marketplace, decentralised tournaments, and decentralised matchmaking.  Chimaera gives developers the power to put entire game worlds on the blockchain where they can run unstoppably without servers. It also includes tools for developers to create provably fair games, which, if you follow the rabbit, leads to provably scarcity (or lack thereof). This means that items can have an easier to determine value, and thus be valued higher (there's no friction due to risk).  Chimaera also offers a lot more, e.g. decentralised trading, etc.  As for Bittrex, they will list what they feel best fits their customer base. CHI may fit there, but only the people at Bittrex can determine that.  I hope that helps.",False

Huntercoin started with human mining, which means the coin is paying people to provide a complex input, in this case playing a game.  The significance of it is that game coins, which attract people who interact with the algorhythm and with the other people involved, are probably the first part of what crypto will eventually become. Bitcoin started with a useless algorhythm, then primecoin etc started with useful algorhythms that perform work for science. The next step is a more complex scientific coin that has constant input from large numbers of people and generates what some people call artificial intelligence.  Once this process becomes developed better with coins it will be a simple thing to make a coin that, for example, develops some field of mathematics very fast or accelerates some other science.  Games are fun, so they are a tool to attract people to a coin, but in this case the big payoff is not the game or the mechanics of using the coin. In 20 years there will probably not be any useless algorhythm coins, there will be simple science coins and more complex artificial intelligence coins, and they will be the cutting edge of every science.

Granted I haven't finished reading the WP yet so I don't know if this has been addressed in detail somewhere.   Mining details are going to be released later on.

On the other hand, Chimaera is truly gaming on top of the blockchain.  How will it scale? The cost of running smart contracts between players would skyrocket, right? Hi Bulletdodger,  The problem with scaling is solved through Chimaera's off chain game channels. We have developed game channels as an extension of bitcoin's payment channels. Game channels mean that the majority of game data takes place offchain, and therefore there is no need to ""purchase"" much if any blockchain space for games.

Here is one piece of advice.  Most recently there was the drama involving as I recall Wiggi and Mithril, both of whom are long time actively involved with Hunter.  My suggestion to Chimaera, and to you as primary conduit of opinions between supporters and developers, is to find a way to bring those two back on board, as a balance to whatever alienated them.  Recently Miramax has been in the news. A large corporation taken over by two brothers who managed to destroy their company because they did not have adequate respect for outside criticism, or circumvented it in a Machiavellian way.  Chimaera is just beginning, in fact has barely started, but it has the potential to be a very significant project, as long as it is forced to listen to all voices, all sides.  I never figured out the exact dispute that alienated previous members of this coin group but I have watched Huc long enough to recognize that it would benefit Chimaera to solve that problem in a way that does not exclude people previously involved with Hunter.  Any group ultimately has to serve its members and when it starts excluding, for whatever reason, any one member then it should give concern to others.  The big difference between fiat and crypto should be ideally that in crypto there is awareness that it is not a gang in charge, that it is not power or ambition that makes decisions.  So if you want to start with a big and difficult project, first figure out what the schism was and find a way to solve it without alienating or excluding any of the people who formed conflicting sides.  Fiat has always been based on the gangster ideal of controlling power by a few ""for the greater good"". Some little mafia who ""knows best"" takes control.  Crypto in many cases has repeated that mafia mentality, with a few exceptions. It is the notion that there is always a necessity to sacrifice certain individuals for the sake of the group.  That fiat mentality should be discouraged. It's sort of like how the United States began with a few people trying to find liberty, but has now become a country that imprisons more of its population than most dictatorships, and regularly executes 'lesser' people 'for the benefit of the other people'.  My suggestion would be to take a tiny percentage of the coin and commit it to providing a forum for dissenters, people who for whatever reason are no longer involved. That would set a fair standard for coins like Monero and Ethereum, both of which were built using force, dishonesty etc to grab marketshare.  I'm not criticizing Snailbrain, nor supporting those who left, rather just trying to push the new version of Huc in a sustainable direction. Any group, company, organzation, should be viewed as something that eventually will be sacrificed for individuals, rather than the other way around. It's a point well made in books like Orwell's 1984 and movies like Eco's The Name of the Rose, and many others, but for whatever reason almost always ignored in practice.",False

Following the pre-token event, a crowdsale of CHI tokens will take place to raise necessary funds and encourage community participation. The platform being worked on will eventually provide a complete set of tools to enable creatives and companies to create decentralized universes on a specifically built blockchain  The Chimaera platform has its own independent blockchain powered by CHI tokens, making use of the technology to reduce the costs involved in game development and deployment. The tokens are key to in-game economies, ensuring participation, engagement, and transaction of value between games. It also has a range of features that enables it to reduce the costs for developers, while increasing the scalability of games.   Everyone has been running non-stop.

This concept is pioneered by Huntercoin, but it leads to large growth of the blockchain and heavy resource requirements. In this paper, we present a new protocol inspired by payment channels and sidechains that allows for trustless off-chain interactions of players in private turn-based games. They are usually performed without requiring space in the public blockchain, but if a dispute arises, the public network can be used to resolve the conflict. We also analyze the resulting security guarantees and describe possible extensions to games with shared turns and for near real-time interaction. Our proposed concept can be used to scale Huntercoin to very large or even infinite worlds and to enable almost real-time interactions between players.  Keywords  Huntercoin; Virtual reality; Blockchain gaming; Payment channel; Off-chain interaction; Smart contract   It's not too long, and very much worth reading.

I'm very excited to share with everyone now an important improvement that we've made to the original game-channels concept, which will further boost Chimaera's ability for trustless off-chain games:  Improved Game Channels  Scalability is a critical difficulty for blockchains in general.  If one tries to put entire game worlds (like Huntercoin and Chimaera) onto a blockchain, this is even more true.  Therefore, off-chain solutions are critical for the future development and success of these projects.  A possible concept for off-chain interactions are game channels [1].  In the simplest case, they can be used to perform two-player, turn-based games.  It is possible to generalise the concept to other situations, but for the purpose of this post, we will consider this situation for simplicity.  (The same ways to generalise the concept as described in [1] can be applied, though.)  Roughly speaking, such a game works like this:  Both players send a transaction to the public blockchain which locks the prize money contributed by either player and fixes the conditions of their game as well as a key pair for each player. The actual moves in the game are sent privately between the two players, signed by their keys. Ideally, both players agree on the final outcome, and sign a release transaction together that pays the locked funds to the winning party. In case of a dispute (one of the players stops to send moves, sends an invalid move or claims that the opponent did any of that), a special ""dispute transaction"" is sent and mined into the public blockchain.  This transaction publishes all moves, so that the ""general public"" can verify the claim and determine who is correct. The disputed player gets a certain window of time to respond to the dispute, and may resolve it by sending a valid next move (again to the public blockchain).  In this case, the game continues privately between the two players as before. If no dispute resolution is mined before the deadline, the dispute is deemed successful by the network and the locked funds are paid to the disputing player.  In theory, this system enforces that the game is performed fairly and in a trustless manner.  No-one can abuse it to ""steal"" the locked funds without properly winning the game (or if the opponent stops to respond).  However, an attacker might repeatedly wait with sending a next move, let the opponent dispute, and then resolve the dispute.  This is not a ""rational"" behaviour, but it could be used to annoy players on the network and bloat the blockchain in a bid to discredit any project built on top of game channels.  This kind of behaviour would also force (both) players to repeatedly pay transaction fees to the miners for including their dispute and resolution transactions.  We believe that there is an evolution to game channels that fixes this issue.  Before we can describe this protocol, let us introduce ""ephemeral timestamps"" first -- the core technology that enables the improved game channels.  [1] http://www.ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/15  Ephemeral Timestamps  Ephemeral timestamps are a feature of a blockchain-based P2P network, which can satisfy these properties:  Nodes in the network can submit an arbitrary piece of data D for ""ephemeral timestamping"".  This gives them a timestamp for the current time T. At a later stage, the timestamps obtained can be used to prove to the network that another node knew (or could have known if it would have cared) D at time T.  Such proofs can, in particular, be used in the consensus rules for transaction verification. Such timestamps only need space in the blockchain when actually used later.  If not used, they burden the network only temporarily (processing cost and storage), but can be discarded after some time (thus ""ephemeral""). Similarly, timestamps are free for nodes to send.  Only using them later requires a transaction fee.  Nevertheless, miners still have an incentive to process all timestamps (or at least nodes can incentivise miners to process theirs).  The actual implementation of this feature looks like this:  A timestamp request sent to the network contains the data D a node wants to store, as well as an entry promising a certain fee upon usage of the timestamp in the future. Nodes on the network (in particular, miners) keep a memory pool for timestamp requests in addition to transactions. When building a block, the miner selects timestamp requests it likes (for a rational miner those with the highest fee promise), and creates a Merkle tree with them.  The Merkle root hash is included into the block. The full Merkle tree, on the other hand, is not part of the core block data.  Thus, at this point, the timestamps are not directly part of the blockchain, and do not cost any blockchain space (except for the constant overhead from the root hash). However, nodes expect blocks that are not too old to be accompanied with the full Merkle tree when they receive them over the network.  Otherwise, the block will be considered invalid.  (Roughly speaking, this should apply to all blocks the node receives while running ""fully synced"".  During the initial blockchain sync or when catching up after being shut down for some time, the node accepts blocks without the Merkle tree.)  Note that this does not cause issues with blockchain reorgs, either, if the time interval for which it is kept is not too short.  There is no fundamental harm in requiring the data to be kept for a day or a week (it is still ephemeral and won't lead to eternal blockchain growth), so that one can set the keep-time long enough to never see a reorg beyond that time. To actually use a timestamp, a node has to send a transaction that includes the Merkle branch linking the data it timestamped to one of the blocks in the chain.  This transaction also needs to pay at least the fee promised in the timestamp request to the miner that originally confirmed the request, otherwise it is invalid.  It may also need to pay an extra fee on top for confirming the transaction itself, of course.  Finally, let us discuss how this implementation satisfies the claims:  Since the full Merkle tree of timestamping data is sent around the network at the time when the block was originally propagated, every node in the network that follows the regular rules sees all data.  This guarantees in particular that it was able to know the timestamped data around the time the block was created.  (This assumes that no partitioning-attack is going on and that propagation of a new block throughout the network is relatively fast.  Both assumptions should be valid for a healthy P2P network.) The full Merkle tree can be discarded after some time, so that timestamp requests only burden the network temporarily and are not immediately part of the blockchain. When the timestamps actually need to become part of the blockchain to prove something for consensus purposes, the node is forced to pay an appropriate fee.  This incentivises miners to actually include high-promising requests into the ephemeral Merkle tree, since it creates at least some probabilistic expectation of earning the fee later.  (See the next section for some more discussion about the incentive structure.)  The Incentive with Fee Promises  Let us now discuss the incentive structure provided to miners by the ""fee promises"" attached to timestamping requests.  It is of course very important to give miners an incentive to include requests into their blocks, and it is not directly clear that this is possible without actually paying a fee for the mere request alone.  However, we believe that the system described above provides sufficient incentive for miners.  The idea is this: Even if a time-stamping request does not by itself pay the miner a fee, there is a certain probability p that the user creating the request will actually want to use it later (as otherwise it would be pointless to create the request in the first place).  p can actually be measured in a real system by the miners and/or the network.  Then, since the user needs to pay at least the promised fee F to the original miner upon usage of the timestamp, the miner can (on average) expect a gain of p F for confirming the request.  It can of course be that p is quite low, but this just means that the fee promise F needs to be high enough to compensate the marginal cost that the miner has (e.  g., in longer propagation time of its block).  Furthermore, we believe that this cost will be rather low, since the processing of timestamp requests should not be very expensive to the miner and the network.  However, one potential issue remains: Even if there is some overall average probability p that each request will be used later and thus actually pays fees, a particular user could still send an unlimited number of timestamp requests for free with the intent to just DoS the network and never pay any fees.  If this turns out to be a problem, we can solve it by limiting the rate at which individual users can send requests: We can require that each time-stamping request must be signed by the private key of an output holding some minimum amount M of coins, and allow each such output to be used only for one request in each block.  With a maximum number C of coins in existence, this implies a hard cap of C / M timestamp requests per block.  Thus, as long as there are at least some legitimate users in the system (which have a non-zero probability of using their timestamps later on), p will be bounded from below and thus provide a non-zero incentive to miners for including every timestamp request.  (Instead of a strict rule that each output may only do a single request per block, one could also leave the decision to the miners.  By requiring deposited coins, one adds ""valuable identities"" to the requests.  With that, miners themselves can decide upon the rate of requests they accept from each such identity, and how they limit spam.)  Finally, note that if the ephemeral timestamps are used in a setup for game channels as described in the introduction, then the security deposits come for free: In this situation, one might require each timestamp to be linked to one of the game-opening transactions and signed by one of the keys published by the players.  This leads to a similar effect on adding a ""valuable identity"" and preventing abuse, while not requiring any additional effort on the side of the users.  Game Channels Again  Let us now finally come back to the topic of game channels, and discuss how ephemeral timestamps as discussed above can be used to improve them.  The idea here is pretty simple: For creating and resolving disputes, we no longer require nodes to get certain transactions mined.  Instead, they should send the corresponding data as timestamp requests.  By doing so, there is no actual cost in fees as long as all disputes get resolved.  Overall, the dispute process between Alice and Bob looks like this:  As already mentioned, if Bob stops to send his next move to Alice or sends only an invalid move, Alice sends a timestamp request with the history of the game, showing that she last made a move and is now waiting for Bob. Since this data is published to the whole network, Bob will certainly receive it as long as he is still paying interest to the game.  In this case, he can send his next move in a dispute resolution to be timestamped as well.  To be valid, the resolution needs to be timestamped at most N blocks after Alice's dispute. If all is well, Alice has now received a next move from Bob, and the game can continue privately. If Bob does not send a resolution in time or if his move is actually invalid, Alice may send a claim transaction to the network after, say, 2 N blocks.  This transaction uses her original dispute timestamp to prove that she opened the dispute sufficiently long ago.  She pays the required fees out of pocket for this transaction. Alice might try to cheat Bob out of the prize money by sending a claim even though Bob sent his next move.  In this case, Bob can create a counter-claim with his timestamp.  If the move was valid and sent in time (which can both be judged by the network), then he can prove that Alice' claim was fraudulent.  In this case, he gets the prize money unlocked and paid out by the network. If, on the other hand, Alice' claim was right, she gets the prize money paid out after a certain amount of time in which no valid counter-claim is received.  This procedure ensures, in particular, that as long as a player is honest himself, he need not pay any fees except if successfully making a claim or counter-claim.  In this case, he also gets the prize money for sure, which then ideally pays for the fees and some.  So a dishonest player can never actually cause damage to the honest player, except for delaying the game to a certain limit.  There is one tiny issue that remains, though: If a player determines that her chance of actually winning the game is very small based on the current state, she may decide to stop responding instead.  This doesn't cause any extra loss for her and the opponent will get the prize, but will need to wait a bit longer for it and also needs to pay some more in fees.  This, however, is probably not a very bad situation, and we believe that it won't be a big problem in practice.  (Since, as mentioned, it is at least ensured that an honest player can never have any actual loss, and gets at least the prize money minus fees if the opponent misbehaves.)",False

""Trustless Exchanges -  trade game currencies and assets (items, cards, armour, characters etc) for ""Chimera coins"" (CHI) and other game coins built on Chimera.""  You can earn from gaming. The games running on the Chimera network will implement Chimera coins in some way. You'll either be using them directly on games or trading in game assets for Chimera coins, which will act as a universal asset/currency that transcends throughout all the games on the network.  That's correct. The informal economy for games like WoW and EVE Online is huge... you can always play to earn items and sell them for CHI, which you will be able to exchange for BTC.  But also, there's nothing preventing someone from porting Huntercoin to CHI or creating a similar game on top of it. That's not our immediate priority, but it's still an option which we've discussed in the Huntercoin thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=435170.msg17911081#msg17911081  Quote from: jeffthebaker on February 20, 2017, 04:59:52 PM How will burning HUC be weighted against BTC purchases?

It can be limited by the number of players, whose transactions issued in the course of gameplay have the potential to bloat the blockchain at WoW's scale.

There is quite a large difference afaik .. a completely different area of expertise and projects. You cannot really compare them.  I may need correcting if im wrong but Game cryptos are pretty much Bitcoin clones which will use the cryptocurrencies for in game currencies or to purchase games. Some 'blockchain games' store assets in Bitcoin and clones or similar using them as an asset store. Those examples are really a different but still important part of gaming and blockchain than what we are doing.  Huntercoin (released feb 2014) is much more advanced as an actual crypto coin compared to others in that it has an actual mmo game/virtual world in/On the blockchain. It really is gaming on the blockchain.. Not actually just using the blockchain for gaming.  Chimera is the step up from Huntercoin - you will be able to build and run multiple games and applications on the chain using innovative methods.. Even fast paced games..  What others are doing is great also.  But to answer the question again - huntercoin / chimera are completely different and there isn't anything out there like them.,False
