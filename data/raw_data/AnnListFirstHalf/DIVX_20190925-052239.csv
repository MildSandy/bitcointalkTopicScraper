Everything scales accordingly, so a copper would now be 100,000 if say the chosen ratio is 1:100. Also, some consider this inflation but I disagree. I like to use this example: Say you have $100 you want to sell, and you find the demand(a buyer) for that $100. Now you can choose what bills you want to use. Right now the supply = 1 $100 bill. Say a 1:100 ratio is voted for, so now it's as if you just gave them the same amount of money, but with 100 $1 bills. It really doesn't matter if it's 1 $100 bills, 5 $20 bills, 2 $50 bills etc, the demand for the same amount of money is still there.  The market cap here stays the same. Now, if instead, you were to all of a sudden decide you want to sell $10,000($100X100), without the demand for that, that would be inflation. But simply changing the exchange rate does nothing but make liquidity better and gets price closer to what people are used to with forex.",False

Both divx and divi will be listed on bleutrade for at least 3 months, so it should be rather easy to sell divx and buy divi as prices will be pretty close due to arbitrage players. There is also a real option that bleutrade which is based on brazil will actually be able to do swaps for people. You could also have someone outside of the US do the swap for you and send you the coins(requires trust though). Another option is to have someone located outside the US let you use their link since it can be re-used, so you can enter your own address.

The developers are still working on the Blockchain and I believe plan to launch it in 2018,  so we are sort of in a holding pattern with the DIVX E20 token until then.   And yet every time someone unloads coins, there is strong buying supports  and the price keeps popping back up above $1.50.   It’s encouraging, I bought 18,000 coins at $.65 average and  have made healthy profit  while waiting for the final launch.   It tells me that this is going to skyrocket once they launch the DIVI Blockchain, masternodes, etc.   PLUS,  developers have said because they sold fewer tokens during the ICO then they projected, those with master node’s will likely double their supply of coin in the first year.   The ROI on that is 100% without even considering price increase!   My plan is to hodl,  and watch this coin hit $100  by December 2018.

We are in phase one now.  Phase 1, Divi project funded via the token sale of ERC20 Divi Exchange Tokens, called Divx. We all bought Divx in the ICO and now Divx can be bought at Cryptopia.  During this phase we will get ""airdrops"" from the Divi team, free tokens that add up to our balance of Divx during this phase.  Phase 2 Divx to Divi conversion will happen in 2018 Q2.  Once the Divi Mainnet is launched, and the new Divi coin is created we will do a conversion process, all Divx tokens will be exchanged for Divi coins.  Once we have the Mainnet, have our Divi coins, the new phase is where we will start ""staking"" for the returns or interest you mention.

The 60 million is for the hard cap had it been reached, it's not really relevant anymore and there will be a new WP soon.

We project that there will be around 60-80 million tokens created through a smart contract during the token sale, but this depends on when people buy. Divi Project tokens will be automatically issued to participants through a smart contract and become tradable as soon as the token sale reaches the cap or the end date, whichever comes first. Only DIVX will be available during the presale, token sale, and prior to the launch of the Divi Project blockchain.  DIVI - Divi’s coins will be created and available when the Divi blockchain launches. DIVI is the native currency to the Divi Project blockchain, and will be required to set up masternodes and qualify for Lottery Block jackpots. Redeeming Divicoins - DIVI will become available after the Divi Project blockchain launch, scheduled for early Q2, 2018. There will be a 60 day redemption period where Divi Project token participants can stake their DIVX tokens to receive a 1 to 1 ratio of DIVI. Redeeming DIVI is free, and   TOKEN SALE DETAILS  The Divi Project will sell ERC20 compliant tokens on the Ethereum blockchain via a smart contract. • Max 60-80 million DIVX tokens will be created to start. • Additional tokens, based on 20% of the total sold, will be created and held by The Divi Project treasury. 10% will be for influencers, team members, brand ambassadors, mass adoption projects and incentives. • Vesting Period: The other 10% (for founders) will vest over 2 years. • Minimum: 5000 Ether - If for some reason we don’t reach this minimum target, we will return all tokens to the participants. • Maximum Cap: 100,000 Ether - If the sale reaches the cap, the sale will close.

I think having some of the developers or team members make accounts and start delivering information through reddit as well, it will show people that you are all real and actually engaged in this project, and not another get-rich-quick scheme. Because I'm sorry but that's what the subreddit screams.  1) The headliner for the sub is super obnoxious: ""Crypto. Made. Easy"" Yes it was in the video, but with the periods? Really?  2) The sidebar is even worse: ""Divi will offer a “One-Click Master Node” system that will accumulate residual income for users. This offers a way for users to accrue passive income that can be monitored easily from all operating systems and mobile smartphone devices.""  That's literally it. No information about what Divi IS, or what the mission is. No links to any official pages (website, twitter, telegram, bitcointalk, etc)  Yes it's all in the FAQ but having the current blurb in the sidebar just makes this whole thing look like a complete sham. Even the FAQ itself NEVER talks about what the Divi mission/goal is. Instead, it goes on and on about the token sale, divx vs divi, and masternodes. Sure masternodes are the rage right now, but you have to give people a good reason WHY they would want to support the network. It generates tokens for them, but what is it about Divi that stands out from the hundreds of other shitmastercoins, where people stake coins worth dog shit because it has no actual, practical use-case in the end? Obviously Divi does have more going for it, but NONE of that is apparent on first glance.  When people hear about a new project, many of them check reddit (among others) for information. I didn't want to invest in Divi because the reddit made it seem like a get-rich-quick scam.  I don't mean to come off rude if I did- I would be happy to see Divi do well- just my two cents.",False

The community that forms around a crypto is what drives its value.  The technology provides no value alone but creates hype the makes a community excited about its potential future.  A good example is IOTA.  People love the tangle and are becoming big fans of it, even though it's not actually doing anything right now.  What I can tell you is that we're very aware of the community aspect.  If you visit our slack or telegram, you'll find us always there to answer questions, and treat everyone with respect.  We love to turn critics into fans.  If you look at our team, you'll notice that we have a woman named Heidi Krupp.  She and her husband Darren are top NYC publicists.  We have a 2-5 year plan (as long as it takes) to bring Divi to the attention of millions of people through publicity.  Heidi works with Tony Robbins, Gary Vaynerchuck, Oprah Winfrey, etc, etc.   Right now, in the media the only coin that's in the news is Bitcoin.  Sometimes they talk about Ethereum.  Occasionally you hear about Monero because some criminals are using it.   Divi will be the other one you're going to hear about, with a story about how it's so much easier to use than other cryptocurrencies.  It's for regular people.  It's security is better and safer.  It's like using PayPal but can do so much more.  This is an easy story to sell because everyone hears about Bitcoin, but when they start looking into it, only a tiny community of geeks want anything to do with it.  Divi will change that.",False

It gives you a chance to earn the right to add a block to the blockchain.  If your masternode is a higher level, you get an extra multiplier effect that improves your chances to win the block.  Like this:  1000 Coins - Level 1: Copper 3000 Coins - Level 2: Silver +5% 10,000 Coins - Level 3: Gold +10% 30,000 Coins - Level 4: Platinum +15% 100,000 Coins - Level 5: Diamond + 20%  This encourages people to hold onto more coins, and try to accumulate more to reach a higher level.  More people holding coins means more stability in the network, and more scarcity of coins, which helps the value.

Former Yahoo CSO Tim Sanders has joined crypto wallet startup The Divi Project, describing the venture as a potentially ‘world-changing’ opportunity to take cryptocurrencies into the mainstream.  The Divi Project stands apart from its peers, doing away with jargon-heavy language and adopting a more user-friendly approach, whilst maintaining the high levels of technological sophistication necessary to run an effective crypto interface.  “For the last five years,” says Sanders, “I’ve been watching the cryptocurrency scene, looking for the best opportunity to help a team change the world. Divi is that opportunity. The team will make digital currency easier to buy, use and transfer for mainstream investors (like me). From one-click solutions to their master node offering, this team gets what it’s going to take to take this industry beyond the tipping point.”  Central to this user-end simplification is the addition of names, emails and metadata to each transaction - an innovation Tim Sanders likens to Apple’s revolutionary ‘design acumen and appliance-level ease of use’ in the home computing industry:  “Divi’s design approach takes the complexity and fear out of cryptocurrency. They’ve demonstrated the ability to not only dream big, but to execute the plan. Those are the two ingredients I look for when getting involved in a company.”  Based on a multi-tiered masternode system, The Divi Project facilitates coin-holder maintenance of the network, enabling them to earn more as they help the currency survive and thrive. The Divi Project aims to help crypto meet its potential by building a truly global marketplace that can be used by billions of ordinary people.  It’s a vision shared by web pioneer Sanders, who has spotted a potential for expansion sorely lacking in rival cryptocurrencies.  “The promise of Blockchain and cryptocurrency was decentralization. Of course, we all know how that played out with Bitcoin and Mt. Gox. Divi’s approach will enable coin owners to truly manage their currency, without needing a digital-bank of sorts to help them buy, hold and trade it. Their technology will not only help the Divi currency rise in value, it could potentially offer Flickr-like spin off value by licensing technologies to other crypto-companies.”",False
