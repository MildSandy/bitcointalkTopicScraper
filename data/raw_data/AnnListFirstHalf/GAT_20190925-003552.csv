Your question of course deserves attention. IcoDrops site tells us that at the moment Gatcoin project collected $3,643,581 of $14,500,000 (25%). Token sell ends in 27 days on 28 January.  Yes, etherscan shows that they sold around 4.4k ETH which is approx. 3.9M $. I'd say this is a very good result so far.  You're right because this ICO isn't hyped at all, but you'll see later this year how much your GAT are going to be worth. And I want to see how the final version of the app will work I really really hope it will be sold out, otherwise the value of the bounty tokens will be reduced. Boom! pre-sale sold out. congrats to gatcoin team   if the price of eth break 1400$ before 14 jan there is no ICO and all remening tokens will distrubited to pre-sale participants. Wow, did they state this? that ""if the price of eth break 1400$ before 14 jan there is no ICO and all remening tokens will distrubited to pre-sale participants.""  @martinholly167 Not with those exact words. In their website's News section they did address the hard cap in relation to the rise in ETH price. They will be using a 7-day trailing average model ""To determine when that hardcap is reached"". However, this also means there might not be an ICO at all if hard cap is reached early, or if prices plummet it could go until closing date.

An underwriter works closely with the issuing body to determine the offering price of the securities, buys them from the issuer, and sells them to investors via the underwriter's distribution network. Underwriters generally receive underwriting fees from their issuing clients, but they also can earn profits when selling the underwritten shares to investors.  http://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriting.asp  So whether you call it fee, premium, discount or bonus, it is a reward for early buyer risk and providing liquidity.",True

This technology, which is currently patent-pending, could be an extremely powerful draw for retailers. +3 From the perspective of consumer adoption, Gatcoin has a unique opportunity to consolidate loyalty programs all in one place.

The development will take roughly a year.  People on this forum tend to get a heart attack after just 1 week of silence from the developers. That is not always without good reason. The least you can do after your ICO is to celebrate reaching the minimum cap and even that does not always happen. And sadly in some cases they have disappeared completely.  But to give weekly updates, let alone daily ones, a whole year long... I would be impressed if GATCOIN manages to keep that up. It would be very encouraging if they do.  Weekly updates? I'll be very happy if they deliver monthly updates lol. Btw with the current state of ICO market you can't do quick moneys, you must choose wisely and keep your tokens for long term  There is not even a need to do development updates, just a weekly sign of life. For example in the form of blog posts. Could even be random facts about loyalty programs. As long as investors are assured the team did not ran off with the money.  Naturally, every investor want assurance from DEVS that they are in good hands.  We've tried hard to be active and transparent so far and we hope to keep this up during development after the ICO too! Maybe not weekly updates but certainly when major milestones are reached as well as progress along the way.

This is not entirely unfounded, given the long-standing challenges facing Ethereum’s mainstream development. The Ethereum network has already been prone to significant processing delays due to extremely high volumes. It seems like Gatcoin’s success would exacerbate processing delays on the network, especially if mass adoption is achieved. To date, it is unclear how or if the Ethereum community can resolve these issues.  The author does not take the high-speed Super Large Ledgers into account which separate the Merchant Token transactions from the Ethereum network. The risks outlined in the whitepaper pertain to GATCOIN transations mainly. I concede the GATCOIN platform being a D-app on Ethereum could be vulnerable, and I am not sure to what degree the Merchant Token networks can continue to run autonomously in the event Ethereum underperforms.  However, the Ethereum Byzantium upgrade has cleared up Ethereum network congestions and lowered the transaction fees dramatically. And there are even more upgrades in the pipeline.",True

Please take a look at some exciting new announcements here https://www.gatcoin.io/update-on-gatcoin-private-sale-public-pre-sale-and-public-sale/  To summarise; Pre Sale is starting October 28th with a 20% bonus! 15 Million GAT Coins will be available over the pre sale period at a price of $0.167 USD (price fixed in ETH) to reward all of you who have been waiting patiently! Make sure to sign up to our mailing list to ensure you get in on time!  We have been working hard on our demonstration app, but to make sure that investors get to preview the functionality of the GAT Wallet, purchasing process in the GAT Marketplace and the trading mechanics of the GAT Exchange we have pushed back the Public Sale date to December 15th, when 115 Million GAT Coins will go on sale for $0.20 USD (price fixed in ETH).  The development process has given us clarity on the cost of business rollout and we have adjusted Hard Cap accordingly it has been reduced to $35.87 Million USD so  no more tiered ICO structure.  As some of you will have noticed this leaves 70 Million GAT Coins unspoken for, due to overwhelming demand for private sales, we are in discussions with several parties, we have allocated this for private sales (with a 6 month lock in period) to ensure public investors still have ample opportunity to participate but still allow institutional investment.

This is a very excellent point and we’re glad you looked so thoroughly through our white paper to find it. The data you cited from Visa represents the STRESS testing and PEAK transaction speeds that Visa can handle—for example, AliPay can currently handle 180k TPS at peak. However, the average TPS for Visa is still in the 4,000-5,000 range. Our figures in the white paper are for our average as well. We can handle up to 100k TPS for short periods (such as holidays like you mentioned) but we feel reporting this number gives a false impression of our capabilities and that average is much more important. No company can reliably offer 47,000 TPS as an average. Even Ethereum Enterprise which is aiming for just 100 TPS has yet to reach it.

This allows merchants to quickly change or even withdraw programs if there is any negative impact resulting from their digital token program.  In that case I am interesting in how the user interface for configuring and managing Merchant Tokens looks.,True

Whitepaper    2004 https://www.informationweek.com/visa-tests-transaction-processing-system/d/d-id/1026381  During the annual weeklong stress test, conducted at an IBM facility outside Washington, D.C., Visa ran the system at a processing load of 6,200 transaction messages per second, a 20% increase over last year's peak on Dec. 24 of 5,200 transaction messages per second. Each card purchase requires about two transaction messages.   2013 https://www.visa.com/blogarchives/us/2013/10/10/stress-test-prepares-visanet-for-the-most-wonderful-time-of-the-year/index.html  After the test is concluded, the VisaNet team determines the best configuration to maintain our higher levels of security and reliability when millions of transactions from all over the world hit the network during the holiday shopping season. As a result, they also come back from Gaithersburg with a number that represents the maximum processing capacity VisaNet can handle, which later is stamped on coffee mugs and distributed to the team involved in the test. This year’s “mug number” – as we like to call it – is 47,000 transaction messages per second, which is a huge step forward from 2012’s peak capacity of 30,000 transaction messages per second!   I didn't have time to look up the current transactions per second capabilities of VISA so don't quote me on this but I vaguely remember hearing Vitalek say they were over 69,000 TPS. The 5,000 TPS capabilities are from 14 years old data. Please correct me if I'm wrong. I'm no expert in this field. I decided to do a quick search after thinking about Vitalek the Visitor's talk a few months back.  So my question to GATCOIN is, who looked up and verified your whitepaper's numbers? My next question is.... Is your tech ready to handle the load of the holidays? With November and December comes a tripling of TPS at the minimum.    That is a small typo if anything and in my opinion does not reflect the capabilities of this project as a whole. Nor does it raise any red flags.

In 2014, SK Planet acquired Shopkick Inc. for $200 million, a mobile shopping companion that informs and rewards customers with points for walking into participating stores which can be redeemed for discounts.  Now what is Shopkick? Shopkick is an American company based in Silicon Valley that created a shopping app for smartphones and tablets that offers customers rewards for walking into stores. It uses points called “kicks” which are usually awarded when users walk into participating stores. Kicks are also awarded by scanning product barcodes or QR Codes using a device's camera, and by making purchases.

But I do have some experience with Asus promos.  When I tried to redeem an Asus promo code, I had to pick one of their regional redemption sites. I bought an Asus product in a shop in a different country which shipped it to me. When I tried to submit the form for the region of my country, it would not continue to the next page nor show an error. When I emailed customer support they said it could be a browser error. On several website other people had problems redeeming their Asus promo codes, as it appears the redemption sites went offline or 'out of stock' in the weekends.  Eventually I started to use my brain and went to fill in the form at the redemption site for the region of the shop where I bought the product. And that worked.  So I am an idiot. But still, Asus should have displayed helpful errors. They could have been more clear which one of their regional websites to use. Or better yet, have a single universal redemption site.  ----  Another personal experience is with a different brand, Bosch (they make home appliances and tools). After sending them the invoice, they mailed me they could not read it. They asked me to resubmit the invoice through a different form. Apparently it is not possible to use the original form to resubmit the invoice, it causes a 'serial number not found' error. At first I got a form that did not even contain proper labels, just placeholders. The form itself did not work either. A few weeks later I tried again. The labels were fixed and I tried saving the invoice as JPG, GIF, BMP, PNG and PDF, but the result is always the same: ""Failed to upload your invoice"". As of today this has not been resolved.",True

I have a little confusion in this point otherwise I like the idea to have that project and to invest in it. I hope you will clear this confusion.  Yes we will give merchants a chance to issue their own tokens as rewards and vouchers. These tokens can only be used in the store of that particular merchant or sold on the GAT Exchange for GAT Coins.  This is where the value of GAT Coin is, if you want to buy points for your favourite coffee place or more airmiles to get an upgraded ticket, you need to have GAT Coins to purchase them from other users on the GAT Exchange. The only place to buy Gatcoins is via our ICO or off ICO investors afterwards. The more people on the GAT Exchange and the more Merchants on the GAT System the higher the demand for GAT Coins. Which is great for early investors because we already have an anchor client with over 60,000 retail locations on board!

You can find a quick video here that explains the purpose: https://youtu.be/qq0_WVK8lMc  Also, our white paper goes into a lot of detail: https://www.gatcoin.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/170919v2-Whitepaper-EN.pdf  But to give a quick summary… GATCOIN will create a single platform to organize rewards points and discounts for all merchants and retailers. Customers who get rewards points from different companies (for example, hotels and coffee shops) can keep these in their app/wallet and trade the points on the GAT Exchange for the goods and services they truly want. Merchants gain more marketing options and can target customers based on age, demographics, and spending habits. Also, GATCOIN offers the airdrop feature to release coins to potential customers within a certain area and based on demographic/spending criteria. Moreover, we are designing this to be an easy-to-use, turnkey solution for retailers so that companies who aren’t tech savvy can get setup on the platform fast.  Of course, this all depends on the size of the network of retailers using GATCOIN. Fortunately, we already have a partnership with SK Planet Japan so that when we launch the full platform it will immediately be used at 21 major international and local brands in Japan with a network of over 30,000 retail stores, 80,000 restaurants and 60,000 beauty outlets.

It is also important to note that we as the Dev's will not have access to the GAT Coins allocated to the GAT Foundation, so we could not cash in like that even if we wanted to (we don't btw all of us are personally invested in the project and firmly believe in the future of the project).

Short answer, we want to do this right, in order or ICO investors to see truly excellent returns on their investment we need to build a bullet proof system, test it extensively set up infrastructure in multiple markets and actively pursue as many merchants as possible to expand the network as soon as possible. To do this we need funds unfortunately we cant build a easy to use interactive marketplace that spans the globe and covers a vast network  overnight and on the cheap   If you look at section 4.3.1 you will find more information about the use of proceeds and our expansion plan.  https://www.gatcoin.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/170919v2-Whitepaper-EN.pdf  Quote from: levyashin on September 30, 2017, 02:48:59 PM I have a question about merchant tokens.

At the moment there is no mechanism in place to allow them to take merchant tokens directly to a marketplace. Merchant tokens can be used to purchase goods in store, on line or traded on GAT Marketplace.  It is helpful to view Merchant tokens more like traditional rewards vouchers, not a currency or a stored value card. This is where the value of the GAT Exchange comes in where consumers can take the additional step of monetizing rewards if they wish to and if there is demand for it.

So its safe to assume they will not just dump the tokens and dilute the market!  I also hope we hit the hard cap and this question takes care of itself!  Quote from: matjas on September 30, 2017, 08:54:17 AM Nowadays a lot of retailers use some kind of benefits programs trough cards, coupons, etc. But i noticed that even thou the company is international and it has branches all over Europe, your loyalty card or coupons are useless outside of the country of issue. How will Gatcoin work around this?  You are right under a traditional rewards system you can't use, say your coffee rewards points from Germany in Hong Kong. In the GATCOIN System you would be able to work around this. Here is how. Say you are moving countries and want to make sure you don't lose all the value you have in your loyalty programs, the solution is take these tokens to the GAT Exchange and sell them there for GAT Coin. You can then use this GAT Coin to purchase merchant tokens for your destination country or even for an airline to help pay for your trip!",True

How to solve it? Both they issue a token on GAT and customer will choose to spend it for a cheeseburger or exchange it for Foot Looker tokens. A random London's night club ear about GAT and see that if they issue a token, McDonald's and Foot Looker tokens can be exchanged for club's tokens to gain more people into the club. Can you do this if you create three ERC20? I don't think so, you want to exchange your McDonald's tokens and you do it trough an exchange and maybe if you don't get confused (remember than this is for mainstream) you find Foot Looker tokens and then Foot Looker themeselves need an app to exchange those tokens into vouchers.

I have created several tokens and am not that technically inclined, so it would makes sense that companies actually interested in blockchain will easily  learn the process.  So, my question is how does GATCOIN plan to stay viable 6mths - 1yr down the line as most individuals find out that solidarity is not rocket science and most of this scripts can be easily created or emulated. Why will companies subcontract GATCOIN ( a company using ERC 20) to create a token for them when it takes less than 30 mins to create your own ERC 20 token.

The value of GATCOIN comes from its network and the GAT Exchange. For customers, collecting blockchain rewards points from various retailers/shops/merchants doesn’t solve the issue that they have points that they can’t/don’t want to use. Through the growing network of retailers (big and small) on the GATCOIN network, these customers will have greater choice of how and where to use their rewards points (of course done via exchange through the GAT Exchange). Moreover, with all these customers of various merchants using the same wallet, it is easier for merchants to reach new customers (for example through demographic/spending targeting).  As we have already secured the partnership with SK Planet Japan, we are launching out of the gate with a strong network of merchants who will issue Tokens, thus offering immediate choice to consumers and GAT Wallet holders. As new merchants come on board, we streamline the process for them so that blockchain tokens are no longer an onerous technical issue for them but rather just another marketing application—we remove the hassle of having to Google the process and learn the tech.  To put it simply, we are offering a one-stop-shop for all rewards points. The more merchants who join, the more powerful the platform. We are working hard to recruit even more partners and are confident that more merchants will join the platform organically as the success of GATCOIN grows.",True

An additional feature is that merchants can choose to accept a combination of merchant tokens and FIAT when selling goods, so items bought with merchant tokens are not necessarily given away for free but rather sold at a discounted price.  We also believe, and I think most people on this forum would agree, that there is a an inherently interesting quality about crypto, and that many people will enjoy the collecting and trading aspect of the system and that this will in turn drive up engagement for merchants.",True

Merchants who already have rewards systems in place know that there is a cost associated with them however there is a net gain as the system allows them to acquire/retain customers at a rate that they would not have if the rewards system was not in place.

GATCOIN’s benefit to customers is that all Merchant Tokens are tradeable on the GAT Exchange. So, as you say, they might earn with Shopkick but the points will not mean much if the customer isn’t interested in the merchant—whereas with GATCOIN Merchant Tokens, the customer can trade. Moreover, GATCOIN offers merchants the opportunity to reach new customers. This would work in the case when a customer already has the GATCOIN app for rewards with company A and now passes by an airdrop location for company B. Now that customer collects Merchant Tokens for company B. He or she might choose to shop with company B or just trade those tokens for tokens with company A. Lastly, airdrop can be very targeted for merchants: rather than making these airdrop Merchant Tokens available to all customers, they can be selectively released to customers in a specific demographic match or those with particular spending habits. This data will be collected from the GATCOIN app which customers use to hold and collect Merchant Tokens.  There is more detail about this functionality here: https://www.gatcoin.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/170928v2-GATCOIN-System-Overview.pdf",True

That's just a fact. No matter how much you guys might sugarcoat it, the idea is nothing new to the space.  There are several companies already offering this services and every one of them is doing poorly in the market.    If a company wants a coin, they could easily create a coin on wallet builder or on several other services that offer this and have it listed in an exchange in a few days. Companies can also create a wave token and have it on wave dex immediately or erc 20 and have it on delta immediately. With implementation of the new protocol, the transaction will really speed up. so even if Gatcoin gain better traction than the troves of companies offering similar ideas, the idea will be obsolete in a few months to a yr. Solidarity might be in infancy but if I a non technical observer can create erc token. am quite sure a company with interest in blockchain can easily figure it out.  So I know it's on a lot of ppl interest to shill without reserve but I won't let you lie to unaware investor and make it seem like this is a groundbreaking idea, cos you are basically leading them to a trap, that I think, will end up costing long term holders dearly. If someone wants to take chance and  pnd the ico, that I can understand but this idea is nothing new, it's already been offered by a lot of companies, and is almost obsolete cos the mass is becoming better aware of the blockchain tech.   This is akin to buying a new telly, then investing into a robotic model whose  job is to ONLY control the remote, cos you haven't figured out how to do it yourself.

We are lowering substantially some of the barriers to entry that the average mainstream consumer faces with the adoption of blockchain technology by increasing transaction speeds and delivering blockchain to them via trusted retailers in a manner they already know (like a coffee reward card or frequent flyer program) all within a simple mobile interface.  GATCOIN provides a complete ecosystem that benefits merchants by giving them an exciting new way to incentivise and entice customers (and gain valuable data on spending habits) and consumers by providing a way to consolidate multiple rewards platforms with the added benefit of being able to convert rewards/and vouchers into crypto on the open market.",True
