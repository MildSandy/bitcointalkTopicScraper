I'm still perusing the whitepaper, and there seem to be some legal fallacies, for one, different jurisdictions define pandering in different ways, and the roadmap does state that expansion into the trade would occur in the US.  That's, 53, probably, different jurisdictions just covering states and territories.  Strictly speaking from a fiscal (crypto does eventually turn into fiat, and vice-versa)standpoint, I would be concerned that there would be an opportunity for an overzealous prosecutor to push for a RICO case involving pandering.  Personally, I find the hoops that someone is going to have to go thru fascinating to follow, much like I find the Mustang Ranch being technically owned and run badly to the point of failing by the US government to be ironic.  I am all for government staying the hell out of everything short of filling a pothole.

Read the Lust Whitepaper: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2Au0kLZOVYRMmw1cGJqODJ5dlU/view  They plagiarized some parts form sexservice.io project. https://sexservice.io https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1970891  Here are some proves.  1. Lust: If the request is accepted, a client will be able to access private information of that worker, like more photos, name or something worker decides, and vise versa. After double confirmation, this money will be held by smart contract and his wallet would generate an access key.  Sexservice.io: But these tokens are not in her wallet, but in a two-step contract. What is important, manâ€™s wallet generates access key, which can be used later if service completed. For woman it is a signal the man are interested, have real intense and solvent. They can start a communication using methods they want. Man receive access to private information of the woman, like more photos, name or something she decides, and vise versa.  2. Lust: This key has to be scanned later if they make an agreement and meet otherwise the contract gets automatically closed in 48 hours, and the client gets his Etherium tokens back in the wallet. The client can start with another try if she disagrees. Also, once the service is completed, both parties have 24 hours to leave a feedback to each other and gain reputation. Completely anonymous, transparent, secure and impossible to shut down, this decentralised marketplace is the new revolution of the sex industry.  Sexservice.io: If they are ready to proceed, she scans the access key, and man gets the service. Otherway contract will be closed automatically in 48 hours, and man will get SSIO tokens back and can start with another try. There will be the same outcome if she will not respond to a request, or they would not meet each other. After that, they both have 24 hours to leave a feedback to each other and gain reputation.   Also i see some other parts are plagiarized from Frantic project. You can compare that by yourself or wait till Frantic react.  And not, Lust project can not be realized technically! Don't be a fool! ""Escrow deals based on smart contracts enable us to develop contractual arrangements in which the money is stored in a wallet temporarily, before the completion of the contract."" Remember that smart contracts works only when Subject of agreement in inside it. Sex and whores are not inside a contract!

As for using the system for the first time - this possibility is not ruled out. But the same thing happens in the event that a prostitute finds a client on the street. The conditions are the same. The system helps protect workers in this sphere with repeated use. Ultimately, we provide not a panacea, but a partial solution, which in any case will be safer than their usual work. I am sorry to say the conditions are not the same , in street there is big chance for eye witness while with your system no eye witness .

As in any similar project, only relative anonymity is provided. Simply put, we provide an opportunity to remain anonymous, but will the client use it? It's only his right. The possibility of error is not excluded, for example, the client can leave his documents by chance in the girl. Our system allows you to appoint a meeting, like a dentist. That is, the girl will know that she has a client for this time and will not require his identity card.  As for using the system for the first time - this possibility is not ruled out. But the same thing happens in the event that a prostitute finds a client on the street. The conditions are the same. The system helps protect workers in this sphere with repeated use.
