They say when you're wearing rose colored glasses, red flags just look like normal flags; I've wondered if I'm wearing rose colored glasses in regards to my enthusiasm for CompCoin - especially as of late.

Why would you expect me to announce the domain before the website is ready? We've spent a lot of time and effort to help explain CompCoin. It will be promoted once it's ready. You haven't uncovered some groundbreaking investigative detail, all you've done is spoiled the launch announcement and pointed people to a site that's not ready yet.  Furthermore, since it's still being developed, no forum member can purchase a single CompCoin from that website. Period.

I said I was working on a CompCoin project. I have not profited from these posts in anyway whatsoever.  Also, I'm not blocking anyones PMs. I'm open to discussion as I have been from the beginning.

I'm here to clear the air and provide a few small updates.  As we're all very much aware, the CompCoin team continues to do a poor job in communicating with customers, meeting deadlines, and just getting their overall shit together. At this point, it's moved from beyond annoying to downright disheartening. I'm still a firm believer in the potential of the coin and the team behind it, but the delays and technical incompetence is starting to wear on my patience - as I'm sure it has already worn on all of yours.  I want to make it clear that every time I've shared a deadline here, it was based on information that was passed directly to me from the founder himself. Needless to say, I'm done asking for and sharing deadlines since there is always some reason or another why the deadline is delayed. In this case, as emails to another forum member here from the CMP team indicated, there has been an effort to drum up private sales during February in order to provide support for the market once trading opens again. My understanding is that this is the reason for the web wallet/coin transfer/cryptopia delay. Unsurprisingly, people are (justifiably) pissed and are ready to exit as soon as possible. Given current liquidity levels, it's important to be able to support the expected selloff - so Alan has been traveling recently and meeting institutional/private investors to generate capital so that those among us who want to sell can do so at a profit.  That said, I'm told we must wait (again) for another two weeks or so until trading is opened.  Given the fact that this is something none of us wanted to hear, I suppose it's only right to share some positive news as well. Although I would recommend (and certainly expect) you to take it with a grain of salt.  As mentioned previously, talks with the NFA have continued in a positive direction. Final approval is still pending but I'm told there is only one issue left to resolve before trading can open. I have no clue what that means in regards to a time frame. Other deals are in the works as well - it seems there's been a shift to focusing more on the enterprise value of the coin in regards to it's use cases for institutional investors moreso than retail investors. Several products are being developed that use CompCoin - I will share more info on that in a later update.  Overall, I don't feel like much has changed in regards to the longterm outlook - if anything, I'm as optimistic as ever about year end price targets. But, we're all pretty much done with being strung along - me included. While I can confirm the truthfulness of the CompCoin team's claims, that doesn't make me or anyone else feel better. We all want to be able to trade the coin, to do with it what we please, and to feel like someone is looking out for our best interests as shareholders. I've been stressing the importance of better communication with the community. I will continue to emphasize the fact that they NEED to be on top of this - creating a Slack group, sending consistent emails, responding in a timely fashion to support tickets, and working out all the bugs that we've been patiently waiting to be resolved.  Until then, I hope we can just keep our heads up, try to not let it affect us emotionally, and focus on the goals at hand. I will continue to provide updates and share what I know with the community. Believe me, no one is more upset at the recent lack of fruition than I am. I've put my money and reputation on the line with this one and I don't intend to be wrong. We're going to the moon - and I don't know of any rocket ships that are a smooth ride for the astronauts.  One thing that is clear, much of the FUD surrounding crypto markets in general relates to the fact that there is no underlying value or revenue generation models for crypto assets in comparison to stocks or traditional financial assets. This is why I love CompCoin. The algorithms work, profits can be generated and are not dependent on future investment into CompCoin. This really is one of the only coins with an inherent value due to it's profit generating capacity. As u/bitshitz mentioned, this asset is severely undervalued for trading software. Consider that each CompCoin is basically a prepaid software license that gives access to trading software. The cryptocurrency/blockchain aspect of this project is fundamentally just a different way to package the software - one that is more fair and democratized. The team has a great product but faces difficulty with packaging and delivery - that's it. And to be fair, they've hired 3 new developers since my last update. These guys are getting paid top dollar to take care of the remaining issues. While it's not happening in accordance with a pace or time frame we are satisfied with, things are still moving forward. I'm currently trying to convince Alan to hire IdeasByNature.com - one of the leading blockchain development and design firms (clients ranging from bitcoin.com, Salt, Dash, Digital Currency Group, etc.). He's open to the idea. He's committed to improving CompCoin and ensuring its long lasting success. With a firm like that behind us, I would imagine these technical issues would be a thing of the past.  That's all I can share for now. Things are moving forward in several different areas and, despite the frustratingly slow development, we should be out of the woods in the upcoming weeks. Take that deadline with a grain of salt, keep your chin up, and hang in there. PM me if I didn't answer your question or if you want to talk. I'm here for you all. We're in this together and we're going to crush it. It's just a matter of time.",False

Help me understand this. Honestly. The CEO knows that Compcoin is going to tank so he's allowing major investors to sell privately while smaller holders are left with the bag when Cryptopia opens up trading?  The information you have provided on here has failed to come to fruition numerous times, though I don't fault you for being misled. The ""customer support"" Compcoin provides is woefully amateur and doesn't instill much confidence. When I called the person was fumbling with her cell phone while driving, unable to provide ANY answers or tentative timelines, but she was enthusiastically assuring that ""one CMP will be worth a lot by EOY!"" though I never asked about the price. The CEO of the ""most transparent coin ever"" can't even spend a few of the ""several million"" (your words from back in September - I believe you posted that it was $45mm before, but can't find it) raised to pay for customer support beyond your posts.  At best, Alan Friedman is incompetent and in over his head - at worst he really is scamming people. I'll suspend my disbelieve and assume you personally are being transparent, but at this point why would anyone trust anything involved with this project? How do we know that the paltry trading volume/artificially inflated price isn't just you moving around some of the 65,000 coins you're in possession of?  After all, if Mr. Friedman has the time to hock Compcoin on random webinars (https://www.coincomm.com/posts/1447346/comments), he can probably carve out a few moments to ease the concerns Compcoin investors have. Or maybe he simply doesn't give a shit once he get's your money.",False

The major investors are buyers not sellers.  All this FUD turns people off, but the product works and NFA approval is only for non-accredited investors so of course they would try to generate sales with accredited investors to counterbalance those people who speculate with the coin, want a quick profit and are ready to cash out as soon as they can. The point was, if I'm not mistaken, to find people on the other side of that trade who will actually hold the coin and use it for its intended purpose - which is automated money management.  The NFA has put them through their paces, as has the CFTC. Yeah it feels bad to wait, to be told a deadline and have to wait longer, to feel like you're in the dark. But that doesn't mean it's a scam.  I've been transparent and forthcoming about everything I know. I'm not a frontman; I'm an investor, a miner, a crypto enthusiast, and a member of this forum who wants to share information for the better good. That's all. But honestly, responding to posts from people who JUST created an account and their first post is freaking out about CompCoin being a scam is not why I'm here.

But let's all gain some perspective and look at this in a broader context. What ICOs have rolled out a finished product within six months after launch? What ICOs have any number at all for you to call and speak with an actual human?  Sure, the CompCoin team isn't perfect. Far from it. But they're trying, they show up to work every day and push the ball forward. I get email notifications from Base Camp at random hours of the night that prove they're hard at work trying to make this a success. It's a lot easier to look at it from the outside and point out what could be done better or differently. I could be wrong about all this, and if I am, I will humbly apologize and eat my words. Until then, I'll keep my money where my mouth is and my faith in the project.",False

Sorry it's been a while since I last posted in this thread; I've been busy working on a very exciting CompCoin related project with the founder, which I will be sharing here in a few weeks. If you're interested in hearing more about that and possibly earning some bonus CMP for yourself, PM me for details. Otherwise, just stay tuned!  Obviously we've seen some tremendous price movement since being listed on Cryptopia - and mark my words - this is just the beginning.  Many things have happened recently and I'm happy to clear up some of the confusion around here.                                                                                                                                               Okay, so CompCoin forked in November; that's why the block sizes are different and why you can't send coins to Cryptopia. This was done in direct response to the exploitation of the CMP blockchain via what we now know was a ""time warp attack,"" (which sounds ridiculous, but is a real thing, google it). That attack is what caused the price to drop, as blocks were falsely inserted into the honest chain. Good news is that's over. However, everyone must wait until early January, at which point the new web wallet will be available and we will be able to easily swap our coins to the new one. Then you will be able to deposit on Cryptopia, cash out, whatever you want.  If you already sent coins to Cryptopia, don't worry.  Simply email help@compcoin.com, tell them what happened, and they will fix it.  In regards to trading with ART, we're waiting for final approval from the NFA. The CompCoin team has been working closely with them. Can't say for certain, but I'd guess we'll be able to trade relatively soon. There's over $6MM in funds waiting to be traded with CompCoin, so we'll have plenty of data to extrapolate the performance of the algorithms. In regards to trading performance, I'm not a Certified Financial Advisor, so I can't share the exact numbers but let me just say I'm confident anyone who trades with CompCoin on the forex markets will be very pleased. Even better, the real-time trading results will be posted on the CompCoin website every week once trading is open. So we'll get to see just how good the algos are before we let them trade our money.  Moving on. Lots of big investors are interested in CompCoin. In fact, it's a paradigm shift in the way we can view our investment. This asset is synergistic with many established industries: think of how much money is in the forex niche alone - selling software, indicators, strategies, and other products to traders. Not to mention all of the money managers, hedge funds, private equity firms, investment banks, etc. who have a problem for which CompCoin is the best solution.  Here's a way to phrase what's happening so you can fully understand the extent to which this coin is not only different, but revolutionary.  CompCoin will become the world's largest hedge fund with no investor funds.  Additionally, I'm aware of two online forex trading academies, a crypto hedge fund, and an international forex group - all of whom want to purchase, trade with, resell, or offer CompCoin to their clients. At least one of these groups have already committed to a very large purchase in Q1 2018.  All in all, things are looking up for us early adopters, hodlers, and ICO participants. If you look back through this thread, I've provided several updates - all of which were verifiably accurate. This is no different.  Now for a little optimism.  If all goes well, we could be looking at some truly spectacular gains in the upcoming months. Remember, CompCoin earns money from outside the crypto ecosystem. That allows a value multiple to be imputed based on the earnings per coin. At current prices, CMP is an absolute steal. Don't expect it to stay that way for long!  Anyways, that's about it for now. Will be back soon with some more news and an announcement regarding the upcoming launch of my CompCoin project.",False

Cryptopia is only briefly in maintenance mode; the updated source code was sent to them today. Trading will resume shortly. The web wallet development is still underway; release was scheduled for early Jan. but due to unforeseen circumstances there's a delay. Shouldn't take much longer regardless. (Side Note: if you're a blockchain developer or you know one, CompCoin is currently hiring. PM me to followup with that.) The NFA came back with what we're expecting to be the last round of revisions. For context, this is the ninth iteration and CompCoin is the first cryptocurrency to go through this process. That said, we're told that it's close and the approval process is almost complete - after which, trading will be available to non-accredited investors.  Thank you to those who've reached out with interest in earning bonus CMP with the launch of our new CompCoin project. I sincerely appreciate your interest and I haven't forgotten about you. I will be following up with details regarding that announcement soon.   Lastly, I'm going to share some very exciting news.  Fintech Investment Group, the company that created the CompCoin algorithms, is developing a new CompCoin product.  Here's the idea behind it: many private investors, particularly larger ones, want to hold a portfolio of cryptocurrency but don't know how to go through the process of acquiring it, i.e. signing up for different exchanges, verifying accounts, converting fiat, choosing coins, maintaining wallet security, etc.  People want to buy a portfolio of diversified cryptocurrency in one click. Soon, with CompCoin, they'll be able to do that.  People will be able to access the investment platform and authorize Fintech Investment Group to trade on their behalf. Using CompCoin, they can then select a pre-weighted portfolio from a variety of options with different motifs and exposure to different segments within the crypto markets. Next, they download their own private keys for safe keeping and reupload that file when they're ready to sell.  It's a turnkey investment management product that offers prepackaged coin portfolios to that large percentage of potential investors who don't know how to get skin in the game. This is revolutionary. And it's likely to be a huge price mover for CMP as these portfolios can only be purchased using CompCoin.  I know it's frustrating to be dealing with a tech team that has ambitious deadlines and is struggling to meet them. Believe me, I understand. It's important to realize that we're still so early in the tokenization aspect of this project - look at where CompCoin is in comparison to the vast majority of ICOs on the market that don't even have a line of code yet. Once the few remaining loose ends are tied up - and we have access to trading, exchanging, staking, and mining - the price will more accurately reflect the value of this asset. When that happens, you'd better hold onto your seats. We've already gotten a taste of that price movement as the entire order book on Cryptopia was bought out a couple days ago. This was following an investor seminar Alan hosted in North Carolina. There's a lot happening behind the scenes.  CompCoin is different than every other digital asset; the value will be proven and it's price will rise. We're in the middle of a market correction right now, and make no mistake, money will be consolidated into coins that have tangible value. Tokenized, enterprise-grade products will rise to the top.  I've got a couple more exciting things to share but will be back soon with that news. Please PM me if I didn't answer your question or address your concern. Several people have sent messages expressing their appreciation for these updates. Thank you for that. I'm here for you guys. We're a community. We're all in this together. We are going to the moon.  Until then, just sit back and try to enjoy the ride - bumpy though it may be.",False

Once that fix is in place - again, before the end of next week - we can expect tremendous volume and price movement; mark my words.  - They've hired an outside party to audit the algorithm - which means we get to see independently verified trading results soon.  - Live trading may be available now if you contact them directly.  - They've got an interview on CNN coming up in the next couple weeks - which obviously is awesome publicity and will likely have a positive impact on volume and price as well.  - Several large buyers are interested in acquiring significant positions in CMP but have been told to wait until this whole debacle is sorted out.

The crisis is over.  I can share more about what happened now. First of all the price has stabilized and is steadily increasing (which, by the way, it will continue to do for some time to come, expect a run back to at least $2 in the short term - Alan maintains a target of $100 for year end).  For the quick learners, you can see for yourself what happened and what they did about it here: blocks.compcoin.com.  ________________________________________________   Okay then, boys and girls, sit down and prepare for a story.  ________________________________________________  Once upon a time, Compcoin was built. The algorithm that determined block difficulty was configured to adjust appropriately for the technology at that time.  Then, things changed.  The Antminer L3+ was released.  You can see earlier in this thread that someone mentioned how ridiculously profitable it was to mine CMP (they were getting $60 a block). The blocks were designed to distribute 35 CMP every 10 minutes. The problem: they were spitting them out every 1-3 minutes. Blocks could sometimes be found within seconds of each other.  What happened?  There was one miner who pushed the price down this whole time. They started scaling their hash rate through NiceHash and were pointing anywhere from 50 - 150 GH/s at the pool, depending on how much competition there was from other miners. When they were able to get thousands of CMP a day, they chose to sell. With Nova Exchange being a small market, that movement was enough to drop the price from $16+ to ~$0.55.  With all that hash power, the guy basically achieved a 51% attack on the network. The team went into crisis mode. They had to stop this guy who was mining all the coin and just dumping it for pennies on the dollar.  Hence the silence; they didn't want other people to find out and do the same thing.  So what did they do?  The coin forked and the block size has been decreased from 35 CMP to 2 CMP.  Now blocks are found at a more reasonable rate. This changes the mining dynamic so it's not as profitable to point the hash power equivalent of 300 L3+s at the CMP pool when you're just going to turn around and dump coins for a couple cents each.  You can see on the NovaExchange and CoinMarketCap charts when the trading volume spikes, the price drops. This was occurring daily as the miner was just cashing out his haul with no regards of, or respect for, the price.  Now that the team has a technical solve for the problem, we can probably expect an update soon (as if we haven't been already) and a steady if not rapid price correction that more accurately reflects the value of CompCoin.  In the meantime, sit back and wait. Or buy some cheap CMP and reduce your cost basis while it lasts, which if you ask me, may not be as long as one might think.  Look at the block explorer. Get an understanding of what's happening behind the scenes. Then look back through this thread at all of my other updates - the new website, the trading results, the NFA approval, the CNN interview, the brokerage partnerships. That's all happening. There's some exciting things that they can get back to working on now and it looks like we're on track to make some nice gains real soon.  To the haters, keep your eyes on the charts.  To the believers, get ready.  We're in for a wild ride - and it's only just begun.",False

They're working on a lot right now; it's probably one of the furthest things from a scam when it comes to cryptocurrency - there's two companies here; Fintech Investment Group created the algorithmic trading that's been around for 8 years, then it was tokenized as a way to sell access to retail investors who usually would not have access to top tier trading algos. That token is CompCoin. It's a software license for artificial intelligence that trades USD/EUR and has so far shown some pretty impressive returns in backtesting and 99% correlation with real-time trades. It's the only token that actually generates earnings from outside the ecosystem - via profits from the automatic trades.  I can't share too much but I'm willing to disclose that there is a concerted effort on behalf of some members of the community - WHO ARE NOT PART OF THE COMPCOIN TEAM - to suppress the price of CMP. The dev team is working around the clock right now to counter these efforts so they can get back to working on the business. Now I don't know for sure, but that's my guess why there have been no updates.  I understand my reputation here isn't enough for people to take my word at face value, but I figured I'd share what I know. There's real money behind this project and they're busy working on a lot of things. They have over 1800 algos right now; they're testing with different pricing models that can be used to trade commodities, stocks, bonds, treasuries, any financial market. They're working with other brokerages to offer the software to their clients via affiliate relationships. There's so much more too that I really can't say.  Just know that the project has been in development 8 years. It's been on the exchange less than a month. They're well funded and have a leadership team with a track record. This is not vaporware. These are not anonymous people. You could find the founder's phone number right now and call him, he'd probably pick up too even though it's almost midnight where he is.

See, here's what you've got to realize. A large majority of this recent wave of ICOs are designed, marketed, and deployed by people who want to cash in on the ICO frenzy - that's not the case with CompCoin - hence CompCoin hasn't had the level of communication (via Slack, Telegram, forum presence, etc.) that we see with these ICOs peddling vaporware. For most of those ICOs, their presence is all they have to sell, other than a dream, idea, roadmap, etc.  Want to know why there is no roadmap for the CompCoin or ART software development?  The software already exists.  That's what most people don't get here. Fintech Investment Group, that created the algos tokenized into CMP, is A REGISTERED FINANCIAL ADVISOR. You can pull their records. I don't know where you got Maldives from, Alan lives on the east coast.  And in regards to CompCoin not officially communicating the situation I mentioned previously, that's because they want it to stop. They don't want any more malicious actors. Hence they pulled wallets. That's what they're working on. Being busy is no excuse, but that's why I'm telling people as much as I know about the situation. Alan randomly stumbled upon my business, we talked a lot and he told me about what's happening to CMP.  Guys, they're fucking livid about what's going on with the price. They have the investors' best interests in mind - you better believe it. We all win together. Again, it's no excuse for not communicating but when the house is on fire you put it out - you don't stop and talk about it. They've got some lessons to learn in community management and they might learn it the hard way if people lose confidence for no reason, but again, CMP has been listed for what, less than two weeks on some nothing exchange with no volume. It's easy to dump on that market and push a coin with 11BTC max trading volume per day down 15 fold in a few sessions.  Again, I want to reiterate, I don't see any of this as an excuse for lacking communication with their community. They need to have more of a presence.  I haven't shared the message yet, haven't had the chance to myself, but I'm expecting to have another conversation with him soon and I'll let him know - on behalf of all of us here - that they've got to step up the communication.",False

But at least three of your premises are unsound and reveal a fundamental lack of understanding of CompCoin and of trading financial instruments on global markets.  You said ""if it was fully adopted by everyone it would stop working and your company would go out of business.""  So your idea is basically that if it made money, everyone trading USD/EUR would buy it, then it wouldn't work because we'd all have the same positions, so therefore it can't exist/doesn't work.  Do you even realize what this would entail? USD/EUR is the largest financial market in the world. You think the algo can't find someone on the other side of your trade for a couple hundred bucks in a multi-trillion dollar market? And the reason you think so is because everyone would own the software if it worked?  First of all, if that were the case, we'd all be millionaires from every single USD/EUR trader trying to buy CMP - so what's your point?  Also, it's impossible.  Why? Keep in mind there will only be 10MM ever minted; they expire due to fees at a rate of .5% per quarter (2% per year deflation). So in any case, everyone can't have them. There's a limited, deflationary supply and a minimum requirement to get access (you can't get the algos for 0.1 CMP) - hence your flawed premises.  Moreover, each token only trades up to $500. So with 10,000,000 CMP: only $5 Billion - at most, when all coins are minted by 2020 - can ever be traded by CompCoin, within the $5.3 Trillion PER DAY Forex market.  And what about the other financial instruments and markets that will become available, each with their own multi-trillion dollar market caps? Pretty soon we're looking at a situation where CMP algos can trade most financial markets. Yet no more CMP will be created after that 10MM.  So please explain how $5B in CMP controlled capital won't find liquidity among a $5.3 Trillion market, let alone when CMP is spread amongst all of the global financial markets that the ART platform will eventually include.  What predictive technology do you think Goldman Sachs trades with - and every other investment bank, hedge fund, trading desk, etc.? They use proprietary, top tier machine learning. Bayesian theory - the probability models that the algos are built on - has been around since the 1700's and has been applied to finance through computational sciences since the 1980's. The whole point of CMP is to democratize access to top tier machine learning algos through the distribution mechanisms afforded by tokenized software licenses. You're kidding yourself if you think it can't work.",False

Why can't you trade with it right now this second?

Apparently the documents have been submitted and are pending approval.

Now compare that to other ICOs that have roadmaps with no actual code written yet. Here we're two weeks out from having been listed on an exchange and already they're about to release into the wild.
