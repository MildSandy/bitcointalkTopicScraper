They had many interviews.  I just want to add that the demand for computational processing capabilities and storage is expected to dramatically increase in the near future due to two major trends in the business and computing worlds: Big Data and Arti cial Intelligence (AI). Big Data is the collection, management and storage of vast amounts of information obtained from any internal of external sources (such as the company’s IT systems, social networks, sensors and so on). The data management of companies promotes collection and storage of any data related to its operations, clients and competitors, should a need to analyze any of these data ever present it self. The other major trend is the emergence of Arti cial Intelligence methods that “learn” from data on past operations,  nd patterns and business rules and predict future behavior. AI-based processes consume require vast amounts of computations and consume signi cant processing power of CPU and GPU processes. T he demand for storage and for processing power is expected to exponentially increase with broadening the introduction of AI applications in new areas and with the widespread adoption of data collection from multiple channels (such as sensors, social networks, data providers, etc.) and later processing them. And I hope your platform will really help to deal with all that guys and reduce costs mostly for us - users",False

One of the most common methods that miners use is Proof of Work or Proof of Stake, which is a mechanism that rewards a particular miner for discovering a particular block. IAGON’s decided to take a different and better approach by using a “Proof of Variance” mechanism.  The Proof of Variance essentially classifies each miner based on their contribution into a pool, allowing miners within the same pool to compete which each other. Miners from lower pools get upgraded or downgraded based on several factors but the two main factors are speed and amount of data that they are able to handle. This mechanism uses a combination of algebraic theory and probability functions to compute a miners contribution and determine which pool they can be classified under. This allows newer miners to profit from mining data while increasing their processing assets. It also allows miners who invest more to receive an immediate return on their investment.  As block tasks are distributed to miners, they need to match the data signature from the data input and find its corresponding data object in the block to return the data output. They do not need to store any of the data they process, though once it is validated to belong to the specific block, the miner is considered to have mined the block and receives incentives for it.

Reliability because we have 24/7 uptime, our solution doesn't rely on several servers but thousands of nodes miners to run the system. In a centralized solution one server failure can result in downtime for many companies/users, our solution if one node/miner is offline, there are others to help take the load. Afforable prices because we are able to cut costs of up to 80%. Why? Because we have relative to no infrastructure cost. Whereas centeralized solutions pay millions of dollars for servers and staff to run those servers. Security because ofcourse all info (not storage, but the hashes of the info), is being stored on the Blockchain.

The data management of companies promotes collection and storage of any data related to its operations, clients and competitors, should a need to analyze any of these data ever present it self.

So, thank you! It is because of the community and supporters behind us, that the IAGON project has won the “Crypto Fight Club: The Search for the Undisputed” poll conducted by MegaX.

This mechanism uses a combination of algebraic theory and probability functions to compute a miners contribution and determine which pool they can be classified under.

IAGON benefits the miners who provide processing power and storage space to the grid without requiring efforts when their servers and computers are not used by them. Blocks are distributed evenly to miners by utilizing proof of variance and does not store any of the data within their local systems. This allows data to be processed anonymously without being able to identify any single node individually. Miners are incentivized to process the data quickly to earn rewards.

IAGON utilizes and enables storing big data files and repositories, as well as smaller scales of files, and carries out complex computational processes, such as those needed for artificial intelligence and machine learning operations. IAGON operates a fully secure and encrypted platform that integrates blockchain/tangle, cryptographic and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in a user-friendly way.  Under IAGON’s platform you can imagine a world where anyone can profit by joining a massive processing grid. IAGON will provide a fully automated platform for carrying out the storage and processing tasks of users on the basis of unutilized storage and processing capacities that are contributed by the “miners”. The miners will be able to convert the tokens back to fiat money, to accumulate them or to pay for similar services that they need with the tokens. For each transaction, IAGON will charge 10% commission and the rest of the tokens will be transferred to the miner. This decentralized cloud platform will operate two grids, i.e. a storage grid and a processing grid. Both grids operate on a Blockchain platform powered by Machine Learning capabilities to optimize the allocation of tasks and files to miners.  IAGON Mission:  IAGON’s major aim is to revolutionize the cloud and web services market by offering a decentralized grid of storage and processing. By joining the unused storage capacity in servers and personal computers and their processing power, we can create a super-computer and super data center that can compete with any of the current cloud computing moguls.  We aim at providing companies and individuals storage and processing services at a fraction of the market prices and at a better security level by connecting data centers, business computers and personal users and utilizing their free storage capacities and their CPU and GPU processors during idle times. Doing so, IAGON overcomes the entry barriers imposed by the high level of investments required to compete in this market.

In return for sharing the capabilities of their machine, they will be granted IAGON tokens that can be traded back to fiat money.",False

By joining the unused storage capacity in servers and personal computers and their processing power, we can create a super-computer and super data center that can compete with any of the current cloud computing moguls.  We aim at providing companies and individuals storage and processing services at a fraction of the market prices and at a better security level by connecting data centers, business computers and personal users and utilizing their free storage capacities and their CPU and GPU processors during idle times. Doing so, IAGON overcomes the entry barriers imposed by the high level of investments required to compete in this market. Our token-based economy is based on computer, server and data center owners who join the storage and processing power grids.  In return for sharing the capabilities of their machine, they will be granted IAGON tokens that can be traded back to fiat money.",False

Following an exclusive invite, IAGON’s very own Elad Harison and Pavlo Babenko represented IAGON during the June 12th — 13th, 2018 Blockchain pre-Accelerator Pitching Bootcamp in Switzerland, which covered a multitude of advanced techniques and impressive strategies. Based upon suggestions given by Swiss Innovation, Urs Aebischer directed the 2-day event, which was an impressive choice due to his many accomplishments, including raising 30 million USD in investments with his previous startups.  Beyond that, the event was packed with direct and responsive training, with Day 1 being held in Zug. During the first part of the day there were several exercises focused on Pitch training, while the evening hosted Pitching Night in Zurich where, after heading there via train, participants spent the evening pitching to the local Blockchain community as preparation for the day that was to come. For this event, Pavlo presented the IAGON project and garnered a lot of interest from the community in reference to the technology behind IAGON.  The next day did not hold back either, while the group of participants spent their mornings working on the last round of changes, based upon the input received from others during the previous day’s events. As the evening rolled around, 6:30 pm in Zug was an eventful one that was full of Investor Pitches and additional Networking.

One of the most common methods that miners use is Proof of Work or Proof of Stake, which is a mechanism that rewards a particular miner for discovering a particular block. IAGON’s decided to take a different and better approach by using a “Proof of Variance” mechanism.  The Proof of Variance essentially classifies each miner based on their contribution into a pool, allowing miners within the same pool to compete which each other. Miners from lower pools get upgraded or downgraded based on several factors but the two main factors are speed and amount of data that they are able to handle. This mechanism uses a combination of algebraic theory and probability functions to compute a miners contribution and determine which pool they can be classified under. This allows newer miners to profit from mining data while increasing their processing assets. It also allows miners who invest more to receive an immediate return on their investment.  As block tasks are distributed to miners, they need to match the data signature from the data input and find its corresponding data object in the block to return the data output. They do not need to store any of the data they process, though once it is validated to belong to the specific block, the miner is considered to have mined the block and receives incentives for it.",False

One of the most common methods that miners use is Proof of Work or Proof of Stake, which is a mechanism that rewards a particular miner for discovering a particular block. IAGON’s decided to take a different and better approach by using a “Proof of Variance” mechanism.  The Proof of Variance essentially classifies each miner based on their contribution into a pool, allowing miners within the same pool to compete which each other. Miners from lower pools get upgraded or downgraded based on several factors but the two main factors are speed and amount of data that they are able to handle. This mechanism uses a combination of algebraic theory and probability functions to compute a miners contribution and determine which pool they can be classified under. This allows newer miners to profit from mining data while increasing their processing assets. It also allows miners who invest more to receive an immediate return on their investment.  As block tasks are distributed to miners, they need to match the data signature from the data input and find its corresponding data object in the block to return the data output. They do not need to store any of the data they process, though once it is validated to belong to the specific block, the miner is considered to have mined the block and receives incentives for it.  Some of the additional benefits are:  IAGON provides miners with complete flexibility and freedom of choice in providing and consuming decentralized cloud services. Miners can choose either Ethereum or Tangle to fully secure and store their files, process computational tasks, pay and receive IAGON tokens for cloud services. IAGON benefits the miners who provide processing power and storage space to the grid without requiring efforts when their servers and computers are not used by them. Blocks are distributed evenly to miners by utilizing proof of variance and does not store any of the data within their local systems. This allows data to be processed anonymously without being able to identify any single node individually. Miners are incentivized to process the data quickly to earn rewards. Miners receive incentives based upon the number of processes they perform. In other words, the more data they process the bigger the incentives.",False

One of the most effective ways to attain the security that you’re seeking is by way of encryption. Providing an additional layer of security for end users, encryption of secure platforms is an incredibly important aspect of IT (information technology) that allows you to trust in various services and devices that would otherwise be viewed as potential security risks.  As society and technology advance, increasing numbers of services are being offered via the cloud or mobile devices, which in turn allows for better overall productivity throughout a day, however, there are always chances for unsuspecting individuals to misplace their device, making their secure information available to those who find it. That is, of course, unless you have already encrypted the data, preventing unauthorized individuals from accessing your private information. But, encryption goes far beyond simply securing the data on your device.  Our users desire to protect their information, ensuring that the content that they may be transferring is done so in the most secure way possible, and our encryption/decryption protocol is used to ensure the security of the internally stored data. All data stored within IAGON’s platform is encrypted to some degree in order to protect the data in the event of a breach. In addition, IAGON has a variety of options to store data on its platform, including SQL,NoSQL, private Blockchains and other 3rd party storage providers which are compliant with regulatory requirements. IAGON at its core uses AES-256 to encrypt and decrypt data, which is the encryption standard recommended by the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and uses a symmetric key algorithm. https://medium.com/iagon-official/the-importance-of-encrypted-platforms-76f387ee9a2  This unique protection is only available through the implementation of encryption techniques and allows you to truly trust the platform in which you are sharing your most sacred information.",False

Through the KYC (Know Your Customer) process, IAGON will be able to verify the source of funds raised during the course of the token sale, guaranteeing that governmental regulations are met.  We want to increase our Global position and in order to do so, we must interact and partner with third party providers that will ensure the security and accuracy of our platform users, token holders, miners and more. In efforts to accomplish this important fete, we have spent a long time vetting various companies that may be able to assist us in the quest to have a completely secure and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) compliant platform. There could never be too much security when it comes to the protection of sensitive information, including personal financials and identity and for that reason we have chosen to incorporate Jumio into our KYC process and Comply Advantage for the additional AML (Anti-Money Laundering) checks.  Utilized by some of the leading companies in the industry, California-based Jumio is considered to be the largest and most accurate solution on the market. Rather than attempting to use a less secure yet traditional verification method, Jumio connects an individual’s online and offline identities quickly by connecting with the individual via webcam or smartphone. Not only is this method much more reliable, but the verification process can be completed within seconds instead of waiting for several hours or even days. With Jumio being 100% GDPR compliant, we trust that they will be able to aid us in the process of establishing trust with our valued community members and potential investors, while continuing to adhere to compliance mandates.  In addition to incorporating Jumio with our KYC, we have also sought out the best companies to work alongside us in our quest to avoid fraudulent and illegal financial transactions and money laundering attempts, partnering with the best in their field — Comply Advantage. Comply Advantage performs at the highest level, diligently ensuring that there is no suspicious activity coming from individuals that are utilizing the IAGON platform. The Comply Advantage AML checks screen against global PEPs and Sanction databases, giving IAGON users the highest level of protection against terrorism funding, fraud and other unlawful financial activities.  We value our community and will continue to hire and partner with the best companies in their respective fields in order to ensure that our community receives an optimal and secure experience. https://medium.com/@navjitdhaliwal/kyc-aml-check-open-for-iagon-pre-sale-bcfdd74bd8ca",False

Although our project is off to an incredible start, we continue to work towards positioning ourselves globally and are honored and thankful for every chance that we have to present our platform to the world.  On May 14th, 2018, we had the opportunity to do just that as we presented the IAGON platform during one of Qatar’s first ICO conferences, which was located in Doha.  The invitation-only, ICO Qatar Conference event hosted a panel of nine speakers and showcased seven amazingly innovative projects, including IAGON. During our time at the conference, we had the chance to reveal the overall vision behind the IAGON platform, while also connecting with thought leaders from across the globe, creating bonds and building bridges that will aid us all in the global expansion of our respective brands.  During ICO QATAR, visitors and participants took part in a Q&A session that led to in depth conversations and straightforward feedback regarding the IAGON project and the other projects that were being showcased at the time. This portion of the conference was vital to the future growth and development of these cutting edge technologies because, not only did it provide a network of Industry peers that are willing to assist in the process, but it also allows us to listen to our potential users and make changes to enhance the usability of our platform, to fit the needs that we may have otherwise overlooked.  Overall, ICO QATAR was a success and, although the exact number of investors has yet to be determined, we did manage to make a bevy of new professional connections, while securing a meeting at the Qatar Financial Center (QFC), where we spoke with one of their representatives about the potential for future collaborations. Moreover, through our networking efforts, we were able to connect with a few additional investors, enthusiasts and other like minded individuals that see this technology as being on the precipice of revolutionary change. Included in our newly minted relationships is a Qatari investor, interested and ready to learn more about what we have to offer, as well as a couple of individuals that are interested in becoming a part of AGON’s initial adopter program.  As IAGON continues to grow, we will continue to present our groundbreaking platform to the world, revealing updates and events to our community, as they take place.  https://medium.com/iagon-official/iagon-platform-shines-at-ico-qatar-b0fa4b22025a",False

Due to these major outages, platform users in various regions were unable to properly access the platform, if they were able to access it at all, leading to many users submitting online complaints regarding this issue.  In a statement that Telegram released to their users, they acknowledged the problem, saying: “Repairs are ongoing after a massive power outage in the Amsterdam region that affected many services. Telegram users in Europe, MENA, Russia and the CIS are currently unable to connect. We apologize and will update you on the progress.”  Telegram, the encrypted messenger app, has become the go-to platform for Blockchain companies and debates on crypto-assets and numerous startups are relying on the app to effectively communicate with their community. Their issues with downtime, however, are causing users to doubt the company’s reliability. Remember, this wasn’t the first time that Telegram has come under fire for their platform shutdowns and undesired downtime, but we at IAGON strive to prevent this from happening to other online community platforms in the future.  At IAGON we understand the problem and are ready to provide a valuable solution for growing companies by using distributed data and distributed processing. Our platform will collect GPU and CPU processors from users during idle times, enabling us to create a global supercomputer which will allow our users to access extreme computational power and data storage at a highly secure level. To ensure the security of your files, all data that a company shares on our platform will be broken into shards (pieces), with each shard copied several times and distributed to multiple nodes/miners. So, even if a person hacks into the system and gets access to one specific piece of data, they won’t be able to encrypt or understand it without other pieces of data, which will remain unattainable, as full data sets can only be accessed, edited or deleted by the individual or company who owns the private key.  Since the distributed data that IAGON collects has several shards and copies of each shard, data stored on our platform is accessible 24/7. Meaning if data is divided between numerous nodes (or servers) the others will be fully capable of taking over the task and continuing to provide the user with undisturbed operations. This structure is going to have the ability to assist other online platforms who access the full capabilities and potential of the IAGON platform, to nullify their downtime and server problems.  As a result, individuals and organizations that accumulate large data sets as a part of their day-to-day operations will now have new ways to store it on a secure platform and IAGON can deliver those innovative methods at up to 80% cheaper than the centralized solutions.  https://medium.com/iagon-official/iagon-solving-the-mystery-of-platforms-downtime-b0a7e7b76e97",False

With the second week of April rolling in strong, we at IAGON are excited to announce the winners of the IAGON Legacy Competition, Round 1.  IAGON uses the world’s leading technology for developing and establishing two online grids to connect users that demand storage capacities for Big Data and large processing capabilities for Artificial Intelligence computations. As previously mentioned, the IAGON AI protocol is based on scores given to miners for their gpu, cpu and storage capabilities and we are in need of a name for these scores (i.e. Dragonchain Slumber Score).  Thanks to the massive amount of community engagement and involvement in the competition, we have compiled a large list of suggestions and have managed to narrow the list down to the 5 most popular name suggestions.  Round 2 of the contest will consist of a poll where members from the community can participate with their votes on the name that they like the most out of the list above. The team at IAGON will ultimately be deciding upon the top 3 contestants, as well as the final winner of the competition, however, we are basing our decision upon a combination of relevance and alignment with the overall vision of IAGON, along with taking into account the thoughts of our community members.  This phase of the competition will be open on Facebook, to community members and supporters, beginning at 5pm PST on Monday, April 9th, 2018 and will run through Wednesday, April 11th, 2018 @ 9am PST. Winners of the competition will be announced SOLELY through the IAGON Reddit Page, with each of the 3 receiving prizes in the form of IAGON Tokens: 12,500 IAG Tokens for 1st Place, 6,250 IAG Tokens for 1st Place and 3,333 IAG Tokens for the 3rd place suggestion.  Please remember to subscribe to our Reddit page in order to track the winners and get involved in our upcoming community events.

Iagon has a fully secured and encrypted platform that seamlessly integrates blockchain, tangle, cryptography, and AI, enhancing the overall usability.  Our vision is to create a Global Supercomputer, powered by Artificial Intelligence & Blockchain/Tangle Technology. This is accomplished by integration across all smart devices, thus creating a seamless experience that effectively and efficiently serves the needs of its users  IAGON utilizes enables to store big data files and repositories, as well as smaller scales of files, and to carry out complex computational processes, such as those needed for artificial intelligence and machine learning operations, within a fully secure and encrypted platform that integrates blockchain, tangle, cryptographic and AI technologies in a user friendly way.   Don’t Miss Out on the NEXT Disruptive Innovation! HOW IT WORKS? Decentralized and Secure Cloud Platform Developing a one-stop solution for decentralized cloud based services.  IAGON’s major aim is to revolutionize the cloud and web services market by offering a decentralized grid of storage and processing.  By joining the unused storage capacity in servers and personal computers and their processing power, we can create a super-computer and super data center that can compete with any of the current cloud computing moguls.  We aim at providing companies and individuals storage and processing services at a fraction of the market prices and at a better security level by connecting data centers, business computers, and personal users and utilizing their free storage capacities and their CPU and GPU processors during idle times. Doing so, IAGON overcomes the entry barriers imposed by the high level of investments required to compete in this market.   IAGON TOKEN ECONOMY  Our token-based economy is based on computer, server, and data center owners who join the storage and processing power grids.  In return for sharing the capabilities of their machine, they will be granted IAGON tokens that can be traded back to fiat money, while any party who wishes to utilize their capabilities will purchase IAGON tokens to distribute them to the parties that provide their services to the grid.  The storage mechanism will be based on blockchain encryption and delivery of encrypted file fragments to many storage facilities. Contributors to the grid can publish their skills and free capacity and offer their service on the basis of their experience, available resources, and storage space and bidding on price.  Advanced machine learning and AI algorithms will assist in recommending prices to parties involved in this venture and classifying them according to their price levels and assuring continuity of services and access to all files.  As more and more companies will recognize the benefits of IAGON’s platforms for storing files and processing them, the demand will increase and so will be the demand for the token – the way customers pay grid participants.  IAGON’s token and platform are proven services with our Ethereum-based blockchain beta version, proving the concept of blockchain-based distributed computing and storage grid.
