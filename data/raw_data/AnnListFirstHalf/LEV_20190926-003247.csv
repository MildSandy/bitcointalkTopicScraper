Decentralized protocols such as 0xproject and Airswap err on the side of safety, while centralized exchanges err on the side of usability and economics. The market has certainly favored the latter as decentralized protocols have only captured marginal volume.  The technical issues with on-chain order-books and order-matching are well documented in many places. However, the real issues are economic. Trading on exchanges with on-chain matching is simply a losing proposition for many reasons. For example, any system where cancellations require an on-chain transaction are not feasible for market making. When the price moves fast, orders need to be cancelled and moved repeatedly with millisecond resolution to avoid being filled at severe disadvantage. Market making only works because razor thin margins over millions of transactions accumulate profit. Lags due to blockchain events and congestion attacks would mean a single day can undo the profits of many months.  We analyze this and other issues of current decentralized exchanges and present a protocol with the best of both centralized and decentralized approaches.  The Leverj protocol centralizes speed-critical functions and decentralizes safety-critical functions. Users can use fraud-proofs to detect violations and notify the smart contract that holds custody of user funds.  We invite the public and the best crypto minds to analyze the protocol and help us make it as secure as possible. from https://blog.leverj.io/announcing-high-speed-non-custodial-trading-with-ethereum-a0e9159e96cd  Read the Protocol Paper Here",False

I would even say it is quite under-hyped. Such expertise coming from the team isn't highlighted enough by the community, and the final product will definitely be useful to thousands of people. Let's be honest, it won't be a 10000% RoI in the first few months, but it is definitely a good project with a serious team that, I believe, will grow strong progressively. Getting early in the ICO in order to get some LEV, and start staking them right from the beginning is a nice long term strategy in my opinion, as you will accumulate something that will be very useful whenever the product reaches mass adoption (look at how BNB and KCS were successful).  Anyway, if you have any question, feel free to ask them here. Please note that I may not be the best for answering to technical questions, I think the team is better than me for this lol, they are really helpful on their Telegram. They literally answer to *all* questions, it's quite awesome. (https://t.me/leverj). But I can give you some insights about leverj investment-wise - at least, give you my humble point of view.",False
