With ICOs having such a high inherent risk, it may make more sense to look at something tackling a bigger problem. (-2)     The mercy of third-parties. Facebook‚Äôs recent advertising guideline changes and the ever-evolving digital media landscape could hinder Friendz in the long run. (-1)  Growth Potential     Proven idea. Most importantly, Friendz is already successful. Investing in a company that‚Äôs already profitable eliminates a lot of risk. (+6)     Virality. The platform is built around social sharing and virality. As more people use the app and share content, the company should ideally see exponential growth. (+4)     Token terms. The small percentage of tokens allocated to the team and buy-back program give me less suspicion that there‚Äôs any funny business going on. (+2)  Disposition Friendz receives a total score of +7 out of 10. The team, product, and token are solid and look to have minimal downside risk compared to other ICO investments. The company isn‚Äôt trying to drastically change the world through a decentralized internet or financial institution overthrow. Instead, they‚Äôre tackling a fairly large industry that probably won‚Äôt be going anywhere anytime soon.  Although this probably won‚Äôt be a home-run 50x return, it could easily by a solid single or double.   This is a good rating from hacked.com.
