TechBench is a social network for IT-professionals and programmers which will offer membership to specialists that can lead to an unlimited amount of opportunity to blend talents and ideas into meaningful projects. It combines the best of social media, crowd-based development, freelance employment and interactive crowdfunding. Users of the platform will be able to interact, exchange ideas, and work together to create technical foundations for startups.  TechBench brings together three user categories: investors, IT professionals and businesses. Because it's not merely a social network, but a crowdfunding and employment platform, TechBench provides an excellent opportunity for Ethereum-based investors to find high-quality projects and businesses to make contracts with IT professionals who come together to develop their own startups.  Social network TechBench is designed to become one of the main networks for IT specialists and programmers. Using the social profile, technology professionals will be able to show their qualifications, achievements, and areas of current interest. The social profile will offer wide opportunities for specialists to express themselves. Freelance participants will be able to join the platform to earn cash or value; they can also share ideas, join teams and collaborate on projects.  Investment portal TechBench allows everyone to safely fund start-ups with high growth potential. This approach maximizes opportunity for professionals, developer, and investors to gain access to substantial projects and early stage startups. With its base in smart contracts, it offers high levels of safety and investor comfort. The highest returns on investment often come from early stage investments. Investors that seek to maximize profits look to this stage as the best opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a successful startup.  Employment solution Employers seeking to fill gaps in their professional workforce can use TechBench to get vetted lists of qualified applicants. Professionals that create profiles gain exposure to employment and contract opportunities. The platform will give access for small and mediumsized (SMB) IT-business to the base of qualified IT specialists, formed using algorithms for screening and testing staff.  Platform intended to change current model of interaction in the freelance industry An innovative model will allow developers to be independent, work for themselves or find colleagues, search and create projects more efficiently. The opportunity to participate and invest in high-profit start-ups should become accessible to a wide audience. In addition, the platform will provide a system which gives access to the base of qualified IT specialists which is a recruiting solution for business clients.  TechBench is designed to completely change the way the freelance market works today. Instead of all of the users competing against one another for jobs, they will be able to come together to improve code and even develop their own new projects and ideas.  This new model is a ground breaking approach for promoting startups and creating early bird investment opportunities. Professionals that choose to share ideas create the possibility to grow through collaboration and not just through competition. It is precise and comprehensive solution to connecting investment and technical innovation, promoting ownership and long-term equity.  Collaboration rather than competition An innovative model will allow developers to be independent, work for themselves or find colleagues, search and create projects more efficiently. Collaboration is a distinctive feature of TechBench, and the ecosystem thrives on professional collaboration. Development sites allow people to share and combine code to produce great apps and programs. And crowdfunding sites are the basis for some of the most exciting and innovative products and startups in today's economy. TechBench brings all of these together under one roof - united with the power of Ethereum-based cryptocurrency.  Collaboration rather than competition is an ideal environment for developing projects. With a global talent pool, professionals can share ideas and promote technological innovation. Projects that take form can attract developers on the TechBench platform. Developers play the key role of fostering project development and connecting the project to potential funding sources.
