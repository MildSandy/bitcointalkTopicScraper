Relevant to this article is the Agenda on Food Security.  Blockchain Technology has been the talk of town now for the past one year after Bitcoin reached its all-time highs of 20,000 USD per BTC in late 2017. In Kenya, the craze to jump on the bandwagon and own a slice of crypto, has not been with its challenges. What of the few exchanges available in the country and the tedious processes required for one to be approved to trade on these platforms. Despite these challenges, a recent report by Business Daily Africa estimates that 2.4 Billion dollars Kenyans have and are HODL in cryptos combined value. It is a fact that Kenya has been in the front lines in adopting new technologies, among other equals in Africa i.e South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Rwanda and Egypt.  The above paints a picture in which Africa is leapfrogging other technologies like card-based technologies to mobile technologies and now Blockchain. Any startups, ICOs, Blockchain companies worth their salt, should never ignore the potential that Africa hold especially in furthering the adoption of Blockchain as the Technology of the 21st Century.  These companies must design their products with Africa in mind. Africa holds the potential as the last frontier that’s untapped and its resources, both human and natural, holds the promise to solve World’s problems and thus becomes the missing link in a truly civilized and developed world.  https://medium.com/cibusworld/cibus-trade-f1fbc13212f8",True

ECOS is focussed on Quality Control of Food only. While CIBUS is focused on full ecosystem of Food end to end. ECOS total business can be compared with CIBUS TRACE module only.
