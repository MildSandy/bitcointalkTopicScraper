However, if I may say so, although I know the Industries will be a very important player in this project, I think it would be very useful to explain on this forum not only in easily understandable language, but also in only a few lines, what exactly the use, the idea and the ambition of the project is.  This forum is flooded with newbies and juniors looking for interesting opportunities to invest and/or speculate, who are missing out on this impressive project, because their attention span is not longer than 20 seconds.  And I think a lot of the more serious investors and readers on this forum could be interested in the project too, and a short introduction could awaken their curiosity.
