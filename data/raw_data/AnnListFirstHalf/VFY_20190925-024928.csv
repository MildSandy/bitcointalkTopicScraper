VFY will be available through a token pre-sale scheduled for September 14, 2017 and a crowdsale open to the community  NEW DATE: The crowdsale opens on October 25th, 2017 17:00 UTC and closes on November 30th, 2017 17:00 UTC.   See www.verif-y.io for the pre-sale and crowdsale site   VERIFY'S CREDENTIAL VERIFICATION PLATFORM AND DIGITAL IDENTITY Verif-y’s identity solution addresses the fact that a strong and reliable digital identity is necessary for the continued expansion of the global digital economy and a fundamental building block of the rapidly expanding blockchain economy. To meet the fast-growing identification demand, Verif-y is expanding the development of the blockchain-based, digital identity solution layer of its commercially available credential and employment verification platform. Verif-y’s services improve the protection of Personally Identifiable Information (""PII""), which in today’s world define our identity.       VERIF-Y APP - SAMPLE PROFILE       IDENTITY NEEDS ARE CHANGING Verif-y’s aim is to give its users the power to own, manage and communicate their digital identities and verified credentials as well as to give entities an interface and layer of trust to provide and request PII data. Importantly, with Verif-y, all communication of PII is exclusively governed by the users, something not available until now.  VERIF-Y PROTECTS INDIVIDUALS’ DATA The Verif-y platform employs Next-Generation Defense-in-Depth methodology to support and secure the industry’s first end-to-end validation of education, employment, license, certification and membership credentials and the resulting digital identity. The strength of the digital identity generated by Verif-y’s process is high, given that the identity is generated in an organic manner – comprised of unique identifying data, stored on the blockchain and resulting in a new paradigm for securely storing and accessing PII.  This new digital identity can then be utilized for identification purposes outside of the employment and educational markets, such as online login authentication, formal identifications (IDs), physical access and many more applications.    Verif-y's app and supporting platform have been live since April 2017 and available for download on iOS and Android devices.  As identity is one of the pillars of a successful and ubiquitous blockchain implementation in many industries, Verif-y’s highly robust and differentiated identity solution can become an essential part of this global, fundamental transformation.      EXAMPLE SMART CONTRACT DICTATING THE TERMS OF THE TOKEN-BASED TRANSACTIONS RELATING TO THE SHARING OF VERIFIED RECORDS            •   A user selects record(s) they want to share from their profile and payment with a Verif-y app-token is required and linked to the service request.      •   The smart contract oraclizes the share request through Verif-y’s secure, off-chain, API which sends the request to a web API.      •   Verif-y’s platform provides a secure interface for the third-party to submit a Verif-y app-token payment.      •   Following payment, the third-party securely accesses the shared record(s).      •   The platform then notifies the user that the third-party has viewed the share, and an incentive equal to a percentage of the cost of the service is refunded to the user’s Verif-y app-token balance, and the contract closes.        BLOCKCHAIN AND OUR VERIFICATION INFRASTRUCTURE Verif-y’s platform operates on a technology stack conceived and designed to leverage the attributes of the blockchain, and built to be operated securely and intuitively. Verif-y’s platform supports two types of PII, Identity Verification (“IDV”) and Credential and Employment Verification (“C&EV”) data. When users and organizations are introduced to Verif-y’s platform, they are assigned a Personal Identity Verification (“PIV”) or Organization Identity Verification (“OIV”) score respectively, which evolves as more records and other identification methodologies are associated with their identities.       This high-level functional diagram of Verif-y’s platform illustrates two data flows: from left to right, steps one through seven (in blue) represent on-boarding a user and the submission of a new record. From right to left (in green) represents how organizations can bulk upload/invite users to the platform with pre-populated record data.    The platform leverages the Ethereum blockchain to exchange credentials and identification between individuals and organizations, charging a substantially lower transaction fees than what is customary today and leveraging the power of smart contracts. Verif-y's app-token (VFY) facilitates in-service purchases on the platform, allowing organizations to manage their employees/students/members and users to have their personal credentials verified and disseminated via the app.    REVENUE MODEL  These organizations - private and public-sector employers, license and credential providers pay to validate their individual users’ credentials (students, employees, members) on the Verif-y platform, which in turn allows their users to own and manage this data in a way not previously possible.  Organizations will also pay to review various candidate’s data (such as job applicants, student admission applications etc.)  Users are able to sign up and pay for the services offered directly and submit their credentials for verification. Once these credentials are verified, these users are able to grant access to any third party of their choice, including: future employers, financial services providers, rental property managers, higher education institutions, governments and many more.      Additional revenue growth will come from the network effect, as more and more users enter information that is then verified, the more organizations will benefit from using the platform and the more organizations use the platform, the more others will come. This increased availability and growing use cases for our platform and its services will increase the utility of each user and organization identity.
