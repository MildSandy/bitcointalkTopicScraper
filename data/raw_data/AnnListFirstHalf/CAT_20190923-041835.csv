Or even the security that comes with knowing that there are no centrally controlled algorithms which take advantage of your digital footprints and browsing patterns on your favorite search engine? Imagine the efficiency, accuracy and security that such an engine can deliver!  That’s exactly what BitClave’s search engine, Desearch, offers.  Desearch enters the search engine ecosystem as BitClave’s answer to all user concerns over centralized control of the existing search engine providers, eliminating once and for all the problems and ambiguities in searching for specialized content (such as cryptocurrency and blockchain related information), the overbearing influence of service providers on such content owners, and exploitation of private data for advert revenue generation.  Desearch is able to eliminate these existing shortcomings by leveraging the BitClave ecosystem on the revolutionary blockchain technology. By virtue of this innovation, you can now get all your crypto information needs and curiosities in one easy dashboard, but without the bother of interfering ads or the age-long worries of invasion of your privacy.  How It Works  Essentially, the Desearch engine is an expansion of existing crypto-centric websites such as Coinmarketcap, Coincap, Coindesk, Cointelegraph, Crypto Answers, Coin Calendar, etc. and official websites, blogs, social links, and other digital resources of cryptocurrency concerns. But instead of serving as just another news or market information source that is still dependent on existing centralized search engines, Desearch acts as a decentralized pool for all the information and data resources of these specialized crypto-centric sites. This way, users have all the industry-related information in one place, with the extra benefit of searches being more focused and results more accurate and, of course, all the problems with centralized dependence engines are eliminated.  An Intuitive Search Algorithm  Besides the benefits of a decentralized ecosystem, the Desearch engine is also distinguished by its optimized, intuitive search algorithm which delivers a better experience when surfing, because it connects intelligently with the most trusted, relevant websites to gather the essentials on any search keywords. Furthermore, Desearch’s powerful search capability also looks through the top sites used in the Blockchain space, searching Telegram channels, BT, company and influencer Medium content, and Reddit, always going for the deepest dive on ICO and all crypto information — and that at the speed of lightning!  With a streamlined and specialized focus, Desearch is invaluable to the industry because it is now easier to stay up-to-date on crypto exchanges, find a strong ICO, track your favorite apps and developers, and quickly get the useful content that is restricted on the old search sites. It doesn’t get better!  The Future of Desearch  In line with BitClave’s vision, Desearch.com is designed to be the future of search, with a decentralized search engine that is the ultimate go-to for all types of content on the web. Even more, the BitClave blockchain ecosystem comes packed with even more juice, as it puts more power in the hands of the everyday internet surfer.",False

You will see GitHub activity this week for our Platform project. MatchICO is currently developed in private repositories as these include BitClave’s private IP. These projects will go through refactoring and we will move the functionality that does not include BitClave’s private IP to public repositories.  MatchICO This week we implemented many important features and fixed major bugs:   - Batch processing (processing of transactions in a group) that helped us to accelerate the distribution of token rewards. Do you remember that your rewards were in pending for a long time? Now we fixed it!  - Fixed the wallet verification process. The API of our wallet verification provider was broken and was causing a 500 error. We decided to design out the third party provider and implemented our own solution.  - Launched the referral program. Now everyone can earn 20 CATs if he refers a new investor with a wallet balance more than 1 ETH.  - There were cases where investors searched for offers but did not get any results. A common scenario for this case was when an investor had less funds on his wallet than what a business required as the minimal amount before extending the offer. We implemented a message box notifying investors of these situations. It is important to clarify that MatchICO is a platform facilitating a direct connection between ICO projects and ICO investors. It is the business who decides on the rules of the offer and the investor who decides on search criteria. The MatchICO search engine just follows the rules and matches ICO projects and ICO investors that have matching criterias.  Bitclave.com We redesigned our landing page and are actively implementing the frontend.You will be able to see the new design shortly.  Platform This week we focused on refining the requirements and scope for the 1st deliverable of the Platform project. A lot of work happened including product development like MatchICO (product) and Android BASE (early prototype) in private repositories and as part of technology evaluations in public repositories. We leveraged what we have learned during these phases and now we can define a better implementation plan for our Platform.  The scope for the 1st deliverable of the Platform has the following requirements and goals:   - Deliver the platform with clean, documented API that will be used internally in BitClave products and by our 3rd party partners  - Define an API and abstraction layer between DAPP and Platform layer  - This will allow us to adopt the best decentralized technologies that will be available in the future with minimal disruption to the application layer.  - API for the 1st phase shall cover the following use cases  - Registration  - Updates of personal information  - Authorization of access to personal data to a trusted entity  - Access to the personal information by an authorized parties  - Performance and economics of the deliverable shall be reasonable and be comparable to what is expected in the current centralized world  - To satisfy this requirements some of the capabilities will be implemented using centralized technologies  - The main value of this deliverable is an API for internal and external use and access to the anonymized data that was collected in BitClave products. With this deliverable, BitClave in it s own products and any 3rd party in their products can start using this API and build DAPPs that use and contribute to BASE anonymized data store.  Events/meetings We attended two conferences in Bay Area and several events this week   - Blockchain Protocol Analysis and Security Engineering 2018 at Stanford University - https://cyber.stanford.edu/bpase18  - This conference was very technical and academic as is expected from a conference held at Stanford. It was very encouraging to see hundreds of scientists talking about issues and solutions in blockchain space. You can see new research domains are being developed in academics around blockchain. Seeing this gives us more confidence that blockchain is here to stay. There are many issues with the current blockchain state but the best minds are working on finding solutions to these issues. There was a talk that had a direct relation to the issues that BitClave is attacking and it was about anonymity and linkability by Rebekah Mercer - Mobius. While a “user friendly” presentation is not available yet, here is the link to the research paper https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/881.pdf.  - Blockchain Technology Evolution in US and China - http://www.goblockchainconnect.com/  - One of the popular events in the Blockchain community with attendance of our partners ICON, QTUM and others. We met with several ICOs and continue to see a lot of interest for MatchICO as several more projects will be added to the mix.  - An evening with Jay Clayton - https://law.stanford.edu/event/evening-jay-clayton/  - An interesting panel at Stanford with the SEC head. It was very interesting to listen to Mr. Clayton, who presented his views not just on the state of ICOs,, but the overall view of the global investment climate. As the US government continues to study the phenomena of Blockchain, we see the role of technology companies continuing the path of innovation while making sure they closely follow any new legal developments and regulations.  Marketing We continue our search for Head of Marketing https://angel.co/bitclave/jobs/264172-head-of-marketing. We have made several hires in the marketing team. If you are interested in joining us, please drop us a line.  Community Here we have collected the top questions we have received from our community this week   - Why there is no GitHub activity. Answer: To add more details to the answer given above on this topic. BitClave plays two roles in building the BASE ecosystem. The 1st role is building the open platform to enable 3rd party development and the 2nd role is building Products and Services on top of that platform. A lot of activity happened in building products in BitClave’s 2nd role, but this activity was happening in private repositories on GitHub as it included BitClave’s private IP. The reason we have chosen to focus on products and prototypes 1st (our 2nd role) is to better experience the need of the 3rd parties and to better define the requirements for the platform (our 1st role). We kicked off the Platform project and you will see more and more activity in this direction as we ramp up.  - Why there are so little updates to the community and requests to improve marketing efforts Answer: We hear your feedback. We took actions to improve in this area. As you can already see, we had 3 AMA sessions, we started to publish a weekly newsletter and we are in final stages of hiring and extending our marketing team.  - Why can I see CAT balance on my Bitclave account if I already withdrew tokens Answer: What you see on your BitCalve dashboard right now is the information related to the event of Token Sale. It shows the contribution you made and the tokens you got. This dashboard is NOT a generic CAT wallet at this stage  - Where can I find my tokens after I bought them on your site Answer: You refer to a feature where you can buy / sell CAT. This feature is powered by Bancor. It allows you to buy / sell CAT tokens without any need to register on exchanges or even Bancor. All you need is a MetaMask wallet. All the transactions will happen on the MetaMask wallet. Metamask is a mandatory requirement to use this feature.  - How many tokens should I withdraw Answer: This is completely up to you. You can keep your tokens with BitClave or move to your own Ethereum address.  - Where can I buy these tokens Answer: You can buy the tokens on exchanges, on BitClave site using the Bancor-powered wallet or as a business you can buy tokens in MatchICO.  - What GAS to set up Answer: GAS price fluctuates a LOT in Ethereum network based on the load on Ethereum at the time of transaction. We recommend checking https://ethgasstation.info/ for the average GAS price before you issue your transaction.  - MatchICO: Do we really need to have 0.5 ETH in the wallet constantly to get offers? Answer: Businesses decide on the criteria for their offers and what rewards they are willing to pay for using an investor’s personal information in extending the offer. Businesses might decide they are not interested in extending offers to potential investors that have less than 0.5 ETH on their ETH wallets.",False

If I understood correctly, the product (MatchICO) is based on the platform (BASE).  Quote https://www.bitclave.com/en/ Alpha BASE platform is under active development and is publicly available on BitClave's GitHub account. The CAT Token is deployed on Ethereum main net and is used as the currency in BitClave’s first product. The product is dubbed MatchICO. MatchICO allows ICO projects to pay contributors CAT tokens in return for the right to use contributor’s personal data while presenting their ICO project.  Quote https://medium.com/@BitClave/bitclave-2018-and-beyond-813df59489da In October, we released the first version of our search product dubbed MatchICO. MatchICO is a proof of concept website where users can receive CAT tokens in exchange for viewing various ICO’s while sharing their data with the listed companies. MatchICO is mainly aimed at demonstrating a new way of direct marketing between consumers and businesses. Businesses pay the consumers directly, avoiding middlemen like Google and Facebook — BitClave’s core idea.",False

Here’s my thoughts and predictions of the prices when Bitclave is listed on the exchanges:  Price prediction Starting price range may be $0.31 — $0.50 where I think some lucky few will perhaps get in for $0.10 — $0.20.  I predict that the bulk of the trading in the first few days will trend up and take place between $0.50 — $0.63 & finally I estimate that the high end at the beginning could taper off between $0.70 — $0.77.  Going forward Outstanding dev team, a promising collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University, actual alpha product on their BASE platform, challenging but disruptive solution.  One issue I do see is transaction speed limitations but that is more a problem involving the whole blockchain ecosystem.  Bitclave is gonna be exciting and one to look out for going into 2018.  As for the future, steady price increase. With the updates, changes and improvements of what’s to come, I place a conservative price point of $1.50 Mid 2018 and around $2.00 — $2.35 EOY 2018. Take this into consideration with a grain of salt.  Possible aspect of the supply One interesting found is the total circulation supply. Currently, most of us think it is around 550m (cirrulation supply). As mentioned - “550,842,000 tokens distributed in token sale or 25,547,000 USD hard cap""  Those were just the general terms of the token sale. But if one were to take a look at their contract https://etherscan.io/token/0x68e14bb5a45b9681327e16e528084b9d962c1a39#balances, by the actual numbers we’re looking at possibly less than 400m in circulation (Total Supply minus top holder which is assumed to be bitclave).  In this case, there could be a big increase in what the actual prices are. Knowing my luck, I’ll probably be sleeping when trading starts so I do hope this isn’t the case. If not, then that’s good since nothing has change.   Reminder, this is not what the actual prices will be. This is just a prediction. The numbers could be overestimated or underestimated. This serves as a guideline and will vary on an individual basis.",False

The fact that the crowd sale sold out very fast means that there was a high demand with this token so even if people want to offload and bounty hunters will dump their coins, I also believe demand will exceed supply at the 10 cents level which was the original ICO price if I am correct.

BASE revolutionizes how people interact with search engines and online advertisements. It provides compelling alternative to the current walled off garden of online advertising by prioritizing personal privacy and user control over data while supporting a transparent and streamlined process for businesses to reach customer audiences.  How did we get that idea? I have a solid background in cybersecurity, so data privacy has always been among my top interests. I was always very curious about data management and how people can monetize their data. This background eventually led me to the idea of a platform where users have full control of their data versus somebody reselling it. Then we started discussing and brainstorming with our future co-founders – Patrick Tague, Emmanuel Owusu and Vasily Trofimchuck, and after a few brainstorm meetings we started working on several prototypes.  We all had different backgrounds – corporate, academic, startup and decent experience in different industries, including cybersecurity, blockchain, marketing, business development, which is really helpful. Our team is truly international – some of the co-founders are based in the US, some in Singapore, and we also have people in Russia.

We had participants from all over the world — a whopping 13821 transactions from 137 countries! While this is a very exciting statistic, it made our KYC procedure more challenging. The team has worked tirelessly through the KYC process and we are able to verify above 98% of our participants. We still need your help to get to 100%. Please make sure you complete the forms to pass the KYC process successfully. You’ll receive a confirmation email and see a green notification on your dashboard after successfully completing the KYC process. If you are not sure about your status, please contact our support team.  Meanwhile, our MatchICO product already has 4803 token holders with more than 35K transactions. We are excited to see so much interest in our product and cannot wait to complete KYC and unlock the tokens for general usage.  With token sale completion within seconds and good progress on KYC, we are way ahead of our schedule. Just recall, our original plan was 4 weeks for token sale and 4 weeks for  KYC. We are beating this schedule by almost a month.  While we are eager to release our tokens as soon as possible, we will begin the token distribution on January 1, 2018 to ensure that all legal requirements are met and ensure a smooth process for all the participants.  We’d like to thank all the contributors again for their participation. We are looking forward to seeing all of you guys using the system in 2018. Happy holidays!",False

Help us spread the word and be rewarded!  Recently we announced that BitClave hit a new high by raising over $22M out of $25.5M hard cap in the token pre-sale. This success would be absolutely impossible without our community. More than 64,000 users have already signed up for the token sale!  We are extremely grateful for the support coming out of our growing community. We receive a lot of good feedback from our users, who help us from fixing the typos and finding security issues on our website, to promoting our product through news media and YouTube channels! We hope to see even more increased collaboration with the community, and we do believe that any valuable contribution should be rewarded. This is how we’ve come up with the idea of the Proof-Of-Fan (POF) model to help our loyal fans get the the whitelist bonuses.  Participants on the whitelist receive priority queuing during the crowdsale event and are also eligible for individual bonuses. Since we are already oversubscribed for the crowdfunding, we have to close our whitelist on Nov 22 and cancel bonuses for the non-whitelisted members. However, if you are our real fan who believes in the project, and you missed the whitelist deadline but you are very interested in participation, we still can accommodate you.  After Nov 22 you can get subscribed to the whitelist by the Proof-Of-Fan model. Here is how it works: before submitting your whitelist registration, you have to make and publish a video/podcast, an article or a blog post promoting BitClave and send us the link for manual evaluation via the chat on www.bitclave.com. Feel free to publish this on your blog or any social media channels and networks you have access to, including Reddit, Steemit, Facebook, YouTube, Telegram groups, etc. Just share your opinion about BitClave and the problem we are solving.  https://medium.com/bitclave/proof-of-fan-help-us-spread-the-word-and-be-rewarded-c701e173fddb",False

If you find insights useful for you, ""thank you"" will be enough, if not, start a discussion (we have open comment on a site).  The reason of that is probably that you are related to the Bitclave.

All the ratings has explanations, if you dont agree, copy it here and oppose.  From our side, we understand, that we do responsible business. We always do a deep analysis. We checked a lot of interviews with a founders, they dont understand how google or facebook ads works, they dont understand about bet mechanism, they dont know how important is user data analysis in internet marketing industry and how costly and complicated is to develop it, they dont know that they use AI for they ads. How you can compete with them? Paying 500$ for add view? (Im serious guys, they promised to pay 500$ for ad view without action)  If you dont agree on some point in review, come here and oppose me.

Everyone from this forum can participate in the Bounty Campaign, we absolutely have no intention to buy/steal or otherwise relate to users’ accounts. However if you’ve got any proofs of account ownership you’re claiming please kindly provide it so we we could take it off from the campaign.  The user name “Tyska” is my own since the beginning. According to the Forum’s Rules it’s not prohibited to post in any threads on any languages… Our CEO Alex Bessonov is extremely busy with this project and isn’t able to monitor every post on this Forum. But you could be in touch with him by using a chat window on our genuine website.  Just a few more points on platform’ tech aspect. We don’t compete with Google in full as we don’t index the sites. We’re building product & services search engine. BitClave is playing two roles.  Role#1 is to build a platform that can be used to build 3rd party service and role#2 is to build the services. You can read more on a high level here https://medium.com/@BitClave/search-engines-in-the-era-of-blockchain-be29d6cb582. IPFS, FileCoin, Storj are technologies for storing the raw data, these are not the indexes. The raw data will be anonymized and open to all to build their 3rd party services - this is to attract more players and to make the BASE ecosystem better.  The BASE DB is used to provide BitClave’s services for search and ranking - this is where BitClave is playing it’s 2nd role. At this stage, we do not plan to give 3rd party access to the indexes, but we are considering to give API to 3rd party to use the search results.  Off-chain distributed storage is required because on-chain storage is much more expensive, so this is cost reduction technique we are considering.  Search results are given to REQUEST contract (which is on blockchain) and then REQEST contract can further communicate with OFFER contract to finalize the deal. The role of search engine is to provide potential matches and the final decision is done by the contracts themselves.  Search Engine can be compared in its role to a realtor in real estate business - it tries to match buyer and seller but the final decision is by buyer and seller. And you can have many of these search engines.  All providing “potential matches”. The REQUEST contract is going to receive a pointer to “recommended” OFFER and then REQUEST can directly verify if he “likes” the OFFER. The “recommendation” will come from multiple search engines, but neither REQUEST nor OFFER trust the recommendation so they are going to verify each other directly. You can provide your own search engine. You have access to all the information. This is important design point for BASE, we want to ENABLE 3rd party services, so all relevant information is stored in open storage.",False

I really like the idea, but Google perfected its search engine algorithms over decades. Quote from: orpel on October 22, 2017, 06:53:25 PM Hi, What are you going to be your first steps in order to acquire some market value? We will not compete with Google in the search for sites. Only in the field of advertising. As part of the initial ecosystem bootstrapping, we have already introduced 15-20 small companies for the initial instance of the BASE market. Our team will continue to target industries where significant effort is put into marketing to individual customers, such as auto sales, real estate, hotels, and retailers like Target that compete with major ad service providers. Once our small market is established, we will increase our marketing efforts to continually expand the number of players involved.

Any posts made by my account C3ALL, in this thread have not been made by me.  They have been made by a scammer that then appears to have sold it on to another scammer/farmer.  The signature that is now attached to my account is almost identical to dozens of others that are posting in this thread.  The scammers are even having ""conversations"" with themselves to try and pump this stuff up. Avoid.  Like the plague. Feel free to check the posts made by ""C3ALL"" here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=189431;sa=showPosts As you can see, I left crypto back in 2014 and didnt post again.  That is until October this year when my account suddenly started posting again.  It appears I lost my ability to write coherently in English too. Then later in October, for whatever reason, I started posting in Romanian...   My advice, avoid this project, and avoid anything posted since 2014 by my original account C3ALL. If someone uses your profile to earn stakes in the bounty program, we have nothing to do with this. Why are you accusing us of this?

In fact looking at the post history of your account seems to suggest that too has been hacked/stolen/sold.  If the people behind this project had faith in it, they would post under their own accounts and not feel the need to try and artificially create trust by buying/stealing established accounts.   If I have a business idea I want to pitch, I pitch it myself, I don't go to the bank dressed up as Richard Branson and try to convince them they are dealing with somebody they aren't.  The only people who will make money from this project are the few who want to encourage the many to part with a small amount.  They know full well that the many will just write off their investment, its just like unsecured crowdfunding on a different platform.  Stolen profiles, the irony of ""bounty"" rewards being paid to identity thieves and all this behaviour circling a project that expects legitimate business to part with significant cash for access to data and pay for advertising, and you want private investors to pony up double what the EIB invested in Qwant.  OK, Good luck with that.  Just to note, in case you missed the bleeding obvious, the whole advertising model works for Google because of the data received from searches.  They can then sell companies very specific targeted data for their adverts.  That's why companies pay to advertise through google, so they can make sure their adverts are seen by people who are actually interested in their category of product.  Without competing on the search side, you are just selling blind advertising space.  What you are doing is recreating the yellow pages.  Im all for entrepreneurial activity, but to wake up one morning and decide you want to take on Googles advertising stronghold, with zero users and zero data input from millions of customers searches, and ask the general public to stick their hand in their pocket for $50m, is just daft.",False

Also, a lot of advertising is done in closed platforms like Facebook, Amazon (amazon pay per click), Instagram, etc. How is the coin (Bitclave) is going to get to these people?

The BitClave community Slack channel is not alone in being plagued by malicious users who are trying to trick users into sending them Ether and Bitcoin, fraudulently claiming that they will receive CAT in return.  Recently, an imposter website has begun advertising through Google with the address www.bitdave.com - the lowercase ‘D’ looks like ‘cl’ so the address appears to be official website.. We are working with registrars and lawyers to shut them down, but until that happens please make sure to be diligent about confirming you enter the correct URL when attempting to use our wallet. Our website is www.bitclave.com. One way to ensure you always access the correct website is to follow this link and bookmark it, then use your bookmark to navigate to our site.
