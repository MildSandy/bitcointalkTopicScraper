We had a nice round of after-work drinks on Friday the 17th, with cold drinks, snacks and music. We even had an impromptu talent show from our visitors, which was a blast! It seems everyone in our office has some special unexpected hidden talents!  Primalbase London   In London, May brought us sunshine (finally!) so winter has finally gone (there’s a Game of Thrones reference in there too). Despite the warm weather, we had some big crowds in the offices for evening meetups and events. We kicked things off with a Waves meetup, during which a number of different projects working with the Waves platform gave us the lowdown on what they’ve been up to. The event showcased everything from blockchain-powered games and coworking spaces (THAT’S US), to blockchain-enabled cars.  Primalbase NY   With the Summer weather rolling into the city, we are counting down the weeks until we open our NYC office. Hannah, Simone and the team have all been working hard to get everything ready for the official opening at the end of Q2.

Buterin was not an official adviser to the project.  Quote from: Primal Base on June 14, 2017, 08:51:02 PM   Vitalik Buterin an advisor.  An advisor is just that, an advisor.  There are many advisors on many projects.  To what extent they are working with a team can vary from small to large.  We do not speak for any of our advisors.  If you want to know the extent of their involvement you can ask them.  If they are comfortable with telling you they will.  If they are not they won't.  Primalbase decided to cheat a little in this regard.  What do you need to succeed?)  Joint photo with Vitalik + contact via email)    Quote Vitalik was not initially endowed with any technical tasks, there was no role here in creating a formula, a model, a technical implementation of any kind because we utilize fairly simple, already known tools. His role was that of the leader of one of the world’s largest communities in the area of Blockchain. He liked and likes our project, it makes sense for him — an interesting interpretation of how Blockchain can move into the real world. It will be very interesting to see.

I even ""lock"" my tokens by crossing them to the ETH gateway. I understand that land and building business need years to cultivate.   I don't understand.

That would be your response? Really? Very well, let's begin.      I would believe the difficulty you experience to understand my point come from your decision to read the post as sentence per sentence instead of wholly, or the decision to not utilizing a correlation between separate sentences, or perhaps your decision to deliberately failing to understand the obvious. It is really a shocking and discouraging found that someone who work as a community manager, who clearly required to be able to... well, communicating and interacting with the community, failed to conduct such an essential action.  Nevertheless, you'll find that the meaning between the two sentences easy to understand, and although (if I may put myself in your shoes) seems contradictory but actually completely related and supportive to the earlier part. The sentence that gave correlation between the second to the first paragraph that you refer to, located on the first sentence of the later paragraph. Allow me to quote  Quote from: holydarkness on September 18, 2018, 11:38:14 AM What I don't like is, or rather are, your company decision to keep delaying an exchange that has a potent to bring more awareness of the token.  If you still failed to see, allow me to restructure the sentence. ""What I don't like is your company decision to not considering an exchange, whereas an exchange has a potent to bring more awareness to the token."" Now, read the former and the later paragraph together, and I really hope you can translates those two paragraph as follows,  ""I believe in your project, but I rather not fond of your decision to continue on delaying one key feature, namely an exchange. Because......."" then the whole sentence of the second paragraph literally describing my opinion regarding it, in reflect to your previous replies of your company sight about exchanges.  Did you manage to get the whole explanation? Honestly, it's not that difficult to understand. Of course, practice makes perfect. Maybe you just need a lot of practices so you can understand people's thought. Start from trying to read to understand instead to merely answer. I know you can, don't give up.     ""If you failed to see how this decision to keep ignoring demands for exchange could affect your progress, allow me to point out one factor, namely community's support. Some with high visionary and firm belief and strong investing knowledge (the name goes on) would stay, true, but some will also eventually lost faith if you failed to show good progress.""  Look at the blockchain space right now. Many many projects are out of money or have run out of money because they burned it all trying to hype up their coins and get them on exchanges so the prices would pump during bull market. Not only did those coin prices come crashing WAY down during this bear market, but it's brought a mistrust and bad reputation to the market as a whole.   And only several project survives, which, I personally believe, are the strong projects with strong communities. I have some projects for reference, whose price ""plummeted"" to nearly one sixth of their initial price, or even one tenth, yet they still have manage to keep their community believe on their project, and when the market gets bullish, I believe these projects will also improves. It shows that they're really qualified to be called a strong project, a serious ones... or... are you implying that you yourself didn't trust your project's strength? That you afraid, when PrimalBase hit exchange on current situation, instead of striving due to the plenty of tangible products to deliver, they will be utterly destroyed?  Well, of course people are entitled to their own opinion, but I myself believe if PrimalBase play their cards right and manage to keep their solid community, they'll survive lots of bearish (mind that this very chat indicates otherwise, though. And I would say that the very reason why this dialogue happen is due to the very poor community support). Besides, refusing to enter the market because of the bear and then claiming that your price is strong and high when the bull appear would be like saying that you are very talented that you can call the rain at your will while the sky itself is already dark and heavy. I hope you manage to understand the analogy, but if you once again failed, allow me to clear them: it means, what will happen is not due to your power or capability, it happen because your surroundings already support the outcome.    ""but you might forgot that you're standing on crypto, on a field that's basically cheerish trading and speculations.

Primalbase is actually trying to build a real project that can last years......so no.....it was not a 'mistake'  What? No, it was not a serious question. It's a rhetorical question, or sarcasm if you may. Jesus, now I began to really question what they write on the job specification for a community manager. May I know? And yes, this time it is a serious question.  Meanwhile, let's continue on forward with the rest of the sentence. Yes, I am honestly believe in the spirit of open blockchains, problems it solves, etc. Do you? (hint: it's rhetorical again). Because from where I stand, I didn't see they harness the very power of the decentralization itself. PrimalBase is trying to build a real project that can last years... with its base, or half of its base, on cryptoworld, yet they somehow decide to not fully embrace the cryptoworld. They focused on delivering products, constructing and building workspaces while hiring a snarky community manager to maintain their community. And let's see our current position, our current price against ICO price, in regards to the whole cryptomarket fluctuation, and in reference to your buildings achievement.  After the initial freefall, when the market rises, your price rather stays, when the market fall down, you stay, when you announce buildings, guess what? Yep, your price also stay at relatively same position. I would argue that this is because you are lack of exchange, or lack of access for the community to utilize your project as one of the trading assets. How is this is an embrace of the power of blockchain? (Hint 2: again, this is a rhetorical).  You've tried your way and it didn't show significant improvement, why don't you try the community's suggestion of adding new exchanges to boost visibility, accessibility, and liquidity?  And if you failed to understand how the two sentence above this one is correlated to my statement that I believe on your project as a long term, it spelled as: I believe that your project will bring bright future, that's why I will not sell my token in a very long term until I see that your price is right, but an exchange will help gain interests and enthusiasm from cryptoworld so your price won't looks like a stagnant.  How about you informing your board of directors about this, and while they contemplating on it, either they hire a new community manager that is more capable of attending to inquiries on this media in a more polite ways than yours, or you learn on how to regards your investors. I held a firm believe that, of course, your company culture dictate that you didn't discriminate small investors from big investors? Oh... yes darling, this one can be answered, it is rather a sarcasm, but confirming this will set several understandment on how to navigate through your company's medias.",False

For thosw who are interested to know how these... (im)professional banter happened on the first place, kindly scroll.      My sincerest apology, I am well used with people, both in digital and direct world, that understand sarcasm solely on the whole context of the sentences without the need of emoji. I read somewhere that people who can understand sarcasm are they who are bright on their mind. Emoji themselves usually translated as a hint of non-professionalism in business world. Despite the inability to stay away on sarcasm when the situation pushes me to, I surely tried to stay as away as possible from emojis when I tried to discuss something with an entity that I see as a professional or business body. Well, if you suggested emoji for such situation that we have, may I perceive that . . . . . . . hmm... interesting.    You want politeness? Perhaps you could read your last message to me and decide for yourself whether you are being polite yourself? How polite do you think you are being on a scale from 0-10?   I decide myself? Well, then it'll be at 8, 6 at the lowest. Kindly read again, the whole post was rather delivered in a civil manner at most of the post body, with probably an exception to the closing paragraph, which rather dilluted with opinion --as warned-- but composed based on an observation on how the community manager of this project interact with their members. Don't you agree? Because, I think several people here are on the same page with me. I became less polite when the answer you gave was rather rude, defensive, and seems to be taken personally..  One would perceive such sentence as an input to improve themselves, while others, it seems, and how unfortunate that it should happen on a ""room"" which aimed to host business spaces.  So, forgive me as I really hard to point out to myself which sentence of my second previous post that can be seen as impolite. Kindly point it out to me? There's a feature on this forum to highlight a sentence, or change the font color, it'll help. Of course, I expect the community manager to know the difference between an impolite input and a mere statement-based opinion?     My apologies if you aren't finding the yes man that agrees with your point of view.   Do I specifically ask you to be a yes man and agree with the post? To try to enlist the second you read my post? I have no intention to it. Again, kindly point out which sentence lead to such opinion.  I expect an open discussion, a healthy debate, and anything along the line, before you (it seems to me) derail everything with defensive-offensive replies instead of explaining why you haven't try any exchange, when will you try them, at which milestones, etc.   Q: ""You've tried your way and it didn't show significant improvement, why don't you try the community's suggestion of adding new exchanges to boost visibility, accessibility, and liquidity?""    A: Didn't show significant improvement in what? Getting people to buy and trade more of the token to increase the price of the token? I think it's clear by now that Primalbase doesn't care about the price of the token in the short term. They are focused on building features and eventually getting adoption with those features. They are choosing to spend their time working to cater to the needs of those who would use the token, not speculate over it....especially when they are still working to get their first 5 offices up and leasing feature.   Exactly, improvement at the token price. Usually, the token price will rise and fall at annual news, evwn for a very long term projects, much like how good news in macro and micro economic influence stock, lands, and foreign exchanges. One good example is perhaps lands, one of the investment with a good long duration, how earthquake decrease price of lands an houses on the impacted spot, or how a news of new public place (like mall, hotel, or public transportation station) drive the price of the surrounding buildings up. In your case, perhaps at the announcement of new offices. And kindly tell me, why don't those announcement significantly fluctuate price? Doesn't PrimalBase concerned, even at the very least, that their good news brings very low excitement to their community? Or are you indicating that PrimalBase doesn't care about their community enthusiasm?    Q: After the initial freefall, when the market rises, your price rather stays, when the market fall down, you stay, when you announce buildings, guess what? Yep, your price also stay at relatively same position. I would argue that this is because you are lack of exchange, or lack of access for the community to utilize your project as one of the trading assets. How is this is an embrace of the power of blockchain? (Hint 2: again, this is a rhetorical).  A: I'm not disagreeing with you. I agree that getting more liquidity to the token and doing marketing could possibly drive up prices. The point here is that the company is not focused on that and don't really care much if the price is pumping up or down.  So what is the point to continuously bring it up? If you want to interpret that to mean the company doesn't care about small investors, that's your prerogative. They are not designing this for crypto traders. It would be fun if they were (for me as well), but they aren't. So that's that.   (In regard to the bolded sentence) because you failed to explain to the community, at which point shall you take step to get an exchange. They are wanting that, expecting that, and from your old explanation (IIRC, the community manager before you, the one which more open and polite) they will do that once they have a tangible product or a demand, as I said, I failed to recall correctly. And at this point, where you have more than one building, I believe some people are entitled to ask if your category of tangible products (in this matter, buildings and office spaces) or a demand is already reached?  if you answer that your category of spaces are not yet achieved, despite the number of buildings you already have, then the next question will be at which milestone? How many buildings do you aim to own before you declare you have tangible products?  If you answer that your demand is not yet reached, thus no effort for an exchangeI yet, I would question why, despite the numerous buildings you have, you still have a very low demands?",False

It's rather discouraging to see that you choose to ignore a comments that sounds their concern about your attention to customer's wishes and input.  In regards to the post, may I also highlight that months ago, you said that exchange will come after you have a demand or tangible products or something like that, I failed to recall correctly. I failed even more to see what ""preliminary"" achievement you need to finally decide that you have enough ""foundation"" and decide it's time to enliat and be more visible to users worldwide.  Before you got any idea that I was a mere pump-rider or anything around that kind of species, allow me to inform you that you may rest assured, I have a firm belief of your company's future, and I have no intention to sell at all. I even ""lock"" my tokens by crossing them to the ETH gateway. I understand that land and building business need years to cultivate.  What I don't like is, or rather are, your company decision to keep delaying an exchange that has a potent to bring more awareness of the token. You may argue that this project is more focused on ""something real"" or a ""long-term utilities"" and you couldn't care less about exchange and their speculation-enabling-feature, but you might forgot that you're standing on crypto, on a field that's basically cheerish trading and speculations. If your company doesn't care about such and prefer to have your focus undisturbed on establishing tangible product, then I should ask your initial decision to reach crypto. Was it a mistake due to a poor decision? Why don't you reverse the roadmap to make it more suitable to your concept? Namely building offices and reputation for years, establishing yourself, and only after you're well known, you reach crypto. It will surely safe you a lot of time answering demands about details and exchange and price.  If you failed to see how this decision to keep ignoring demands for exchange could affect your progress, allow me to point out one factor, namely community's support. Some with high visionary and firm belief and strong investing knowledge (the name goes on) would stay, true, but some will also eventually lost faith if you failed to show good progress. And this leads me to my second dismayal, namely bad response. Either a bad company culture or a community manager with bad attitude, depends on who in charge of answering posts.  Before you pass judgment, I'll humbly ask you to review back few pages to see that I have never clashed way with you, so I'm confident when I said that this is nothing personal, it's not more than a simple observation, that your responses to criticism, be it possitive or negative, are mostly cam hardly be seen as warm or... diplomatic, if you prefer a more official term. A ""how is not doable?"" from someone who represent business space rental that operates worldwide is certainly least to be expected, and certainly discourage people from interacting well by dissuading them from saying what they want to say.",False

Lots of tokens failed to get listed because they can't comply to this rule. The reason itself is quite understandable, usually a newly listed token will gain a sudden interest that pumped the price a little. It'll be unfair if the member of the community have a prior knowledge of the enlisting and they prepare themselves by stocking up few days before the listing.  I hope this helps you understand why pbt can not share details and always close mouth to a question about exchange",False

If a request is not submitted in advance, the regular opening hours apply. This will probably change in the future.",False

Primalbase is a serious project working to fulfill their original vision to investors.  Have there been hiccups along the way?  You bet!  But let's keep things positive.  Primalbase managed to open 2 of their first 5 offices in 2017.  Much more to come this year.  They are working hard on a technical solution.  Please keep in mind that thus far nobody else developed a prototype for leasing commercial space on blockchain, so it's really quite an effort!  Also, while Ethereum currently has a larger market cap than waves, let's look at the big picture.  Waves is a promising platform for the future!  It's already scaled to over 100 tx/s while Ethereum can only handle up to 13 tx/s.  It's just a matter of time before the space expands and more platforms are used.    Take exchanges for example.  A few months ago everyone wanted to get listed on Polo because such a large percentage of volume came from there.  Now, Polo is considered a joke in many circles and there is so much demand for trading that many exchanges actually had to shut down because they were getting too many user registrations.  Primalbase is going to slay it!  They are a first mover and have a big headstart in what they are doing.  HODL!  ",False

This is the most idiotic cryptocurrency in this universe.  They collected 50 million USD worth of BTC for handing out 1000 free memberships to people of whom 90% will probably never ever need a coworking space at the locations they are base.  What use to have a membership of a coworking space that is not around the corner???  What they should have done is give the people who own PBT a share of the revenue. But no, THEY GET TO KEEP ALL THE REVENUE generated over 50 million worth of USD.  People who pump this coin are trying to drag you into this scheme. The fundamentals for creating token value in this project are completely rediculous.  Who is going to pay 10.000 USD for renting an office? So ok... you can rent out your token... How much you think you can get for that? Maybe 100 euro per month, maybe even 300 euro... but you will be competing with other token holders as well as Primalbase itself, who will probably just put on offers in USD.  CoWorking Spaces without having to take any loans or mortgages... These guys are brilliant. They can just hire some management teams for the spaces and sit on the beach collecting all the income. The margins will be gigantic because the biggest cost (mortgage and loans) are missing in this business model.   Ps. they talk about the total CoWorkingspace market and getting your share of it.... This would be true if you would share in the revenue... but no, you just get a (shareable) membership, nothing more nothing less.",False

From the very beginning we underlined that we will use those 250 tokens to support the development of the Blockchain technology and the growth of its community.  And just to remind you the idea behind it, we would recommend to refresh this answer in your memory that we have already given in one of our Q&As:  Please see:  3. “Why do you need to keep 250 (20% or 1/5th) Primalbase tokens?” We can create an excellent infrastructure, excellent workspaces, with very comfortable furniture, great kitchen and stuff. But the infrastructure is dead without people. It doesn’t really work without people, it is a multiplier. WeWork now is referred to as an IT project because they are focusing on the IT community, it is a significant revenue multiplier. It is not a real estate project only. To start working with the community we need to add value. We are aspiring to make Primalbase both a home and Research and Development Laboratory for Blockchain projects. We will give away a part of our tokens (250 PBT) to those who we see as being active Primalbase Ambassadors, to equip them with a freedom to use a service all around the world. I am now referring to technology gurus Vitalik Buterin, Sasha Ivanov, and others who are recognized global leaders. I am also referring here to guys from Bitcoin community, Ethereum Foundation community, Waves community — those who truly believe that Blockchain has a potential to provide solutions to a range of problems. One has to understand that Blockchain technology is about developers and researchers. If we are talking about Blockchain business, it is hard, almost impossible, to move forward if you don’t have developers. If you only have marketing tools, it isn’t enough, you have to have a technology — interesting, promising, the one which has a range of real-life applications. Any research and development projects deserve attention. We would like to support talented developers from Bitcoin, Ethereum Core, Waves camps. We would like to give these teams an opportunity to get an instant access to infrastructure and community. What is Blockchain? It is a huge community. It allows people to make a connection, to understand each other. Decentralized infrastructure can help boost decentralized technologies. At the moment the industry is mostly occupied by online projects. We hope that Primalbase will change it by providing blockchain developers with physical platform for working on their projects. They will be communicating not only online, but also offline, which will surely contribute to further development of technology. Quite recently we have launched the Blockchain Institute, we find it very important for Blockchain developers to have their own infrastructure. It will bring benefits to those who purchase membership, and to those who will be provided our tokens as a contribution to development of their projects. It doesn’t mean, however, that our team will be trading tokens on exchanges seeking to make profit, absolutely not. Tokens will be rented out for a certain period of time to prominent Blockchain tech ambassadors.  Best Regards,  Alexander, Community Moderator.",False

Well, the tokens are still not directly related. Only because some coins increase in value doesn't mean the PBT token will increase in the same moment.

There are too many tokens available. (Investors will fight for tenants -> it will dilute the price) Quote There are 50 desks available in Amsterdam ofice for PBT holders, and similar amounts will be created in other offices as they open. Quote There is no private office for 4PBT+ holders in Amsterdam?  A: Token holders with 4 or more PBT are eligible to a private office, based on availability.  At this point, there are no more private offices available in Amsterdam. At the end of this year we will release a booking platform for the private offices. Through this platform it’s possible to check the availability and rent a private office.  2. Lack of transparency (I  can understand that they want to keep their financial information private, but for a crowdfunded project I don't think this is the best approach) Quote without the express permission of our initial private investor(s), we won’t be revealing their identities in this forum  Quote Q: Why didn’t you publish financial reports?  A: This is difficult to answer without sounding defensive or elusive; but to be blunt, Primalbase is a privately held company. Privately held companies are not required to publish their accounts and it’s not common practice for them to do so. Even if they did, only one full quarter of the financial year has passed since the token sale, the team is still small and still working flat-out opening offices.  No one here is trying to hide anything, either from the public or token holders, it’s just the priority is not on reporting right now, it’s on executing the whole concept of Primalbase in the very ambitious timeframe we set ourselves with a very small team.    The benefit to operating like this is that it keeps the costs very low (hence we haven’t been the best at comms to-date, with our apologies), but as we grow in geography and scope, and as we sign up more tenants in the offices to sustain the Primalbase financial model, we will have more capacity for reporting and communications.  3. Giving away tokens to influencers, In Principal a good idea, but it will also dillute price for token holders Quote 3. “Why do you need to keep 250 (20% or 1/5th) Primalbase tokens?” We can create an excellent infrastructure, excellent workspaces, with very comfortable furniture, great kitchen and stuff. But the infrastructure is dead without people. It doesn’t really work without people, it is a multiplier.

Tokens will be rented out for a certain period of time to prominent Blockchain tech ambassadors.   4. Q: Do you feel any responsibility of the huge decreasing of price?  A: No. We are doing everything we can to deliver Primalbase as promised in the token sale.  At the moment my conclusion is, I must admit it, it was a big mistake to invest into this ICO. Yesterday, I acted accordingly to it and sold my tokens with a big loss, but better late than never. IMO this project is only interesting for startups that want to set up an office with Primalbase and use their blockchain network. We as investors made this project possible, but let's face it, we are not needed anymore for the success of the project. If Primalbase token would be too expensive it would be contrary to the success of the project, as prices have to be competitive to WeWork and other established competitors. It came to my mind that Waves could be the secret investor and it would absolutely serve their objectives. Keep in mind I only have the best interest to my fellow investors and I don't want to spread any FUD, I just wanted to share my analysis. I m looking forward to a fair discussion.",False

The business failing or even if they open all the offices as advertised is pretty much irrelevant, these tokens are advertised as a profit vehicle, if that expectation isn't reasonably met then then it's fraud and an illegal security.  The value of raised BTC now 7 million dollars, market cap now 2.4 million dollars.  1 month after opening, zero marketing and google still showing the wrong address. If they continue down this path of non engagement, the class action lawsuits will start happening soon. I see a few lawyers are soliciting work against fraudulent ICOs, then possibly it will come to the SECs attention, lots of evidence of mis selling online. They have provided no liquidity to the market as advertised.  They have the funds, so should offer refunds now, other fraudulent ICOs have started doing this.  They seem to think they are immune to prosecution, they're not. There are already several precedents. Opening an office in New York? Wouldn't be advisable for any of the promoters of this to visit the US ever again. A few million is not that much in the grand scale of things, hope it was worth risking jail, fines and reputational destruction for all involved.  Sasha Ivanov marketed this heavily and then disappeared and hasn't mentioned it since once he had the cash. This is his project, the others are just his puppets and employees, but US law extends to the promoters of scams, given Sasha Ivanov's high profile, he will make the perfect poster child for an SEC prosecution, and I am sure they will start looking into his other activities.",False

More important was the August 1 update which was very impressive.  While it would be interesting to see it on exchanges now - I'm happy for price discovery to happen after there is a more tangible product.  Demand is being generated - and will continue to be generated - as we get closer to listing on exchanges.  This is good for investors who weren't looking to instantly cash out into other cryptos.  For those looking to do a quick 'ico flip' the frustration is understandable.  Your options are either to wait as your tokens appreciate in value or to sell on the Waves dex.  My advice - unless you need the money immediately - is to wait.  This project is under the radar - if the team can deliver this would be a huge success story, an amazing use-case of tokenized rental ownership.

That is incorrect imo. If you raise millions of dollars it makes sense to get on an exchange with decent volume to ensure there is easy market access to your token. Failure to do so has cost their investors millions of dollars.  If they'd been upfront and said we don't understand the crypto market very well and are only planning on being listed on Waves for the first few months, they would have raised <$2 million imo.  They will struggle to raise money in future on this precedent as without wide post ICO market access to a high value token significant value loss for investors is almost inevitable.    I'm actually someone who benefits from this as I often buy tokens that are only listed on small exchanges, for much cheaper than ICO, without having to take the risk it's a complete scam and a few months further into development.  I still feel sorry for the ICO participants that lose money because start-ups don't value their investment &/or understand the importance of wide market access to their tokens to maintain ICO value.

(Eg. REP, MAID, DGD, EOS and on and on...)  Besides increasing in value if you are meeting your development goals you will also increase market and brand awareness, which is especially valuable if crypto-users are a potential demographic you wish to target.  While there has been a downturn in the market since you completed your ICO, it was rapidly sold out, indicating potential further demand. You have since demonstrated that you are not a scam, (which is always a risk ICO investors take) You have also demonstrated you are building the business advertised, meeting your targets & have just released very positive update. Had you been traded on a higher volume exchange, I'm confident PBT would reflect the value you have since added but instead you are valued at a fraction of your ICO. This is a direct result imo of the incorrect views you hold above.  Don't you agree that PBT is more valuable today than at ICO stage and should be valued as such?  The people that are hurt by your incorrect views are your ICO investors who took far higher risks, paid a much higher price and lost significant time value compared to people like myself simply because you don't understand this concept. As I said had you advertised your views on this matter more clearly you would have raised significantly less and may struggle to raise in future. (Because Investors would know they could pick up the project for much less risk, at a much lower price, further along in development closer to actual product release rather than participating in your ICO.)",False

In London, where PBT should have a location soon, I know you can easily pay >$5000 a year for an individual shared workspace and a fortune for office access.  So at this price you could be looking at a lease value/yield of up to 100% per annum in a location where the average yield is <3.5%. (So even at 10x the price this could still be very attractive. In addition tokens will also be bought and burned with a portion of operational profits.)    (I think the most expensive location will have to be 1 PBT and other locations priced relative to that to avoid the 1 PBT cost being over-priced in cheaper areas like Amsterdam but I've already explained that in a separate post and I hope the team are considering it.)

The price can increases up to 20x in one night then dropped down to half of the base rate in a blink (well, that's the case of pump and dump). A more realistic example of how nothing is impossible in crypto is what happened to DOGE. Their amount was hovering on 40++ last year, dropped to 20++ (more like what happened to PBT right now where their price went a little bit down for a while) then rocketing to 100++ and stay right there for a while before gradually settling at 70-80++. So, if we took their graph, we can see that the price now is almost 2x their usual amount, with a little drama in between.  And this not only doge, you can see the same case happened on dash and other coins too.  My point is, the safest way is to believe and rest your trust on your own feeling, because whether you got some profit or loss, the only one that'll enjoy or suffer from it is you, not the adviser or whoever else. But, if you ask my opinion, I'll say that a price increments is very likely, with a limited amount and a feature which connecting to real world business, it is very easy to attract strong business entity to invest and support this coin.",False

I've been in Waves since the beginning and PBT since the start as well. I've watched how it's performed on the Dex since the day it was listed. I'm very aware of the relatively light volume on the Dex for PBT right now. It is what it is. It gives those with a pressing need to exit a way to do so. I have confidence that more exchanges will be added and that the team will release further plans and information that will increase the perceived sense of value of PBT.

You have said it is a question for Sylon to be made on the bounty thread. However, Sylon posted last week that he had sent all distribution information to the Primal Base team and the impression seemed to be that distribution would begin on Monday of this week. It appears no bounty distribution occurred on Monday. Which is fine. I think the topic is of general interest and should be addressed here in the main thread. Since the team is in possession of the information to distribute the bounty, could you check and see when it is expected to be distributed. I assume no earlier than next Monday. Once that information is known, it would be good for you to post it both here and in the bounty thread so there is general awareness of what the plan is. Thanks!",False

However as stated the lease value of each PBT location will be relative to the cost of competing shared workspace options in the same area. So price fixing at 1 PBT for all locations is a sub-optimal strategy regardless of other variables and factors.  This will also manifest itself in voting, with PBT holders voting for the most expensive locations as opposed to the best locations. (Doubly so because you haven't given PBT clear profit exposure to the rest of the growth of the business, so costs/expenses & profitability of locations will be irrelevant to them -  only the annual lease value of their PBT.) On the other side of the coin, you don't have enough equity in PBT yourselves to be committed to maintaining its benefits & increasing its value long term.  So in addition to suggesting that locations are relatively priced with the most expensive being 1 PBT. I would also suggest a clear revenue/profit % buy back scheme where the bought PBT are for your use but locked till 2025. This clarity will give PBT holders an interest in the success of the underlying business model & promoting/suggesting your traditional office revenue streams & keeping that in mind when voting on locations. While the PBT tokens you purchase, locked till 2025, will give you enough equity and therefore incentive to maintain and grow the value proposition of PBT till at least 2025...  (I have PBT already btw & think it will grow significantly but will then largely be capped relative to lease value unless it has clear exposure to the growth of the business.)",False

First, this is a discussion that belongs in the bounty thread if it is to had at all. Second, the bounty structure has been known and published since before the ICO. Why all of a sudden is it an issue now? From what I saw, the team was very stringent in its demand that translations be original and not be done via Google translate. Translations are an important part of any ICO, and I don't think what the team offered was outrageous by any means. It may have been a little on the generous side, but it was clearly what they thought would be necessary to achieve the translations they desired. This fellow simply seems jealous that some people were able to perform the required tasks and receive the promised bounty. It feels very petty to raise this issue at this point in the process. I think the project should be judged on the whole scale and scope of what it has planned and what it has accomplished thus far. Which is a lot.  I hope this thread can return to more such fruitful discussions. Go to the bounty thread if you feel you absolutely must continue bemoaning perceived injustices in the translation bounty structure.  (For the record, I did not participate in the translation bounty even though I am fluent in Spanish and could have completed the Spanish translation had I been able to claim it in time. But I am an investor who purchased more than 1 PBT. It bothers me not in the least to think that someone received a generous amount (though certainly a fraction) of a PBT for performing a translation task that I may have found relatively easy to accomplish. I think being bothered about that says much more about the person being bothered than it does about the fairness of the bounty structure itself.)",False

Why participate in ICO at all if you can buy the coins literally only minutes after ICO end?  Every real successful ICO in which ICO investors gained profit was not a ""get your tokens immediately"" ICO: Instead the team should take its time, release some kick-ass news within the month until exchange trading and give ICO participants real value for their investments.  Look at Decent: ICO investors waited vor 8 months for coin distributions. Sure, the usual bounty participants are annoying af, but the rest is completely okay with that because they know that they will get a good product.

On the other hand, this technology significantly streamlines and simplifies the lease relations. It makes leasing an attractive investment into a life-lasting product. Blockchain technology transfers lease relations in a rather interesting space in this sense — you can lease your membership making profit or sell it at any point. Blockchain technology is not useless here, it fits naturally in this kind of model. Besides, crowdfunding on blockchain is an efficient way to attract investments into one’s project. The Blockchain is not useless here, it is very logically built into the lease relations.  We see it as following (and that's what we offer to the investors): The only way for you to start using coworking space is to have a token. As number of locations open up and more people know about it - the value increases. On top of that we need to cover our operational expenses by renting out offices, which means advertising and sales, which means people find out about primalbase, which means that people who are asked if they can just get an access to coworking, not a whole office are sent to buy PBT because that is the only way for them to get it. There is a lot of marketing efforts that will be done on our side for operations by product of which becomes a marketing for PBT thus creating more value for investors. Either via new customers buying the token outright creating buying pressure or leasing the token for the period they need, generating dividends. Profits are not distributed to token holders, this is not an equity. It's really simple supply and demand, with capped supply and ever growing demand for the service due to location expansion (those who knew about it) and product discovery mechanisms (those who didn't know before).",False

And it's not through yet. I suspect there will be a last minute rush to get in at the discounted rate in the final hours and minutes. It just so happens that today happened to be one of the more ""bloodier"" days in recent memory for many coins with values crashing all around. That's a challenging environment in which to debut an ICO. Still, Primal Base performed like a champ amid much carnage and uncertainty in the broader market.  I know many wondered if it might sell out in the opening minutes or hour. Maybe under better conditions it would have. Still, it's done wonderfully well. I actually think it might be a good thing for both the project and investors if there ends up being a mix of backers who have entered at the different pricing tiers. It makes the early investor discount more meaningful. And having a small group of investors who enter at the higher price levels gives the project a bit more financing and the token an even stronger overall perceived sense of value and worth at the conclusion of the ICO.  I suspect with what's been raised thus far, the project is already in a very strong position to execute on its plan. I agree with the sentiment that it's not a race or some kind of speed pageant designed to impress the crowds at how quickly you can ""sell out."" This is a solid debut for sure. And the best is yet to be.",False

This does not say if they fail. This says for any reason. It's not FUD, it's right in their ToS. You need to do your due diligence.   Care to explain why investments are considered donations? I'd love to hear that explained to the public.  It would appear that investors are the only ones taking a risk here and primal base is taking absolutely no risk at all on their end. They do not have to pay you back if they don't even try to make a working business. They don't have to pay you back if they decide to go on an all expenses paid vacation to Las Vegas and gamble away your funds. This looks like the Mycelium Crowdsale all over again. No revenue to speak of, no working business model, no promises promise to never pay you back if anything goes wrong, (i.e. if the tokens are never distributed to begin with).  Quote from: Primal Base on June 26, 2017, 07:06:27 PM Quote from: Chris! on June 26, 2017, 06:59:36 PM I was thinking of investing into primal base just for kicks. I was going to throw in a small amount and see how it does. Then I read this in the ToS:  Quote 9 Cancellation and refund policy  9.1 By participating in the Crowdfund, you acknowledge that Primalbase is not required to provide a refund for any reason, and that you will not receive money or other compensation in lieu of a refund, and you consent to no right of withdrawal from the fund of the Crowfunding.  9.2 All donations to Primalbase are final and nonrefundable  So basically, if they decide that they don't want to go ahead with this business anymore they thank you for the donation! (Not your investment. Did you notice that too? That must have been a Freudian slip).  This is how you distinguish the entrepreneurs who fully believe in their business and the ones who don't. No thanks. I'd rather invest with an entrepreneur that will do whatever it takes to succeed, not one that if they give up they just keep the money and have no legal recourse so to speak.  The nature of an ICO is quite volatile, so there are risks, both known and unknown. Investors know this going in. It is unregulated in every sense. Having said that, Primalbase has put its core members forward, and got support from leading players in the blockchain field -- people staking their reputation. So, it wouldn't make sense to throw all of that in the trash for a quick cash grab, now would it? Primalbase is interested with expanding and nurturing the tech community, one full of like-minded people.  TL;DR: Trust us, we have a good reputation. Your team actually has no reputation at all. I've never heard of them. Advisors mean nothing because we all know every single ICO lists these top guns in the cryptocurrency space to make them look better. Their involvement in the projects themselves is basically nothing.  Oh and would it make sense to walk away with millions and have a bad reputation? Absolutely. People scam for $5 on this forum and you want me to think that for some reason these people are different with millions and millions?

Did developers calculete this? There are a couple of people who have power for such an investment.  Of course there are a couple of people who have the power to buy that much. There are even people out there that can buy one whole country but that doesn't mean they'll do it. Most ICOs don't get that much recognition until the minimum goal for crowdsale has been reached. But with the sale for the first investors, I bet there would be some investors impulse buying. Regardless, I doubt that someone's ready to make that much of an investment -- 3000 btc.",False

It offers a rather unique product - on the one hand, it is an access to co-working, on the other hand, it is a financial instrument, which can be traded on the market. There hasn’t been anything like this before. It can unite many startups within the community. Many cryptocurrency startups are getting interested in sharing Primalbase co-working spaces, soon we might see the development of a new environment for cryptocurrency businesses, that will go out of the virtual world into the real one, in particular, geographical locations, it will be interesting.”  Ivanov notes:  Quote “Integration of tokens into this model allows for greater simplicity and transparency. You can, of course, agree with a person without a token but with a token, it is easier. This is going to be the very first project which will be pushing leasing of financial instruments through Blockchain, it is a very interesting scheme.”  Ivanov thinks that the Primalbase project is going to demonstrate a fast expansion, triggering the development of a new business ecosystem and creation of a new economy.   Quote from: sasha35625 on June 10, 2017, 12:32:41 PM yes, I fully support this project, the idea of this project was born while discussing issues in the existing model of co-working industry with Dmitry.

This is your chance to invest in a tangible product developed by an all-star team matching real and crypto economies. Don’t miss it - 66% bonus for early investors. Learn more at http://primalbase.com   Interview: Vitalik Buterin on Scaling Ethereum, Its Popularity in Asia and ICOs https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/interview-vitalik-buterin-ethereum-scaling-issues-popularity-asia-and-icos/    Buterin was recently appointed as an advisor to the board of Primalbase, a startup that is aiming to tokenize a WeWork or Regus-type co-working space provider and grant micro-ownership to its investors.   “I’m definitely very interested in all these applications, particularly the semi-financial ones with some components of finance and monetary value but also some components outside of it” said Buterin. “The general idea that we can create this economy where we micro-tokenize and let people have their own micro-ownership, I think that is definitely a very interesting and promising idea.”       Sasha Ivanov, CEO of Waves in CoinTelegraph Article:  https://cointelegraph.com/news/we-are-witnessing-brilliant-example-of-crowd-intelligence-sasha-ivanov-on-icos  Quote “Primalbase is a real estate project, while it is also a Blockchain community project. It offers a rather unique product - on the one hand, it is an access to co-working, on the other hand, it is a financial instrument, which can be traded on the market. There hasn’t been anything like this before. It can unite many startups within the community. Many cryptocurrency startups are getting interested in sharing Primalbase co-working spaces, soon we might see the development of a new environment for cryptocurrency businesses, that will go out of the virtual world into the real one, in particular, geographical locations, it will be interesting.”  Ivanov notes:  Quote “Integration of tokens into this model allows for greater simplicity and transparency. You can, of course, agree with a person without a token but with a token, it is easier. This is going to be the very first project which will be pushing leasing of financial instruments through Blockchain, it is a very interesting scheme.”  Ivanov thinks that the Primalbase project is going to demonstrate a fast expansion, triggering the development of a new business ecosystem and creation of a new economy.   Quote from: sasha35625 on June 10, 2017, 12:32:41 PM yes, I fully support this project, the idea of this project was born while discussing issues in the existing model of co-working industry with Dmitry.

This is your chance to invest in a tangible product developed by an all-star team matching real and crypto economies. Don’t miss it - 66% bonus for early investors. Learn more at http://primalbase.com   Interview: Vitalik Buterin on Scaling Ethereum, Its Popularity in Asia and ICOs https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/interview-vitalik-buterin-ethereum-scaling-issues-popularity-asia-and-icos/    Buterin was recently appointed as an advisor to the board of Primalbase, a startup that is aiming to tokenize a WeWork or Regus-type co-working space provider and grant micro-ownership to its investors.   “I’m definitely very interested in all these applications, particularly the semi-financial ones with some components of finance and monetary value but also some components outside of it” said Buterin. “The general idea that we can create this economy where we micro-tokenize and let people have their own micro-ownership, I think that is definitely a very interesting and promising idea.”       Sasha Ivanov, CEO of Waves in CoinTelegraph Article:  https://cointelegraph.com/news/we-are-witnessing-brilliant-example-of-crowd-intelligence-sasha-ivanov-on-icos  Quote “Primalbase is a real estate project, while it is also a Blockchain community project. It offers a rather unique product - on the one hand, it is an access to co-working, on the other hand, it is a financial instrument, which can be traded on the market. There hasn’t been anything like this before. It can unite many startups within the community. Many cryptocurrency startups are getting interested in sharing Primalbase co-working spaces, soon we might see the development of a new environment for cryptocurrency businesses, that will go out of the virtual world into the real one, in particular, geographical locations, it will be interesting.”  Ivanov notes:  Quote “Integration of tokens into this model allows for greater simplicity and transparency. You can, of course, agree with a person without a token but with a token, it is easier. This is going to be the very first project which will be pushing leasing of financial instruments through Blockchain, it is a very interesting scheme.”  Ivanov thinks that the Primalbase project is going to demonstrate a fast expansion, triggering the development of a new business ecosystem and creation of a new economy.   Quote from: sasha35625 on June 10, 2017, 12:32:41 PM yes, I fully support this project, the idea of this project was born while discussing issues in the existing model of co-working industry with Dmitry. As for Vitalik - Dimtry talked to him while he was in Moscow, and Vitalik liked the idea. I'm an advisor to the project and we'll use Primalbase office space.",False

It offers a rather unique product - on the one hand, it is an access to co-working, on the other hand, it is a financial instrument, which can be traded on the market. There hasn’t been anything like this before. It can unite many startups within the community. Many cryptocurrency startups are getting interested in sharing Primalbase co-working spaces, soon we might see the development of a new environment for cryptocurrency businesses, that will go out of the virtual world into the real one, in particular, geographical locations, it will be interesting.”  Ivanov notes:  Quote “Integration of tokens into this model allows for greater simplicity and transparency. You can, of course, agree with a person without a token but with a token, it is easier. This is going to be the very first project which will be pushing leasing of financial instruments through Blockchain, it is a very interesting scheme.”  Ivanov thinks that the Primalbase project is going to demonstrate a fast expansion, triggering the development of a new business ecosystem and creation of a new economy.",False

Yes and No. If you have 1 bitcoin and you are willing to invest it on Primalbase then the price depends on what day of ICO you are buying it. For first day the price is 1PBT = 3BTC or 0.33PBT = 1BTC and on the second to seventh day the price is 1PBT = 4BTC or 0.25PBT = 1BTC and when you buy it after that then it's price will be 1PBT = 5BTC or 0.2PBT = 1BTC.",False

How much space does 1 token grant you? 2. For how long are you able to use the space that the 1 token grants you? - e.g. can you only use the space 1 month in a whole year? Or is the space actually yours for ever for 1 token?   As I understand: 1. 1 PBT means 1 membership. 2. Lifetime  So to be clear, 1 membership is 1 person and 1 seat yes ?   From the whitepaper section 3.2:  Quote 3.2 Token specification   One PBT token allows full access to the shared workspace at any Primalbase location for one person. In every office space, all the necessary services and amenities will be present and provided, such as broadband Internet access, digital printing, etc. The term of the token is unlimited and, therefore, does not expire. The fee itself is secured in a single payment. The number of tokens that can be purchased by the same holder is unlimited. In this case, the possession of 4 tokens permits the use of a private office, if one is available.   Read more:  http://primalbase.com/assets/PrimalbaseWP.pdf",False

In addition, the deficit will positively affect speculation. Part of the answer is here: https://medium.com/@primalbase/q-a-1-primalbase-ico-83dbaa0f88e5 Quote 7. “Why so few coins, people won’t like owning 0.0001 of a token” It is a matter of denomination. Why pumping up an artificial value? 1 token equals to 1 membership spot. Why are we creating splits? The reason lies in the fact that 1 token is not only one membership spot and access to the infrastructure, it is also a financial tool. What is the meaning of crowdfunding campaign? Everyone has a chance to buy in even with a small account of stakes, and nevertheless be directly involved into development of the project. The entry threshold for buying into our project is significantly reduced. We don’t intend to create anything extra, if it is not needed. Let’s say creating 10 000 tokens. I don’t understand what are the 10 000 tokens for — it is like having 10 000 keys. I need only one key, which opens all of the doors, I don’t need to have 10 000 of those. I have only one key which gives me access to all, it is my universal digital code. But in order to ensure a greater flexibility for people who would like to join our project, we decided to create a certain split of 0.0001. Bitcoin has 8 digits after decimal point, while Primalbase has only 4, there is an explanation behind it, I don’t see the point in having such a division.",False

Could you please advise if the offices for the remaining 4 locations have been finalised or are you still searching for suitable premises? Procuring real estate can be a long process at times and it would be nice to know that you are able to meet the deadlines stated on obtaining your locations.  Where will your London offices be located? I would ideally like to know before investing for travel purposes  From what i can see you are aiming to raise between 3000 and 5000 btc. From current pricings this would be between 6 and 10 million, lets say 1.2-2 million per location. You would not be able to purchase any significant office space for this price in East London so I assume you will be leasing the locations? If this is the case how long are your lease agreements?  How many workspaces/offices there will be per location?  Will all token holder be guaranteed a workstation if they choose to use the location? The worst thing that could happen with this project is that token holders arrive to use their workspace and there are not enough for all token holders for that day. Lets say there is a crypto conference in London and investors want to use their token whilst they are there to do some work. What if maybe 100 token holders arrive and there are not enough workspaces? Or what if a location is oversubscribed after ICO and there will not be enough spaces?  Also I wanted to ask how are the offices? What is the size, layout, is it an closed office for privacy etc? Could you please post an example from your Amsterdam location so investors can see better what is the benefit of investing in an office over a workstation  If an investor was to invest in 4 tokens for the office, how long would the term be for? Would there be an legal contract provided as a proof of tenancy/lease agreement for investors?

Yes, my examples a bit unrealistic but my point is your funding process too volatile. How much Primal Base need for sustainable business model, for establish 4 other work spaces, expenses?
