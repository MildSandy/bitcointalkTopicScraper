Crypto Market News Highlights: 1.) US Congress Urged to Regulate Crypto Sector Under Bank Secrecy Act 2.) Binance Acquires Singapore-Based Crypto Spot and Derivatives Exchange 4.)  Ripple Continues Mass-dumping as Fresh 500 million XRP Leaves Escrow Wallet 8.) Digibyte (DGB) Trading to Kick-start on Bitrue Exchange by 12 September 10.) IOTA Partners with Jaguar Land Rover for Tracing the car energy with Distributed Ledger Technology  Live YouTube Questions When funding? When burn the correct XCM total amount? Any news on TRAM? Internally, the date is the 15th of September. We have brought on an external QA team, on top of our internal QA team. The date this is supposed to end is the 15th. Internally! When fix the utility for XCM? Happening around the same time as the TRAM release. When new website? Any update on Montenegro and the CSD? We got an official letter yesterday, from the president of the CMA. Professional reference to Kevin and the other co-founder of the CSD and CoinMetro, saying they are more than happy and eager to receive our application into the sandbox. When can I buy a CoinMetro T-shirt? Why is CoinMarketCap’s circulating supply for XCM only 8 million? Any comments on the price right now? We’re talking about a token that is available on one platform, that has yet to do (substantial) marketing, and has seen sell pressure on one day of over 1% of the circulating supply, and was able to maintain a value of less than 20% of that day’s high. That’s quite extraordinary. Any updates on the debit cards? Market makers still due to come online on the 15th? If CoinMetro runs into any critical money issues, would you consider selling large chunks of XCM from the liquidity pool outside the book? Any sneak peak of the next proposed IEO? When tokenized debt on CoinMetro? One of the products we’re looking to offer in the sandbox. We wouldn’t want to tokenize individual debt, that’s a slippery slope. Does the LOI with the Brazilians include the full funding or just part of it? Will you get all funds in one swoop? Until when do the current funds last? What kind of timeframe before the CSD will be a working product? How big is the potential market for the CSD? Well, you have to total up every single regulated market in the world. So, huge. Bond market in the US is a 100 trillion. Generally, we’re talking about 100s of trillions in terms of possibilities. Any update on US residents that participated in the ICO being able to be in the airdrop family?",False

Backed by FXPIG. LIVE NOW,"    Hi CryptoTech_  This is a very often asked question in the Telegram channel. Short answer: no. And longer answer: there is no plan to officially list XCM outside of the CoinMetro exchange.  However, there is a very good reason for that. XCM is considered as a utility token. After the introduction of margin posting (in roughly 4 to 6 weeks from now) the will implement the XCM tokenomics mechanics. That means all fees will be paid by XCM and all these trade fees will market buy XCM in the process. But outside of CoinMetro the XCM utility token has no other purpose.  In addition, the listing of XCM on any other exchange would ask the question if XCM is exceeding its utility purpose and could be used as an actual currency or even a security. On a regulatory side, this could become a problem for CoinMetro. Obviously, something they want to avoid.  Hopefully I could help you bit. Cheers    Quote from: khiholangkang on July 22, 2019, 10:06:53 AM  This project continues to show very good progress, but what I want to ask is whether XCM has been registered in exchange other than Coinmetro? XCM is only listed on its own platform with the XCM/EUR pair, maybe in the future we can see it in other exchanges  Hi khiholangkang  Theoretically XCM could be sold on any DEX because one can transfer his tokens to personal wallets. However, in the future there are no plans to list XCM somewhere else for the reasons outlined above.",False

Obviously that process took too much time. Hence, right now LHV is setting up a framework that allows to list CoinMetro any coin they want without that process, which should be much more quickly and feasible. Word is that this might be set end of week or next week. Fingers crossed.",False

As for exchanges, CoinMetro, is an exchange, and it is of their best interest to keep it there.   Initially, XCM will be tradable on our own exchange. Listing a token on multiple exchanges is actually counterproductive. Given the limited supply by its design it is an illiquid asset, so spreading it thinly across multiple venues simply makes more illiquid, and as most volume will be on the sell side initially, this simply leads to more downward pressure.",False

LIVE NOW,"3.2.10 Decentralization and Atomic Swaps  Generally, cryptocurrency exchanges are at least ""semi-centralized"", given that assets are often held by the exchange on behalf of its client base. The move toward fully decentralized exchange mechanisms has begun, and CoinMetro plans to take a proactive approach to this technology. The CoinMetro team sees technology like Polkadot, Cosmos, and Aion approaching, and understands that atomic swaps and cross chain communication will be extremely significant going forward.  CoinMetro intends to offer atomic swap-like ""peer to peer secure exchanges"" using time locked smart contracts where no third party intervention is needed to complete the transaction. The smart contract will act as a form of timed escrow, ensuring that both parties are protected in the event that one party defaults on the transaction. It is intended that this exchange mechanism will carry fees that will be almost zero from our side, as it will be considered an added service for clients who are trading smaller volumes and those that do not require immediate execution.  https://coinmetro.com/whitepaper",False

CoinMetro aims to offer the lowest fees in the industry. Customer Service - FXPig has a great track record of offering the best customer service in the FX world. CoinMetro wants to bring this world-class service to the crypto world. A lively community of passionate Passengers who are onboard with CoinMetro and who, as early customers, help the team build the tools they would love to use.

Backed by FXPIG. LIVE NOW,"   Regarding this, and from Kevin on Telegram:  Quote Initially, XCM will be tradable on our own exchange. Listing a token on multiple exchanges is actually counterproductive. Given the limited supply by its design it is an illiquid asset, so spreading it thinly across multiple venues simply makes more illiquid, and as most volume will be on the sell side initially, this simply leads to more downward pressure.  Also, keep in mind, CoinMetro has a specific strategy in place for the long-term stability of the XCM price, see here; https://coinmetro.com/whitepaper/#long-term. This strategy is not as effective if we allow the token to be traded on external platforms.  https://t.me/CoinMetro/20327",False

Simplification is key in order to get a large level of adoption.  Trading facilities need to have as few clicks as possible when it comes to getting from fiat to crypto and from crypto-to-crypto for simple exchanges.  On the trading side, CM never wants to be conventional, but the complexity should be a natural iteration from the simple version to a more advanced trading tool.  CM wants have a very exploratory process with the community in order to build the exchange that they deserve.

Kraken notified their users a while back that the SWIFT system would no longer be used for transfers in the EU, and SEPA transfers would remain. This could be specific to another situation, so do ask Kevin, if you get the chance to join us at 2PM. __________________________ Friday 25.05.2018 @ 2PM (GMT), the AMA with our CEO Kevin Murcko's main topic will be about recent developments in crypto.

Backed by FXPIG. LIVE NOW,"   Hey, Grchina.  Initially, XCM will be tradable on our own exchange. Listing a token on multiple exchanges is actually counterproductive. Given the limited supply by its design it is an illiquid asset, so spreading it thinly across multiple venues simply makes more illiquid, and as most volume will be on the sell side initially, this simply leads to more downward pressure.  Hope this helps.",False

Backed by FXPIG. LIVE NOW,"Written summaries of Kevin's AMA yesterday, provided by the CoinMetro Telegram community:  Here are a few points covered in the video:  US Contributors still expected to keep any XCM they purchased  Crypto was created by frowning on banks  Platform allows swap-loans, but CM is not a bank  We’re still in a bubble when we come to ICOs.  Website translation done internally as much as possible, some things outsourced.   _________________________________________________ The fact CM may seek to offer merchant accounts for retailers is very big. But a long way off potentially.  Also the chat functionality within the platform. It would be great to obtain more information on what this may include, like groups for certain coins.  Landing page containing news and info on coins etc. So full info about any listed coin is attainable on CM platform. Without requiring us to source this externally.  Customer retention/service with plans on having 20+ support staff employed to manage webchat/Email queries by beta launch.  Also the fact that TAM ETCF and other elements of the platform may be seen sooner than anticipated on the roadmap as they are likely to be built around the exchange platform easily.  They also stated that expansive chart variations will be available for TA. This is important for gaining volume with serious expert traders.",False

COINMETRO NOTES  From the 4th May 2018 AMA on Facebook  * No announcements regarding partnerships. They are in the works. * There have been some movements in devs. Transferred devs around, hired new ones. Changed the way that the functionality of the core exchange worked. This required changes. Can’t go live without a license in place. License in Estonia should be established by 13th May. Russian devs in town along with CTO. * Shouldn’t affect vesting period * A facebook live meeting is planned for once a week. * Haven’t jumped into the US regulatory landscape yet. Wyoming as initial start. * If SEC classifies crypto as future, no exchange for US without regulation. * Regulatory roadmap will be revised (UK, Japan, Switzerland being looked at) * Reg D 504 looks likely * New Legal Team in the US * Referral program will remain, the percentages are still being looked at. * Will be having a talk with the Ripple guys * Approximately 1st week of June for beta launch * More feature are possible because of the delay * Marketing hired new people, new director of Global Content, Alex- Julia with additional market information, Niels with Google Ads, Social Advertising, etc… * iOS working on updates and ensuring that it’s ready to connect to the exchange. * KYC is required for all * 2 different e-money providers for €, USD - 2/3 banking application in process * € most likely on launch, USD not so much * Always looking for new talent- looking for talented developers * The team wants to make sure that the projects on ICO Express are vetted, and receive the help they need to succeed * No one knows for sure if Airdropped tokens for US contributors are fully legal at the time, so CoinMetro decided not to provide them for US contributors to prevent trouble down the road. * ICO Express will allow people to create tokens * They want to make sure the team creates a mature product that people want to use * They’re still not back at the contribution rate they accepted XCM for on the sale. * The team will hold on to a certain amount of funds in crypto. * Patience is a virtue * Commission on trade: Default 0.1 percent, 0.075 percent for contributors * The approximately 30 days of delay shouldn’t affect vesting. It’s not an official announcement yet. * 80 Support in Ukraine 10 in Mexico, 10 in Macedonia * 4.5m EUR/year burn rate for building a business * Debit card is still on schedule for July * Kevin is pro regulation for companies in the crypto space. * News on partnerships incoming * Once they mint, they’ll list on CMC * “Don’t make the mistake of equating supply, demand and liquidity to rise in price.” * The main correlation for the rise of price in crypto is hype. * Role of FXPig- has provided the initial staffing, is providing the initial tech, will provide liquidity in the future for certain types of assets depending on regulations. * Team will use ChartIQ * Team hires the best developers, no matter where they come from * The team plans to offer as many crosses as possible, but they to avoid getting into synthetic areas. * No such thing as fee-free. * Success should be the result. The catalyst is that you’re doing things right. * Putting on a foundation to go lobby regulators. * Marketing will be ramped up. * Until demand outpaces supply, it still doesn’t make that XCM be listed on other exchanges. * Lots of partnerships currently in the work with tokens. * XCM will be tradeable once the beta exchange launches in about 4 weeks * Team will be setting up a careers page * Not final renders, Sunday afternoon UI mockups * Team has 10 people in the Estonia office, including Kevin * There are 25 desks in the office.",False

New participants can also join but must donate 1 XCM or a minimum of 1 ETH or equivalent in order to qualify.  Airdrop Process  In addition to either donating or being a participant in the presale or public sale, users must go through KYC procedures, a process that can take up to 30 days to verify. While the airdrop ends April 15th, participants should expect tokens to be sent to their wallets sometime between June 20th and July 1st.  The airdrop is open for the first 10,000 who apply, so if all the participants of the presale and public sale enter, this leaves little space for new participants.

Changes in the hierarchy: COO/CMO roles: people wanted, positions are open!  - Right now there are on staff: 11 in Estonia, 7 in Mexico, 5 in Macedonia.  Starting the setup of the support office in Ukraine. Looking at 24 people initially for 3 shifts of 24/7 support. - 80 people when exchange goes live. - Dev side: testing exchanges - other exchanges only have price updates twice per second, which is ridiculously slow. Also, stress testing own matching engines. - Updates thin because a lot of work behind the scene, lots of people wearing many hats. - Team is looking to be structured and set for 3-5 years ahead to prevent any regulatory surprises. - KYC still not official, normally it will be in the next 48h. Tomorrow there will be an official OFAC list. At this moment, most KYC applications are approved within minutes. - In the coming days, Kevin will be micromanaging marketing, support and dev. - Tomorrow there will be a marketing update. On Friday a support update, this weekend a developer update. Patience please, we are working. - Marketing: more details tomorrow. - E-mail updates: towards end of the month structured updates via mail. More e-mail updates once the Global Content position begins on the 25th of April. - Trains squeak when pushing out of the station! But once the train gets going, we gonna steamroll 🙂  And of course, you can listen for yourself here: https://t.me/coinmetroupdates/125",False

Listing a token on multiple exchanges is actually counterproductive. Given the limited supply by its design it is an illiquid asset, so spreading it thinly across multiple venues simply makes more illiquid, and as most volume will be on the sell side initially, this simply leads to more downward pressure.

Backed by FXPIG. LIVE NOW,"  interesting video, thanks for posting. here is the sum: Quote What makes them stand out?  1. Yes, they're a decentralized exchange, but they're above and beyond anything else out there. They've created ETF-like digital asset baskets, which is a fancy way of saying you'll be able to diversify your portfolio by sector (healthcare coins, privacy coins, banking, IoT, etc) all at the click of a button.  2. By this Summer, they're promising instant fiat withdrawals via their debit card. They'll offer instant fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat deposits and withdrawals, meaning you'll be able to stroll up to an ATM (of a to be released major ATM purveyor), and withdraw fiat directly from whichever CoinMetro wallet your card is linked to.  3. Unlike other major exchanges, they're being super progressive on the regulatory side of things, seeking to cover all their bases by actively seeking licensing and accreditation in as many countries as possible. So you won't ever have to worry about your funds suddenly being frozen because they aren't compliant.  4. Also unlike other major exchanges (like Binance, who charges $1 million listing fees), they won't charge aspiring cryptocurrencies any egregious fees.  5. They're going to incorporate a turn-key ICO platform to launch ICO's directly, giving CoinMetro users exclusive pre-sale access as well!  6. To top it off, you can partner with a pro-trader through their TAM (tokenized asset manager) platform, and essentially invest in the success of professional's portfolios, while gaining invaluable trading knowledge in the process. There's much more to them than this, so check out our deep dive into CoinMetro, as well as his enlightening views on cryptocurrency regulation and the parallels between the early days of FX trading, and what the crypto market is currently undergoing.",False

Introducing the COIN (XCM) token; a unique digital asset that powers CoinMetro, a one-size-fits-all fintech platform fueling the future of blockchain innovation.  What is CoinMetro?  CoinMetro is a one-of-a-kind investing platform that will utilize a tokenized ecosystem to service both professional traders and investors as well as, crypto novices who are interested in joining the market. CoinMetro will also issue their own Coin Metro debit cards that will provide instant cash withdrawals across millions of ATMs around the world. The platform will offer instant fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat deposits and withdrawals. In addition to the exchange platform, CoinMetro also sports investing services found in traditional finance markets. Investors can purchase ECTFs (Electronically Traded Crypto Funds) similar to ETFs where they can invest in “baskets” of digital assets based on criteria like riskiness of assets and the industry an asset is in. Users will also be able to earn returns by investing in Tokenized Asset Management baskets. Token Asset Management is a successful managed account model that was created by FXPIG which would partner a user with a pro trader to grow their portfolio. All in all, the goal for CoinMetro, is to ensure an easy, user friendly one stop platform for investors.

While it remains to be seen what it might look like for Facebook to embrace decentralized technologies, we agree with Zuckerberg that cryptocurrencies and blockchain will play a huge role in future businesses.  Facebook’s CEO isn’t the only Silicon Valley bigwig to jump on the crypto bandwagon. Twitter and Square CEO, Jack Dorsey, also recently announced the rollout of Bitcoin support in Square’s app. At CoinMetro, we believe the time for mainstream adoption is just getting started, and as major players from established industries and companies begin to set their sights on crypto, we think Zuckerberg is right to call attention to the potential for blockchain tech to solve real world problems.

Backed by FXPIG. LIVE NOW,"Kevins AMA Video in detail..  1:32   |  How and when will we submit the KYC form for the presale?  2:55   |  Do we get bonusses for holding XCM (Coin)? If not, what’s to prevent a mass dump when it hits the exchange?  7:01  |  What is your experience running FXPig and how will that help to build CoinMetro? Also, from FXPig to CoinMetro, have there been any challenges and how have you overcome them. What has been the overall experience going from Forex to Crypto?  10:44  |   How will marketing be done after the pre-sale, will it be increased?  14:03   |  It seems like South Korea will expand KYC by requiring a linked bank account. Will this be part of your KYC verification as well?  17:28  |   In terms of differentiating, will you restrict yourself to the main coins only, or expand into altcoins as well?  22:30  |   As a greedy investor, what is the value of the token you see post lock-up period and how will the how will the burn rate as described in the whitepaper tie into that?  31:13  |  Are you worried about pump and dump groups coming in and voting on a certain token, only to then pump and dump it on the platform? Do you have a strategy to prevent this from happening?  36:27  |  The whitepaper mentions “transparent, third-party audits”. Will these audits be there only for Bitcoin, or for every fiat currency and/or cryptocurrency that you hold? Will these audits be there from the get-go and will they be published?  41:00  |  Apparently the Bitcoin Cards from TenX, BitPay, Bitwala and Wirex stopped working after VISA stopped providing services to WaveCrest, who issued the cards for these companies. Was CoinMetro planning to use WaveCrest as well? If so, how will you prevent something like this from happening? Apparently WaveCrest was non-compliant with VISA membership regulations.  45:43  |  On the token buy-back program: what actually happens when the platform buys back the tokens?  The tokens that don’t get burned, will you keep them in a vault, will they go back into circulation or something else? How exactly will that work when you take your fees in the native token?  48:15  |  Will the native token be mandatory in using the CoinMetro platform for adoption? Do we first have to deposit fiat, then buy the coin and then use the platform? Or can we deposit Bitcoin, buy coins and then use the platform.  50:02  |  Since you’ll be putting in an effort to keep fees low, aren’t you worried that people will flock to the platform just for cashing out? So for example: people who have never used the platform will just put a lot of Bitcoin on there, convert it to euro and then pull the euros of the platform into their bankaccount. Do you think this will hurt your liquidity and do you have a plan to counter this sort of action?  54:32  |  What are your benefits over other main exchanges and do you plan on marketing and becoming the main, nr. 1 exchange, or are you content with a low market penetration?  61:50  |  Will the token supply fund decrease in size together with the token burn? Or will it grow relatively bigger since it stays at the same amount of tokens while the overall supply decreases?  64:23  |  The whitepaper talks about “stabilising the XCM market”, what does that mean? Is this only done when no-one is selling COIN and the platform needs it because all fees are converted to COIN?  1:09:37  |  Could you elaborate on your wallet system for customers? Moving crypto of and on exchanges and keeping my own secure cold storage wallets is quite the task. Do you plan on offering some kind of secure, cold multi-currency wallet?",False
