One of the experts listed these points:   - Does not clearly define the problem they're solving. Is it that people don't have time? Is it online 3D retail made available? What's the point of having 3D residence and converse with people there if I can use SKYPE? - Explanatory video hardly explains anything. - 3D retail not gonna work for all industries. Especially upper class clothing and luxury brands: people have an experience shopping, try things out before buying, sometimes it is a status thing. 3VR at current stage of development and accesibility is not going to change that yet. - Team has no advisors. - Team member links to FB pages and/or wikipedia for the ICE hockey guy. Should it be an inspiration of confidence? How does ICE hockey skills relate to VR and this project?   My question is, has any of this changed for MarkSpace to score a 4.1 now?

Perhaps tokens will not be sold in full at the first stage. At the second stage of the ICO, the team will have more motivation to present a better and more technologically advanced product. And for investors, there is a possibility to regulate risks a little, perhaps only investing part in the first stage, and then see how the whole platform develops. And investors can secure themselves by investing in the first stage only part of their planned funds, and see how the platform develops.

For starters, mixer reality is different from VR. In VR you only see the virtual world, because the screen isn't transparent. You could attach a camera to see the outside real world behind the virtual world, but that's called augmented reality. It's not better or worse, it's just different like a fantasy movie and a documentary are. Mixed reality goes one step further than augmented reality because the virtual world is interacting with the real world, but it's still not better or worse than VR. How do they call that, I think suspension of disbelief, it's better with VR. With AR and MR you're always aware you're in the real world.  The Hololens isn't that impressive tbh. The hardware is lagging behind the demos Microsoft is showing, as if you can see the MR all around you, but it's a tiny screen.",True

Yes, everytime you click for the backup wallet, you get a backup in which you have to decrypt with your password made during the signup.

The use of Ethereum smart contracts is limited only to critical functionality and utilizes the Ethereum blockchain.  Additionally, the platform has a fully decentralized architecture in contrast to other projects that just call it decentralized. Decentralization is achieved through the use of three types of servers. These servers will be picked from available machines of network participants providing their computational and storage resources and assigned one of three roles: DATA SERVER - data blocks storage; receiving, storing and retrieving data. SERVICE - accepting and executing tasks and returning results. HUB - storing references to data blocks; addresses of DATA SERVERs and SERVICEs; accepting requests from servers and clients (UI); locating servers for executing tasks and returning data about these servers and access keys.",True

Thank you for your question !  Currently, there are many projects that attempt to combine VR and Blockchain technologies but MARK.SPACE takes the synergy of the ideas to a whole new level.By combining the best of both and supporting the VR-platform with a crypto-economy, MARK.SPACE created a technologically advanced virtual universe, allowing for decentralized transactions and 100% transparency.  Before MARK.SPACE, creating personalized VR projects was time consuming and expensive, and only possible with the assistance of professional developers. In the framework of the MARK.SPACE universe, each person or organization is able start their own VR/3D project, without knowing even the basics of programming.  Specially designed gadgets and costly equipment like Oculus, HTC Vive, VR-helmets and the like are optional, with no need to use powerful computers or to download special Apps. The only thing required from users is one of their existing gadgets – PCs, tablets or smartphones, and an internet connection.  Moreover, all MARK.SPACE areas will have their own web address, which means users may connect them to a domain of their choice – people will be able to visit spaces directly, without even knowing they just entered a part of an entire VR-universe.  To add to the list of how different and technologically advanced MARK.SPACE is compared to other VR-projects, we have to mention the technological readiness of the platform even before the start of the ICO, which can already be experienced by visiting the demo.",True

Sometimes these companies don’t even have physical offices. VR technology allows any reputable company to virtualize their office and allow it to be visited by potential customers. If you are looking for a lawyer or trying to choose a movie production studio, thinking about hiring an IT outsourcing firm or considering visiting a plastic surgery clinic -  having an opportunity to first visit its virtual premises would only help in making a correct decision. Imagine each company that recently managed a successful ICO having its own virtual office that any investor could visit. As you walk down the hall you see offices of Lisk, AEthernity, Tezos, Civic, Waves, EOS, and the like. ICO promotional agencies could purchase an office right next to the Ethereum foundation. Copywriters could purchase an office right next door. With the MARK platform it’s going to simply take a 360° camera and few hours of work to make it possible. Any freelancer or artist could create their own office.",True

Currently, there are many projects that attempt to combine VR and Blockchain technologies but MARK.SPACE takes the synergy of the ideas to a whole new level.By combining the best of both and supporting the VR-platform with a crypto-economy, MARK.SPACE created a technologically advanced virtual universe, allowing for decentralized transactions and 100% transparency.  Before MARK.SPACE, creating personalized VR projects was time consuming and expensive, and only possible with the assistance of professional developers. In the framework of the MARK.SPACE universe, each person or organization is able start their own VR/3D project, without knowing even the basics of programming.  Specially designed gadgets and costly equipment like Oculus, HTC Vive, VR-helmets and the like are optional, with no need to use powerful computers or to download special Apps. The only thing required from users is one of their existing gadgets – PCs, tablets or smartphones, and an internet connection.  Moreover, all MARK.SPACE areas will have their own web address, which means users may connect them to a domain of their choice – people will be able to visit spaces directly, without even knowing they just entered a part of an entire VR-universe.  To add to the list of how different and technologically advanced MARK.SPACE is compared to other VR-projects, we have to mention the technological readiness of the platform even before the start of the ICO, which can already be experienced by visiting the demo.",True
