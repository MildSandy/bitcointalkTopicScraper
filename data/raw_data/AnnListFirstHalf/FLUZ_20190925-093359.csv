That makes more sense now.      Tell me if I got this right: the profits are split between all network members based on their proportional amount of tokens, and tokens are generated when a purchase is made from the app. So at some point, when all tokens are sold and the network is full, if one wants to get a into the network to get a discount, he has to buy some tokens from someone. If the income from the tokens is solid, one won't sell his tokens unless offered a good price for them. Wouldn't that mean that at some point the overall income for everyone will start decreasing as less and less people get into the network? I mean, if everyone in the network plans on making a purchase every now and then I guess it'll be fine.
