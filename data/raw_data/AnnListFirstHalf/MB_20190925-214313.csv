Etherium monsters (Ethermon) The point of game is to imitate the world of ""Etherium monsters"" (Ethermon), in which players have to take over and evaluate Ethermon in order to defeat the other creatures. In the beta version you can take over the world, but they still need to develop the possibility of evolution and fights. So far, the functionality of the game is limited only by the purchase of virtual eggs and their storage. With each subsequent purchase by another player of the same monster, a small percentage of profit will be credited to the account of the owner. The cost of the monsters themselves ranges from 0.37 ETH (300 USD) to 1.25 ETH (1,000 USD). At this stage, users are already faced with the first problem: the investment is done, and there is absence of any functionality. It suspiciously reminiscents of the classic pyramid scheme in which early adopters get the profits through attracting new investors. When there are new revenues and investments, interest payments will stop.   2. Cryptoppies   Clone with the cyber games.   3.
