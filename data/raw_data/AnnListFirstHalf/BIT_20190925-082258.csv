It's actually a very good question, thank you for that. We are much more than a cashback platform. We will give shoppers cashback in cryptocurrency, referral rewards in crypto, social actions rewards in crypto, etc., etc. Here is how we are going to work with cashback platforms such as LetyShops: 1. For those of them, which will collaborate with us, we will provide a solution to replace a cashback in fiat with cashback in BIT. So essentially they will become another source of the demand on BIT tokens. The interface, the brand, the website will stay the same for the shoppers, but the reward will change  to BIT token from fiat. 2. As to those which will not collaborate with us, we are going to take their share of the market ?? as cashback in cryptocurrency is much more appealing to the end users than cashback in fiat.",False

Our team have enough expertise to extract the most from the distributed ledger technology to apply an innovative approach towards loyalty management market. Working product means a lot. 2) We focus not only on cash-backs but on any reward systems, so giving customers a freedom to choose. It also gives a necessary flexibility to BitRewards regarding different market trends. 3) We share the same spirit - to provide every citizen with cryptocurrency, though the realization differs - the RETN token economy is totally unclear from the whitepaper. Also, the liquidity issue has no place in it, whereas we describe token liquidity in detail. All in all, we're open for potential co-ops as the only reasonable goal for us is to make the loyalty management market more efficient and beneficial for all the participants.",False

For those of them, which will collaborate with us, we will provide a solution to replace a cashback in fiat with cashback in BIT. So essentially they will become another source of the demand for BIT tokens. The interface, the brand, the website will stay the same for the shoppers, but the reward will change to BIT token from fiat. 2. As to those which will not collaborate with us, we are going to take their share of the market ?? as cashback in cryptocurrency is much more appealing to the end users than cashback in fiat. BIT tokens are an Etherium based currency. In case of the listing at the exchange, it will be possible to change them into crypto or fiat currency ‚Äî everything that the exchanges allow to do.",False

They are struggling with attraction, conversion, activation, and retention of their users and want a solution.  The statistics show that online merchants are spending annually billions of dollars on such solutions and often do so extremely inefficiently - over 50% of loyalty programs are closing within the first year after the launch, because they don‚Äôt pay off and create more customer frustration, than satisfaction  The user experiences in loyalty programs leave much to be desired, leading to clients frustration and worsening of their loyalty.  BitRewards will equip the merchants with the premium set of tools, which will increase their revenue by double-digit percentages. The software, which usually costs hundreds of dollars will be offered free of charge.  We don't plan to impose the limitations on the merchants ‚Äî they can both issue points or BIT tokens to reward their users on our system. E.g., they can choose to reward for shares and likes with points, and for the purchases of the referred friends with the crypto. We aim to give the suite of tools that solve the merchants' problems better, rather than tie them  our platform. It will result in broader adoption in the long run  The merchants want to have a tool that enables them rewarding not only with points, but with something the users deem more valuable - cash, or cryptocurrency (which in certain aspects is better than cash).  The adoption from the stores presently will, besides the other factors, be driven by the fact that rewarding in crypto helps to stand out among the competition, and in the future, it will become the industry standard and will be demanded by the users.  The question of the ban on crypto often arises. However, it will already hardly be possible. We are following the regulators and in reality, approve of the majority of their decisions. Because they show the desire to shield the large public from scam, misconduct, and negligence, rather than uproot the cryptocurrencies as a class. SEC's head of blockchain division is actually very supportive of the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency developments. Regulators have hard times now figuring out how to approach a lot of concepts and technologies, as the speed of evolution is extraordinary.  Therefore we are most assured that very soon the crypto will become a standard of the retail industry and will be adopted by almost every store. It's not hard to figure out how to legitimize the typical retail transactions in crypto, and given that a lot of great minds are applying their skills to this area, it's a matter short time when we will see it. If you think about it, crypto is much safer and more transparent, than physical paper cash, in which no one objects transacting.",False

Regarding Retainly - it's for sure an interesting project that deserves some attention. However, it's not accurate to compare it with BitRewards for a number of reasons: 1) One thing is to talk, another one is to show. BitRewards is based and backed by a successful product - GIFTD - that was launched in 2012. Our team have enough expertise to extract the most from the distributed ledger technology to apply an innovative approach towards loyalty management market. Working product means a lot. 2) We focus not only on cash-backs but on any reward systems, so giving customers a freedom to choose. It also gives a necessary flexibility to BitRewards regarding different market trends. 3) We share the same spirit - to provide every citizen with cryptocurrency, though the realization differs - the RETN token economy is totally unclear from the whitepaper. Also, the liquidity issue has no place in it, whereas we describe token liquidity in detail. All in all, we're open for potential co-ops as the only reasonable goal for us is to make the loyalty management market more efficient and beneficial for all the participants.",False

While we are waiting for the listing, thanks to the open sale, we will be able to work with the big partners interested in a large purchase of BIT tokens. This will positively affect the liquidity of the token, and it is strategically important for the successful listing. At the moment, we are already in the process of business development with some of the major Asian companies. 3. This is not going to affect our roadmap in any way.

Let me answer that question! Regarding Retainly - it's for sure an interesting project that deserves some attention. However, it's not accurate to compare it with BitRewards for a number of reasons: 1) One thing is to talk, another one is to show. BitRewards is based and backed by a successful product - GIFTD - that was launched in 2012. Our team have enough expertise to extract the most from the distributed ledger technology to apply an innovative approach towards loyalty management market. Working product means a lot. 2) We focus not only on cash-backs but on any reward systems, so giving customers a freedom to choose. It also gives a necessary flexibility to BitRewards regarding different market trends. 3) We share the same spirit - to provide every citizen with cryptocurrency, though the realization differs - the RETN token economy is totally unclear from the whitepaper. Also, the liquidity issue has no place in it, whereas we describe token liquidity in detail. All in all, we're open for potential co-ops as the only reasonable goal for us is to make the loyalty management market more efficient and beneficial for all the participants.",False

However, it's not accurate to compare it with BitRewards for a number of reasons: 1) One thing is to talk, another one is to show. BitRewards is based and backed by a successful product - GIFTD - that was launched in 2012. Our team have enough expertise to extract the most from the distributed ledger technology to apply an innovative approach towards loyalty management market. Working product means a lot. 2) We focus not only on cash-backs but on any reward systems, so giving customers a freedom to choose. It also gives a necessary flexibility to BitRewards regarding different market trends. 3) We share the same spirit - to provide every citizen with cryptocurrency, though the realization differs - the RETN token economy is totally unclear from the whitepaper. Also, the liquidity issue has no place in it, whereas we describe token liquidity in detail. All in all, we're open for potential co-ops as the only reasonable goal for us is to make the loyalty management market more efficient and beneficial for all the participants.",False

Please understand that we are much more than a cashback platform. We will give shoppers cashback in cryptocurrency, referral rewards in crypto, social actions rewards in crypto, etc., etc. Here is how we are going to work with cashback platforms such as LetyShops: 1. For those of them, which will collaborate with us, we will provide a solution to replace a cashback in fiat with cashback in BIT. So essentially they will become another source of the demand for BIT tokens. The interface, the brand, the website will stay the same for the shoppers, but the reward will change to BIT token from fiat. 2. As to those which will not collaborate with us, we are going to take their share of the market üôÇ as cashback in cryptocurrency is much more appealing to the end users than cashback in fiat. BIT tokens are an Etherium based currency. In case of the listing at the exchange, it will be possible to change them into crypto or fiat currency ‚Äî everything that the exchanges allow to do.",False

However, it's not accurate to compare it with BitRewards for a number of reasons: 1) One thing is to talk, another one is to show. BitRewards is based and backed by a successful product - GIFTD - that was launched in 2012. Our team have enough expertise to extract the most from the distributed ledger technology to apply an innovative approach towards loyalty management market. Working product means a lot. 2) We focus not only on cash-backs but on any reward systems, so giving customers a freedom to choose. It also gives a necessary flexibility to BitRewards regarding different market trends. 3) We share the same spirit - to provide every citizen with cryptocurrency, though the realization differs - the RETN token economy is totally unclear from the whitepaper. Also, the liquidity issue has no place in it, whereas we describe token liquidity in detail. All in all, we're open for potential co-ops as the only reasonable goal for us is to make the loyalty management market more efficient and beneficial for all the participants.",False

There is no affection at all. The customer will either sell his 1 BIT or keep it. If he sells it, it will make a price a little lower than $100.

BitRewards is based and backed by a successful product - GIFTD - that was launched in 2012. Our team have enough expertise to extract the most from the distributed ledger technology to apply an innovative approach towards loyalty management market. Working product means a lot. 2) We focus not only on cash-backs but on any reward systems, so giving customers a freedom to choose. It also gives a necessary flexibility to BitRewards regarding different market trends. 3) We share the same spirit - to provide every citizen with cryptocurrency, though the realization differs - the RETN token economy is totally unclear from the whitepaper. Also, the liquidity issue has no place in it, whereas we describe token liquidity in detail. All in all, we're open for potential co-ops as the only reasonable goal for us is to make the loyalty management market more efficient and beneficial for all the participants.",False

On-premise ‚Äî when the merchant has it's own server with Ethereum node for managing the BIT tokens. That would be about $10/month.

They are struggling with attraction, conversion, activation, and retention of their users and want a solution.  The statistics show that online merchants are spending annually billions of dollars on such solutions and often do so extremely inefficiently - over 50% of loyalty programs are closing within the first year after the launch, because they don‚Äôt pay off and create more customer frustration, than satisfaction  The user experiences in loyalty programs leave much to be desired, leading to clients frustration and worsening of their loyalty.  BitRewards will equip the merchants with the premium set of tools, which will increase their revenue by double-digit percentages. The software, which usually costs hundreds of dollars will be offered free of charge.  We don't plan to impose the limitations on the merchants ‚Äî they can both issue points or BIT tokens to reward their users on our system. E.g., they can choose to reward for shares and likes with points, and for the purchases of the referred friends with the crypto. We aim to give the suite of tools that solve the merchants' problems better, rather than tie them  our platform. It will result in broader adoption in the long run  The merchants want to have a tool that enables them rewarding not only with points, but with something the users deem more valuable - cash, or cryptocurrency (which in certain aspects is better than cash).  The adoption from the stores presently will, besides the other factors, be driven by the fact that rewarding in crypto helps to stand out among the competition, and in the future, it will become the industry standard and will be demanded by the users.  The question of the ban on crypto often arises. However, it will already hardly be possible. We are following the regulators and in reality, approve of the majority of their decisions. Because they show the desire to shield the large public from scam, misconduct, and negligence, rather than uproot the cryptocurrencies as a class. SEC's head of blockchain division is actually very supportive of the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency developments. Regulators have hard times now figuring out how to approach a lot of concepts and technologies, as the speed of evolution is extraordinary.  Therefore we are most assured that very soon the crypto will become a standard of the retail industry and will be adopted by almost every store. It's not hard to figure out how to legitimize the typical retail transactions in crypto, and given that a lot of great minds are applying their skills to this area, it's a matter short time when we will see it. If you think about it, crypto is much safer and more transparent, than physical paper cash, in which no one objects transacting.",False

We will give shoppers cashback in cryptocurrency, referral rewards in crypto, social actions rewards in crypto, etc., etc.  Here is how we are going to work with cashback platforms such as LetyShops: 1. For those of them, which will collaborate with us, we will provide a solution to replace a cashback in fiat with cashback in BIT. So essentially they will become another source of the demand for BIT tokens. The interface, the brand, the website will stay the same for the shoppers, but the reward will change to BIT token from fiat. 2. As to those which will not collaborate with us, we are going to take their share of the market üôÇ as cashback in cryptocurrency is much more appealing to the end users than cashback in fiat.  BIT tokens are an Etherium based currency. In case of the listing at the exchange, it will be possible to change them into crypto or fiat currency ‚Äî everything that the exchanges allow to do.",False

Although it will be possible for the developers of the Smart Rewards apps within the BitRewards ecosystem to charge the merchants for the customary tools, the BitRewards in its first year of operations will not take commission from transactions, aiming to provide maximum efficiency to the merchants. This demonstrates that BitRewards is committed to the growth in the value of BIT, which strategically corresponds to the interests of tokens holders. Our strategy is the maximum adoption and utility of the apps that are built on BitRewards platform among retailers, which will increase the demand for tokens, their adoption and price.  After 12 months of operations we will introduce 0.5% commission on the sales transactions with BitRewards tokens. Also, the special administration entity BitRewards Operator can offer paid services as a result of retailers‚Äô inquiries, as they will be interested in our expertise.  Such services may include: - Customary apps for specific business goals (e.g. a sophisticated bounty campaign); - Adjustments of settings and the testing of hypothesis of the rewards and other parameters of the loyalty system; - The integration of customary blockchain solutions in the existing corporate loyalty program;  The BitRewards Network does not see such development as a priority and considers it the most efficient to transfer such types of important services to independent contractors, BitRewards enthusiasts, and community members with which we plan to work. This will help the adoption of the BitRewards platform and broader acceptance of BIT.  The value of the network grows in the process of adoption by a large number of participants, who start using BitRewards. According to the estimates, in case a conservative forecast (reaching a softcap of $3,000,000), the targeted funds will be sufficient to sign up 5000 retailers in 3 years, which will generate a monthly demand for BIT worth $4.9 million.",False

Sure we have a solution.  The answer is simple: the shop buys BIT tokens whenever it needs to rewards a customer, not in advance.  For example, imagine a shop has a loyalty program and rewards customers with 5% cashback in BIT tokens. Whenever someone makes a purchase for $1000, the store uses BitRewards software and buys BIT tokens for $50, dependless on current BIT exchange rate, and gives these BIT tokens to the customer.  The good thing is that the entire process happens automatically, our software will use BitRewards Liquidity Smart-Contract and purchase BIT tokens with ETH, USDT or other popular ERC-20 tokens automatically whenever it's needed.  So the BIT exchange may grow indefinitely, and it will be attractive for merchants at any given moment.  Thank you for your interest! ",False

You might find it interesting:  Q: From what I was able to find on your project - a few obvious questions arise. Which network will be handling the vast majority of the transactions and how would you address the scalability issue that would be an obvious problem for any rewards solution on blockchain (wich are plenty right now, none have solved this issue last time I have checked with them).  A: Thank you for the question. We also consider the network scaling as one of the major roadbocks to quite a few projects that have emerged recently.  Short answer:  We will move the vast majority of transactions off from the Ethereum blockchain. In the beginning, we'll process them in a centralized manner; later we will switch to Raiden / Lightning networks or other blockchains.  Long answer:  Using Raiden network will allow authorizing the settlements of the transactions on the Ethereum platform almost instantly. We will adapt our software to make use of the Raiden network as soon as it's released. Now it's 80% ready, according to their official GitHub ‚Äî https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden/milestones.  While the Raiden network is still under development, we have the following plan: 1. In the beginning, we will make a half-centralized software, when the shoppers will get their BIT rewards in a centralized manner (our web wallet). The balance in that wallet will not depend on Ethereum blockchain; it will be controlled by our proprietory software and database. However, when someone wants to withdraw their total reward to the external crypto wallet ‚Äî their balance will be recorded to Ethereum blockchain, and they will receive actual ERC20 tokens. We know from experience that only a small minority of people will withdraw tokens often because most people use the default solution and don't care so much.  2. If the Raiden network is still under development in August 2018, we will consider using ¬µRaiden (https://github.com/raiden-network/microraiden) to make the system more decentralized, as ¬µRaiden will help to reduce fees of transfers between shops and shoppers.  3. If there will be no good news about Raiden network in November 2018, we will consider moving the tokens and the entire system to another blockchain. We are closely looking at Ripple or NEM, which are both attractive from different perspectives suits. If we decide to move this way, we will implement an atomic cross-chain exchanger to move all the tokens to the new blockchain. It is a complex, but a realistic process.",False

BIT will also work as a payment medium, and will give BIT holders a possibility to redeem it with every participating merchant. The holders of BIT tokens can also receive bonuses on their purchases at certain stores.  More info:  telegram: https://t.me/bitrewards web: https://bitrewards.network/",False

We would spend no more than 25% of funds on product development. It's possible because our product is based on existing software (as we work on this market for almost 5 years). We will re-use many of software pieces that we've already built. However, lots of stuff has to be projected, designed, developed and maintained.  What about other 75%? Short answer: scaling and marketing. Since our token's exchange rate is a primary source of revenue for us, we will push the market hard  to create a great demand on token.   And softcap is too big, i suppose.  The stated softcap will allow us to reach the optimal number of retailers connected to BitRewards. ""Optimal"" here means min. 5'000 retailers in 3 years. This will create min. $5'000'000 monthly demand on our token. And this in turn leads to min. 5'000% token's price growth rate from this moment.",False

They need to do that in order to stay competitive in the current crowded marketplace. Loyalty programs are not only costly, but also time consuming and cumbersome to set up. Often times, customers get only more frustrated from participation in them, complaining about difficulty to earn points or bonuses and to redeem them. This results in a fact that most loyalty programs just don‚Äôt pay themselves off, and shut down in less than 12 months time.
