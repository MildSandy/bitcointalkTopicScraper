Two weeks of fruitful and hard work have passed. We thoroughly explore the options for opening a brewery in Belarus. We studied the laws of this country, the availability of sources of raw materials, transport component, but most importantly to meet and talk with representatives of the Belarusian business community.  After discussion and analysis of all the information gathered, the team members opinions were mixed. On the one hand, Belarus is actively developing legislation concerning the regulation cryptocurrency and everything connected with it, on the other, the legal framework in which the actions of the Belarusian business has high risks. We decided here not to talk about what kind of information we got and how things are in Belarus, but it was decided unambiguous decision not to start a business in Belarus.  Discussing with the investor the situation with Belarus, he also supported us in the decision that it is better to stay in Russia. In this connection, we began to search for a suitable site for the construction of a brewery in Moscow and the Moscow region.  There are already several interesting proposals, one of the most attractive is a land plot with a cadastral number: 50: 05: 0120214: 7   Despite the complex geometric shape, this land lot has a number of advantages: direct access to the Yaroslavl highway, proximity to high-voltage transmission lines.  Currently, we are negotiating with the owner of the land on the cost and conditions of purchase.  Sincerely, the team Satoshi Brewery!",False

Firstly, SATOSHI BREWERY - is a project from the real economy sector which has material realization of the invested funds.  Secondly, the beer production is a highly profitable and financially sustainable business around the world. The investments in the beer production generate a stable and low-risk income.  Thirdly, like the formation of the crypto-currency economy, the craft brewing is a kind of revolution in its own sphere and it gives the society a new culture and philosophy of beer consumption.  According to the results for the year 2015 in the USA and European countries the share of the craft beer amounted more than 12 % (2874 million liters – 22.3 billion US dollars). In Russia the craft beer brewing has just begun to appear and at present its share does not exceed the level of 5.5 % (436.7 million liters – 1.4 billion US dollars). Thus, the SATOSHI BREWERY project will be successful due to the following reasons: The project is carried out within a market which is not developed enough but which has a large growth potential; The minimum competition level; The high marginality level of the final product.

We answered your question literally at 2 posts above.  Quote In Russia to get a Bank loan, very difficult. Banks put stringent requirements on the borrower. The interest rate is more than 20%. Also you will need a valid business or guarantor with a good financial position. Necessarily need collateral. Its value should be 2 times more than the loan amount. As for private investors. The involvement of large investors is associated with greater risks for the team. Russia's large investors want at least 75% of the shares of the company in which to invest. This means that at some point, the founders of the project will simply lose business. Because of these complexities and the desire to be independent, we decided to attract private investment on ICO.  This question we also revealed in more detail in our blog. Link  Sincerely, team “Satoshi Brewery”",False

Firstly, SATOSHI BREWERY - is a project from the real economy sector which has material realization of the invested funds.  Secondly, the beer production is a highly profitable and financially sustainable business around the world. The investments in the beer production generate a stable and low-risk income.  Thirdly, like the formation of the crypto-currency economy, the craft brewing is a kind of revolution in its own sphere and it gives the society a new culture and philosophy of beer consumption.  According to the results for the year 2015 in the USA and European countries the share of the craft beer amounted more than 12 % (2874 million liters – 22.3 billion US dollars). In Russia the craft beer brewing has just begun to appear and at present its share does not exceed the level of 5.5 % (436.7 million liters – 1.4 billion US dollars). Thus, the SATOSHI BREWERY project will be successful due to the following reasons: The project is carried out within a market which is not developed enough but which has a large growth potential; The minimum competition level; The high marginality level of the final product.
