New tokens uniformly suffer from a barrier to liquidity, leaving holders stuck and discouraging adoption. Today, tokens must battle to be listed in exchanges and achieve relevant trade volumes to match buyers and sellers through a classic bid/ask order book. These exchanges are distributed throughout the world with various market depths and restrictions, are vulnerable to security and regulatory risks and charge increasingly higher listing fees, if they agree to list a new token at all. Liquidity is the number one challenge for a newly issued token and must be planned for in advance.  The Bancor Protocol enables continuous liquidity for tokens on smart contract blockchains such as Ethereum. These Smart Tokens are convertible for any token in the network, at a predictably calculated rate, directly on-chain. Users can always buy and sell any token in the Bancor Network with no dependency on exchanges, market makers or trade volume. Conversions do not require matching two parties to exchange or depositing tokens with another party. This allows even lightly traded tokens to be easily convertible, so token creators can focus on their product.  Twenty-eight tokens are already convertible on the Bancor Web App, and counting. Aigang is one of the newest projects to join the network. They ran a successful Token Sale last December, attracting $9 million from contributors to build a decentralized insurance blockchain protocol for IoT devices. They recently launched a proof-of-concept on the Ethereum blockchain that can detect faults or failure dates in mobile phones and pay out insurance claims to users without requiring human oversight.  https://steemit.com/bancor/@bancor-network/aix-aigang-bancor-partner-testimonial",False

It means that this bounty cannot exceed 2% of all issued tokens. If the 2% is reached, the value per stake will be recalculated.

IoT devices are currently what makes it possible. Some examples are noted in the Demo App - Smart Phone Battery, Tesla, Drones. However, we're further looking to build a unique insurance for crypto community. Currently, we think about GPU/CPU insurance for miners as it was suggested by one of community members. For now, we look into solution & whole execution of that. We'll be attending a Hackaton in Kiev this weekend and sponsor the team who manages to provide the solution for this.",False

The Aigang Network’s token sale on November 15th brings together Internet of Things devices and Autonomous Insurance, promising self-paying insurance claims on a subset of the 55 billion IoT products forecast to be produced over the next eight years. Aigang has created Proof of Concept products on the Ethereum blockchain that detect faults or failure dates (initially in mobile phones) and pay insurance claims to the user without the requirement for any human oversight. In other words, Aigang is creating an insurance DAO; a Distributed Autonomous Organisation.  The Proof of Concept app, on the Ethereum Testnet platform, has more than 7000 downloads and around 2000 smart insurance contracts have been issued. Aigang has deployed smart contracts that issue policies, conduct risk assessment and process claims. It has also deployed smart contracts that perform insurance profit calculations, create reserves and tokenise the insurance risk pool. The protocol architecture is able to integrate other insurance products.  AIX Tokenx  Members will receive Aigang AIX token rewards in return for telling whether they are bullish or bearish on particular insurance markets or products. Aigang uses a ‘proof-of-stake’/‘proof-of-reputation’ algorithm based on token ownership and an immutable reputation score stored on the blockchain. It takes into account the current weight in the prediction market, mechanics of insurance pools, the user’s proportion of total AIX tokens, and their reputation score.  As well as predictions, the AIX token will allow members to submit proposals for product improvements, making prediction markets a tool for product development. A vibrant community of smart insurance enthusiasts is critical, and we will attract those people by rewarding accurate predictions.   Aigang Protocol Layers  We aim to build a DAO Insurance Protocol on a blockchain which would enable community, companies, developers build insurance prediction markets and insurance products themselves, using our infrastructure. That’s how we see the future of blockchain insurance protocol.              As seen on Media    Partners",False
