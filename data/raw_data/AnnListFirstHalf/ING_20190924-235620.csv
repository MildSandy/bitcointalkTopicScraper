Few university‚Äôs scholars attended the meeting as well to update us with newest broad-bandwidth technologies.  Discussion involved few topics concerning our mission and ways to cooperate. The company is specialized in building satellites as well as creating telecommunication solutions.  Recently, the internet through satellite has developed more than anytime before. Technology upgrades now enable industries to have faster and a wider range internet. Applications of using satellite technologies to provide internet are limitless. While the speed is still improving everyday and the connection latency lag is being solved, satellites can provide internet connection where ground access is difficult. In remote and isolated areas, or where geographical location makes it hard for companies to provide internet access, satellites come as a first-option solution.  During the meeting, we have discussed ways to cooperate with the company to insure our WI-FI network is truly global. One of the smallest satellites, CubeSAT can be a part of the solution.  The CubeSat has a set of dimensions of 10 x 10 x 10 cm and weight of less than 1.33 kg in average. The small size satellite can be used for data transmission with comparatively lower cost.  We hope that soon we will have a cooperation where Iungo Network utilizes latest technologies to help us achieve our mission goals.

Due to meetings and appointments with potential partners, we will be posting the video in the next couple of days instead of Sunday.

These kind of projects, an example would by Cindicator, make it typically directly to an exchange like Binance. When you look a bit further in time you will see that things were quite different then, just look at Oyster Protocol when it was listed on Kucoin, it went through the roof. That is not just one example, it is also reflected in the price development of Kucoin shares. They went up faster compared to Binance Coin in December while there was a Bull Market, but have been under much more pressure since we are in the Bear Market. Also the entire ICO market has changed. While it was achievable to hit a 3-5x return for good ICO¬¥s in December, you can be lucky if you double your initial investment. Given the fact of course that you did your due diligence and research. Many recent projects that launched came out flat or are trading below ICO price.

However, we believe that a significant market sell of like we are currently enduring will result in a flight to quality.

It also serves as an essential tool for globalization and societal development that is significant in every area of individual and national development such as education, commerce, politics and the military.  Centralized servers are limited Considering how crucial Internet services are becoming and the growing demands upon service providers on a global level, it is obvious that the existing infrastructure can only be relied upon for a limited period of time. Also the centralized nature of these systems remains a form of limitation which leaves subscribers in a state of uncertainty based on what to expect from a service based on centralized control. Being run mostly by profit-oriented corporations, the limited coverage in terms of Internet service is a consequence of demography and available opportunities. This explains why most sparsely populated areas, such as small towns and villages do not enjoy good Internet services.  On the side of users, connecting through centralized servers means giving up on their rights to privacy. This is because with the existing service providers, there is no such thing as genuine neutrality.  A decentralized platform The solutions offered by Blockchain technology which enables ‚Äúanyone to be anything at any time‚Äù is being explored in the Internet service providing industry. IUNGO network and its existing partnerships enhance the availability of the Internet across several borders by taking advantage of the flexibility offered by Blockchain technology. This system involves the creation of a decentralized platform where anyone who has Internet data can function as a service provider to his immediate community by providing WiFi services. This service will enable more participation, and create an inclusive ecosystem that will increase Internet coverage even to more remote areas across the world.  A universal revenue opportunity Powered by an Ethereum based token, IUNGO presents service providers with such benefits as an additional revenue stream for individuals and businesses who elect to provide Internet services to anyone within their surroundings as they can pay using the platform‚Äôs tokens. The project is also a cost-effective venture since there will be no need for the usual physical infrastructure that is normal practice with the existing systems. Blockchain is a protocol that is not bound by geographical location. Therefore issues of coverage and Internet reach will become forgotten. More users will become engaged in the profitable venture, thereby contributing to solving the global and persistent problem of unemployment.  The IUNGO platform provides users with powerful web-based service management tools (network abuse prevention, reports, billing, alerts, captive portals, white label branding), marketing tools and also the resident Blockchain protocol ensures increased security within the service. Also, based on the direct peer-to-peer nature of transactions, there becomes a significantly reduced legal liability for corporate ‚Äúvisitor‚Äù Internet access.  A convenient and affordable service Internet users on the IUNGO platform are exposed to instant, seamless, safe and automated connectivity with hassle-free payments. Beyond these, the reduced cost of providing these services automatically implies a more affordable product for subscribers who through Blockchain technology are offered transparent accounting with a single global wallet. Internet usage, in this case, is also based on preferences in terms of price, speed, quality and reviews.  IUNGO network is currently carrying out an ICO and has already achieved its Soft Cap with more than 10 mln tokens sold to over 3,000 unique investors from every continent on earth. The network also has working MVP and is rolling out globally with a partnership to provide IUNGO hotspots at Vilnius International airport (impressive video of the Airport launch here) with more hotspots in London, Dublin, Dubai and Taiwan coming soon. Its recent partnership with Mysterium (who raised $14 mln in their May ICO) will provide the first DApp on the platform providing a VPN to all IUNGO users.  This innovation by IUNGO network is set to disrupt the Internet service providing industry, offering both individuals and organizations the opportunity to earn revenue while enabling the global growth and coverage in Internet services. They already have a community of over 5,000 passionate supporters on Telegram, a sure fire sign of a successful project indeed, making IUNGO one to watch in 2018.  https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-platform-makes-internet-service-more-private-and-affordable",False

Now that ETH has shot up from $300 to $800, to now $1200 in the past week, IUNGO's coins have shot up along side it from $0.30 to $0.8, to now $1.23, without technological advancement, milestone achievements or the actual growth/demand of the company to justify it.  Seriously, what an effing joke. Your ICO value increased 4x in value solely due to ETH's success which is in no way related to yours.  Why should I have to pay 58% more for each of your coins since last week, solely because of ETH's success?  Imagine if other companies did this: let's say the value of NFL goes up one year by 4x, so Walmart increases the price on all generic footballs by 4x; or stores around the world start only accepting crypto, but everything has a fixed crypto price, so when Bitcoin moons your starbucks coffee costs $420.

My phone provider grants me access to all of their wifi access points for example, not just in this country, which includes every household with a subscription and about 90% of public places, also worldwide at all public places, train stations, airports, capital cities etc.  So actually the project might become promising for countries and places where the internet has not spread to it's fullest yet. Because for example I got unlimited bandwidth for only a fraction of what people are supposed to invest in IUNGO, and a cellular 4G subscription with unlimited bandwidth is also readily available and affordable for literally everyone here.  So why should people invest in IUNGO?  If operational the IUNGO network can eventually fill in some unexpected gaps, it might be praised by people who love to provide for and customize their own stuff, but overthrowing the world wide web will be something entirely different. That will not happen by just building and marketering a product and raising funds. If you want to replace a system with a better one you will have to take it's place, either by conviction or by a show of strength.

They literally moved the decimal point to make the coins more scarce (far more valuable)   After discussions with the presale community on Telegram (the usual way to communicate with early investors) and Crypto experts. They DID discuss this with the investors before they made the change and the majority supported the lower supply that makes their investment FAR more valuable post ICO.    Why is bitcoin so valuable ? Because there is only 21 million coins in circulation. You should want the same thing for ING. As I can see you are an intelligent and experienced  investor you should want the total price of your investment to be worth more right?  Nobody took anything away from you , the number of ING Tokens was reduced for everyone founders , Devs, community.  Imagine you and me start a company together and it's worth 100,000 USD. We could decide to issue shares with total supply of 10,000 shares at $10 dollars per share and have 5000 shares each OR we could issue total supply of 100 shares at $1000 dollars each and keep 50 shares each.  In both scenarios we own half the company or $50,000 USD each.  Does This comparison make sense to you ?  Us presale investors got an AMAZING deal and I will make you the same offer as Del Penta- if you think you got a bad deal I'll make you an offer: please let me buy your ING and the price you paid ? Would you sell them to me? If yes, send me a PM and I will buy more at a fantastic price.  If you are not willing to put your money where your mouth is then stop taking nonsense about one of the best projects of 2017 as you are talking down your own investment (that is if you really did invest and are not a known Troll like the other guy).

I usually never reply to obvious trolls (the fast that this was your 1st post shows you created that account just to spam us) but your comment is so ridiculous that I have taken the time to respond to your comment directly.  You start by saying ""you have no idea of the technical aspects"" and that ""you are new to the crypto world"". So I would kindly ask that you read the whitepaper and reviews online and look at the experience, track record and credibility myself and the other advisor Simon Cocking have in the Technology world before you start writing illogical and poorly researched nonsense.  If you are another fake profile of Den Penta / BTC Wish then I can also see from your posting history that you are involved with another project (that I shall refrain from naming) with some kind of basic WiFi angle and you were having some difficulties with lack of communication from the Devs there. I do empathize with you if you have concerns about other projects that had a WiFi component but do kindly not project those concerns onto a project where you have zero involvement with the community and have not done your due diligence.  For comparison at IUNGO our CEO, COO, CTO, CMO, Marketing and Customer service teams ALL engage with ALL of our investors all the time across all platforms. We are speak to our investors and community in person, over skype and phone and seriously take their feedback on board.  This is a legitimate project with a real Core Team who have real LinkedIn profiles, real careers and have put their faces on camera on YouTube. You do realize that you are slandering real people in a real business and this is a civil offence in many jurisdictions?  Why would I join the team if IUNGO was not a real legitimate business?  Why would we invest in developing a working hardware and software MVP? Why would we risk our reputations when we have successful businesses and reputations to uphold in the EU, US and Dubai? It is very brave of you to talk down one of the most honest, highest potential projects of 2017 behind a fake name from behind your keyboard.  For all of us at IUNGO, this is possibly the most exciting project we have been involved in (please note I have been through an IPO with LinkedIn and opened two new offices). There is a team of over 30 people across Europe, the US and Dubai working hard and putting their blood sweat and tears into scaling the hardware, software, commercial partnerships and token ecosystem to benefit our Investors and the entrepreneurs and end users all around the world who will participate in the IUNGO economy.  I am working on this project full time because we have a noble aim- we are looking to bring internet connectivity to the 4.3 Billion people in the developing world currently not connected. More than half the worlds population are excluded from the societal, civic and economic benefits provided by the internet that we take for granted. I am personally passionate about this mission and I will not let anyone or anything get in the way.  I would strongly advise you to read some of our articles, watch the videos and check our  teams profiles on LinkedIn:  We have already hit our soft cap with 8 Million Tokens sold. Please see my LinkedIn and Medium articles and Cryptocentral interview for more context:  https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/net-neutrality-can-iungo-succeed-where-pied-piper-failed-sharkey/ https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/forgotten-4-billion-can-iungo-succeed-where-facebook-failed-sharkey/ https://medium.com/@iungo/announcing-the-iungo-token-strategy-monetary-and-fiscal-policy-b7bad789da4a https://cryptocentral.io/index.php/market-live/87-breaking-news/894-on-the-table-with-iungo-s-senior-advisor-dylan-sharkey http://www.bitcointalkradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IungoNetwork-Interview-with-Dylan-Sharkey-Final.mp3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZMcBfiDjVQ  I think after listening and reading you will understand my sincerity about our work here. I would love to welcome to you to our Telegram to chat with some of the community members about the project and their experiences. I would also love to meet you personally for a beer at on of our global meetups if you are near a major city. There is too much negativity in the world already so instead of trying to hurt another project because you fear it may be a competitor for something you invested in lets put our heads together and brainstorm on ways to make both projects better- perhaps there are synergies that could be unlocked through dialogue.

All the Presale investors (myself included) were informed that they were reducing the total supply of ING Tokens based on feedback from experts abd the community. The important  thing is that the % ownership of the Total supply of ING remains the same and the nice 3x bonus remains the same compared to the full price at end of the ICO.  Overall the reduction in the total supply of ING is good for ALL investors as it increases scarcity of the coin. The devs  are super honest and will burn anything unsold. This is a legit project and I recommend you come to the telegram group and talk to the dedicated 24 hour customer support team they have working there to clarify any other questions.  You can find the telegram link on page one. It's a serious , honest and helpfull community of people who want to spread wifi to the 4.3 Billion people in the developing world so I look forwards to see you there! Where are you from by the way ?  Edit: Den, I see you say you have invested 1ETH in pre ICO? Congrats ! You have got an excellent bonus and will have 3x more ING in terms of ETH than people buying at the end of the ICO. If you are an investor I am suprised you have not come to the telegram channel to get the answer to your questions there - you can even PM the devs like Paulius or the earlier investors like Berry and they can explain all the details of your token. Basically you have got the best possible deal in one of the highest potential and most honest ICOs in 2017.

I can see from your writing that you are an educated gentleman and not a troll or a shill (I hope!) for another WiFi project so I will give you the benefit or the doubt that you did not do your research before you commented.  The reduction in total supply was agreed in consultation with our presale participants, community and adviors. Anyone with a rudimentary understand of token economics realizes that increased scarcity of supply with higher % ownership for early investors is a net positive for everyone in the ecosystem so we were able to come to a multilateral decision.  I can also see from your posting history that you are involved with another project (that I shall refrain from naming) with some kind of basic WiFi angle and you were having some difficulties with lack of communication from the Devs there. I do empathize with you if you have concerns about other projects that had a WiFi component but do kindly not project those concerns onto a project where you have zero involvement with the community and have not done your due diligence.  For comparison at IUNGO our CEO, COO, CTO, CMO, Marketing and Customer service teams ALL engage with ALL of our investors all the time across all platforms. We are speak to our investors and community in person, over skype and phone and seriously take their feedback on board.  This is a legitimate project with a real Core Team who have real LinkedIn profiles, real careers and have put their faces on camera on YouTube. You do realize that you are slandering real people in a real business and this is libel in many jurisdictions?  Why would I join the team if IUNGO was not a real legitimate business?  Why would we invest in developing a working hardware and software MVP? Why would we risk our reputations when we have successful businesses and reputations to uphold in the EU, US and Dubai? It is very brave of you to talk down one of the most honest, highest potential projects of 2017 behind a fake name from behind your keyboard.  For all of us at IUNGO, this is possibly the most exciting project we have been involved in (please note I have been through an IPO with LinkedIn and opened two new offices). There is a team of over 30 people across Europe, the US and Dubai working hard and putting their blood sweat and tears into scaling the hardware, software, commercial partnerships and token ecosystem to benefit our Investors and the entrepreneurs and end users all around the world who will participate in the IUNGO economy.  I am working on this project full time because we have a noble aim- we are looking to bring internet connectivity to the 4.3 Billion people in the developing world currently not connected. More than half the worlds population are excluded from the societal, civic and economic benefits provided by the internet that we take for granted. I am personally passionate about this mission and I will not let anyone or anything get in the way.  I would strongly advise you to read some of our articles, watch the videos and check our  teams profiles on LinkedIn:  Please see my LinkedIn and Medium articles and Cryptocentral interview and Bitcoin Talk Radio audio interview for more context:  https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/forgotten-4-billion-can-iungo-succeed-where-facebook-failed-sharkey/ https://medium.com/@iungo/announcing-the-iungo-token-strategy-monetary-and-fiscal-policy-b7bad789da4a https://cryptocentral.io/index.php/market-live/87-breaking-news/894-on-the-table-with-iungo-s-senior-advisor-dylan-sharkey http://www.bitcointalkradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IungoNetwork-Interview-with-Dylan-Sharkey-Final.mp3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZMcBfiDjVQ  I think after listening and reading you will understand my sincerity about our work here. I would love to welcome to you to our Telegram to chat with some of the community members about the project and their experiences. I would also love to meet you personally for a beer at on of our global meetups if you are near a major city. There is too much negativity in the world already so instead of trying to hurt another project because you fear it may be a competitor for something you  invested in lets put our heads together and brainstorm on ways to make both projects better- perhaps there are synergies that could be unlocked through dialogue.  Failing that, feel free to connect with me directly on LinkedIn and we can take the conversation offline: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylansharkey/  Best regards, Dylan   [/quote]  After reading this entire thread and seeing Den_Panda's interaction.. the farcity of the pre-sale being sold out with false lump sum payments. The changes on terms and conditions after presale.  This seems just to be a clone of WiC or WiFI-Globalized... hopping on the band wagon and doing a shit job at that. Most of it seems to be a copy-and paste of each combined...  Presale stages just like WIC with ""high ROI"" guaranteed after ICO based on pricing stages...  I agree with Den_Panda here this one screams stay away. [/quote]",False

Already this makes iungo unique.   In terms of the value I highly recommend you read the white paper but they have also summarized it well here:   At a very high level, Iungo provides society with ubiquitous and seamless internet access through a distributed global network, built upon a swarm of  wifi hotspots.  Business of all sizes, city municipalities and homes can generate additional revenue by providing bandwidth to the Iungo network. Cafes, restaurants and retail outlets through to hotels, corporate campuses, public spaces and concert venues can begin sharing effortlessly with the plug and play Iungo solution. Even individuals on the move can earn by providing bandwidth to the IUNGO Network from their mobile phone whether at the airport, beach, or a city park.  Behind the scenes a distributed network of service gateways takes care of all payments and administrative aspects.  This multitude of interactions creates a competitive, free market, highly liquid token based economy where providers are incentivised to contribute bandwidth at a very low cost and often free of charge.  This benefits the contemporary consumer: a modern generation of travelling professionals, tourists, digital nomads and anyone on the move who all expect fast, hassle free, unlimited  internet access at a low cost wherever in the world they are.
