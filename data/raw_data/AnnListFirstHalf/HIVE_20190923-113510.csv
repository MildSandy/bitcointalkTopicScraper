We sincerely appreciate your support. Our second Initial Loan Procurement has ended. We have raised 867,534 euros, comparing a hard cap at 6.75 million euros. Please see the link below for details:  https://blog.blockhive.ee/second-ilp-and-our-plans-going-forward-399750ff20c5  Going forward  Here are our plans now that our public ILP is over:  First, we will spend more time speaking with some of the exchanges to get our tokens listed.  Two, while we were on the road, some accredited investors have shown interests in joining our ILP. Since ensuring the liquidity of Hive tokens is a priority for us and that is also behind the design of Future Loan Access Tokens, we would like to open up our ILP to accredited investors who can invest more than 100,000 euros in blockhive’s ILP.  We will make the remaining 5.8 million euros from our second ILP available for accredited investors. Due to the time needed for due diligence, some of these investments may take time to be realized. Therefore, we plan to conclude the activity by the end of the year.  Thank you for your support.  Best,  The blockhive team",False

We also incubate projects that have the potential to benefit from blockchain technology.  That is where our name blockhive originated. Like bees in a beehive, we are building a platform where each participant can work together. By joining forces, every partner in this digital ecosystem will thrive, using the blockchain technology.  Based in Estonia with roots in Japan, our team of programmers, engineers, designers, mining experts, and financial specialists has a diverse and multicultural background. We work alongside natural-language-processing scientists through our partnership with Tokyo-based artificial intelligence company IMAY, as well as the founding team from Agrello, an Estonia-based legal technology startup. blockhive and its partners share the goal of making technology work for the people.   Our Strategy  blockhive works with partners to design their blockchain strategy, and jointly develops projects with them. No fees are charged. Instead, revenue from the projects is shared between blockhive and its partners.     Our Projects   Our Strategic Partners   Our Supporters    Initial Loan Procurement  Loan Agreement  blockhive will raise fund using a new structure it developed jointly with Agrello, called Initial Loan Procurement (“ILP""). The legally binding loan agreement involves the issuance of Future Loan Access Tokens (“FLAT”), which give Creditors who provided lending to the company the ability to trade their rights with others.    “FLAT” Future Loan Access Token  blockhive plans to issue the first FLAT we call Hive tokens. Once creditors enter a loan agreement with blockhive through ILP, they receive Hive tokens.   What is HIVE token?  Hive token allows creditors to enter into a loan agreement with blockhive and to trade their contracts with others.  Upon concluding the loan agreement through smart contact, creditors are entitled to receive, as interest on the loan, 20 percent of the annual operating profits generated by blockhive from the platform. This has the potential to increase as blockhive incubates more projects.

That enables borrowers to use money raised more efficiently. The ILP structure also holds borrowers accountable with the money they raise because they will have to pay back at the maturity.
