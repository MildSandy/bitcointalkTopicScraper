The new year is here. After the whirlwind of progress the Po.et team made in 2018, it was time for everyone to take a much deserved break over the holidays. Now, we’re back and ready to take on 2019 with renewed energy. Suffice to say, there’s been a lot of planning for the next 12 months going on around here. We’ve been focusing a lot on what the technical implementations we want to implement are going to look like and how those efforts will be supported, both by marketing and the community. As always, your involvement is key to everything we do and makes all the intense work worth it.  And speaking of community, you might remember Brian Isbell, who created an Alexa command which stamps anything onto the Po.et protocol. He’s now enabled a publishing feature on The Musicians Community which now allows members to publish their musician profile and creative writings to the Po.et network. You can see the demo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMHlNjnESEM. This sort of innovation is why we continue to build Po.et to enable the future of creative products into the ecosystem.  We love seeing all the ways the community is utilizing Po.et and finding new solutions for attribution issues that have typically plagued content creators. Keep them coming.  From an awareness standpoint, I stopped by to be a guest on  Anthony Pompliano's amazing podcast, ""Off the Chain” on Monday, which should be available to listen to very soon. Watch our Twitter and Telegram for that.  Community and growth are at the heart of our plan for this year. We’re really head down right now ensuring that we are not only effective in the way we grow and scale, but also thoughtful. It’s essential that Po.et reaches wider adoption so we can grow our library of content and claims. You have all been so instrumental in helping us achieve wider notoriety and we appreciate having such an incredible group of advocates behind us. I know the entire Po.et team is excited for this year and looking forward to what comes next. Stay tuned!",False

Last week was a monumental moment in Po.et history: we launched on Bitcoin mainnet. As I mentioned in my “Mainnet Means Maturity” post, success for Po.et is defined as growth in the usage of everything we build. We don’t want to put in artificial and unnecessary barriers to bringing increased value to your applications, projects and content. We want to be extremely mindful of the incentives we create and the culture we build, while quickly modeling and exploring what those incentives should look like. Therefore, success is really measured in maturity and how much people trust the protocols and applications we’re all in charge of building through Po.et.  That time has arrived. We are here and we are excited. Now it’s time to move forward.  This is the last time you’ll hear me use the word “mainnet” as a milestone indicator. We achieved it, and now it is in the past (stamped on the Po.et Network). The future is about adoption, collaboration and utility to the protocol and that’s where 100% of the team’s efforts are going: Making blockchain, and the Po.et protocol an applicable value to the entire world.  When we set out to build Po.et, we wanted to make blockchain technology accessible and valuable to everyone. This comes from the incentives and overall motivations for the community and 0ur partners to build the next wave of applications for the better web. Po.et is broad by design, in that we believe that the future products built on the protocol will be built outside of the core development team. Our commitment is to maintain and strengthen the foundations set for everyone to structure on top of. And now the protocol is open for you all to build upon.  It took little time for someone to get started. Just today, Bryan Isbell of the Po.et community created an Alexa hook so that anyone can vocally stamp proof of existence on the Po.et Network. See here: https://twitter.com/jarroddicker/status/1070385716172066816. It’s an incredible use of the technology and Bryan continues to be one of the leading innovators in our space.  Over the next few weeks, there will be more activity and work being done on top of the protocol as well as partnerships to help fuel move this effort forward (more to come on that soon). We’re going to keep this brief, as we have a lot in the works and more to share with you soon. In the meantime, start building; we’re here to support and will be grinding away on new applications to push forward with the rest of this incredible community.  Let’s go POE.",False

In case you hadn’t heard, we solidified a monumental partnership with New York Media, publishers of New York Magazine, Vulture, The Cut, and Slate (amongst many others). Po.et will be integrated into the company’s Clay Publishing Platform. Clay is a perfect match for Po.et. It’s already powered by open-source software, ready for mobile-first, publish anywhere websites that need to support complex monetization strategies, and is making new technologies accessible to a new class of publishers. We expect the platform to begin integrating with Po.et’s functionalities in early 2019. You can read more about it on our blog: https://blog.po.et/po-et-is-coming-to-new-york-medias-clay-publishing-platform-303264105dda  New York Media isn’t all we’re excited about though—we’re already looking forward to 2019. The opportunities to spread the word about all the great work we’re doing at Po.et continue to come; At the end of January, we will be sponsoring DCN’s Digital Content Next Summit in Orlando. It’s a great opportunity for us to come together with senior-level digital executives in order to facilitate conversations which will ultimately drive the business of media forward.  Following DCN, I’ll be jetting off to Austin to speak with Sara Fischer from Axios at SXSW. With so many legacy media organizations still tied to outdated technology and infrastructure, we’ll be exploring blockchain’s role in empowering journalists and creators to realize the true value of the content they produce. It’s going to be a great event.  As we wrap up the year, it’s incredible to look back on everything the Po.et team has achieved. But, more than looking back, it’s equally as important to look forward. Now that we’ve moved to mainnet, we will be focusing heavily on getting contributors and community products built on our protocol. We’re devoted to ensuring Po.et is open and accessible for all and it’s our mission to give everyone the tools they need to be successful. We value each and every member of our community and without you, we wouldn’t be where we are today. We’re thrilled to see what the new year brings and are excited to have you along for the ride.

I’m on the road connecting with partners, innovators and blockchain evangelists all over the APAC region to dig deeper on Po.et and the value it brings to the entire ecosystem. The goal of this trip is to emphasize the impact of Po.et today and deepen its footprint through Asia and Australia. We will highlight how far we’ve come but most importantly, where we plan on going.  Yesterday, we had a meetup in Shanghai, which had an overwhelmingly successful turn-out with our friends, fans and the Shanghai blockchain community— it was standing room only, with over 300 sign ups/attendees. It was humbling to see such enthusiasm from our Chinese community and the event was one for the Po.et archives. I keynoted on the value of Po.et, and how blockchain is set to impact media for the better. It was followed by a panel session with members of BTC Media, U Network, Sanyan Blockchain and Awakennews.  Today, I spoke at the Wanxiang Blockchain Labs alongside BTC Media CEO David Bailey to a crowd of 1000+. We discussed a subject we touch on quite often: blockchain and the power it will have to influence the media. David is the CEO of BTC Inc., the company that owns Bitcoin Magazine and Distributed among others. We were the sole presenters on the topic of media at China’s largest blockchain event of the year (4th annual). Tonight we have partnership meetings and events for the Po.et project and then I’m off to Australia.  Our very own David Turner is heading to Austin this week to represent Po.et at the 2018 ONA Conference. Media producers globally are at a crossroads, where everyone is seeking a new funding model for journalism. Dave’s session is designed specifically to spread the word about Po.et word while offering new ideas around revenue models and the ways that blockchain technology can power the media – and web – of the future. He will be joined by Vivian Schiller of Civil and David Cohn of Advance.  What do we discuss at these events and why is Po.et asked to be the project that best represents media in the blockchain space?  We talk a lot about revenue models in media and I’m constantly being asked “why media”, ""why add in blockchain” and “why now”. I thought it would be a good opportunity to recap my thoughts on blockchain, journalism and value on the web. After all, these are things I am asked about everyday. We’ve been told over and over media is dying. What if it isn’t “dying”, but just changing — and we have the opportunity to not only frame the conversation of how media and content should be valued, but also actively shape the business models of the future? That is a powerful place to be.  ""In order to force something new, to force change, maybe what we need is for all of the elements of the current journalism business model to weaken. Perhaps once revenue and growth channels for media and journalism reach a tipping point of being under immense stress, it will drive a new way of thinking. A new way of collaborating. And a new way of sustaining.”  It’s difficult to create new revenue streams and often times, companies are reluctant to reinvent the wheel – even if that wheel is mediocre, at best. At Po.et, we believe in a world in which good journalism and creative can come together and make for good business.  You can read more of my thoughts on media and journalistic value on the web in our most recent blog post:  https://blog.po.et/the-media-resurrection-blockchain-journalism-and-value-on-the-web-1cb9e55beb5e  After today, I’ll be jetting off to Sydney to discuss all of these ideas at the INFORM News Media Summit, APAC’s annual gathering of news media leaders.

It’s time for another weekly update:  We’re firing on all cylinders over here so this week’s update is going to be delivered the way I speak; fast & bulleted. Hold your breath and let’s go:   The past few weeks presented several important opportunities for educating stakeholders in media, journalism, advertising and beyond about what Po.et is doing and how our platform intersects with their industries. This is a critical component of the work we’re doing at Po.et; we are building something most of the world doesn’t know they need yet. So it takes the work of not just constructing the protocol but educating on it as well.   Here’s a recap of our recent activity, along with information about where you can see the Po.et project next.   RightsTech Summit  Friday, October 5, I was at the RightsTech Summit in New York City. Dicker participated in a discussion titled “Crypto, Code and Copyrights,” where I spoke alongside representatives from the media and music industries.   The discussion focused on the ways in which blockchain technology is reshaping ownership and payment structures for digital rights -- and the extent to which cryptocurrency and AI will improve the rights market in the long term.   My contributions to the discussion drew on past experiences at digital platforms like the Huffington Post, and how they informed my perspectives on blockchain and how blockchain technology can create new types of incentive and rewards mechanisms, especially in the journalism industry.   You can catch a recording of the talk here.   Breaker Interview   I also had an opportunity to discuss Po.et with Breaker, a magazine that focuses on the crypto industry writ large.   The interview provided a chance to explain to a crypto-focused audience what Po.et is -- and what it isn’t. (Short answer: Po.et’s mission is not to “police the web”; it’s to create a “nutrition label” for online content in order to help people learn the facts about content that they encounter on the web.)   You can read the interview -- and learn how Po.et just might one day help someone monetize tweets -- here. These are huge opportunities and ideas that transcend Po.et into industries beyond imagination. All we have to do it build the roads to get there.   Reputation on the Modern Web   In addition to speaking and the above interviews, I spent part of early October writing. My article “Reputation in Web3” was published by Token Daily at the beginning of this month.   In the piece, I discuss the challenge of reputation on the modern web -- a challenge that starts with defining what reputation even means in a global sense. He argues that in the web (and media industry in general) of the future, reputation will become the primary driver of value. We’ll consequently see “a monolithic shift in the opportunity for creators and the restraints of the companies that are currently working as hard as possible to best represent them,” he writes.   Speaking to Students  Last but not least, I also had a chance to speak to students about Po.et at the Studio One: Innovation in Media Class. Here’s the proof.   What’s next?   See Po.et at Elevate Blockchain  If you’re in New York on October 17, come join me and other amazing speakers for Adweek’s Elevate Blockchain event. Find details here.   We will have updates to main net and our progress in the engineering report coming soon. We’re very close, and will have collateral explaining how best to prepare (whether a developer, creator or spectator) for full use and opportunity shortly. The marketing team is heads down building documentation and collateral for everyone to use and weigh in on.   Ok, back to work. We can breathe again.   JD",False

Many blockchain projects are often challenged by whether they can solve an existing problem and if so, why that solution can’t be done with another technology.  This is similar to arguing whether you should fly or drive to a destination. There are variants and factors that enable you to achieve your goal by getting from one place to another. And those variants can be satisfied via automobile or via plane, both bringing different values as well as challenges towards reaching the end goal. There isn’t a right or wrong. The decisions are relative based on a specific need. But these decisions aren’t the end of the road; they’re the bridge to what’s next. And that’s why they warrant our attention.  If we’re looking to solve an acute problem, we shouldn’t be just looking at how to solve for existing conditions, we should look to challenge how those conditions came about in the first place. The greatest technologies question behaviors. It’s not about solving a specific problem but questioning the behaviors that brought us there in the first place. It’s not just technical, it’s cultural. New ways of “doing” shouldn’t be applied to old ways of thinking, however, innovation is often judged by the problems it solves, not the behaviors it creates. And that’s backwards. Often times products fail because they’re solving problems without questioning behaviors. If we can change behaviors, we can change, and solve the problems.  A solution in search of a problem is a good thing. Its core incentive is not to provide a solution for a problem rendered by an existing behavior. Its incentive is to create an entirely new behavior, thus creating entirely new problems. That's how change happens.  At Po.et, we are rethinking the creative process at large. What does it mean to own your ideas? How do you build value and reputation around the work that you do? If there are new models for rewards, new models for funding and new models of acknowledgement for individuals, then everything inside and outside of the process can be rewritten as well. To best understand how to drive value, we must listen and build tools for opportunities that individuals see, feel and breathe.  Behavior follows culture. Culture follows incentives. Change the incentives, change the culture.  Now to the good stuff. Here’s a recap of what the Po.et project has been up to recently.   Engineering Updates  First of all, I’d like to draw attention to the Po.et engineering strides in the most recent progress report. There are a number of items to highlight, including:  The implementation of batch claiming, an important feature for allowing Po.et to scale and process large numbers of claims at once. A redesign of claim structures that ensures forward-compatibility over the long term. A lot of bug squashing. The most notable achievement on this front is the fixing of bugs that caused problems in some cases for claims that dealt with foreign language content. We want everyone, everywhere to be able to use Po.et reliably, and the fixing of this bug helps ensure that they can. The completion of a security self-assessment and a code quality checkup by the Po.et engineering team. Software security and quality are also a core part of our mission, and we want to ensure that we’re taking steps as Po.et evolves to keep our code as clean and secure as we reasonably can.  With this work out of the way, the engineering team is transitioning from creating new features to testing and debugging those features. As reported, the team is putting the final touches on the Po.et mainnet release. We are excited to share more with the community soon.   “Blockchain in Journalism” Panel at Columbia  Last week, I took part in the “Blockchain in Journalism: Promise and Practice” event at Columbia University’s Journalism School in New York. The discussion allowed me to raise some important points about the current state of the media and journalism industries and how blockchain can help it.  Part of the solution, as I explained, is to use the blockchain and tokens to do a better job of showing readers the value of journalism that is produced. By using decentralized networks of token holders to validate information, we can prove to readers that what we say is accurate, and give them a more compelling reason to pay for subscriptions.  You can catch the full discussion (along with the rest of the event) in this video recording.   Adweek Elevate  I also spoke last week at the Adweek Elevate: Blockchain event. The discussion presented another opportunity to connect with stakeholders in the advertising and media industry and help them understand how Po.et can improve what they do.  Here’s a short clip that gives you the Cliff Notes version of what we discussed at Elevate.   RightsTechSummit  In yet another recent stop on the conference circuit, I spoke at RightsTechSummit at the New York Media Festival about how blockchain impacts licensing and intellectual property rights.   Hackernoon Article  Po.et was called out (in a good way) this month by Sam Radocchia in an article on Hackernoon. Sam wrote about the challenges that data collection currently poses, and how blockchain can help us shift toward a culture where people have more control over how their data is used. Blockchain will not only help to offer consumers the choice of opting into data collection, but will also provide them new incentives for allow their data to be collected.  Sam mentioned Po.et as an example of a platform that uses the blockchain to “reconcile content creation with a fairer, more transparent system for attribution and compensation” and to create immutable records of proof of existence.  There is a lot coming up. If you happen to be at DevCon next week, please make sure to find our head of product, David Turner.  Until next time.  JD",False

Why does this matter?  There are many blockers on the road to widespread blockchain adoption. These blockers are heavily covered and critiqued and normal to any consumer application success. They include design and storage. And, by far the most discussed in the blockchain space, the blockers include scale. As we edge closer to the end of 2018, we are seeing the first batch of scalable blockchain apps launched using technology like transaction batching, lightning network, plasma and so on. As of today, Po.et will be among the first scalable blockchain solutions in this space.  The mechanics of the Bitcoin blockchain restrict the number of claims we can hash to the blockchain. Po.et is the decentralized protocol suite for ownership, discovery and monetization of content. That means we need to be prepared to handle a volume of content and information never seen before on chain. Of course, this can't be done in five to seven transactions per second increments. We need to do better and build a solution that works for all if we want to be the protocol for the world's creative assets.  Talking to Eric Elliott, our VP of engineering, he explained that now with claim batching implemented, we can batch an unlimited number of claims per bitcoin transaction, which gives us virtually unlimited claim processing bandwidth. Need to hash 100,000 claims per second? We can make that work. This is huge not just for Po.et, but the industry at large. We are building bridges, not moats. There are no competitors, just collaborators. And Po.et is bringing a function to market that enables potential for real scale and real adoption.  These are the innovations and investments needed to bring Po.et and other blockchain projects to the masses. These second-layer solutions like batching and payment channels strengthen the core value to make these products, technologies and feature-sets things that the entire world will use.  With Po.et's new claim-batching solution, we will be able to handle the volume that comes with creative works at scale. We will now be able to open the door to all media companies, all agencies, all artists and all creators. ALL. No restrictions. This means millions of users writing millions of claims. This is true value for everyone. This is the future of scalable blockchains.  Our road to mainnet has been an exciting journey and this huge milestone by our engineering team is a major step toward launch. There are more git commits, documentations, pushes and pulls than ever before in Po.et's history. And this is just the beginning.

I described last week why that is important (https://blog.po.et/scaling-po-et-to-millions-of-users-75b01b95e4f1) and Eric published a piece (https://blog.po.et/scaling-blockchain-cc6db2f88a48) yesterday that goes into how it works, how it builds value and how Po.et will be one of the first (if not THE first) protocols to batch claims to the Bitcoin blockchain at scale.  Claims are critical to our mission. It is technically how we're building a verifiable system for Web 3.0 and, ultimately, it is the core value of the Po.et protocol. So, knowing that, it needs to scale. So how does batching work? In Eric's words:  ""A publisher (which is you!) creates and signs a claim, which gets hashed — a hash is like a unique fingerprint for some given content — and placed into a batch by a Po.et Node. That batch is itself hashed, and submitted to the Bitcoin blockchain. When the batch is confirmed (which could take some time — Bitcoin mines a new block about once every ten minutes), other Po.et Nodes detect the new batch hash, locate the batch, and verify the claims it contains.""  This is how we build reputation on the Po.et protocol. And being the protocol for the world's creative assets (yes, the entire world) means scale is critical to our success. We need to support reputation for all. And this problem is solved. How? Again, take it away Eric!  ""Recently, Po.et has been talking about providing a nutritional label for content. What does that mean?  Verifiable claims are claims that are cryptographically signed by their creators (called issuers). Anybody can issue a claim about content on Po.et, but they must digitally sign it with a private key and then the claim and the signature get bundled together in a JSON-LD document and anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain, which proves that a claim existed at the time the block was mined.  On its own, a claim that you own a particular creative work may not be very interesting. For example, I could claim that I wrote ‘Moby Dick,’ but anybody familiar with ‘Moby Dick’ would know that claim is false. A claim is not a fact. It is only evidence.  Such a claim would not stand up for long on the Po.et Network, because on Po.et, people can make claims about claims, so there’s a good chance I’d get called out.  All the claims about a particular work get aggregated together into a unified view of the work called an entity. That entity is the sum of all claims made about something that has a representation on the Po.et Network.  All of the claims I make and all of the claims about those claims get aggregated together into a holistic view of the content I post, and what the Po.et ecosystem thinks about the claims I make. Over time, that builds verifiable reputation.  The aggregation of claims about a particular piece of content (including the reputation of the creator) can act like a nutritional label for content. It tells you something about how trustworthy (or not trustworthy) that content is.  The Po.et team sees a future in which all content has that nutritional label, and when you aggregate and sort content based on how healthy it is to consume, the result is a better, more trustworthy web where good actors are rewarded for creating good content, and where lies are difficult and expensive to maintain.  The result of all this is that every time you post an image of a beautiful sunset on your favorite social network, the Po.et Network could pick it up, verify that you’re the owner, and then more claims can be made about it, like ‘it’s beautiful,’ or ‘it’s a sunset,’ or it fits a ‘relaxing mood.’  So if Po.et users post 1 million sunset photos per day, that could generate 3 million claims about them. Those claims could help media organizations discover and license content for articles or broadcasts, help a publisher find and license content for a book cover, or help ad networks identify and block inappropriate content. (But who doesn’t like sunsets?)  Virtually every crypto or decentralized app project is going to have to contend with the problem of scalability. If you’re relying on the Po.et Network, don’t sweat it.""  So in short, we have you covered.

We are building the decentralized protocol for all information ownership, discovery and monetization. The protocol must acknowledge, structure and prepare for usage and value by creators across the entire world. That is why we’re heading to China.   The media and publishing industries in China, like its counterparts around the globe, are hungry for new ways of distributing information. The value of blockchain, specifically claims, will build new ways to confirm the authenticity of sources, collaborating and achieving greater levels of transparency and expose the most important information for consumers and creators alike. These are all things that Po.et will help achieve.   In two weeks, I’ll be attending Shanghai International Blockchain Week (September 11-12), where I’ll have the chance to meet with representatives, blockchain companies, potential partners, the local community and Po.et team to educate more on how Po.et can help grow and strengthen the publishing and media industries in China with the goal of applying those learnings to other countries and regions.   While I’m there, on September 11, I’ll also be giving a keynote fireside chat with BTC Media CEO David Bailey at the 4th annual Global Blockchain Summit presented by China blockchain leader Wanxiang Group. If you can’t make that event but will be in Shanghai, be sure to catch me and the local Po.et team at a meet-up on the evening of September 10. We’ll focus on Po.et’s tech development and the implications of blockchain applications in media and publishing. Details of the location and timing will be shared shortly.   And if being in Australia fits your schedule better than China, you can also hear me speak during the afternoon session of the INFORM 2018 News Media Summit in Sydney on September 14. It is in essential event for advertising and media professionals who either work with or within news media brands and is expected to attract more than 400 delegates.   Dave Turner, our head of product, will be in Austin, Texas, September 13-15 speaking at the Online News Association’s annual ONA18 conference, which will bring more than 2,500 of the best and brightest digital journalists, educators and technologists together.   Now the good stuff.   Engineering Progress   While I’ve been busy preparing for our engagements in China and Australia, Po.et engineers have been making steady progress toward the Po.et mainnet release. I’d like to take a moment to call out some of their major recent achievements.   Our latest, greatest milestone – and it is a significant one – is the implementation of claim batching. For those of you not versed in technical terminology, here’s what claim batching means, as explained by Po.et VP of Engineering Eric Elliott:   Our ability to process large volumes of data on the Po.et Network will no longer be limited by severe scalability limitations of the Bitcoin blockchain. If a big media publisher needs to process 100,000 claims per second, we can make that work.   To put it another way: Po.et will now be able to process as many claims per second as users need, virtually without limit. This is a big deal, because if you know anything about blockchain technology, you’re aware that scalability limitations in the major public blockchains – because they can only process a relatively small number of transactions at once – have long been a thorn in the side of many blockchain software platforms. They won’t be for Po.et.   Beyond claim batching, I’m happy to report that overall, progress toward completion of mainnet nears 80% and all of our work towards features, partnerships and documentation are progressing.

This is a common and, in fact, fair question, especially as Po.et is an emerging technology in a new space. But what's amazing about this space (that is, the blockchain and crypto space) is that it's not about competition, it's about collaboration.  At Po.et, we're paving a two-way street; the opportunity to leverage Po.et's technology on-platform and off- as well. We are building a web of interoperability, a web of collaboration. And many in this space agree, which is why this isn't a rat race to the bottom, it's a cooperative climb to the top. We win when we all get there. And the early foundations of Po.et will be the stepping stones not just for our marketplace and reputation signals, but for many who are building on Web 3.0 at large.  We believe in transparency. That's why we're building on a blockchain and that's why the incentives tied to crypto economics are critical to its overall success. But you don't NEED a blockchain for  transparency — this is true. However, we do NEED a blockchain for dynamics tied to transparency in order to reveal a decentralized consensus on information. What does a universal immutable ledger of all of the world’s information look like? How do we move beyond basic categorical means to find the most informative and most important? That is driven by decentralized transparency that moves towards the overall notion of reputation. But how do we measure that?  Today, many question what is true and what  is not true. This isn't something that's necessarily great for society, especially for the media and journalism business, but it's the world we live in. Now, more than ever, it's important to have third-party verification for transparency to expose the information behind the information. We are no longer comfortable letting the fox guard the henhouse and those who practice ethical creative standards believe in working toward a transparent system that shows not just the results of their work, but the effort that they put into it. There is much we can learn from these standards, and build a system of exposure based on this set of criteria that is exposed to consumers. How can we, together, build a default list of behaviors that is exposed to a consumer in order to reveal the ingredients that go into a work? It’s not black and white. But like everything else we consume, the more information around its components the better.  This is what we're building at Po.et; the nutritional label for the web.  We want to put value back on the effort and not the results. In media specifically, the definition of success is predominantly on the results. How viral did a story go? Did it drive acquisitions? Did a consumer come in through this story and go elsewhere? However, the value of the creator and the brand is the reason why a consumer engages a work in the first place. The very thing we can’t yet identify and reveal is the real value of a work. So what are the key components that would help reveal the efforts and value that go into a work? This can be a written word, or a piece of music or art; basically, anything valued and tied to a creator's IP. I asked Twitter what it thought some signals should be as it pertains to journalism and the responses were interesting.  Some recommendations included:  1) Time spent  2) Number of sources  3) Fact check/accuracy percentage  4) Number of verified source claims  5) Hosting brand and URL  6) Investors  7) Updates/changes  Author & Author History  & more  You can see the entirety of the conversation here: https://twitter.com/jarroddicker/status/1021383017317781505. What's clear is that we know that there is value in a creator's work. And we recognize what ""premium"" is but we, as consumers, don't actually see what ""premium"" is. What if there was a way to expose the efforts in premium and put the value on that input instead of the output?  Premium is what happens before a creator hits publish.  Enter Po.et.  As you know, we have spent the past few months building toward mainnet and updating features to support attribution, claim types, search and discovery and more. You can dive deeper into Eric's update  here: https://blog.po.et/july-2018-po-et-engineering-progress-report-ead91299140c. These protocol-level implementations will enable creators of every capacity to leverage the products being built on the Po.et platform as well as those companies leveraging the protocol for their own operations in different sectors of the space. These features will benefit consumers in a variety of ways but the biggest component of the works will be its effort and utility toward reputation. How can we drive beyond a web of recency and relevancy and into the new world of reputation? I obsess over this, and to save us all time I'll just link to the latest blog post coverage of our development of a bridge to a better web: https://blog.po.et/building-the-bridge-to-a-better-web-e2c257e475a5.  What else? We're rounding out alpha partnerships and edging closer toward a mainnet release. We spent the last three weeks in Nashville, San Francisco, Philadelphia and Washington D.C. meeting with top media and agency executives about Po.et. We're keynoting Turner Broadcasting's executive event on blockchain technology today, joining Comcast's Techstars Mentorship on Friday and finalizing plans for the alpha launch next week.  As always, please follow our progress on GitHub, Telegram, Twitter and everywhere else. We're screaming from the rafters so you all can hear us.",False

The announcement was covered in various trades (pasted at bottom for reference) and highlighted one key component of Po.et's strategic focus; to enable and attract new and existing companies to build on top of the Po.et protocol. Today, the first POEDL partner Inkrypt made a major announcement with their application nLIGHTn. I've pasted it below for all to see:  ""Back in May, we launched Po.et Development Labs as a way to support projects that believe in Po.et’s vision and expand the number of ways to engage with content on the Po.et Network. Inkrypt, the first project to be welcomed into Development Labs, is building a distributed media-hosting platform focused on providing journalism around the world with censorship resistance. Inkrypt seeks to create a comprehensive media ecosystem for Web 3.0 by becoming a one-stop shop for content aggregation and distribution and by partnering with synergistic protocols like Po.et for service integrations such as cryptographic content attribution and licensing.  Inkrypt’s mission is to not only eliminate the single-to-few points of failure in media hosting and devolve the deep concentrations of network power that currently acquiesce to or are subverted by malicious actors who seek to manipulate the flow of information, but also to create a journalist-led governance model to monitor content in an ethical fashion.  As part of its greater effort to empower publishers and make journalism truly free, Inkrypt is launching its very first product offering, nLightn, which is a decentralized application for journalistic publishing that combines a peer-to-peer, encrypted storage protocol with an anonymity overlay that ensures comprehensive front- to back-end censorship resistance. The Harvard-based team conducted the very first live demo of the DApp on July 19, 2018, at the Distributed 2018 conference in San Francisco.  In the coming weeks, the Inkrypt team will deploy nLightn with freelance and citizen journalists in censorship-prone geographies, such as Syria, Iraq, Pakistan and Turkey.  We’re thrilled to have Inkrypt as part of the Po.et family and hope that you’ll keep an eye on them as they work to usher in a new era of freelance and citizen journalism that will not only inform and empower citizens of censorship-prone geographies, but also facilitate the production of valuable content for global consumption.""  This is the first of many innovations built in partnership with Po.et. I am going to focus solely on POEDL for this update even though there are many more things happening at Po.et right now. Why? Because in the next few weeks, we will be giving more granular expectations for main net launch, new partner acquisitions, new product updates to the protocol and much more. These will release as their own updates because they are BIG news. The work Inkrypt is doing is an excellent example of how earlier adopters are thinking about the platform to help strengthen their offering in partnership with a like minded technology and cause. This is just the beginning, and there are many other developments happening on Po.et today. Stay tuned for updates while we're heads down building the platform you all deserve.

That’s one of the questions behind a proposed law that moved a step closer to approval in the European Union recently.  It’s also a question that we here at Po.et spend a lot of time pondering. And while we are in agreement with the EU legislators behind the proposed law that current processes for sharing and licensing online content are broken, we think the solution they envision is far from ideal.  The proposed law includes two articles that concern us. One, Article 13, would place the burden on digital content publishers to ensure that all of the content they publish is in compliance with any licensing agreements that may apply to it, even if those agreements are not made clear when the publishers acquire the content. The other, Article 11, would mandate that sites that republish news articles pay a fee to the outlets where those articles originated.  We understand the EU’s concern with enforcing copyright agreements and protecting intellectual property.

Every single thing that's searchable, digestible or created on the web is driven from these two notions. How can I find the most recent content? How can I find the most relatable content, verbatim to my search? What's happened is that the consumer driven web has affected the creator driven web--and that's not a good thing.  Why?  I think it’s very important to emphasize the differences between the product and the business of media. Journalism is the product. Outside of news, the content and information delivered is the product. Your art is the product. Media is the business. The business shouldn't directly influence the artistic integrity and motive of the product. It's supposed to compliment it, not drive it.  The web was built on discovery, and discovery has two indicators of value when it comes to finding content. As mentioned above, those two are recency and relevancy. Unfortunately, the discovery behaviors impacted journalism behaviors (business influencing product). This influenced IP, ownership and what goes into the ""process of thought"". Writers and creators started changing the way they create content based on how users search for it and find it. And that is unfortunate, because it limits the artistic freedom of creators and the true value of the product of journalism. This is the value that blockchain will bring; how can we put value back in the hands of creators? How can we show that content, music, art, EVERYTHING is undervalued, and put true emphasis on the value of a creator’s work?  This is the value of Po.et.  Over the past 6 months, we've worked hard to expedite the development and marketing of the next phase of the Po.et Project in preparation for the next 6 months. You've read this in our blog posts, watched at our speaking engagements and every medium beyond. We are approaching important milestones with Po.et and have been transparent on what's coming, when, and how. Big things to keep an eye out for:  1) Moving to Mainnet 2) Alpha partner announcements 3) Engineering milestones that coincide with Mainnet (batching, licensing, marketplaces) 4) Technical partnerships and POEDL programs  The next 3 months will be the most exciting and important moments in Po.et history since its inception. This will be when Po.et goes mainstream and begins its journey to change the way the world looks at information, IP and the value of reputation. Please don't blink, as you may miss the amount of updates releasing.  As always, stay committed, stay excited and stay focused on what's next. We're going to change the world.  JD",False

The verifiable web. We often talk about the philosophies of what this means in terms of the future of the web and how we're building bridges not moats to get everyone to the other side. As I mentioned last week, the web is currently built on the pillars of recency and relevancy. These pillars are strained and need a core foundational element to drive their value in the next phase of the web. That foundation is reputation. The interoperability of the three ""Rs,” not just in the sense of discovery but in development as well, is critical to building a better web. But enough with the philosophy, where are we technically?  Our VP of engineering, Eric Elliott, published the monthly Po.et engineering update last week as we document our road to mainnet and other critical releases. You can (and should!) read it in its entirely here: https://blog.po.et/july-2018-po-et-engineering-progress-report-ead91299140c. For those who are short on time, I summarized key talking points and development milestones/futures below:  1) Everything on the web is centered around content. If content is king, Po.et is the kingdom and it exists to support and sustain the people living and working in it. If we succeed, the Po.et protocols will impact nearly every company in the world, just like the web protocols did.  2) Po.et is tearing down the walls. The walled gardens are transforming into open marketplaces. All of this is possible because some powerful innovations are converging: Blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, decentralized computing…  3) Why the Bitcoin blockchain? The Bitcoin blockchain gives us the consensus we need to make verifiable claims about content rights, trustworthiness, reputation and quality, and those needs are resonating with the industry leaders who we are talking to.  4) What can I get started with today? The Po.et testnet, attribution, an API (Frost), integrations, developer libraries, a mobile app.  5) When Mainnet? In June, we were tracking fewer than 100 total to-do items for mainnet. In July, we’re tracking 174. We’re making healthy progress toward a mainnet beta launch in the coming months. Months.  6) What have we been working on? Claim batching to ramp up our scaling capabilities, fixing bugs, conducting security reviews, achieving automation of essential workflows, finalizing protocol details for Bitcoin mainnet, improving documentation of everything and making token utility advancements.  So, as you can see, we're close. By continuing to build and strengthen the protocol, the features on top of it and our market presence, we're looking to close 2018 with a serious bang. The efforts from our engineering team are being complimented by our community development efforts as well as business development and marketing efforts. We're finalizing our first partner batch to start experimenting on the protocol and building reputation around their works. This, on top of our community efforts, will start to really push innovation on the protocol as we run toward mainnet.  What else is happening? This week, we're on stage at Distributed 2018. You can find more details here, https://2018.distributed.com/. Po.et is onstage with our friends Civil and Axios as well as moderating the session around TCRs. It will be a fun time with the best and brightest in the blockchain world figuring out how, together, we can build a better entry path into our new world.  A lot more to come. Very soon.

As you all know, our platform is only as valuable as the people who use it and build upon it. Our mission is to make Po.et the media blockchain technology of web 3.0, and we do that by making it attractive, accessible and valuable to all. This morning, we officially announced our developer platform (Po.et Development Labs) with our first parter, Inkrypt. You can find all the coverage below and my blogpost here https://blog.po.et/the-creator-economy-po-et-development-labs-inkrypt-the-builder-community-235440cb05c4:  Axios: https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-media-trends-0f657410-6347-41f5-a829-4b327da57f54.html?chunk=3#story3 Techcrunch: https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/22/po-et-launches-lab-for-developers-to-build-apps-on-publishing-blockchain/ Bitcoin Magazine: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/decentralized-media-hosting-service-aims-challenge-censorship/ Nasdaq: https://www.nasdaq.com/article/this-decentralized-media-hosting-service-aims-to-challenge-censorship-cm967217  This is the first of many partners who will build on the Po.et protocol. We are lucky to attract such amazing projects, with ideas and missions inline with our own. Inkrypt has the opportunity to change the world, and together we are setting the stage by building tools to promise a free press in this new era.  There are many updates to come over the coming weeks, especially as we edge closer to new releases on the Po.et platform. Partnerships enable us to move faster and build stronger, so our announcement today is a true testament towards the work and effort that we're putting in to drive Po.et to be the premier protocol for creators.  I hope you all are as excited as we are. Here's to Po.et!  JD",False

Over the past few weeks, we've stressed the importance of value. That all content (ideas!) should be secure on the blockchain, with control and opportunity in the hands of the creator. Our goal is not just to maximize the usage of the Po.et platform but to be a proof of value for all creators to understand and take advantage of this era of ownership. We are facilitating the evolution of web 3.0.  We’re really busy building Po.et, the technology company. And being a technology company means that everything we build and ship must be ready for mass consumption at scale. Over the past months, we have pushed new products (Frost), brokered new partnerships (http://www.coindaily.co/2018/01/29/po-et-will-gain-40-million-users-as-it-partners-with-maven/), and set the stage for the future of the platform (see: https://blog.po.et/ive-joined-po-et-as-vp-of-engineering-here-s-why-69c742123401). And the core team is just getting started.  So... what are we working on now?  Eric Elliott, our VP of engineering, is scaling our technical stack and systems at incredible speed. Po.et engineering is recruiting, on-boarding and setting course for the next phase of the platform, bringing in the best talent from around the world to continue to strengthen our offering. We will be announcing the new hires over the next couple weeks.  David Turner, our head of product, is detailing our roadmap to make sure that we’re smart and agile with our upcoming releases. This includes licensing (aka marketplace), token use, new features and everything in between. Since David joined, he has been head down finalizing these details to make sure that everything we ship helps strengthen the future of the Po.et platform. We will be giving updates on the next wave of releases shortly.  As for me, I'm everywhere. We had an incredible presence at the Forbes event last week, and even had members of the Po.et community in the crowd (the best community, btw). Much of my efforts now are finding the right strategic technical partners to help strengthen Po.et's platform, both in terms of volume and in terms of features. Po.et, in its core, is accessible to everyone. It will always be that way. Having the entry layer and the value layer is something we strive form to enable a community of creators to have the opportunity to own their ideas, and the opportunity to leverage tokens to strengthen it and take it further, That is why we built the Frost API and why we continue to build technologies that hook into creator tools to give all thinkers the opportunity to own their content on the blockchain. Po.et will be the bridge that gets creators to an access layer that proves the value of immutability and reputation. Our initial partners will believe in that mission as well, and those conversations are well underway.  I said this would be short and sweet so I'm going to end it here. I like to always give an update on Tuesday. Last week we broke down our vision, and this week and the following we're working towards strengthening our core and shipping new products. I know this community is excited, and wants to see updates constantly. We do too, and want to make sure that these updates are worth talking about. These will come from myself, David, Eric and the rest of the team.  We're excited to constantly keep you updated, and as always, please reach out with your ideas, thoughts and questions.  Go Po.et!",False

And the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time.” - TS Eliot  It has been an incredible seven weeks of exploration and fulfillment at Po.et. Since I joined in late February, I’ve seen our roadmap execute, our community grow, our industry presence develop and our team grow 400%. This truly feels like the Gutenberg Era, and our accelerated growth and development will render results faster and more efficiently than ever.  Last week, Wordpress accepted Frost and officially has it in its plugin options (https://wordpress.org/plugins/po-et/). Huge congratulations to Lautaro, the team and the community for making this happen. As Eric Elliott mentioned in his blog post, the plugin enables up to 30% of all websites the option to post all of their content to the platform. This is a giant step for Po.et as we open the opportunity for all creators to own their ideas on a major CMS.  We also officially surpassed 8,000 members on Telegram. With more than 30,000 on Twitter, 11,000 on Reddit and many across the other platforms, the Po.et community is growing well beyond 50,000 strong on social media. And the amazing part about it is that our community is active. Active on the platforms, active in conversations and active with feedback on our progress and development. Together, with your help and commitment, we will see this community grow to one of the largest, most participatory groups in no time. We are also expanding our community coverage. For the Chinese speaking Po.et community, please join our WeChat (scan below). We are also currently setting up support for Korea and other countries as the demand comes in.  We spend a lot of time spreading the vision for Po.et across the globe. Last week, we were present at Deconomy in Seoul. We had a booth and did various interviews with media companies across Korea to talk about our progress, growth and vision. We received some great coverage (coming soon) and transcended beyond Korea to Chinese business coverage as well (https://www.huxiu.com/article/239395.html). This week, we’re in Vancouver with our partners at Maven, where I’ll be speaking at their inaugural conference with BTC CEO David Bailey (https://www.themaven.net/events/coalition-2018/advertising-and-publishing-industry-leaders-added-as-speakers-B2oNtVXC2U-XNR5seSvuFA/). As you know, Maven just announced a partnership with Say Media, meaning Po.et’s relationship with the team just got a lot larger (90 million UVs!). Friday, I’ll be attending ISOJ, one of the largest journalism conferences, to talk about AI, Blockchain and other emerging technologies in journalism with some of the smartest people in the space (https://isoj.org/isoj-panelists-will-dig-deep-into-journalists-use-of-tech-tools-such-as-ai-ar-blockchain-and-machine-learning/). As you can see, we’re making our footprint across many industries, in many countries around the globe.  Our VP of Engineering, Eric Elliott, published a note on our roadmap yesterday (https://blog.po.et/the-po-et-roadmap-more-value-faster-3dcf339f771f). I encourage you all to read it. It focuses on our timelines, our development style and our commitment to the core objectives. Po.et is scaling, and in order to do that in a highly operable way, we need to expand and strengthen our engineering. In just one week, Eric has recruited top talent to triple our current engineering staff. Updates to come soon, but we’ll now be able to move faster, offer better support and focus on scale and more product features. It’s a golden age for Po.et, and our commitment to the best engineering to enable our partners and community will bring out the best in our platform.  As always, our community is hard at work!

Here is the latest update from the CEO of Po.et (posted on the official Telegram channel of Po.et) ****************************************************************************** Proof of value.  We had an excellent and successful week traveling and talking Po.et on the west coast. Meetings included top publishing and technology companies who wanted to learn more about our mission and how to leverage big products we’ve deployed and have yet to release. One thing was certain; we’re on the right path.  Po.et has a unique value proposition compared to other technologies in this space. We’re not a threat in the sense that our potential partners are concerned with our presence and disruption. Many companies aim to be “the blockchain of [insert company here]”, and are already limited by what they can do because they compare themselves to a company that already exists. We are not. We are facilitators. Po.et recognizes that many already successful companies want to learn and leverage Blockchain for their own businesses. That’s why we are open source and aim to be THE protocol in Blockchain and publishing to enable others to learn, leverage and build on the code libraries and foundation. We are being looked at as the Blockchain company that can get media, marketers and platforms learning and building in this direction. Our influence is welcomed, and so is our work. This is through our technology and our community of token holders. That is our proof of value and our continued value in this space as we dig deeper and deeper to the core of the media space.  Token Fest! We presented twice at Token Fest and were a hit on the main stage. The panel was titled “the convergence of Blockchain” and highlighted top companies in the space influencing different parts of industries. Po.et kicked it off and focused on media and publishing. We were joined by Bitpay (commerce) 4new (energy) and more. It was great representation of our company and our mission and confirmation that we’re on the right path to leading the charge in our focus area. The presentation included a demo and walk through of our strategy. It was successful in both generating Po.et awareness and attracting new partners, developers and thinkers to engage us on how to work closer with Po.et.  So what’s next? We continue to build (and hire), as we’ve been doing and has been my focus for the past 4 weeks. Block Explorer and other products will be available soon. We will have updates on our migrations to Main, and how we are strengthening attribution, marketplaces and discovery on Po.et. We will be announcing new community integrations built by YOU and the conferences we will be speaking at and attending. And lastly we will be laser focused on our partners. As you know, Po.et’s success is enabling everyone to leverage our technology for good. That also means partnerships, and once we enhance and release more products (soon!) we will be ready to enable the many partners who have reached out and shown interest in working with Po.et in a great way. We are a technology company. Our next wave of products and releases will introduce new opportunities for media and marketing partners and strengthen the ecosystem in new and incredible ways.  Stay tuned for more exciting things to come. This is just the beginning!  JD",False

My focus was to build hyper growth engineering and product teams and pave a path for future business models to not just sustain, but set a new path for the entire industry. It started at the Huffington Post, where we piloted native advertising in early 2010 and then sold to AOL. Then Time Inc., where we built an asset valuable enough to spin off from Time Warner and operate as an independent public entity. The Huffington Post core team reunited at RebelMouse in 2012, where we built an industry best solution for all publishers to build and think differently about Web 2.0, launching some of the largest and well known social brands like the Dodo, Distractify, Paper Magazine and Axios.  Then was the Washington Post. The Post was a place of imagination. A place where we practiced Amazon 'Day One' philosophy in the media space, to rethink what a modern media company should be. This was proven with our launch of Arc Publishing and team RED, which brought in new revenues and awareness to the Washington Post brand, sparking a model where we were not just a media company, but a technology company as well. It was so effective, NPR recognized us as trailblazing the modern day media model where ""newspapers"" were not just media companies but technology companies as well. This was peak value for a media company and its value in every corner of the media and marketing space. A shining example of success for Web 2.0. But what happens post Web 2.0? Then it's time to take it a step further.  When I announced I was leaving the Washington Post to join Po.et as CEO, the question I was continuously asked was ""Why would you leave Jeff Bezos' Washington Post?"" As someone who was obsessed with building and evolving modern day media companies, this was the ideal place to be. And not only that, all of the work over the past three years was paying off, not just in notoriety and growth but financially as well. The Post was, and is, an amazing media business. But the answer was simple, and mission clear. There was a lot of work left to do in the media and marketing space outside of the Post. That is now the job of Po.et.  Over the past month we have been hard at work building the foundational layers of Po.et. Our work has already been covered (in just 4 weeks!) by AdAge, Business Insider, Axios, Variety, Wall Street Journal, eMarketer, The Drum, Poynter, Columbia Journalism and more. We are changing the way the industry thinks not just about technology, but about opportunity and evolution with blockchain. We are not just future disruptors. We are future enablers. And through Po.et, we are working to partner with everyone who has an idea, from long tail creators to the largest media and marketing companies in the world. We will do this through our investment in community and technology, and empower opportunities to allow all to seamlessly integrate into our products and systems. Po.et will define what attribution, valuation and an ""idea"" means in the Web 3.0 era.  What else? We officially have an HQ! We signed a lease in New York this month so that we can grow our footprint in the media capital of the world. We are making two key hires across product and strategy in the next week that will help propel our engineering development and deliverables. And being a distributed company means that we're expanding our distributed team. We now have Po.et employees in Buenos Aires, Brazil, Sweden, Cape Town and all over Asia. It's truly an exciting growth period for Po.et in every aspect of the word.  We are getting the word out. Po.et is traveling the globe, speaking at marquee conferences and meeting with partners, clients and creators around the world. We will be in Deconomy next week, followed by Shanghai, Canada and ending the run with a presentation at ISOJ in Austin.  I'm proud to say that our community is also growing larger than ever. We have over 50,000 active  users across Telegram, Twitter, Reddit and the platforms. We update the community weekly on our developments and get feedback to make sure that we're constantly delivering on our promises to make Po.et the greatest web protocol of the blockchain era.  We are delivering on our road map and, as mentioned last week, have updates coming next week on finalized token use aligned with the original scope. The community is asking and we are delivering on how those utilities will evolve and be exercised on the Po.et platform. Our engineering efforts will accelerate, as you will see more commits, deliveries and documentation not just from the core Po.et team but recognition of community efforts as well. It's all happening.  Po.et is long term. We are a technology company building the next great protocol for Web 3.0. The community efforts in both ideas and executions show that. The team we are assembling and will continue to announce show that. The applications that will be built on top of our protocol will show that. And all of this will happen very soon. With the effort and belief of you all, we are building the web that we deserve. Not just in media and marketing, but across many utilities and industries.  Go POE!",False

Here is the latest message from the CEO of Po.et (posted on the official Telegram channel of Po.et)  ********************* Hello Po.et! Week 2 is wrapped up for me and it’s truly been a very exciting start to an important project.  We have many updates to discuss:  1) Hiring: We have been spending a lot of time recruiting the most ambitious and excited developers in the space to help build Po.et. We’re a global company and our talent is universal, meaning that the product will be influenced by the best and brightest people in the world. We will be bringing on two new developers within the next two weeks, and much more in the weeks to follow. I’m excited about these announcements, as it shows our commitment to building not just the best product, but the best engineering team as well. And it won’t stop with engineering, we will we building other areas of our business in the coming months so stay tuned for updates there as well.  2) Roadmap: In the coming weeks, we will have even more details and updates to the roadmap. We will continue to invest our attention towards strengthening functionalities to the protocol as well as providing more use cases and value to token holders. We know this is important to you and it’s extremely important to us as well. Our investment in the Po.et strategy plus bringing on the best talent and leveraging the brilliant minds in our community will move us faster toward our goals.  3) The community: Po.et’s success comes from the strength and creativity of our community. We celebrate the amazing achievements of you all and work to support the products you all will and can build on the protocol.

We’re looking forward to many more!  4) The roadshow: over the past couple weeks we got the word out about Po.et to the largest and most reputable trade publications in media, advertising and technology. There were over 15 stories written, all focused on the innovation and opportunity Po.et will bring to each and every market. This next month will be spent on the road, visiting with companies large and small all over the world to discuss opportunities to build on and work with Po.et. Next week will be San Francisco, followed by LA and Austin and then an international conference circuit. I’m excited to update you all on the product partnerships as they progress.  And finally, I just want to say how amazed and excited I am by what we are doing here. Rome wasn’t built in a day, and our ambitions of building the most trusted and important decentralized media platform in the world is well on its way. Our commitment towards empowering the community, strengthening the team and remaining focused on our core mission will get us to our objective in a smart and effective way.

Here is the latest update from the CEO of Po.et (posted on the official Telegram channel of Po.et) ****************************************************************************** Happy Tuesday everyone—  Posting the update a bit earlier today as the Po.et team is up early traveling to the west coast for Token Fest and a string of discovery and partnership meetings. We’ve been hard at work and, as always, wanted to give you an update of where we are and where we’re going.  I mentioned last week we hired two new Global developers to the Po.et roster. We’re committed to strengthening our product infrastructure and expediting our roadmap to be able to add more developments and features to the offering.  Bringing in top talent to focus on building our platform will get us there.  We’re actively recruiting to continue to bring on top engineering talent as well as talent across multiple areas of our business. We will update you as we grow, but again I stress that anyone interested in building for Po.et continue to experiment on the protocol or apply at contact@po.et to see if there’s a fit. As you saw in the blog post last week, our community is leading Po.et in amazing directions and we’re looking forward to seeing more of the products you all will produce.  We officially have an HQ! Po.et HQ (well, our office at least) is in New York City. We’re a global community first, but to build a best in class company we need a place to hang our coats. Being in NYC will allow us to constantly have our ear to the ground in the media and tech community and engage partners and collaborators throughout the space. This will help us grow and drop our anchor right in the heart of the media capital of the world.  In the next few weeks we will be releasing updates to our roadmap and token usage in the community. These are very exciting developments for Po.et, centered around our focus towards building the best decentralized marketplace, period. We will dive deep on how our token holders can and will continue to leverage their stake on the growing Po.et platform. As I mentioned last week, we are ambitious here at Po.et in a great way. We are working to build the next platform on the web, with the best community in the world and that takes astute planning and persistence. We’re working hard to listen to the communities feedback and apply it to the roadmap so that we truly have a platform that will change how media and marketing works today. So stay tuned for the updates, we’re in the final phases of our memo release and we know you’ll all be very excited about the developments.  Po.et on the road: the team is at token fest in SF this week! I’ll be presenting twice on Thursday, showing the conference the benefits of Po.et and opportunities for growth, open-source and partnerships. In two weeks, I’ll be at ISOJ, the most prestigious journalism conference talking about Po.et and Blockchain https://isoj.org/speakers-2018/jarrod-dicker/. Further out, I will be keynoting one of the largest journalism conferences in Europe https://events.wan-ifra.org/events/70th-world-news-media-congress-25th-world-editors-forum/location. We have much more set up and will make sure to document it all to share with the community.  Ok, about to board to SF. It’s only week 3 and I’m more excited than ever about Po.ets growth and potential to change the media landscape for the better. Here is to another exciting week and letting the world know about the amazing work we are all doing together at Po.et.",False

In the current paradigm, the effort and access involved in creative asset security can present insurmountable obstacles. But now that is changing. Today, we can build a better future with Po.et by putting the power of written, visual and audio content back in the hands of creators.  I decided to leave my position as the vice president of innovation and commercial strategy at The Washington Post to become CEO of Po.et because I believe in that future. Po.et is a shared, open-source universal ledger designed to track ownership, attribution and the marketplace flow of the world’s creative assets through a never-before-imagined chain of value.  Po.et is a natural progression in my career to create a better model for the media ecosystem. At The Washington Post, I founded RED, its research experimentation and development team. RED went on to launch several digital ad products which helped drive revenue in the ten figures. Prior to joining The Washington Post, I led product and technology teams at the world’s most innovative companies. At Time Inc., I led emerging products and Huffington Post, where I originated native advertising. I then rejoined the core Huffington Post technology team at RebelMouse to build its future content management system. That is to say that over the years, I’ve worked to build products and strategies on the publisher side to help direct the future business models for publishing and technology. At Po.et, we are constructing what this industry needs — a new environment where creators are paid for what they can do instead of what is required of them by an old and broken paradigm.  The path Po.et is taking toward digital artistic independence can free not only content creators but media companies, brands and marketers from servitude to particular platforms, publishers and revenue models. Blockchain technology and the Po.et platform sanction a new network effect to not be “owned” by a single entity but maintained by the collective owners of the content itself.  Beginning with Bitcoin Magazine and seven other alpha partnerships, Po.et had a successful token sale on August 8, 2017. Now with an online community of more than 40,000 developers and creators spanning Telegram, Reddit, Twitter and other social media platforms, Po.et has used the Bitcoin blockchain and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to build a new media infrastructure for the digital economy. Its recent partnership with the Maven Network, Inc., a WordPress developer integration and an ever-growing list of use cases have only strengthened our resolve to see our open-source vision realized.  We, as an industry, are running uphill when it comes to growth, scale and loyalty. Our revenue strategies are negatively impacting consumers and audiences. Engagement with digital advertising is at a stagnant low. Social platforms have a stronghold on creator IP and content has become a leaf in the wind of brand, platform and publisher circumstance. This should not be the case.  Creators need a turnkey solution to help with asset protection, authentication and certification. By leveraging information and data, Po.et can provide an extendable platform for end-to-end transparency in media attribution and valuation. The platform will showcase, archive and track content where buyers and the community set its value. It provides a steady signal to creators of the quality of their work, as rewarded by the community, brands and publishers.  How does it work? Po.et keeps a ledger of all creative assets. Its technology records all actions, changes and locations of origination for IP rights disposition. Using Po.et, brands, publishers and individuals now have an equal opportunity to access the best content and own an original voice regardless of business and historical relationships. Creators own their IP and their identities, as defined by their creative assets on the platform. Control of distribution and message by publisher and brand is now reversed. In the market today, Po.et is the first and most evolved open-source publisher on the blockchain.  I’m excited to be leading the charge by opening new opportunities for creators, media companies and brands to take their work on to the next frontier. Po.et’s success will depend on fostering an exceptional international community within the workplace and throughout our network. Diversity, excellence, integrity and fellowship will be essential elements to building a better ecosystem for creators. We believe that with the right platform and technical stack, IP will finally now lend itself to new revenue streams, explorations and something bigger than ever before.  This is the first step toward bettering the world of independent content creation. Together, with technology, we can recalibrate the media business and set forth a model that benefits creators, publishers, platforms and brands alike. Po.et opens the door. All we have to do is walk through.",False

With all these new ICO's coming out with literally *billions* of tokens, and yet they have ICO prices at a dollar or more.  Terrible investment.  Po.et just announced their per-token price will only be $0.06  .... so even a very small investment will get you a lot of tokens.  And more importantly, its backed by some trusted names that have been in Bitcoin for years.  I hate to keep name dropping him but Adam B Levine is the host of Lets Talk Bitcoin where Andreas Antonopoulos first sprang from, and he is on board with this project heavily.   For me that's a significant factor as the potential for ""scam"" goes to literally zero with his involvement (in my opinion).  That separates this ICO from the others.   -------   I've been sitting in the Slack chat all day so I might as well share the other info I've found:  *  ICO goes live tomorrow August 8, 2017 at 8:08 a.m. EST - and you must have an invite code.  Getting one involves signing up for the newsletter on the home page:  https://po.et/  Or you can go into their Slack channel and request one:  https://poet-slack.herokuapp.com/  Or on Telegram:  https://t.me/joinchat/GKMQ1kOQSdXVZpN1Rygcdw  *  As mentioned, per token ICO price is $0.06  *  Investment max is $50,000 but this changes (reduces) dynamically as more people contribute during the crowdsale.    *  The invite codes will not work until the ICO has begun.  *  ICO participation is first come first serve - so there is a remote chance they sell out before you get in and use your code.  *  Project ICO is capped at $10 million.  *  USA participants may not participate, but nobody is stopping you from googling ""proxy browser"" or being a disgusting little liar and checking the checkbox that says ""I certify I am not a United States Citizen"" on the ICO sale page.  I absolutely am not recommending you do this  Promise.   Swear.   No really ...  *  Bookmark this URL because it's the proper URL for the crowd sale (there are already fakes popping up):  https://sale.po.et/   Or if you dont trust me, go to their home page at:  https://po.et/  >  SECURITY ADVISORY HOW TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TOKEN SALE > and scroll down to # 1 in the instructions which has the same URL to the sale page.  *  HOW TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PO.ET TOKEN SALE:   Even if you do trust me read that page anyways, its here:  https://blog.po.et/how-to-participate-in-the-po-et-toke-sale-dc420c18049f  -B-",False
