For example, if a daily round has a 2.5M CMCT allocation, Jane contributes 250 ETH and total ETH contributed was 25K ETH, Jane will receive 25K CMCTs. Jane paid in 1% of the total round value, so she gets 1% of the 2.5M allocation for that round.  5) CMCTs will be distributed within 7 days of the close of the pre-sale period, and then daily within 4 hours of the close of each daily sale period.

The Crowd Computer is a global decentralized app execution engine. It has been designed to execute blockchain smart contracts and decentralized apps that meet any requirement. The Crowd Computer consists of a peer-to-peer network of Crowd Virtual Machines (“CVM”) that run on the peer devices. Device owners are compensated for the use of their surplus processing power to run the CVM. Embedded in the Crowd Computer is the Crowd App Studio that enables anyone to create decentralized apps without writing code. Crowd Share is a GitHub-like repository of source code that developers can use free of charge to help build their apps.   We will discuss frequently asked questions ...

It is normal   Dapp is a utility for implementing and maintaining CI / CD processes (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery). It is intended for use by DevOps-specialists as a link between the application code (supported by Git), the infrastructure described by the code (Chef) and used by PaaS (Kubernetes). In this case, dapp is designed with thoughts of speed / performance, its purpose is to make it easier for DevOps engineers to develop code for assembly, to reduce the waiting time for building the next commit, and to automate the de-job.  What does dapp do?  Reducing the average build time. Use a shared cache between assemblies. The possibility of distributed assembly when using a common registry. Reducing the size of the image, by taking the original data and tools of assembly. Ability to build an image using chef. Creation of a set of images on one file-description. Advanced debugging tools for the captured image. Deplays in kubernetes via helm (kubernetes package manager).",True
