No further details have yet been released about the token, Barry Silbert’s Investment Trust also keeping quiet about any real involvement.

I'm almost 100% certain that William Suberg of CoinTelegraph didn't take it upon himself to turn a rhetorical question into a truism, but if he had, surely Team The Legends Room would've immediately caught it and requested that the article be amended, of which CT would've corrected the article immediately.

They will create the club and pump the tokens to the moon and make millions of dollars.  That is not a scam. You Gleb said they built the Mike Tyson ATM and the Mike Tyson wallet and then they pumped the stock to reap giant rewards. You Gleb posted links to ICNB which is a wine company that markets Christie Brinkley wine and the stock when through the roof and by YOUR OWN POSTING the same people behind the Legends Room made millions.  One other tip off is that they have offered refunds on the memberships. So they can't be running the small time con of selling phony memberships. That's for low level scammers. This is a massive pump in the making and you Gleb have brought that to the community's attention and I am grateful for your research.  Got it! High level scammers utilize former DC prosecutors to act as a mouthpiece so to garner more suckers to purchase $5,000 memberships to a club that doesn't yet exist and keeps changing its projected venue location, e.g. stating that The Legends Room offers refunds to its members 180o counter to what's declared on TLR's official website, to wit (that lawyerese) ...  https://legendsroomlv.com/mto/   Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure that what's printed on TLR's official website trumps words penned by Gay VouchTard.

Meanwhile, allow me to quote the entire EPIC article that has you jacking off all over yourself ...  Quote Two UFC Legends Enter Into The Adult Entertainment Industry  Times, they are-a-changin’. Gone are the days when fighters used to be more concerned with what kind of party they’re going to get access to after their fight, rather than be one-hundred percent concentrated on their upcoming fight. The athletes of today are more concerned with their resting heart rates than they are finding a party, and perhaps two Ultimate Fighting Championship legends can change that.  Las Vegas, Nevada is without a doubt fight central for mixed martial arts fans, so it was a no-brainer when octagon veterans Phil Baroni and UFC Hall of Famer Stephan Bonnar were given the opportunity to invest in “The Legend’s Room”, a ridiculously upscale gentlemen’s club.  “Legend’s Room” will be the first strip club to operate on bitcoins and cryptocurrency, which is a sign that even more industries are adapting with the evolution of technology. You will have to pay a grand total of $5,000 just to get in the club which is allegedly partially owned by Bonnar.  What do you think? Will you support a brave company utilizing bitcoin as their main form of currency, or will you avoid this like the plague while you’re in Vegas?  Go back to the video where Nick Blomgren clearly states the club will except all forms of payments (including credit cards) and that crypto is just a small part of the overall operation, namely the $5,000 membership aspect.

After its creation in 2008, it was primarily housed in the domain of expert cryptographers. From there, it slowly grew with a small but enthusiastic community who began experimenting with its usefulness. In 2010, a Florida programmer famously ordered two Papa John’s pizzas for which he paid 10,000 bitcoins (worth $25 at the time). Now celebrated annually by bitcoin fans, the pizza order was the first real-world bitcoin purchase and marked the beginning of bitcoin’s entry into mainstream commerce.   While bitcoin is still in the early adopter stage from a consumer standpoint, hedge funds are becoming more publicly engaged in the bitcoin ecosystem and including bitcoin in their investment portfolios. Sill largely anecdotal, some well-publicized examples include the launch of an institutional grade Bitcoin Hedge Fund by Coin Capital Management, and the Pantera Bitcoin Partners fund, which launched in part with investment from Wall Street’s Fortress Investment Group, LLC (NYSE: FIG).   Many venture capital firms and other investors have invested in bitcoin-related enterprises, covering everything from mobile remittances to payments technology. In its latest “State of Bitcoin” report, Coindesk noted that the bulk of the $433m of new venture capital that’s been invested in bitcoin startups since 2012 has come in 2014; a total of $335m was invested in 2014, with a whopping $130m invested in the 4th quarter alone. We believe that the institutional and hedge fund interest in bitcoin will continue to accelerate for a number of interconnected reasons including expectation of price increases, increased use by retailers – especially online, and continued interest in how companies can utilize bitcoin technology to streamline their businesses.   We predict that the Bitcoin digital currency will continue to find its way into the daily lives of many consumers, which is one of the reasons we decided to invest in Bitcoin Direct, an automated bitcoin seller, to build and distribute bitcoin ATMs. Bitcoin Direct is a subsidiary of the.Connexus Cattle Corporation (CNXS) (the Company just announced that they are soonchanging their name to the Connexus Corporation and moving in a different business direction),having recently been taken public through acquisition.Connexus has also partnered with celebrity Mike Tyson in order to accelerate the branding of its ATM product which we believe to be a game changer in the industry. We see tremendous potential for bitcoin-related businesses since digital currency can be used for everything from daily consumer purchases to remittances to gaming. We already know that bitcoin ATMs have the capacity to outperform gaming kiosks in places like Las Vegas where the Company has begun to install its ATM machines. Southridge looks for investment where it can enter near the beginning of the life of a new idea and where there are few capacity limitations. The Bitcoin industry clearly fits those criteria from our vantage point.   According to BitPay, a leading bitcoin payment processor, over 100,000 merchants worldwide are now accepting Bitcoin with the number of European transactions alone reaching an all time high of 102,221 in the second quarter of this year. Growth in Latin America appears to maintain its impressive trajectory as well.   In the e-commerce world, the number of retailers accepting bitcoin continues to grow, and now includes major brands such as Dell, PayPal, Expedia, Dish, Intuit, Stripe, and Microsoft. In the remittance market, which is largely dominated by money transfers from developed countries to developing ones, interest in Bitcoin is tremendous.   Bitcoin currency experienced extreme initial price volatility, having started at $0.10 and peaked at over $1200 in 2013. Today’s bitcoin price is closer to $330 after a recent run from the $220 range and is substantially less volatile than in its infancy. A Wedbush report noted that the growing demand for bitcoin stems from an increase in usage for e-commerce payments, remittances and micropayments. As reported by Coindesk, Wedbush expects bitcoin to ultimately account for 10% of the $5.9 trillion online payments market, 20% of the $744 billion remittance market, and 20% of the $924 billion micro transactions market. Importantly and in contrast to both traditional and alternative digital currencies, Bitcoin Technology is virtually hack proof, a main confidence building component in its acceptance.   At the beginning of last year, renowned American entrepreneur and investor Marc Andreessen compared the invention of bitcoin to the invention of the internet, with the same wide-ranging potential for the development of revolutionary products and services. Our firm certainly agrees with this assessment. Further evidence of bitcoin being on the verge of greater acceptance comes from a recent report by Greenwich Associates, which looked at the potential of bitcoin technology for institutional finance. Of the financial professionals interviewed for the report, an astounding 94% believed that systems similar to Bitcoin’s block chain could be applied in their businesses.   Yet there is still room for greater use and liquidity. It was widely reported that during the Greek crisis, there was an increase in bitcoin prices as some speculated that bitcoin could be an option for Greeks looking to protect wealth, but the reality was that there was very little bitcoin trading related to Greece, and the average Greek citizen has not even heard of bitcoin. While liquidity continues to be a problem for bitcoin, as accessibility is limited, it is possible to buy Bitcoins through a variety of methods, including online venues and now bitcoin ATMs. The launch of bitcoin ATMs, which allow consumers and laypeople to purchase bitcoins, has been widely publicized and will contribute to the public understanding and use of bitcoin. As the number of ATMs increases, we believe that general liquidity will increase, as well.   Additionally, we believe that given the need to stimulate economies throughout the world that expansionary monetary policy will be the order of the day for quite some time. Bitcoin, with its stable money supply, represents an attractive currency for individuals looking to offset inflationary pressures. We believe there will be increased demand for Bitcoin for this reason. That, combined with our expected performance of Connexus, because of its Bitcoin Direct acquisition, may provide for price appreciation in the Company’s stock. We also believe that part of the current opportunity is the Company’s small market capitalization due to its current price and outstanding share count, and that in furthering the growing business of Bitcoin Direct, the market capitalization of the Company should grow commensurately. As such, we believe our investment is justified.   Bitcoin has come a long way since that first pizza purchase. Bitcoin is going to continue to drive payments innovation for some time to come, and I truly believe institutional investors who ignore this nascent asset class will be looking back at it as a missed opportunity.   ###   Stephen Hicks is the Chief Executive Officer and founding principal of Southridge Capital, a diversified financial holding company specializing in direct investment and advisory services to small and middle market companies.

Different guy, fucktard. http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/tucson/obituary.aspx?page=lifestory&pid=181490071[/color]   HUSS, Conrad Eugene 75, of Tucson, passed away unexpectedly September 16, 2016. Conrad was a beloved and adored husband, father, grandfather, friend, mentor, and employer, a kind-hearted ""gentle giant"" who was a pillar of strength and a rock in the countless lives he touched, felt responsibility for, and reached to lift and better. His example of impeccable personal honesty and integrity, completely unpretentious, down to earth humility, and untiring work ethic and professionalism, vision and technical expertise, uniquely suited him to be the driving force behind building a one of a kind international engineering business, and to touch innumerable people in his personal life through his constant thoughtful and considerate actions. Though he was the Chairman of the Board he could be found emptying the trash buckets. Conrad never considered himself too ""big"" for any task or responsibility, and would just as happily help with the dishes and laundry at home as design and supervise construction of billion dollar facilities. He was never too busy to coach and referee his kids' soccer teams for 20 years, be a hard core season ticket supporter of the UA Basketball team, help his wife deliver dinner and personal items to the homeless outreach, support her unquestioningly in her endless endeavors, or perform endless hours of volunteer church service where he could be found everywhere from his 13 year stint working patiently and lovingly with the toddlers in the nursery, through a variety of other assignments, leading to his last responsibility supporting and working with the Bishopric as the Financial Clerk. Conrad loved to write in his limited spare time; whether it took the form of kind letters of encouragement to friends and family, personal stories, or memoirs of those he was particularly intrigued by as well as his own journals. His stellar, lauded engineering career took him around the world working on some of the most fascinating and challenging of projects. Conrad was the recipient throughout his career of numerous prestigious honors and awards; he always down played them and felt uncomfortable with the recognition, just as he refused to allow anyone to ever call him ""Dr"" Huss despite his PhD. He loved his career and found it rewarding, stimulating, and meaningful up until the day of his passing. But nothing brought him more pride and joy and fulfillment than his five children and three grandchildren, who were the light of his life. Conrad is survived by his loving wife, Mercy, and children, Philip, Brian, Joshua, Jared and Christiana Huss; grandchildren, Sam, Dominic and Danielle Huss; sister, Phyliss Provenzano and brother, Howard Huss. His passing leaves a huge void in so many hearts and lives; he will be sorely missed and never replaced. A Celebration of his truly remarkable Life will be held at 4:00 p.m. on Friday, September 23, 2016, at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, 939 W. Chapala Drive, Tucson. A viewing will precede the service at 3:00 p.m. If you have a memory of how Conrad touched your life, please feel free to leave your thoughts in an email to the family at ChristmasValley@gmail.com, with Conrad in the subject line, which will be put together in a book of remembrance for his family. Conrad has left a truly incredible, larger than life, one of a kind legacy in so very many ways - the mold is broken, and now those of us he left behind must step up to the plate and try in our small way to follow in those noble footsteps and fill those very, very big empty shoes. We love you Daddy - and miss you more than words can say. We will do our best to honor the incredible love and legacy you sacrificed so much to bless us with. We know you are already at work on God's errand and preparing a secure, strong, safe place for us there, just as you did here, out of your great big heart full of unconditional love that you exemplified for us better than anyone we know. God be with you until we meet again Daddy.

BTW, Amanda Early is not related to Handsome Early aka Patrick Dai of Qtum. Trust me on this one, for I vetted her too.    Don't forget that Team Legends went on and on for three weeks talking about all the renovations going at Centerfolds, readying it for an April 1st opening with ownership papers and licenses in hand, and with Kevin Hobbs of Vanbex confirming such every step of the way, then the entire team made a 180 when they couldn't stand the heat anymore re Centerfolds was never in their control. HAHAHA & Chuckles  TLR can't produce or provide the link to LV permits' page depicting said renovations that are 100% required my law, even though an honest group like The Legends Room would've 100% had applied for, then granted by LV.

Things just feel different: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYMzoTEloD0  http://siliconangle.com/blog/2015/07/26/mike-tyson-suckered-into-endorsing-branded-bitcoin-atms-in-potential-scam/  Quote Exclusive: Mike Tyson suckered into endorsing branded Bitcoin ATMs in potential scam  BY DUNCAN RILEY  Former heavyweight world boxing title holder Mike Tyson may be biting off more than a rival’s ear in August with news over the weekend that he is apparently getting into the Bitcoin ATM ring. But an investigation by SiliconANGLE has revealed that Tyson may have been scammed.  “Mike Tyson Bitcoin ATM” is said to offer a revolution in offering cash to Bitcoin services in 20 seconds, which is 10 seconds faster that Iron Mike’s quickest knockout in a professional bout, which clocked in at 30 seconds.  Confirmation that Tyson was involved in the offering came by Tyson’s Twitter account, with the retired fighter claiming the service will “change the way we get change.”  If it looks like a scam …  Precious little is known about the service other than what we’ve written above, and various Bitcoin forums are full of speculation as to whether this is a legitimate business enterprise or not. While Tyson is reported to actually be a smart operator by some, he certainly doesn’t always present himself that way in public.  The biggest lead comes via the registration of the domain name miketysonbitcoin.com, which is registered to one Peter Klamka.  A search finds that Klamka is the Chief Executive Officer of Bitcoin Brands, Inc., which offers a site called Bitcoin for Miles (a site to buy airline frequent flyer miles) and something called the “Bitcoin Vending Network,” which makes a mish-mash of claims, talking about offering ATM services on one hand, then vending machines (not sure if these are meant to be different) on the other.  The other service the company alleges to provide is BitMD, claimed to provide Bitcoin payment services to the medical marijuana industry.  Doesn’t sound too bad in theory, and if it was providing those services it would be, but there’s only one serious problem: We can’t find any solid evidence, outside of the company’s own press releases, that they are.  There are a number of press releases pertaining to alleged establishments of Bitcoin ATMs and Bitcoin payment services, and a few sites that simply repeat the claims in the press releases, but there appears to be no legitimate press; that is say a local news report on an ATM opening complete with pictures of people, which you’d expect with a Bitcoin ATM opening, or a promo piece about the medical marijuana seller now taking Bitcoins; they’re either extraordinarily bad at on-the-ground local PR or the press releases are pure fantasy.  But it gets worse: Bitcoin Brands is listed as an Over-The-Counter (OTC) stock, so if it actually was providing these services you’d expect that to reflect in its share price and market cap.  Their current share price is $0.0001 per share with a market cap of $6,780. That’s not millions, that’s six thousand, seven hundred and eighty dollars.  So, a company worth $6,870 has done a legitimate deal with Mike Tyson to provide Mike Tyson Bitcoin ATM’s?  Excuse the language, but bullshit it has.  The best guess here is that Mike Tyson has been suckered into a deal by a fast talker who has promised him millions if he gets involved and lends his name to the enterprise, despite the company behind the enterprise having a market cap that is probably about half the value of one bottle of the champagne Tyson prefers to drink.  The other alternative theory is that Tyson himself has invested money into the service and Klamka is a business partner. But if that’s the case, it throws Tyson’s business judgement into serious doubt as any basic due diligence via a simple Google search would have found that not everything is as it seems when it comes to Bitcoin Brands and its alleged provision of various services.  If we find out more, we’ll update the post.",False

What is unproven is your allegation that Peter Klamka CONTROLS the Legends Room. To prove that, you need evidence. You supply a video with a five second clip about their partner.

Vanbex will be fine we have worked with over 40 companies in this industry and will continue to do good work for all our clients. Not all projects are perfect and as this industry is very new and growing fast there are going to be lots of hurdles along the way. We will always  protect the community and investors with any project we work with if problems do arise like they have with Legends room. As for the due diligence it was done prior to taking on the project and unfortunately circumstances beyond anyone's control happened and now we have to work to handle it the best way possible. No one will get hurt or lose money if the project does not come to fruition. But if it does then I'm sure the people who purchased memberships will enjoy all the club will have to offer.  This business model is one we will see again as we already have multiple other companies exploring this with us. Good luck in your trolling as it seems like you have nothing else better to do in your life.,False

What you dub trolling is actually truism put forth in re The Legends Room. Case in point, up to the me depicting Centerfolds Cabaret as not in reality morphing into The Legends Room, Team Legends immediately changed course, offering up StripTrease as the new venue, abandoning the supposed ongoing renovations at Centerfolds. Sans me intervening, it's highly probably that TLR would still be putting forth its lies about Centerfolds being rebranded and on target for an April grand opening, that honor now passed onto the StripTease venue, a truly impossibility within the set timeframe.  Vanbex now wants us to believe that The Legends Room owning Centerfolds WAS NOT a lie, spinning it as anything but the lie that it is while in the same breath dissing all those as trolls having agendas exposing the scam like myself in their hopes of furthering the obvious TLR ruse.  Vanbex can't even explain away why the Mike Tyson Bitcoin ATM venture is no longer around. A venture orchestrated by the same dudes behind TLR, with Peter Klamka and his brother, Richard, calling all the shots, with Peter being a known con artist for over a decade now, starting with fucking over women ($) who had hopes of entering renown beauty pageants.

When you came around this thread the website was down to change details of the club on it, and other stuff as things were not happening as originally thought. It wasn't because you started with your non-sense posting. That was happening while you where fudding. The site then came back, a few hours later, updated. It still needs to be updated with new info so stay tuned for that. You are using the time since the website went down and the weekend (when people are off and offices are closed) to spread more fud, we see this as your best shot because as soon as more info is released you will have to apologize for all you have said. If you are a man you would have to recognize your mistake.  Kevin has explained the situation above pretty well in our opinion, but it doesn't matter to you, you still go ahead spreading fud.  The Tyson BTM has nothing to do with The Legends Room, also no one got scammed out of that, did anybody lose money? However you still portray it as something people should be worried about as it relates to The Legends Room when it doesn't.

I can understand that a strip club may not be everyone's taste and it seems a bit odd off the start. When we were first approached about this we initially were skeptical. The business model is what is really interesting and what made us want to get involved and since then we have been contacted by multiple membership based business to see if it would work for them.  A digital membership that can be rented, leased and liquidated on exchanges. This is a great model for any membership based business. It is also great for the education and adoption of crypto currency. You now have an audience that would normally not use crypto currency learning how to use it in a real world business and not just on a crypto exchange. You have businesses that would not normally look to crypto or blockchain technology now looking at it as a viable option.  From a business standpoint you get a members base that becomes a free source of marketing for you in the long run as it is in their financial interest to rent the membership if they so choose, word of mouth is always the best referral. You eliminate counterparty risk (Clawbacks) and the traditional 30-90 day hold on funds by excepting crytpocurrency for products and services.  Regarding the latest events surrounding Legends Room: In the beginning we were hired to build the membership token and do marketing for the project. We were given the relevant documentation to show that this project was moving ahead at the Centerfolds location. Incorporation documents, contracts with the girls, contract with partners, LOI with club owner, contract with Steve Paik and Peter Klamka to put the Bitcoin ATMs in Centerfolds, multiple emails between Steve Paik and Peter Klamka, spoke with Nick Blomgren and Stephan Bonnar.  Multiple people in the community went there and met the team involved and verified this for themselves even the contract with Asa Akira.  Recently we were told the owner of Centerfolds was put in jail (this was shared in this thread) due to that the Legends Room team had to find another venue to move forward. We were told this was an inconvenience but not a problem because many places want their concept in their club along with all their clientele. They are now telling us that the new venue is much bigger and nicer and a better fit for this concept and does not have the bad reputation that has been on Centerfolds since it was the Paradise Club.  We are interested in protecting those that have purchased memberships and have requested all the relevant legal documentation to prove that this is going ahead in this new location. So far we have received all the contracts with their headlining girls, an LOI between Legends Room Las Vegas LLC and 6000 Windmill LLC which also includes the liquor license, Pictures of the new location (inside) verbally they have told us  that they have raised 3 million USD outside of the sale and will be purchasing VIP tokens.  I can understand that others would be concerned about all of this. If you have purchased tokens and you would like your money back please PM me and we can speak to the management to see about returning your funds as the management has stated multiple times that if you are unhappy they will refund your money on the spot.  I'm happy to chat with anyone and answer any questions I can.",False

Why did you lie and say that Legends Room had bought the venue outright?   No one lied there was a contract in place but due to the recent legal issues they were unable to complete the contract. I have been informed by management that there will be a fully executed LOI with the new venue tonight or tomorrow and the details will be shared so you can verify for yourself.  Owning a venue outright and ONLY having a contract in place are two very different things that I believe even Guy, The Legends Room's number-on fanboy and this thread's formidable lawyer, would concur even if he barely passed the bar, of which by all accounts seems to be the case, given his evidence prowess, or lack thereof.  Here's how Guy thinks:  Thread, good. Pussy, better. Here's my $5,000. Oh, oh. Trolls! Trolls are bad. Thread, good. Pussy, very, very good. Trolls no like pussy. Ergo, I made very good investment, just like earning a law degree, buying a Tesla, and spending valuable time so now being one of 200 people in the world who to date are the only ones possessing a perfect bracket.",False

If you need cheap ones I can ask them what price they can offer.  I bet since they are manufactured in Europe they are of really high quality. I have seen it take quite a lot of the older Solar panels bolted to a roof facing South, just to heat a swimming pool during the Winter time mid December until mid March in Southern Nevada just outside of Vegas an area known to have historically warmer Winters.  Maybe it's because his partner in crime, Peter Dillon Klamka, is involved in at least one solar venture -> http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=403751&privcapId=403749 with its HQ on Dino Drive, Dino as in Dean.  Oh, and I spoke with a woman at Hard Rock Casino, and she informed me that their legal team has been acting in getting their brand name removed from all of The Legends Room sites and releases because she assured me that they have NEVER been attached to them in any capacities, and she personally has fielded several calls regarding said. I gave her a link to this thread, whereupon she thanked me and wasn't aware of it but perhaps legal was, I assume via a simple Google search.  I'm pretty sure that Hard Rock Casino wants to have no connection with anything that Peter Klamka is attached to, especially a strip joint located in a problematic venue where Nick Blomberg was once employed.

Really enjoy reading the hate.  Nice to see my Legends Room membership is generating such interest. Controversy equals cash especially in Las Vegas.  Wonder why anyone is discussing this as an investment. It's not. It's a product that is to be consumed.  So all this talk about investments is just misdirection and fake news for the real agenda that our bashers have.  I suspect they are antiporn zealots.  The bear picture was some kind of beastiality, right?  I think when the Centerfolds story proved to check out that the Legends Room guys were telling the truth then the hate turned even more vicious.  Now I can't find a bad review of Nick's gym in Las Vegas. I can't find a complaint that someone bought a membership and didn't get to train MMA there.  So why would the guy start now?  Then i went to Yelp https://www.yelp.com/biz/one-kicks-gym-las-vegas-2  5.0 star rating 9/24/2016 This really is a great gym. The trainers are nice, and so are the students. Sparring was much more about learning and improving than beating up your training partners. I trained there during the summer while I was off from school and I had a great experience!    Next review   Great gym for both Muay Thai and Jiu Jitsu.  They offer classes for kids starting at age 4 all the way to adults.  Master Nick and Master Lookchang put a lot of effort into making sure all of their students learn respect and the proper techniques.  Family atmosphere where all the students and teachers work together.My kids have been going to One Kicks for over 3 years and there isn't a better gym in town[/color] Next review  I really like the environment here too.  Everyone is an equal.  It doesn't matter if you're a professional MMA fighter, an amateur fighter, or someone who has no intention of competing at all.  Everyone is friendly and welcoming towards each other.  I've even had some of the pro fighters take their own time to help me out, without me even having to ask, when I've been there practicing by myself during an open mat session.  I've heard stories of other gyms having cliques and people falling into their own little elite group of friends, but you won't see that at OKG.  It really is one big family here and I'm very happy I made the choice to join and meet so many great people who have taught me so many skills I'll be able to use for the rest of my life.  Next review  I started coming to One Kick's Gym in March of 2011, and have had no regrets! I started training in Muay Thai since 2007, and have been to many different gyms, but none of them were like One Kick's Gym. At One Kick's classes are set up by experience and students are matched up or paired with other students that are in the same level so that learning is easy and fun! You will learn basic, intermediate and (at times) advanced techniques.  Next review  Master Nick, Master Lookchang, Mark Dickman and Jon Fitch are great instructors who are approachable and patient in teaching students form, technique and strategy! Once you start going to OKG, you'll feel like you have another family! I love this place and highly recommend it to all who are interested in getting in shape and working on self confidence! Next review  [p]the best in town, Master Nick is very good role model for young kids! very intense gym for some of the best training around, can also take classes for cardio or self confidence   The guy has perfect reviews going back years for his MMA gym but all of a sudden he has turned into a crytoscammer?

Yes, of course they have a license to run this. Come on now.  To obtain a license in LV, among most other jurisdictions, one needs to first register a physical address of the B&M business which Team Legends did not do. But, if they did, than a copy of said license would be available online, of which it is not. But, if they did, they started remodeling Centerfolds while it was still open for business. They did such sans (that's legal talk for 'without' in case you missed that class, Guy) a permit, for it's already been demonstrated that no permit(s) exists. BTW, the remodel was a secret unbeknownst to the staff and patrons - NOBODY THERE WITNESSED ANY REMODELING. But, if they did, then the remodeling continued up to yesterday when Nick went on record and declared that the Centerfold locale was no longer viable, offering up a new venue. A new venue that isn't a registered business in their name, no strip club license, no alcohol or dancing licenses which takes no less than 90 days to be awarded, no remodeling permits, etc., all of which Team Legends says will be accomplished for the for-real grand opening of The Legends Room in April, showcasing the most beautiful women in Vegas, available because all the other strip clubs in Vegas find it prudent to only hire scags as dancers and waitstaff.  Guy, the evidence is so overwhelming in your favor, I suggest you purchase another membership while the supplies last. In fact, purchase several and dole them out like candy to your profitable law firm team, profitable because it's a given that you're the most intelligent person to frequent this thread to date, thus has to have a law firm populated with magna cum laude personnel who've never lost a case and deserves a lap dance or three or ten in the VIP lounge of The Legends Room regardless if located on Paradise or in a rundown warehouse off some back street known for hookers and druggies and the homeless.

But since I have access to court documents, I'll put one or five out there...Paik was staying on as a minority partner and his license was staying in place. No need to relicense.  When he was jailed in Philadephia, Legends left the deal fearing a license issue and found another venue with the exact same structure. Centerfolds is losing buckets of money. So of course Centerfolds wasn't being sold it was simply restructuring with the Legends Room becoming the majority owner of the LLC.  Like when Carlito took over for Sasso.   Fuck that is a good explanation and makes complete sense and might be part of the case file.  Want another? Legends leased Paik's existing license as part of the deal until they obtained their own. Happens all the time in taverns, cabarets, and gaming. Paik goes to jail and is UNABLE to meet the terms of the contract. Nick doesn't want to embarrass the guy so he simply says they moved on. Consistent with a guy who takes gang members and makes them upstanding citizens.  Want another?  Blomgren has a license from his days running other strip clubs and it is in some type of escrow.  Want another? Blomgren is presently licensed as a professional MMA promoter.  https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210924270595157&set=a.1247734385872.2038849.1004803183&type=3&theater This is a much tougher license to obtain because it involves wagering and the health and safety of fighters.

Team Legends will now connect the dots and prove that you and I are the same person.    Quote from: hobbskevin on January 18, 2017, 11:50:46 PM Yes I agree! Which is why we are now starting to build this model into popular clubs in Vegas. Exclusive clubs with Exclusive clientele and Events. Using a digital token as the only way to gain access it has something that the current hotel model doesn't and thats the counterparty risk as well as the anonymity that some people want. Many other advantages as well as the tokens are liquid and you could sell them anytime whereas selling a condo could take a long time.  Translated: A thirty-year-old Bob Smith can transfer his anonymous The Legends Room membership to a underage-looking Alice Jones, where all Alice has to do is present Bob's membership card to the riffraff at the back door and they're let her in under the auspices of anonymity, whereas sans the card each and every other person entering the venue WILL have their IDs checks in making sure no underage patrons enter the premise.  If my assessment is incorrect, then so is what Keven Hobbs alludes to about members maintaining their anonymity, for all because a person has a membership card doesn't mean that they'll be anonymous when they must present their ID at the door having cameras pointing down on them like at most establishments in Vegas where recordings MUST be kept for at least 30 days and immediately handed over upon request by law enforcement, which every lawyer in Vegas is well aware, with Guy hoping that one of said lawyers futurely brings him up to speed.

These are women who kneel down and suck 10 dicks on camera as Asa has done. Crazy porn stars. The clowns here will make it out like Tom Brady left the Patriots or Lebron is no longer with Cleveland. There are so many possible explanations as to why a porn star is no longer associated with a strip club. Did she have a professional disagreement with the owners? Did Asa get pissed off when she found out someone else was making more money than she was?  Was she just a hired face and the company made a change? Is she pregnant? Is she retiring from porn? Is there a health issue?  Is she moving to Europe like Tera Patrick did? Did she commit a crime?  Did the Legends Room find someone they liked better? Is Asa moving to New York full time to do her radio show and won't be able to commit enough time to the Legends Room which is on the west coast? Did they mutually decide not to work together because of timing or personalities? Did she refuse to learn about digital currency? Is it any of our business? Or is it a WWE style marketing angle? Asa leaves the company and then comes back? Who knows and who cares.  I recall people on this forum complaining that she wasn't famous enough. Stars drop out of movies all the time. Movies get made. Life goes on. Now if Kat Dior wasn't there or that blonde Kenna, I would have a serious issue. [/color]  I do love the heat that this company is generating.

We ignored the post as it didn't make any sense, promising millions of dollars for YouTube videos. And we didn't give a sausage about it.  What we can guarantee is that there will be a club opened in April named The Legends Room.  We don't really care about what's been posted it's not going to affect us one bit, most of our sales are via CC so far.

It's you having a YouTube channel that interests me. Although currently not having any following to speak of, The Legends Room channel is still able to earn Lÿnspinz status on our platform dubbed YuTü.Ço.in (under the auspices of YuTübopołis) during our nascent stage, our IÇO maintained at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1801101.0 (future requirements to obtain Lÿnspinz status will be exponentially more difficult to achieve as we further develop).  Short and sweet (or: in a nutshell; puns intended in the vein [pun not intended] of your venture, if you get my drift  ), YuTü.Ço.in's core platform consists of trading YouTube channels/creators' brands as crypto-commodities - yAłtçoins - on our propriety exchange, YTÇ-Sốx (purposely rhymes with Mt Gox, but a non-nefarious, near fully transparent exchange). In The Legends Room channel's case, the ticker symbol (TiçSÿm) on our exchange would most likely be LR, perhaps stylized as LR (naming and stylization only a logical suggestion, you having full control as to what it should be), the accompanied logo a given -> .  It costs nothing to join, with creators NEVER doling out one satoshi in enjoying everything our platform will have to offer. For all practical purposes there's no risk, with a creator able to end their relationship with us at any time sans delays - immediately expunging their brand off any and all our platforms for whatever reasons. All a YouTube creator has to do to be, and remain a Lÿnspinz in good standing is to: provide a link to their presence on our site from their YouTube channel's About page; have at least one other link to the same site stemming from ANY website or social media platform that they maintain; upload at least one video per month that's more than 3:14 in length, or any number of videos within a 30-day period totally 3:14 or more. THAT IS ALL!  Without going into too much detail (already long, with apologies), the main reward that creators receive in return for the aforementioned is that their yAłtçoin will eventually produce 200,000,000 shares (yãłtz) valued at least $2,000,000 ($0.01 ea. min.), created over the course of ~5.945586 years (plus (17,187,500 yãłtz in reserve). A max of 100 virtual miners will be hashing each yAłtçoin via assignable PÅQs maintained on respective permissioned blockchains.  Gleaned verbatim from our work-in-progress white paper: http://yutu.co.in/about/off-white-paper/  Quote At the end of less than six years, each Lÿnspinz will receive no less than U$250,000 worth of their yAłtçoin yãłtz if: their YouTube brand maintained minimum ranking criteria; there’s an attached affiliate; their yAłtçoin sustained the maximum 99 sojourning PÅQers dowzing yãłtz; their yAłtçoin doesn’t surpass trading above 1 U$ ¢ent (U$.01) per YuTüShãrez (yãłtz).  Although it’s theoretically possible for a Lÿnspinz to earn all U$2M worth of their yAłtçoin yãłtz, a realistic maximum will be somewhere north of U$281,250 if: their YouTube brand maintained maximum ranking criteria; there’s not an affiliate; less than 99 PÅQers dowzed their yAłtçoin yãłtz; their yAłtçoin trades above 1 U$ ¢ent (U$.01) per YuTüShãrez (yãłtz).  Our program is available to any creator on YouTube that Google allows to exist. We WILL NOT discriminate. Also, we won't be catering to a certain genre, e.g. sex, your prowess. And yes, anybody on your staff (no pun intended, but funny nonetheless) is more than welcome to participate as long as they have a YouTube channel, with you acting as their affiliate, handsomely (I've seen your mugs  ) rewarded as outlined on our site. That means the likes of Kat Dior (e.g.) can trade her yAłtçoin token KatDoir on our exchange if she is a Lÿnspinz.  I'll stop here, but please PM me if you're interested in learning more.

Jaguars on Desert Inn Road, which once boasted VIP rooms and a private membership plan that supposedly had fingerprint scan entry, is now a nightclub called Embassy. When the Leopard Lounge opened on Polaris Avenue, the chef gave me a tour of his gourmet kitchen, complete with a sous vide setup. After several name changes, it’s now closed, awaiting another delayed topless club called Sophia’s. The building that once housed popular club Striptease sits vacant, and Seamless is now a gay club called Rendezvous.

Secondly, the deal was closed back in 2015. If the deal wasn't closed, then there is no fuckin way the following could've been declared: http://www.clarkcountynv.gov/business-license/Documents/Oct%2001%20to%20Oct%2031%202016%20L%20G%20Admin%20Decisions.pdf   Here's definitive proof that the deal did go through: https://lasvegassun.com/blogs/kats-report/2015/jan/11/strip-clubs-new-owner-prefers-be-out-spotlight/   Quote Steve Paik isn’t trying to make a name for himself. He’s not trying to be the face of something, and he won’t be seen as the figurehead of anything.  The new owner of Club Paradise would rather you not know who he is. When asked to pose for a photo to help promote the club’s official reopening, the head of the operation politely declined.  “No, I really don’t want to be known in this industry,” said the slender man born in Seoul, South Korea, whose family moved to Philadelphia just two days before the U.S. bicentennial. “I try not to be so out front. I am in this business to make a living, not to socialize.”  He carries this philosophy in an industry where self-promotion is seen as both an art form and a necessary evil.  But one can understand why Paik comes off as so demure. His father was an educator and minister. His cousin David Oh is the first Korean member of the Philadelphia City Council. His family founded the first Korean-American church in Philadelphia. He’s a member of a swanky country club whose members might not applaud one of their friends operating a strip club in Las Vegas.  Quietly, Paik has become a successful businessman, an American success story, though he made his money in an industry that characteristically is naughty, dirty and — especially in Vegas — cutthroat. He operates adult clubs near Atlantic City and Philadelphia, making a good enough living to have traveled around the world. He took his wife and children, who attend private school, to the World Cup in Brazil last year and to the London Olympics in 2012.  Paik bought Club Paradise from Sam Cecola, who on a recent day happened to be in the club and appeared to have the run of the place, though he no longer has money invested in his old business. Cecola flew in from Chicago for the opening and was working in an undefined capacity writing a news release about all the celebrities and sports stars who visited the club over the years.  Cecola points proudly to that star-studded history, when he was the kingpin meeting stars of stage, screen and the sports world. But as we enter 2015, Paik and his club officials are quick to point out that the club's former owner is not working in any official capacity at Club Paradise. Under Cecola's tenure, Club Paradise shut down in June after a raid by Metro detectives and IRS agents acting on reports of credit card fraud and other violations.  That word — fraud — is key to Paik’s purchase of Club Paradise. He’d asked Cecola 4 1/2 years ago about buying the place, and Cecola put up a number that made Paik wince. But years later, Paik found coverage online of Cecola’s trouble at the club and sent an email that read, “Sam, seems like your circumstances have changed. Maybe I can be of help to you.”  Today, Paik promises to operate Club Paradise with class and integrity, and hopes to fill the 197-capacity venue with people who can spend moderately.  “I don’t need the few customers who are going to spend a lot of money,” Paik said. “I’d rather see a lot of people enjoying themselves with a small amount of money.”  Paik plans to track credit card receipts painstakingly, since that was a factor in the club’s closure last summer.  And he needs to enter the knife fight with limo and taxicab companies who bring customers to strip clubs but charge high per-customer fees. Limo companies can demand as much as $90 per head, even though the average club customer spends only about $60 per visit.  Paik is learning, fast, how to operate in that culture.  “If everybody else is doing it, paying limo and taxi guys, I have to do it,” Paik said. “It’s unavoidable.”  When asked what his imprint will be at Club Paradise, Paik speaks with the precision of a CEO: “I intend to provide a good service and a fun environment where customers can come in and enjoy without spending a fortune.”  For Paik, that’s as close to brazen as you’ll get.

The Legends Room 4416 Paradise Road Las Vegas NV 89169 USA  It should correlate to this, however it is under a completely different address.  Please prove ownership of the club, there is no rationale when raising 15 million dollars that this should be private.  LOL Sherlock, the company that runs the club can be based at any address, in this case the club manager/agent address.  And the token sale is about getting a membership to the club not about owning a piece of the club.  He is labeled as a club owner. Does he actually own the club? These are very simple questions that anyone would ask.  He owns the club, yes we already said that. But these documents are private, no club needs to show their purchase documents for obvious reasons. You are simply hanging on a mirror made of glass with this argument because you got nothing to prove this is a scam.  You are so unprofessional, we advise anyone to steer clear from icocountdown.  U can't even quote us properly  We have shown enough proof for the people involved in this club, all you are doing is trolling. That is the truth.

How soon can I come to the location and claim this value?  As per the video above the refurbished club should be ready for the public in early April.  You do get 5000 dollars worth of drinks and dances together with a membership, but you also get the chance to rent your membership when unused at a price you choose.

Its very rare for a night club or gentlemen's club to be in business for 20 years.  So these memberships will most likely only be good for the next 5 years or so. With Vegas getting a Hockey team and a Football team a club that is right across the street from the stadium with Adult film stars and UFC fighters is something that I think people will want around for a very long time!

It's you having a YouTube channel that interests me. Although currently not having any following to speak of, The Legends Room channel is still able to earn Lÿnspinz status on our platform dubbed YuTü.Ço.in (under the auspices of YuTübopołis) during our nascent stage, our IÇO maintained at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1801101.0 (future requirements to obtain Lÿnspinz status will be exponentially more difficult to achieve as we further develop).  Short and sweet (or: in a nutshell; puns intended in the vein [pun not intended] of your venture, if you get my drift  ), YuTü.Ço.in's core platform consists of trading YouTube channels/creators' brands as crypto-commodities - yAłtçoins - on our propriety exchange, YTÇ-Sốx (purposely rhymes with Mt Gox, but a non-nefarious, near fully transparent exchange). In The Legends Room channel's case, the ticker symbol (TiçSÿm) on our exchange would most likely be LR, perhaps stylized as LR (naming and stylization only a logical suggestion, you having full control as to what it should be), the accompanied logo a given -> .  It costs nothing to join, with creators NEVER doling out one satoshi in enjoying everything our platform will have to offer. For all practical purposes there's no risk, with a creator able to end their relationship with us at any time sans delays - immediately expunging their brand off any and all our platforms for whatever reasons. All a YouTube creator has to do to be, and remain a Lÿnspinz in good standing is to: provide a link to their presence on our site from their YouTube channel's About page; have at least one other link to the same site stemming from ANY website or social media platform that they maintain; upload at least one video per month that's more than 3:14 in length, or any number of videos within a 30-day period totally 3:14 or more. THAT IS ALL!  Without going into too much detail (already long, with apologies), the main reward that creators receive in return for the aforementioned is that their yAłtçoin will eventually produce 200,000,000 shares (yãłtz) valued at least $2,000,000 ($0.01 ea. min.), created over the course of ~5.945586 years (plus (17,187,500 yãłtz in reserve). A max of 100 virtual miners will be hashing each yAłtçoin via assignable PÅQs maintained on respective permissioned blockchains.  Gleaned verbatim from our work-in-progress white paper: http://yutu.co.in/about/off-white-paper/     Our program is available to any creator on YouTube that Google allows to exist. We WILL NOT discriminate. Also, we won't be catering to a certain genre, e.g. sex, your prowess. And yes, anybody on your staff (no pun intended, but funny nonetheless) is more than welcome to participate as long as they have a YouTube channel, with you acting as their affiliate, handsomely (I've seen your mugs  ) rewarded as outlined on our site. That means the likes of Kat Dior (e.g.) can trade her yAłtçoin token KatDoir on our exchange if she is a Lÿnspinz.  I'll stop here, but please PM me if you're interested in learning more. I'm located in Bullhead City, AZ, across from Laughlin, NV, not too far from your location. I can provide you a number if you desire to speak in person.

Or stops by my gym which is open 12 hours a day.  The truth is that the Topless Vegas Online article changed our entire business. We received calls from clubs in Las Vegas and other states to bring the Legends Room there. Memberships, digital currency and UFC stars has captured a lot of attention.  We also received an offer to purchase over $1,000,000 worth of memberships by a publicly traded company which we are finalizing. While this was going on, the actual owner of Centerfolds wound up in jail. The case number is 2015-14333 in Montgomery County, PA.  Look it up if you want because they certainly will not tell you about it if you call the phone number. The existing management was very hostile for fear of losing their jobs and we received a report regarding continuing unethical activity there. We don't know if the unethical activity was true or not but it raised a concern given an absentee owner and the hostility of the management. We also received some information which we were in process of verifying that there may be some structural issues with the actual building and some code violations.  Again all of this is part of the diligence process and consistent with our stated goal to deliver the best experience for our members.  The membership comes first today and every day. Ask anyone who has been a member of my gym whether it's a pro fighter or a guy trying to lose weight in beginner's muay thai. Ask Dana White if you see him about One Kick Nick.

The facility is 3x the size of Centerfolds which will allow for bigger events, more celebrities, more frequent token rentals for all members, and most importantly more hot girls.

Frankly I love the idea and am a huge fan of Vegas, and would love to purchase this.  I have (more than) $5k in bitcoin ready right now, but before plopping down five grand (well, ok, $4500 until the 10th), I NEED to know the answer to ALL these questions:  -I'm not following your math here.  You say on the purchase page that 1 ETH = 12 VIP, and you need 5000 VIP for the lifetime membership, so 416.66 ETH is required for the ""$4500"" purchase.  Except that ETH is, at the time of this writing, worth $17.90 a pop, which would make it 17.9 * 416.66 = $7458.33 total cost.  What gives?  EDIT: Whoops, wasn't taking into account the 10% discount, but even with the -10%, it is still $6712.50  -What date will the club be opening?  -If we pay for it in anything other than ETH how are we supposed to know what exchange rate you're using so we won't be short like $2 or whatever?   What if I am going by Finex's rate of Dash and send what I think is $4500 worth and this DOES happen?  -With all this confusion, I might just go ahead and put this on my Visa.  In the event that I use a credit card, do I still get the 10% discount and drink/dance credit?  -Do the drink/dance credits have any expiration?  -When I rent out my membership, is there any way I can transfer/sell some of my drink or dance credit to the guy renting out my membership?  -When we rent out our membership, what are the different ways we can get paid?

If you purchase in the presale the price is $4500 USD and if you buy that much in Ether or any cryptocurrency and do not receive the full 5000 VIP tokens the Legends Room will top up your balance at the end of the sale so that you have the correct amount. Unlike other sales you are not at the mercy of the price fluctuation.  There isn't a set date yet, the club is set to open around April, when we get closer to completion we will make an announcement.  So long as you pay $4500 worth of any cryptocurrency you will get a full membership (5000 VIP) during the presale, $5000 worth during the official sale.  Yes if you pay via CC you still get 10% off during the presale only.  Drinks/Dances have no expiration.  We haven't discussed the transfer of drink/dance credits to potential ""renters"" but we can find out if it's a highly requested feature.

When does the club open? It's open now. People are welcome to go and check out Centerfolds. Memberships won't be honored until the change over.

Members but not the general public nor prospective members will be allowed in to these events. They will  be ""pop up"" style due to the nature of the people involved, media commitments, and construction.  AND what are you going to do with the $15,000,000  We aren't trying to raise $15,000,000. We have lifetime memberships that we are selling for $5000 and we will offer a max of 3000. Remember when the airlines used to offer unlimited flying for $100,000? Same thinking here.  We believe 3000 will allow our members to have a unique VIP experience,  a lot quality time with our numerous celebrities, UFC fighters, and adult stars and the ability to consistently deliver the best of Las Vegas to the guys that join us.  If we meet 3000 smart guys during this offering, great. If not, that's ok to because we know what we have.  Whatever is raised in the sale of memberships will be used to enhance the club experience, physical improvements, marketing, as well as legal and compliance. This is outlined in detail in the offering document.

You do not spend VIP tokens they are just for access. You can rent or lease your tokens when you are not using the club if you would like to earn income. On big event nights memberships cold rent for thousands of dollars. You can also trade the tokens on crypto exchanges where on big nights they will most likely go up in value.

Each membership comes with $2500 worth of drinks and $2500 worth of dances, this is a very similar model that a lot of private clubs work with however they just don't give so much free stuff away.
