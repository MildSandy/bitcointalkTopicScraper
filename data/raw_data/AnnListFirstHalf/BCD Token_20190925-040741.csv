The rest part will be given on different conditions to different parties based on multistakeholder model discretion, internal BitCAD governance system.  Each participant can directly influence to the development of the project and the development of BitCAD policies, procedures and business processes. BitCAD community is interested in hearing the opinion of everyone.  At BitCAD, you’ll hear a lot about our bottom-up, consensus-driven multistakeholder process. This means that every individual involved in the process has a voice and can be heard. Every viewpoint added to the BitCAD community makes our decisions richer.  A good example of the necessity for this governance model can serve a potential abuse of the smart contracts and DAO's possibilities with negative intent.  BitCAD's policy and procedures development process is based on a multistakeholder model.  All over the world, each participant can create a local organization or structure of BitCAD. The ultimate goal is to organize at least one structure in each country.  A vital element in BitCAD's processes is the opportunity for public comment on each substantial piece of work before it is considered for approval. These topics can be operational (such as budget or strategic planning), technical (such as security reports and recommendations) or policy-oriented (such as Bylaw changes).  The following principles guide the public comment process: Each item posted for public comment is available for a minimum of 21 days. If comments are received, then at the close of the comment period, a reply period begins, lasting a minimum of 21 days. If no substantive comments are received during the comment period, then there will be no reply period. During the reply period, participants should address previous comments submitted; new posts concerning the topic should not be introduced. When constructing replies, contributors are asked to cite the original poster’s name, comment date, and any particular text that is pertinent.  b. Remaining, unsold tokens from the crowdsale budget will be hold and sold privately to institutional investors or on the next crowdsale. In that case, the best price maintaining guarantee can be influenced by the early ICO participants themselves.  BCD tokens are proof of priority membership in the BitCAD’s Board of Directors. Give the right to access to participation in profits and voting rights, commensurate with the value of tokens. Owners of tokens can directly participate in the development of BitCAD policies, procedures and business processes.  Good luck!  p.s.

Anybody who passed anonymous system identification could become a participant of that business. Every user of BitCAD has a right to make a suggestion, also he is able to regulate policy of engagement in BitCAD by consensus. From the moment of registration every user has his own history, which shapes his business reputation. All workflow including accounting, taxes, insurance could be fully automated.  In the future, to open and register your business on BitCAD platform you should do 5 simple actions:  1) Download an application or launch web version of BitCAD app 2) The first time you run BitCAD you will be able to pass primary biometric authentication according to the law 3) The next thing which BitCAD do is encrypting your personal data and then send the public key into BitCAD system for registration. The Private key is your face as well as the vein patterns or another unique biometric information in its digitized version, which is one-of-a-kind itself and it`s always kept with you at all times. As the system requires private key only, It gives you an opportunity to log in the system from any device. User decide himself what kind of information will be allowed into the open source. Even hidden information identificate the user by his public key and his history of operations - the reputation. 4) After that, the user creates his own profile including necessary information about his profession, job experience, what he can offer and what does he need, description of business processes exist in his industry, etc... 5) Machine-learning system is searching for more appropriate contacts and offer solutions. It may be training new skills or database containing potential and existing buyers of the products or services which the new user provides.

Ethereum tried to rush their IPO in february 2014. This would turned out not well. Very good they listened and delayed it for couple of month. I think you should delay your ICO at least for another month not a week as you did. This way you will get much more media attention and get exposure to more potential investors. 2. ICO pricing / distribution model. Ethereum price was 2000 ETH for 1 BTC (1BTC at that price was around $600) this means around 30 cents per ETH. Your price is 1800 BCD for 1 BTC at current price levels of $1500-1600 that's around $0.85-$1+ for every BCD depending on when to buy into this ICO. This is a hard one to swallow considering the following facts:  a. The BIG difference is that Ethereum most of their IPO supply gave to purchasers 83.5%, 8.3% to Early contributors and 8.3% long term endowment fund + You had mining come into the supply equation gradually! You can look at the details here: https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org/blob/master/public/pdf/TermsAndConditionsOfTheEthereumGenesisSale.pdf  BitCAD instant supply is 100Million from which you allocate only 51% to purchasers. The rest could be considered a free premine that will be given on different conditions to different parties based on your discretion. This is NOT good at all.  b. You aim to a theoretical sell of 51,000,000 BCD / 1800 for 28,333 BTC @ current $1500 = $42,500,000 ? This with a rushed launch? Suppose you sell 25,000,000 BCD...the rest you write that you reserve the right to sell privately to institutional investors. Great! At cheaper price then ICO price? Can you guarantee us they will not receive a better price then ICO investors so these institutional investors don't sell their coins or manipulate the price?  This is very serious you are talking about big money here but as it seems the way you handle this is very unprofessional.  3. Is your project open source? If not this complicates the matters. Are we talking about a privately owned network for public use?  I'm sorry to say but unless you delay your ICO and change the distribution model to something more palatable I will not invest a single $ in your ICO although I would be willing if the above is addressed.  Have a nice day!  p.s Get rid of that logo with the Illuminati eye, it's doing you more harm than good...",True
