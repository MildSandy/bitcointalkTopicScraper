The first stage that included development of the idea, its execution and creation of the MVP, was fueled by inexhaustible enthusiasm of the team.  We created a product that is ready for ICO and is aimed at becoming one of the prominent leaders of the gaming niche. An original idea, a well thought out gameplay and unique workings in the blockchainization of the game economy will help KingSlayer to achieve that.  The second stage of monetization is fund raising during the ICO stage. Token sale will help us to finish what we started, which is to create a successful blend of an MMORPG and a blockchain. This will only take a couple of months and we will release a fully functioning version of the game where every investor will get an opportunity to have fun during their free time.  The third stage of monetization is when the project will work for itself. Fees from transactions, trades and purchases/sales of tokenized items on the secondary market will provide the project with funds for further development.  For the main part, financial support will be provided by Virtual Gaming Platform partners. Their investments will become the backbone of the project and will keep the KingSlayer platform functioning for decades to come!

The domestic currency is the basis of any economy. The virtual world is no different from the real one, so there is also a lot of attention paid to monetary units. The game KingSlayer accepts VGC tokens as a currency. This kind of tokens is developed on the basis of NEP-5 standard.  VGC tokens have the following functions: - payment method within in-game purchases; - ability to form a prize fund in PvP and clan battles; - reward to development partners.  KingSlayer provides rewards in the form of VGC tokens for certain actions and achievements to attract more players and interest them.  Any player will be able to receive daily rewards for a number of simple actions, such as finding a heavenly airship and get closer to him.  Players can also receive rewards for the following actions:  - completing quests; - getting a new level; - capture of the fortress.  The received tokens can be used as in the gameplay (for hiring and strengthening heroes, purchasing game items, etc.), or transferred to the player's wallet.",False
