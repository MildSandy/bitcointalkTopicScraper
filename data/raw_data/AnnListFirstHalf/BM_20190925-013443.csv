BITCOMO Pre-Sale and Crowdsale are not restricted and/or prohibited by US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Governmet of People's Republic of China or Korea. BM token in fact is the license for BITCOMO platform usage. Thus being sold at crowdsale BM coin is the obligation of BITCOMO to deliver its services to the holders of BM coin in future. This is a so called Utility Token. On the other hand this does not prevent our investors to speculate our tokens (obligations).

For instance, Ethereum run 5 transactions in a second. It is quite a slow and heavy solution. Our private operator provides the creation and distribution of a transaction many times faster. MetaHash is a completely different solution to distribute the data in a blockchain.  It means that speed of transactions in our private Blockchain operator is 10 times higher than speed offered by other operators,  After Bitcomo ICO and proving to the world 500 000 QPS - transactions per second and more - such speed on our blockchain nodes, we planing to run this operator as public version and as different project.",True
