We have held back on announcing dates as we are focusing on building our technology and ensuring that we have what we need in place to be a successful project. We understand that this has taken longer than expected, however the ICO and crypto space is an extremely fast paced environment and therefore projects need to adapted to the environment in order to succeed. Therefore, there is no need to rush a project. We would rather hold back and ensure that we have everything in place to secure the success of the project. No highly successful company/project happened over night, there is a lot that has to happen behind the scenes for a company to become successful.  Holding back on our ICO has allowed us to not only better prepare for the next ICO, it has also allowed the company to grow and expand in ways that we never even imagined. We are growing and building stronger partnerships with huge global organisations, our RaidParty application has had so much interest from both players and developers, we have had to limit the beta to number of registrations to ensure that our servers can take the load. It also has the interest of some very cool and potentially huge games, which has allowed us to provide some very cool and big rewards and giveaways.

Let's assume the rate would always be 6,000 for simplicity, that would equal 250,000 ETH (at a rate of 7,000 it would still be 200,000 ETH). So this would be $200-250m. The hard cap is $20m though. This doesn't add up, the sale would be over out at around 150-200,000,000 FORCE. I don't get it, how would the 1,170,000,001 - 1,500,000,000 range ever be reached?

For starters, when we first decided upon our hard cap, which is fixed to the price of ETH, the value of ETH was much lower. Our hard cap should really be set against a fixed amount of ETH, however we have already changed our hard cap twice and we want to refrain from consistently changing things and causing confusion.  Another reason for our hard cap being much lower than what you suggested above, is due to the community and there response. We originally set our hard cap to $60m. Since then we have had the community state that we should lower our hard cap.  The purpose of the hard cap is to stop an ICO from raising more than it needs. Our goal is $20m and therefore we have set our hard cap at $20m. Taking more than that would be greedy and unnecessary. We are here to empower the community with our technology, not take from them. We have a solid four plan which we have reviewed multiple times with many of our advisors who come from strong business backgrounds, from which we have strategically planned so that $20m covers the project for 4 years.  Due to us deciding upon the total supply back in 2017, this has also had an effect and therefore is the reason why we will be left with some many extra tokens. However, our smart contracts are designed to only mint the amount of FORCE that is purchased, meaning that if only 1m FORCE were bought, that would be all the FORCE that would exist. Rather than burning the rest of the supply, it makes more sense to only mint what is purchased. I hope that makes sense?  I understand that this may cause some confusion, but we are trying to balance between constantly changing things and causing confusion as well as getting things right. The way we see it is that, $20m is now our hard cap. That is what we need $20m to carry out our 4 year plan. Taking anymore than $20m would therefore be unnecessary.  ~ Jake Ashby, General Manager TriForce Tokens",False

There are many factors that have come into play which has effected this. For starters, when we first decided upon our hard cap, which is fixed to the price of ETH, the value of ETH was much lower. Our hard cap should really be set against a fixed amount of ETH, however we have already changed our hard cap twice and we want to refrain from consistently changing things and causing confusion.  Another reason for our hard cap being much lower than what you suggested above, is due to the community and there response. We originally set our hard cap to $60m. Since then we have had the community state that we should lower our hard cap.  The purpose of the hard cap is to stop an ICO from raising more than it needs. Our goal is $20m and therefore we have set our hard cap at $20m. Taking more than that would be greedy and unnecessary. We are here to empower the community with our technology, not take from them. We have a solid four plan which we have reviewed multiple times with many of our advisors who come from strong business backgrounds, from which we have strategically planned so that $20m covers the project for 4 years.  Due to us deciding upon the total supply back in 2017, this has also had an effect and therefore is the reason why we will be left with some many extra tokens. However, our smart contracts are designed to only mint the amount of FORCE that is purchased, meaning that if only 1m FORCE were bought, that would be all the FORCE that would exist. Rather than burning the rest of the supply, it makes more sense to only mint what is purchased. I hope that makes sense?  I understand that this may cause some confusion, but we are trying to balance between constantly changing things and causing confusion as well as getting things right. The way we see it is that, $20m is now our hard cap. That is what we need $20m to carry out our 4 year plan. Taking anymore than $20m would therefore be unnecessary.  So to answer your question, our hard cap is fixed at $20m. We will not take more than $20m. Whatever is minted, is final.  Thank you for raising this point, its a great question and I am sure it will help the rest of the community as well.  I hope I have answered your question? If there is any other questions you may have, I'd be happy to answer them.  ~ Jake Ashby, General Manager TriForce Tokens  ",False

However he has raised a few areas where he believes there would be some synergy between TriForce Tokens and Wargaming.net.

But let's just be clear:  1) of the 2,000,000,000 tokens, none have yet been minted I assume?  2) 1ETH will remain pegged to 6,000 tokens regardless then?  3) So only 25% of total supply of all tokens minted will not be sold rather than the fixed amount of 0.5bn?  4) If above is correct, then why not just change the token limits now?

No tokens have been minted to date, tokens will only get minted at the point of purchase in the pre-sale starting tomorrow (20th February 2018) at 12:30pm UTC.  The nominal value is 1 ETH = 6,000 FORCE, yes.  Sorry, I don't quite understand question 3.  Like I explained in my previous post, we have already changed and adapted many things within our ICO and business. To keep amending things not only takes time but it also causes confusion within the community. Regardless of the total supply available, only what is purchased will get minted. So therefore changing the total supply will have no affect anyways? What isn't purchased won't get minted and therefore will never hit the markets or anyones wallets.  I understand that it has caused some confusion, but rather than causing more confusion by making more community announcements less than 24 hours before the opening of the token sale will only have adverse affects. Our community has not raised these issues or concerns with us before and therefore we have not exerted our time or resources on amending this.

The idea is to allow gamers to create a revenue stream through other mediums. Our business model and vision is to help game developers. By allowing re-sales of games, developers will lose out on further profits. Which goes against what we are trying to do; we are helping developers increase profits and revenue streams.  Secondly, selling of second hand games is another ball game in itself. We would have to build a system that checks the that the seller is actually providing what they are stating they are selling and that it is in a decent condition. There would also be other legal framework around that.  I'm not saying we won't ever do it. It may well be something we consider and look into in the future.

I've looked at a lot of projects from GameFlip and Crycash (game item trading and incentives), Play2Live, Dreamteam and Firstblood (eSports) and The Abyss (digital distribution). My gut sense is that there are so many niches in gaming that there is space for a relatively high number of successful blockchain services. That being said, speaking as an avid gamer myself, the project that has impressed me the most as an end user so far has been this one.  For me the key USPs that make TriforceTokens stand out are: Their honour system shows they have a real respect for community in gaming and are making it a core priority, which - let's face it - is the cornerstone of the whole thing. They want to promote collaboration and  positive interactions in the gaming community with their ecosystem, which I think is imperative. The wrong incentive system could turn the whole thing into a toxic play2win farm-a-thon with everyone out for themselves- and so it strikes me that TriforceTokens is doing the right thing in keeping the gaming experience at the heart of their project. People are going to want to be on the platform where the community is top notch, not just where the biggest numbers initially are. As a connected note, I think it's very promising how seriously they are taking the market research side of things - drawing upon big data and behavioural analysis, so they can deliver what we, as gamers, actually want, as the project develops and evolves Likewise, I think their relatively modest company size makes them a lot more agile in this regard - allowing them to actively listen to and respond to the community (they are not a huge, faceless multinational that only looks at the quant charts). In fact, judging from the social media, many of the team are avid gamers themselves... so it's refreshing to have people with a personal stake in the industry at the helm of a project like this They care about indie games and developers, not only by prioritising making their platform available to the smaller players too, but also with respect to their approach to piracy. TFT could end up being an affordable anti-piracy solution that would allow even small developers to safeguard their revenue.  All of which says to me that, although TFT may not be the biggest player in the market currently - they are showing all the right signs of being able to deliver something truly revolutionary that, in addition to helping boost developers' revenue, will reflect what gamers actually want, and that IMPROVES the gaming experience, rather than detracts from it. And the gamer in me is very excited about that.",False

Reading through many ICO telegram groups, it’s quite daunting to see that many self-proclaimed “Real” ICOs aren’t implementing or straight up refuse to implement a KYC or AML process.  One comment I read today was rather deluded and worrisome:  “KYC reduces no. of investors… and there is no need for KYC for an ICO…”  They continued with:  “There are so many scam ICOs that demand KYC and then the documents are forged… so stay alert. Don’t risk ur identity for a few bucks.”  Now, to some with very little knowledge within the crypto space, this would sound like a reasonable reason for an ICO to not implement a KYC or an AML process. However, being in and surrounded by the crypto space this rings alarm bells.  Our advice: Be very wary of any ICOs or projects that do not have and argue against implementing a KYC or AML process.  https://medium.com/@triforcetokens/why-is-the-kyc-aml-process-so-important-959e721d68f7",False

His other accolades include Counter Strike Player of the Year ’05, and NA Player of the Decade. Known as ‘the greatest American Counter Strike player of all time’, Danny has had an extremely successful career in Counter Strike.  Ever since retiring, he has been getting more involved in eSports and has held positions through his consultancy managing and coaching for FaZe Clan, Florida International University, and more. With a financial background, he is now looking to make a splash in the Cryptocurrency/ICO space.  Statement by Danny:  “TriForce Tokens quickly caught my attention with the aim at being a community centered token. Not only is there various forms of protection and security, there is everything you would need to engage in your community. Also, it is important to note that there are multiple sources of revenue generation that is untapped for any content creator and developer. This is something the industry lacks as there are no profitable solutions to engage in the community, while growing it and securing it. TriForce Tokens not only seems to solve a lot of these issues, but also implement an honorary system to keep the community fun and safe for everyone.”  Danny’s deep knowledge and experience within the gaming industry will be a huge asset to us that we aim to make the best use of to guarantee the growth and success for TriForce Tokens, and we look forward to working with him.  ~ Jake Ashby, General Manager TriForce Tokens",False

TriForce Tokens pools all your virtual assets into a single ecosystem – independent of game, studio, developer or platform. That means new ways to play and new ways to profit: help others to level up, join raids, trade virtual assets, use them on different games, earn rewards from in-game bounties – even earn from your gaming skills. TriForce Tokens is powering new monetization opportunities in a positive and profitable community of gamers.  Here are three aspects that really make TriForce Tokens unique:  **Unexplored Revenue Streams** – Creating a community everyone benefits from. Our technology stack will provide new revenue streams to both players, developers and publishers. These revenue streams will range from transfer fees placed by developers, honey pots and our honouree reward system to name a few. Our honouree reward system will not only allow the transfer of FORCE between players, but it will also encourage and foster collaborative behaviour. The honouree system is designed to allow players to send/donate FORCE to one another in exchange for assistance, support or guidance.  **Anti-Piracy Engine** – Piracy is affecting the entire entertainment industry, all though it cannot be eradicated; there are measures that can be taken to reduce it. TriForce Tokens working alongside Coventry University aims to provide real world solutions to help minimise and combat piracy within the gaming industry. Our Piracy engine and solutions are an on-going research project to ensure that our technology and solutions are up-to-date and sound at all times.  **Social Engagement Platform** – As part of our efforts to create a collaborative and cohesive gaming community, we are currently in the works of building a social engagement platform that brings the entire gaming community under one roof. No longer will there be barriers between console and PC communication, our platform will allow players to community at anytime, anywhere. Packed with tonnes of cool features, our platform will definitely be a game changer. As part of the platform, our technology will track player behaviour which it will analyse and provide to game developers allowing them to better understand the needs, wants and desires of their chosen audience.  These are 3 main aspects that sets TriForce Tokens apart, but it doesn’t stop there. Be sure to check out our white paper to delve deeper into what really makes TriForce Tokens a game changer: https://triforcetokens.io/resources/white-paper-v3.3.pdf  ~ Jake Ashby, General Manager TriForce Tokens",False

Here are three aspects that really make TriForce Tokens unique:  **Unexplored Revenue Streams** – Creating a community everyone benefits from. Our technology stack will provide new revenue streams to both players, developers and publishers. These revenue streams will range from transfer fees placed by developers, honey pots and our honouree reward system to name a few. Our honouree reward system will not only allow the transfer of FORCE between players, but it will also encourage and foster collaborative behaviour. The honouree system is designed to allow players to send/donate FORCE to one another in exchange for assistance, support or guidance.  **Anti-Piracy Engine** – Piracy is affecting the entire entertainment industry, all though it cannot be eradicated; there are measures that can be taken to reduce it. TriForce Tokens working alongside Coventry University aims to provide real world solutions to help minimise and combat piracy within the gaming industry. Our Piracy engine and solutions are an on-going research project to ensure that our technology and solutions are up-to-date and sound at all times.  **Social Engagement Platform Mobile App** – As part of our efforts to create a collaborative and cohesive gaming community, we are currently in the works of building a social engagement platform that brings the entire gaming community under one roof. No longer will there be barriers between console and PC communication, our platform will allow players to community at anytime, anywhere. Packed with tonnes of cool features, our platform will definitely be a game changer. As part of the platform, our technology will track player behaviour which it will analyse and provide to game developers allowing them to better understand the needs, wants and desires of their chosen audience.  These are 3 main aspects that sets TriForce Tokens apart, but it doesn’t stop there. Be sure to check out our white paper to delve deeper into what really makes TriForce Tokens a game changer: https://triforcetokens.io/resources/white-paper-v3.3.pdf  ~ Jake Ashby, General Manager TriForce Tokens",False

I rarely make an appearance on our social channels so I thought it would be worth saying a quick hello and giving an update on the developments the tech team have made.  Firstly, our Smart Contracts are now available on github, deployed on testnet and ready to deploy on the mainnet. For any technical reviewers you can take a look on our github repo here: https://github.com/TriForceNetwork/TokenSaleContracts  We are also offering a bug bounty, should you happen to come across potential issues that you can submit to us on our bounty thread on bitcointalk: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2236918 You will receive a number of stakes in the bounty programme determined by the severity of the bug found.  With regards to our central intelligence API hub and developer portal, these are well underway and we aim to have an initial release prior to our token sale launch on 20th February. This hub is the glue for the entire stack being built and will help us secure many opportunities from companies that have reached out to us so far.  Our social games engagement mobile app, RaidParty is also being developed and again aim to have a preliminary release prior to 20th February. This application is going to give players a way of helping each other out in exchange for rewards and will be connected to the intelligence hub.  There are a few other tricks up our sleeves but due to competitors we are not prepared to release further information as we suspect some have been taking our ideas. In some ways it's a great sign that we are the real innovators and our research has paid off. We are confident though that being leaders in this space means we will always be one step ahead of projects that do this.  Finally, thank you to the support everyone has given from the community and all the ideas that have been sent our way. Having a strong community is the heart and soul of this project.  ~ Raza Ahmed, CTO TriForce Tokens",False

In order to abide by many countries legislation and regulations, they now require you to conduct or implement a KYC process before allowing anyone to contribute towards your ICO. It is a good practice that any good and legitimate ICO will implement.  As long as you are not trying to launder money or you are on some government watchlist, you have nothing to worry about. It is a simple 5 minute process that will just ask for some of your details and for some government issued ID. Once you have completed and your details have been cross referenced with government databases, if all is okay and we get the green light, you will be added to the whitelist. The whitelist is a list of approved contributors. In order to participate in the token sale, you need to be on the whitelist.  You should be quick however, as we have limited spaces on the whitelist. Only 2,000 participants at this point.  You will be able to start the KYC process as of the 16th January 2018.

Its vision is to encourage a collaborative and cohesive gaming community, a more socially interactive community that everyone benefits from.  Here are three aspects that really make TriForce Tokens unique:  **Unexplored Revenue Streams** – As part of our plan to create a community everyone benefits from, we also want to make the community profitable for everyone involved. Our technology stack will provide new revenue streams to both players, streamers, developers and publishers. These revenue streams will range from transfer fees placed by developers, honey pots and our honouree reward system to name a few. Our honouree reward system will not only allow the transfer of FORCE between players, but it will also encourage and foster collaborative behaviour. The honouree system is designed to allow players to send/donate FORCE to one another in exchange for assistance, support or guidance.  **Anti-Piracy Engine** – Piracy is affecting the entire entertainment industry, all though it cannot be eradicated; there are measures that can be taken to reduce it. TriForce Tokens working alongside Coventry University aims to provide real world solutions to help minimise and combat piracy within the gaming industry. Our Piracy engine and solutions are an on-going research project to ensure that our technology and solutions are up-to-date and sound at all times.  **Social Engagement Platform** – As part of our efforts to create a collaborative and cohesive gaming community, we are currently in the works of building a social engagement platform that brings the entire gaming community under one roof. No longer will there be barriers between console and PC communication, our platform will allow players to community at anytime, anywhere. Packed with tonnes of cool features, our platform will definitely be a game changer. As part of the platform, our technology will track player behaviour which it will analyse and provide to game developers allowing them to better understand the needs, wants and desires of their chosen audience.  These are 3 main aspects that sets TriForce Tokens apart, but it doesn’t stop there. Be sure to check out our white paper to delve deeper into what really makes TriForce Tokens a game changer: https://triforcetokens.io/resources/white-paper-v3.3.pdf",False

What we are doing is setting up a research framework with the University to study it and then look at how blockchain can help to reduce it - to the point of saving developers from losing revenue. We do have some concepts that need a lot of backing to be able to adeqately benchmark it against studies - it's going to require a lot of data crunching, analysis and stress testing.  There are other benefits to this beyond trying to resolve a near impossible issue such as being resourced by a University, networking opportunities (in terms of business development) and here in the UK there are specific tax benefits too.

We wanted to gage whether it was worth continuing or not with the project. Our early pre-sale brought in around $75k which has also lead to further larger private investments.

We are fully aware and understand that piracy is not simple nor will it be completely eradicated. No matter what policies, procedure, software, technology etc is put in place, people will find away around it. What we aim to do is to work closely with Coventry University to better understand that root of the problem, why people pirate games. With this knowledge we are able to build our technology to provide a solution that helps minimise piracy by making it more profitable to the pirates whilst making it profitable to the developers where possible. We want to find that balance and fine line to ensure that we provide solutions to the industry that help make an impact, especially for smaller games developers.  Yes there are plenty of other organisations out there that already conduct such research and provide such solutions. But is it working? From the research we have conducted already, punishing someone only leads to further negative behaviour. By pointing out their mistakes and offering them a chance to redeem themselves, people seem to take a more positive approach. Not to mention, we aren't targeting these large development companies, our main target market is that of indie game developers, the underdogs if you will. The developers who lose large amounts of revenue to organisations who simply provide a gateway to consumers. We want to help the underdogs, providing them with new and unexplored revenue streams whilst helping reduce revenue loss through piracy. Thats not to say we won't provide our solutions and technology to the big guys, we are just concentrating our focus and therefore market.  Regarding the white paper, what Pete meant by that was its easy to judge a book by its cover. But until you delve into it and really get into the grit of it, will you really see their true colours. The white paper will allow you to make a true judgement of a project. Websites, banners and social media channels are all designed to look good and entice you, which anyone can do with the know how or the money. But to put together a solid and sound white paper, with real solutions to industry problems, now that takes time, effort and dedication.  Lastly, I understand your scepticism. However, ask yourself this. Why would an internationally recognised institution such as Coventry University put their reputation on the line for a blockchain start up that they don't believe in, baring in mind all of the controversies around it?

What I would say then is, consider Vadim Bulatov who is a head at Wargaming.net (100m+ gamers worldwide). He came across us and immediately understood what challenges we are working to solve (he then joined as an adviser). He is someone that works in this industry and recognised something in us, particularly around the social aspects and fostering positive communities within gaming.  From the conversations and research we have conducted with gamers, developers and industry professionals - we have a unique proposition and a demand (two companies even reached to us to declare their support and interest). Our focus is to now deliver this technology and build the community that will support us in this endeavour, which is going very well.  ~ Pete Mardell, CEO TriForce Tokens",False

Also please don't take our response as a challenge either, we just have to clarify a few points.  So there are two main areas we have to look at to answer this question. The first is, is the games industry market saturated with cryptocurrency solutions? The second is, how diverse is the games industry and how does our particular project fit into this diversification. Or in short, how is our project unique?  We have to consider that the games industry is huge. Think about how many cryptocurrency users exist, how many exchanges there are - and our crypto industry is nothing compared to the number of people playing games and revenues generated through businesses in the games industry. Just to highlight the difference in the crypto industry to the games industry - a recent benchmark study by Cambridge University suggests that there are around 5.8 million active users in crypto exchanges and up to 11.5 million active wallets.  Compare that to the games industry there is reported to be a staggering 1.2 billion people playing games globally. That means something like 1 out of every 6/7 person on the planet is a game player. Consider as well the revenues generated in this industry well exceed $106Bn and grows on average by 6.5% annually. It's just simply a massive industry with hundreds of niche areas to engage with.  Then to look at all the gaming crypto projects that are being launched - none are really in full production, none have dominated the market because it's just such a new innovative industry. You say that there are hundreds of gaming related crypto projects, but if there is really that many, how many are actually penetrating the market? We know of a small handful that are making real progress - but again they are not established. We're not saying that other crypto projects in this space are bad (as you mention some have secured partnerships) - it's just early days for this industry with massive opportunities as we all know.  So specifically where do we fit into the games industry then and how 'different' are we?  Our project is focused on developing/fostering the interactive games communities - that exist in a multitude of formats. We are creating specific solutions that doesn't just throw a product or service at gamers and developers, it has been carefully structured and crafted to create stronger unity between them. For example, one particular aspect that we are developing is addressing the issue of gamers going in breach of EULAs for games. This is lost revenue for the developers and publishers, plus is not smooth sailing for gamers that actually wish to pursue these avenues. Our solutions actually work to benefit both gamers and developers in these situations - even going so far as to improve player retention. This is just the surface, to really get into the detail it would be best to go through our white paper https://triforcetokens.io/resources/white-paper-v3.3.pdf and pitch deck https://triforcetokens.io/resources/pitch-deck-v1.4.2.pdf.  We understand the challenges faced by both sides having been involved in some external game markets myself, I can tell you there is a massive opportunity to monetise these activities, something I have yet to see other projects address.  Then comes the actual structure and ethos of the project. This is a business and we are putting things in place now that will place us in a much stronger position for future mergers and partnerships, making us more adoptable and attractive to the bigger institutions. We are advocates of positive change and are working on big challenges such as piracy and protection of players - so our vision is much more comprehensive than simple digital assets as many other projects focus on.  Hopefully this gives a little more clarity on what sets us apart? Ultimately innovation comes from those that are prepared to push the boundaries and those that have the ability to respond positively to trends - something that I know our core team has plenty of.  ~ Pete Mardell, CEO TriForce Tokens",False

To answer the first, we conducted market surveys several months ago before we announced our project, met up with developers, gamers including in game groups. In the survey 86% of developers said that they loved the idea of the solutions we would implement. I have also been a part of external gaming 'markets' so to speak where players are offering in-game services. There is a particular route that can be beneficial to both gamers and developers, without gamers being in breach of the developers/publishers EULA agreements. This is where our solutions fit in.  Our target audience is all defined in our white paper and pitch decks plus we have strong partners in this industry including Vadim Bulatov, our games industry adviser who is head of marketing at wargaming.net. We are still a young start-up project but already have impressive connections and growing our community of followers. As for going out through relevant gaming community publications, it would only make sense for us to do this once our technology is deployed in a production environment or in the lead up to it, which I hope you can appreciate. This forms part of our next four year growth strategy.  I hope I have given you enough clarification to your questions.  ~ Pete Mardell, CEO TriForce Tokens",False

An ISMS is a framework of policies and procedures that includes all legal, physical and technical controls involved in an organisation's information risk management processes.  Source: http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/ISO-27001  It basically ensures that we have the correct policies and procedures in place to protect our and our clients data and information. It helps us to understand the areas of weakness, so that be can better protect ourselves from attacks. The benefits are that we as a company will do regular checks to ensure that our technology is protected and that we have procedures in place, if an attack takes place. It gives peace of mind not only to use as a company that we are best prepared for attacks, but also for our clients and consumers to ensure that their data and information is secure.

This piece of technology will be designed to help minimise piracy within the gaming industry and making it more profitable for game developers where possible.  We are working closely with Coventry University on this to help better understand why people pirate games, to ensure we combat it in the best possible ways.  The engine is designed to notify the game developer that a user is using a pirated copy of their game. The system will prompt the developers with options to which they can take. So for example an option might be, to send the user of the pirated copy a message to alert them that the developers are aware and that they will allow them to continue you trailing their game for a set amount of days. At the end of that trail period, the developers could then potentially offer the user a discounted version of the game so that no revenue is lost. Please be aware that this is just an example, we are working with Coventry University on this to ensure that we provide the best possible solutions for the game developers.  ~ Jake Ashby, General Manager TriForce Tokens",False

So a company who understands the value and importance of this, can implement it much easier early on - then as the company grows they already have a strategy and standard practice to follow. It opens the doors to a lot more partnership opportunities too with much larger organisations. Some will actually not be able to engage with a company that does not meet these standards.

I needed to discuss with the dev team to get a clear and definitive answer:  Ok, so as you expect when purchasing tokens you would have to own/buy ETH as part of the token sales. However, inside our own actual applications we will have a dedicated service that will mean users will not have to own any ETH inside the application to conduct trades/transfer of our tokens. This service will take care of the ETH transaction fees on behalf of the users, with a transaction fee in FORCE tokens.  Btw we are going with a new currency ticker symbol (FORCE) instead of TFT - because we discovered some really old redundant coin was using this symbol on EtherDelta. We could have continued to use it however we made the decision to avoid any conflict down the road, plus our new symbol is much more fitting to our project.  ~ Pete Mardell, CEO TriForce Tokens",False

I am putting a full content piece together on it because there is a real myriad of points to address with why we are unique and why the gaming industry is attracting many crypto projects. In short though, consider how many blockchain projects there are and the size of this industry. Now compare that to the global games industry, where 1 in 5 people globally are playing some kind of game. The blockchain industry pales in comparison to the gaming industry and people claim there are so many 'gaming tokens'. In terms of size I would argue there are far more exchanges for crypto compared to the market size as opposed to blockchain games industry solutions for the games industry.  Hopefully this makes a little sense?  But the clear differentiators that set us apart is the technology stack being deployed, the honorary system, how tokens can be utilised with regards to player to player rewarding. Our token capitalises on actual in-game activities not just simple digital assets.  ~ Pete Mardell, CEO TriForce Tokens",False

There are several things that we are going to put in place to protect against a massive sell-off at the end of the token sales. Of course it's not possible to 'stop' people selling right after, however there are a few things that will be done to protect against it. Like many of you I find it frustrating that some ICO's can end up being bought cheaper right after the token sales. So here is our plan:  Our own team, advisers and investors agreed to a staggered plan of releasing their token share over several months. No massive sell-off will occur from the project team guaranteed. We have implemented a staggered supply to discount ratio that reduces the number of tokens available at higher discount levels - so the largest portion of the supply would need to be sold at a loss to depreciate the token value further A solid buy wall will be put in place at a determined level to ensure value does not depreciate further than the lowest token value of the token sales Finally, we have a plan of consistent project updates and progress to ensure a healthy and proactive community exists beyond the token sale - we really are going for that real world adoption and have the right team that will ensure this happens. It takes more than just attracting the crypto community for a truly viable project to grow and we understand that.  ~ Pete Mardell, CEO TriForce Tokens",False

Jake has been providing excellent answers to your questions. If anything you asked hasn't been covered though, feel free to reply to me and I will answer.  I did notice a couple that I would like to just cover:   from: TOKIA    We have four full time devs working on a variety of technology solutions we are offering, and then we have several other contractors to assist with certain aspects. We also have expert smart contract consultants auditing for us.   from: longwintershere  there are more gaming tokens ICOs than I can count  Yes there are a few. However, the number of projects operating within a certain industry does not give any credibility to whether it is a viable project or not. If you make a decision on supporting a project based on this alone, you won't be doing yourself any favours. I would recommend looking into the industry, the nuances, what the solutions being offered are, is there a market and how different is it to competitors to make a more informed decision. I can tell you there are solutions we are working on that no others have thought of, and you will start seeing more communications relating to this as we close nearer to the token sale. Keep following us on social media..  Consider this is a $100+Bn global industry, with a small handful of genuinely unique blockchain based projects, each with their own differences. Some focus on tournaments, some on digital assets and some on community collaboration and rewards. I'll leave you to decide where we fit in  Keep 'em coming and I look forward to showing everything the team has been working on.  ~ Pete Mardell, CEO TriForce Tokens",False

I don't think they will at first until the token builds value, but once it has a real value I don't see why you couldn't. The platform isn't being designed to sell games at the moment. That seems to be the way most ICOs are heading, crypto based game stores. But if our token takes off, which it will then sure there is no reason why you couldn't purchase a game with TFTs.  I think once our tokens have value, most developers would probably encourage players to purchase their games with cryptos as they start to realise the value of cryptos. The only issue we would come across would be of the retailers and distributors as we would then be taking a cut of their market share. SO, if we were to go down that road we would have to tread lightly and carefully.  ~ Jake Ashby, General Manager TriForce Tokens",False

But what makes us different? Well for starters we provide technology solutions for every party within the gaming industry, not just the player, or the developer. We are providing new and unexplored revenue streams to the players, developers and streamers. We provide a P2P trading system for the players, that allows developers to take a cut (therefore not losing out). Also, we are providing the worlds first honouree system that allows players to reward each on a donation bases. Not only that, but we are also creating a social engagement platform and anti-piracy strategies and engine. We are working alongside Coventry University to conduct research into why piracy occurs and how we can prevent it. TriForce Tokens is creating an eco-system that encourages and fosters collaborative communities.  TriForce Tokens is more than just a crypto-currency, our team is dedicated and passionate and all follow the same vision. We're here for the long run, we're here to revolutionise the gaming industry.  I hope that shed some light on what makes us different.

Of course we don't want our technology to ruin a game or its economy, so we will be working closely with developers once we have our integration kits ready to ensure we keep economies stable and fair. It will also be down to the developers as well on how they want it to work, in a sense we just provide the technology and the rest is down to the developers. As for example some games don't already have PvP trading but they may want to implement it, therefore the only economy will be within the TFT network for that game. Some developers may want to switch there PvP trading solely to the TFT network. Regardless of what they choose, we will work with the developers to ensure it works seamlessly and doesn't disrupt any economies.  ~ Jake Ashby, General Manager TriForce Tokens",False

Many other gaming ICOs have had good ideas, but poor execution and I'd argue that a lot of there market research was also fairly poor. Yes gamers want a way to earn money, but most ICOs out there are only allowing for minor crypto gains in exchange for playing hours of a game that doesn't necessarily interest the gamer. We want gamers to continue playing the games they love, whilst complimenting them with potential revenue streams, a social engagement platform, player-to-player trading and the worlds first honouree system. A system that encourages and fosters positive and collaborative gaming behaviour within the gaming community. Not only that, but we are working closely with Coventry University, researching piracy within the gaming industry so that we can provide state of the art technology to help combat and minimise it.  So I guess you could say we are just another gaming tokens, but we here at TriForce Tokens are more than just a crypto-currency, we are a passionate team focussed on our vision of revolutionising the industry.  ~ Jake Ashby, General Manager TriForce Tokens",False

There are others that we are still in negotiation with, so I am unable to disclose much about them unfortunately.

Aida speaks fluently in English, French, Spanish and Romanian, with a little Russian. With her marketing background, she is also helping us to better understand the different cultures of many of these other countries so that we can better suit our marketing to those audiences.  Vadim Bulatov - Our new gaming industry advisor, Vadim is helping us to better understand the gaming industry and how to conduct marketing within it. From a gaming background himself, Vadim is an extremely value asset to TriForce Tokens. Vadim is then head of SMM for the games World of Tanks, World of Warships and World of Warplanes; some massively popular F2P games. Vadim has helped increase the player count of these and many other games by the millions.  Regarding the development team our CTO Raza is current in negotiation with a few people regarding working on our technology such as our social engagement platform and integration kits. However, until this is finalised and agreed, I am unable to say much more.  There are others who we are finalising with at the moment, which we will make an announcement of upon joining the team.

These things include bringing on prominent people within the gaming industry, our new social engagement platform and a new marketing partnership.  We are currently working on updating our website and bounty campaign so that we can provide everyone with the new and correct information. The reason for choosing to hold back on the next token sale until Feb 2018, is because we believe people are starting to wind down due to the holidays being around the corner. It makes more sense to wait it out and give everyone time to get back into the swing of things.

Regardless of what game it is however, these development companies are making extraordinary amounts of $$$ from gamers for cosmetic items that have very little if not no affect on your gameplay.  I believe Activision was also caught out with a system that had in place that encouraged players to purchase loot crates by matching players with loot crate items with those that didn't. Destiny 2 is a great example of the system.  Thats why we here at TriForce Tokens believe that the players also need a way of generating a little extra income from the games they love and enjoy.

Trove was my example as many YouTubers have created videos on purchasing in game loot crates and receiving around 1-2 good and worthy items from around $150 spent.  I think the issue that countries/governments are having with the loot crates system are because young children playing games are easily able to make these in-game purchases without a real concept of how much they are spending and what the get in return. Hence the gambling aspect of it, people are paying money for a chance to receive a good item. It is therefore arguably, encouraging gambling from a young age.  ~ Jake Ashby, General Manager TriForce Tokens",False

Obviously since focusing a lot more on this project I haven't been as involved in the investment side.

Our's is a token sale, not an official coin offering. The terminology is important, because if a project falls under an ""investment security"" it is then likely to need much more stringent regulation around the activities and how it goes about raising funds. If it falls under a security it makes it very difficult to conduct a token sale and in fact could be at risk of legal repocusions if regulations are not adhered to.  There is actually a ""howey test"" that can be done to determine the likely hood if a crypto-currency would fall under a security. We completed ours which determined there is a low chance of our project being considered a security - meaning we can avoid a lot of the legal implications.

We see ourselves as completely different from both Electroneum, as well as many of our other competitors. We aim to provide real solutions to the gaming industry, solutions that benefit everyone within the industry and community. From the developer to the gamer, everyone that is within the TriForce Tokens network will be able to benefit from its technology and its solutions.  Although we don't have 'mining', we allow developers to set tasks/quests from players that grants players rewards in the form of our own crypto-currency upon completion. So in a sense, I guess you could argue that would be mining to a degree? We also allow players to trade between one another, as well as honour each other through the worlds first honouree system. The system will allow players to send/donate real crypto-currency (TFT - our currency) to others as a form of gratitude or in exchange of services.  We are also currently building a anti-piracy engine. Working alongside Coventry University, we aim to help bring piracy down to a more manageable level for game development companies. We are also currently building a social engagement platform for the gaming community, that will bring the entire community under one roof, regardless of the platforms you play on. We aim to have a beta version of the social engagement platform ready for our community by Feb 2018.  I hope this answered your question? If you still want to know more about TriForce Tokens, I strongly suggest checking out our website and our whitepaper. I will provide links below for you.

We have no intention to stop there however, so do not be disheartened.  We are wanted to start with the indie game sector as we felt that many indie developers have struggled to get their games played and noticed. Our entire ethos if you will is all about helping the gaming community to grow and expand, but through incorporating everyone, not just the big boys with the large amounts of $$$.  As a PS4 and Xbox One gamer myself, we have every intention to break into those markets also. So fear not! We are working on it.  ~ Jake Ashby, TriForce Tokens General Manager",False

However, mobile games are becoming increasingly more popular, games such a Clash of Clans, Game of War etc, have thousands if not millions of players. We want to build a platform that brings everyone together, not to mention most people that play PC or Console games are more than likely to also play mobile games. The idea of the platform is to bring everything under one roof, so that you are able to communicate with your friends and the community all at once regardless of what platform you or they're on.  However the platform doesn't just end there. Our ideas and plans for the platform expand much further than just multi-platform communication. P2P trading, worlds first honouree system, developer's ability to set quests and task for TFT rewards, tournaments, group finding etc etc. The possibilities for this platform are endless.  ~ Jake Ashby, General Manager TriForce Tokens",False

Does Player A have to transfer manually the AK47 to Player B and TriForce smart contract makes the TFT settlement, after checking the inventory at Player B side or does the TriForce application automatically transfer AK47 from A to B and TFT from B to A? From my understanding, both scenarios require TriForce to call the API of the game and you will need to work with game developers. What game genres will be a priority for your project?

There are a couple of methods this will be handled:  First, through integration kits that are being developed for the various gaming platforms will allow developers to connect to the entire TriForce Tokens ecosystem, allowing players to interact on the network. This would mean confirmation of delivery of items or interaction is built into the game. The second method will be via honouring and an in-built escrow implementation, that will mean both parties accept or decline the transaction upon completion. The honouring aspect will show trustworthy players much similar to an ebay style rating, that is publicly viewable. The finer details are being worked out atm.  Hope this helps.  ~ Pete Mardell, CEO TriForce Tokens",False

Yes, the idea of the social engagement platform is to break those boundaries that stop players of different platforms from communicating. We want to create a social hub that brings everyone within the gaming community together under one roof, regardless of the platform you play on. The idea is also to help those that have multiple platforms, stay in touch and in the loop with their friends and community while they play on their other platforms.  Myself for example, I have both the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One. I play with a different group of friends on each platform, and it can be hard at times to keep in touch with everyone at the same time.

So you will have your original contribution set to the new nominal value of 6,000 TFT per ETH plus the original bonus that you was awarded before. We did mention this briefly in the email to our supporters and also that we will be following up with our existing contributors once the update has been made.   However, since we are fixing the value to 1 ETH instead of dollar value, it won't be set to what the dollar value was of the ETH at the time. There are arguments for and against this I appreciate that, however we have to consider that it is now being fixed to Ethereum and with that comes fluctuations in fiat value.

It didn't go as you had planned but your vision is in my view excellent and apologies I'm going to use the that word, 'disruptive', when it comes to gaming; the idea that players can Play To Earn (real money!) is a game changer, especially when publishers are pushing Pay to Win micro transactions/loot boxes.  I'd advise on staying clear from scientific revenue and dynamic pricing algorithms, stay ethical and gamers will come.  You have done a really good professional job on planning your ICO, from a technical perspective,  but one area lacking is that TFT and it's great message is unknown in gaming circles.  Getting a recognised industry name on board is a good start. I'd also recommend connecting with Youtube game bloggers such as Boogie2988, Jim Sterling, Angry Joe, Total Biscuit and game news/Media channels such as The Know; so as to spread the TFT vision and platform and at the very least get gamers talking about it and possibly reading the white paper.            From a delivery perspective how well is the beta development going?  Some positive news on this or current rollout out plan details before the ICO will definitely put confidence in perspective buyers.   Also if you can get game developers/publishers agreements finalised and in position to talk about them and get this message out to the games media (such as above) prior to ICO, will strengthen the chance of success on the upcoming ICO.  Well done on what you have accomplished so far and looking forward to seeing your vision realised.",False

Most of what you have mentioned is being worked on and the main thing is bringing on board industry influencers. The beta development is under way, but yes we should produce a delivery plan before we enter our next event. It's a good suggestion.  To the wider community, we have not released much more information at this stage, simply because we are still going through IP audit process. We want to be secure on this first before we start revealing too much, which I hope you could understand the reasons for this.  Just to reiterate, our main focus is delivering a solid project that will see the value of the tokens not only become stable but increase in value. So many ICO's are having 'challenging' times because of this lack of real user adoption. It's the one thing that has to be secured to ensure a positive outcome for our supporters and ourselves.  ~ Pete Mardell, CEO TriForce Tokens",False

We here take our own and our contributors security seriously. We want to be certain that our contributor’s funds are safe and secure, that’s why we have chosen CoinPayments as our escrow provider.  CoinPayments is a global leading payment gateway that provide that extra level of security. Contributor funds are protected in single signature cold wallets that are assigned to each contributor. This ensures that every contributor’s funds are allocated with the correct TriForce Tokens upon distribution and also from getting confused or lost. This also means that TriForce Tokens are unable to access the funds until completion of our milestones. Our milestones have been agreed with CoinPayments, who will only release once certain terms and conditions have been met. 25% of all funds will also be released at each milestone.

You can find out more on the team on the website, with links to relevant social media channels as a starter.. but I will clarify more here for you.  With regards to myself, I have been the head of development for a young start up for the past 6 years and was key in making that business grow to become one of the most recognised in the industry. I learn't a great deal there, watching it grow from a team of 2 to a team of around 20 and becoming a multi-million pound turn-over business. Through my time there I had been working behind the scenes on my own projects, starting with a bitcoin 'challenge' platform. The concept was to have game developers upload their own browser based games and people would compete against each other with stakes in BTC and I built a few of my own games in Unity3d for it. This project is a much more complicated evolution on this thanks to smart contracts and the evolution of wider technologies. I have always been involved in the crypto space since around 2010/2011, I have done mining, took part in quite a few ICO's and built up a decent portfolio. I also have a real passion for gaming, although due to my development responsibilities I have struggled to find the time in recent years; which I don't consider necessarily a bad thing! I'm probably what you might consider now a more old school gamer Although I still manage to find the time once in a while to play league of legends and some star wars titles. In fact my favourite games have always been start wars - jedi knight 2 jedi outcast. That brings back some really fond memories. So pulling this all together, I am actually combining all my passions; My love of games, crypto and development.  The team as well are all very experienced in their fields, and there is no way we could achieve what we have done without them. Raza Ahmed our CTO gained his masters in software engineering a couple of years ago. He has worked on cryptography, machine learning and blockchain tech and is about to complete his degree with B9Lab to become a certified Ethereum developer. From working with Raza, I know he is a very advanced software engineer although he is very modest about this, and he is regularly approached by big tech companies and even more recently blockchain companies.  We have a few other advanced developers on the team including Jakub Kafarski, Haider Malik and Sorina Rusu each with their own specialist skill set - and again we wouldn't be achieving what we are without them. Jake Ashby is our general manager and although a young guy, he is very smart and has a strong drive about him and completed his BA in international business for which he spent a year abroad in the states.  Our advisers include Kate Breed who has worked for multinationals with regards to business change and consultancy. Owen Ashby who again works high up with multi nationals on corporate strategy and marketing. Then Blake Pope, who is the CEO of Bitcoin PR Buzz and was involved in Lisk (the second largest ICO in history at the time), and involved in some high profile current ICO's.  I hope this gives you a clearer picture of us  We have a solid 4 year plan to execute and have early alphas already released. Over the next few days we will be releasing more details and some exciting news about some new partnerships too.  ~ Pete Mardell, TriForce Tokens CEO",False

Perhaps one of the most interesting ways is just by helping other gamers out - they will be able to reward you through honorary tokens. Think of it like building up a publicly verifiable trust profile. For example, you could help someone level up or join a clan and reward members for doing certain achievements. This would be purely in control of the gamers themselves.  The other more common thing though is with item trading. Let's say you crafted an item or found some thing rare. You will be able to list it on an open market place for some TFT. Then there is the p2p challenging - beat your opponent and win their TFT's.
