Corl provides royalty financing to high-potential early-revenue companies. Our online platform provides companies with access to competitively-priced, non-dilutive, founder-friendly capital, and streamlines the funding process by analyzing transaction-level financial/social data.  Corl is planning to launch the world’s first regulated securities token on the blockchain, representing equity in the company, and paying dividends on a quarterly basis. CORL is the world’s first token to:  (i) leverage the power of blockchain technology to support and accelerate the growth of emerging growth companies through revenue-sharing investments; (ii) aim to achieve regulatory approval as a securities token; (iii) represent 100% equity ownership in a company; and (iv) issue tokenized dividends in ETH.  Unlike traditional tokens on the market, CORL’s value is derived from the equity of Corl, and is based on a profit-sharing model, whereby investors receive a continuous stream of dividends based on future earnings of Corl.  Corl will set a precedence in the financial services industry by initiating the evolution towards digitizing financial assets on the blockchain, and changing the way that early-revenue companies obtain funding.  See Whitepaper for more.     How Corl Works  For companies, the Corl platform is used to apply for funding.    For investors, the Corl platform is used to purchase and track investments.    Companies get access to the funding they need, and individuals participate in the growth of these companies by investing in Corl.
