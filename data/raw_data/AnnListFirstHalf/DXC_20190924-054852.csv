The DXC token is the token for the Daox Protocol and ecosystem around it. This means that it's supposed to be used to participate in other ICOs, rather than to be to be sold. You can see the main difference: If an ICO investor buys tokens of the project related to health or gas stations or whatever else, he usually has no intention to use it for its purpose. But the DXC token, is actually the product for investors. As a matter of fact, you can see that you can already use DXC token to get into other ICOs. We believe that about 70-80% of all supply will be locked in different projects in the coming months.  2. We have skipped the private sales, so there are no token holders who got them at huge discounts, and therefore there would be no tokens to sell at low price. All pre-ICO investor's tokens are locked for 1 year.  3. Each token of every DAO created using the Daox Protocol (including DXC) is representing a part of the raised funds in the sense that it could be used to get the remaining funds back in case of a startup failure. This gives a support for the price of the token on its early-stages of development.  Bottomline: We simply can't have a short term strategy, as we will lose all the funds that we are raising. The only way for us to keep the funding is to make DXC succeed.",False

First of all, its free and there is no commission charged. We clearly understand that this solution has to be widely accessible to everyone, in order to become widely adopted. Secondly, token sale participants should only trust the genuine code, as this is the only way for them to make sure that they get what is proposed by the protocol. Thirdly, there is no need to get rid of the DXC token. DXC token is there to help get access to trusted ICO-related services at a discounted price and to connect third-party modules directly to the DAOs, created using the protocol. However, if they don't like to raise DXC tokens or to deposit them, they don't have to.  On top of that, each project that run the entire token sale using the Daox Protocol might be featured on the Daox.Network and across the whole Daox community. We are also working on the service that would be kind of Etherscan for Daox-based token sales.  The bottomline is that there are only positive effects of running the token sale using the genuine Daox smart-contracts.",False

As an outcome, we can see a skyrocketing growth of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). But there are signs that something is wrong, and the proof is that Google, Facebook and Twitter together have banned all ICO and cryptocurrency-related advertising.  The reason for that is that the general public, with little or no previous experience in investing, got access to thousands of investment offers. Most people are simply not aware of how to evaluate startups and often become victims of ambitious promises or even scams. Many Experts expect at least 97% of all ICO startups will fail within the next couple of years.  So, what is the reason for the problem and how to fix it? First of all, let‚Äôs take a look at how the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù investing works. We can see that investors and startups actually interact via intermediaries which are legal entities. They also have contracts and laws to protect them.  Just think of what would have happened if VCs started to simply hand out boxes of cash right after the startup‚Äôs pitches. Obviously, the return on such investments would be unacceptably low. And we can say that something very similar happens around the majority of today‚Äôs ICOs....",False

The architecture of DAOs, created using Daox Platform, excludes the possibility of locking the funds. If no on-demand transfers are made in a course of 4 months (e.g. someone with 51% of tokens blocking all withdrawals) the DAO will automatically switch to a refund mode.  2. The flood could be filtered on the Daox Platform. There is also a sandbox functionality for proposals. So no problems at all.",False

First, the source code of Daox smart-contracts is open and accessible for review at https://github.com/daox. Besides that we offer a detailed description in our white paper: https://tokensale.daox.org/daox-whitepaper-eng.pdf.  Secondly, we are conducting our own public sale on Daox smart-contracts.  Thirdly, we believe that when it comes to redistributing funds the most simple solution is the best. That is why we have isolated the functions related to transfers of funds and made them simple, so even if there are bugs in other parts of the code of DAOs, the funds are safe.  And the most important thing is that Daox-DAOs has a modular architecture and there is a functionality to update modules after the DAO is formed.   So, yes, the funds in Daox DAOs are always safe!",False
