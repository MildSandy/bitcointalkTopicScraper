Vital thing is to get enough users into games.    So anything I mention is with that hope basically, I've been betting esports for many years now and I could use this one for sure.   So yea I think being able to place a bet and just ponder over the choices made should be allowed before being fixed into it.    The terms are familiar to any regular but new people are going to need a minute to comprehend the choice vs the rules,  maybe look at that FAQ and get a sense for what is required to get 'the win' in this contest     This part which pops up is opposite to that, pay first and then decide.   I know people could in theory get out pencil and paper and figure it that way maybe but I think people literally are going to weigh it up on screen 90% of the time, discuss with others possibly, screencap, link.  Also include mobile users who just are doing it on the go.  Also another factor is payout or if the contest never proceeds, the buy-in is returned.    But if the pay is not there for a week or its tied up, it slows down users who might otherwise enter the next game.   Especially those new players who are just turning over the free buy-in and getting into the site.   Hopefully Im understood, its the iteration of the bets made that counts alot.   I think this is common to every gamble site even if this site is unique, its the turnover of bets and players so the payout on the last game feeds into the next bet and so on.   I think that'd be a larger part of encouraging an accumulation of betting.     https://www.herosphere.gg/counter-strike-global-offensive/2019-iem-season-xiii-katowice-world-championship-champions-stage-bracket-bracket-final-1000-45-x-2  Anyway today is the CSGO grand final, quite an upset possible.

We are HERO, the issuer of the cryptocurrency HEROcoin (Ticker: $PLAY). Our ICO took place from September 2017 - October 2017 (unfortunately these dates were wrong in the graphics above; we updated the post). In the last year we managed to relaunch our first use case, which was free to play and had almost 250.000 users. herosphere.gg Now, one year after the ICO ended, we are close to mainnet (on the Ethereum Blockchain).  herosphere.gg is an esports prediction platform, which allows you to bet on esports events (we also provide fantasy esports on the platform). This is our own use case, but HEROcoin can be used by any other betting provider. Therefor in the future it might be possible to bet on Tennis, Football, Formula 1, ... and of course esports with HEROcoin.  I hope that helps you.   If you have more questions or would like to get more details please join our Telegram channel (https://t.me/herocoinio) to discuss topics with the HERO team and the community.  All the best",False

Its probably a good idea to do both initially but of the two the former has the bigger potential especially internationally possibly.    House odds are often ending up indirectly related to betting by the majority anyhow.  I've done 'lay away' type betting on mainstream sports also, I understand the interest is not small in that either    Ive been on sites where the bet started off blank all open and the odds swung wildly as bets of various sizes came in, that setup led to a 'sniping' kind of relationship where the biggest bets swung in the last closing seconds.  It made for some interesting games, I got over 40x return on one surprising game someone big had too much confidence in the overdogs team of just a short game and my team had a few rough diamonds (unknown talent) on there who came through for me, fun bet House odds are good for encouraging regular usage though",False

To clarify this issue:  The KYC process has nothing to do with HEROcoin ($PLAY), but every use case (like our herosphere.gg) has to have a KYC process. This means if you  use herosphere.gg you have to take part in this process. When HEROcoin ($PLAY) is used by a third party provider, there should be a KYC process too. But this depends (as we wrote on Medium) on every use case provider. If you bought HEROcoin ($PLAY) in our ICO, you already took part in our KYC process regarding the ICO.

The story for HEROcoin probably I hope goes alot deeper and its about whether it will be used or not, if it does go ahead anyone longterm who follows esports games knows this can be massive.    Theres zero wrong with esports as a growth story and really at least 10% of the price should reflect that prospect instead we're tied to deflation/inflation of the overall crypto user base and exchange pricing which is mostly speculative and some inverse to Dollar index strength even.

I also intend to start a petition to collect signatures on proper operation of KYC regulations.  Avoidance of exploitation or protfiteering should be standard practise across the crypto industry.  There is a good arguable case the KYC deadline unfairly benefited some over others, so far that case has not been defended only ignored.  In this particular case the participants across the crypto community not just Facebook and Twitter (who are now turning their back on ICO) were not sufficiently informed after the fact of the changes to payments: The thread title was altered for the close of the ICO but not the new KYC requirements. Spreadsheet with address details of participants were left unaltered with new requirements The opening post never reflected changes to T&C or new requirements for payment The campaign manager gave no mention of new requirements for payment when in correspondence with participants and/or was not made aware himself  I hope PLAY is successful overall and I said long before I was on the bounty campaign there is a good basis for the business but for a communication mixup to occur combined with a previously unannounced short deadline and then to ignore people trying to correct what was an obvious mistake is a misstep.

The higher marketcap is a result of the way higher ICO price of Unikoin. Additionally, their total supply is 4x higher than HERO's so the price per token could drop drastically if they decide to put all their tokens on the market. In terms of volume I see 2 major reasons: First, more exchanges (yes, in that case, it is positive but it doesn't necessarily lead to a higher price) and secondly it is better known at the moment because of Ashton Kutcher and Mark Cuban.  What makes HERO better than Unikoin? HERO aims to remove the middleman and want to keep the money/tokens with the users. At Unikoin you bet against the house and users will loose money. Additionally HERO is open for every 3rd party provider who wants to implement the system and aims to create a whole online betting ecosphere with their system. Unikoin is closed and limited to their own platform.  For the near future, the focus is on developing the product so we will most likely not see any new exchanges at the moment.  I hope I could answer your questions properly,",False

It cant only be called good when the sun shines, generally I'm glad BTC solved some of its fees problem.   Thats a long term positive effect probably, price is something else   The PLAY tokens are a hold in the long term and in the short term its speculative what the price could be. Most of the time BTC sets the tone for alot of the alt market, thats fair enough as PLAY isnt in active usage so its seeing just speculative price movements.   Depends what you are intending to do, make a quick buck or hold long term.  I was just looking at BTC price and a recent high was the 200 Daily moving average which is also decent resistance on a number of perspectives for the moment.   Normally I'd expect even if bullish the price has to gain some momentum to jump that wall before it can continue rising, I expect it to hold resistance for now.   Some might prefer to return when there is a regular 'stair step' type gain in BTC price and alts generally.     If BTC sets the tide for crypto in some way, PLAY would be generally sideways ?  Thats my guess, my idea is to be buying on lows buts thats a long term idea.    Weak hands sell, a good market will allow the longer term holders to gain some benefit from accumulating.   A one sided market is actually bad, hence prices are cheaper for buyers is still positive.  tl;dr  The 200 day BTC price is rising still, in broad terms the crypto market isnt negative or impaired.  A cheaper price isnt a negative by itself",False

You can still exchange for value even while that might be a speculative price but thats a description of alot of crypto and blockchains out there Im fairly sure.   So I'd place PLAY above alot of other value exchanged.   The thing to follow is the general prospects, the market sector being addressed (esports growth etc.) and that is a determination of value that is at least equal to an exchange price.   It wont have a fixed label like your bid/offer figure but ultimately the wider market is what gives the price.      Its a case of the tail wagging the dog if you get what I mean, the bid/offer is not what determines value utlimately.   Largely thats a reflection of sentiment right now and you have the backdrop of BTC which is massive but not a determination of actual prospects for usage of PLAY.   I'm fairly certain of this because it happens in the general money markets, if this were a game it would be lemmings   I dont just follow others personally",False

Its normal kind of tide change that occurs, anyone long term in crypto isnt seeing anything new here.     I put in orders around this price so its all according to what I had expected as possible.      The majority of anything I hold longer term in crypto is what yields a dividend or return of some kind.   That is pretty much the point to holding this token so this is the time to read through or think through if you see the overall sector and scheme to be feasible and use the weakness for a positive.    Of course crypto is definitely not for the faint hearted but the price doesnt have to be a negative just because its in red.   This is just my general thinking, I hold yielding assets elsewhere in crypto and its always about the ongoing utility if its worth buying or not.

That was the reasoning given for not paying people who were due tokens.  There was a period of 14 days to find out and pass KYC.  Here is why they should be paying people for publicity like they promised they would : https://www.btcnn.com/google-informally-banning-ico-ads/ Actually involving the community properly, not altering rules after close with only 14 days given would be best.   Every other company who fields KYC allows participants to engage properly, unfortunately there was a rush and they decided not to pay outside of the 14 days.  I'm conducting an ongoing campaign for payment of the outstanding tokens to people who helped publicise the ICO : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2892870.msg29743762#msg29743762 Please register how many tokens you were due and as much information as possible.   The current stance of the company is to ignore the community complaints which just says to me we have not organised enough of a response to this failure to pay.   Heres a blog written by the COO https://medium.com/@HEROCoin/why-we-had-supporters-actually-claim-their-bounties-8e065517439a   If you agree with that blog say so, if you disagree then you better speak up or you cant blame the company for not being bothered about your lost tokens.    The basic response to that there is no democratic country fields a law that presumes criminality.  If HEROcoin meant to comply with a law of KYC or regulator then it still leaves those tokens as due, to remove payments owed on a presumption of guilt or failed KYC is not correct.    Every company in crypto fields open KYC allowing people to pass when possible.     I'm interested to hear of any company excusing itself from payments citing KYC as a reason why.   The tokens are due and the debt is outstanding.  Quote from: karlu92 on March 12, 2018, 10:42:06 AM You registered at 31. January 2018, there was no bounty after that time, so why are you asking?

The ICO campaign was due to pay out tokens to participants but failed to pay citing KYC regulations in Austria as the reason.   There was no warning before taking part it was decided retrospectively.    This is why some view it as dishonest practise, thats a reasonable point of view when the value could have gone towards Bitcointalk forum costs from which the campaign benefited.   For the tokens to just disappear without payment is why HEROcoin  is viewed badly by some  On the other hand the HEROcoin (PLAY) believes they have to abide by possible regulatory oversight and KYC was part of that.   That also was reasonable, heres some context of the fear the company might have had: Quote Quote   https://politiken.dk/forbrugogliv/digitalt/art6328177/Teleselskaber-får-besked-på-at-lukke-for-skinbetting-sider    Those tokens should not have disappeared on account of changes to terms after the ICO had closed.   It was reasonable for this forum itself to be repaid for its help with the ICO, Ive asked months ago that charities benefit if I'm excluded as not a valid individual.      To allow only 14 days and tell me after I had a month,  even the COO was confused how long we actually had, to pass this previously unknown hurdle seems to be an unfortunate rush that occurred to launch.   I can understand some of it because I've bet on CSGO games for years so I get some context the company wants to continue long term within legal boundaries but its not reasonable to disregard participants as some kind of potential criminal.     I asked where is the best place to start a forum thread on this issue, reputation section seems most applicable.  I've started a thread on missing Tokens, I will edit and update the Opening post and Thread title, which was part of what the HEROcoin ICO failed to do with its participants on this forum.

Its a legit business with decent prospects, otherwise it would be a worthless token to be paid in and a waste of time from the beginning.  It is ironic that it is part of a strict adherence to KYC that caused this failure to payout the allocated bounties and that has led to the perception of deceptive bounty terms.     Its a mixup over KYC legislation and that became a requirement introduced retrospectively after the bounty had closed.   Its a reasonable requirement for any company to proceed lawfully but I've never heard of KYC being used to forfeit in only 14 days in any other case.  I was told we had a month to pass KYC but it started a week into November and closed a week before end of the month so it was about 14 days total, I think there was a rush hence why I say some mixups occurred.    I suggested that if identity cannot be legally proved then participants could nominate a charity like Red Cross or a Cancer research charity for their allocated tokens.   That should be possible and it seems a reasonable outcome to me. I myself can pass KYC on any online site that requires it, I have an available credit record usually thats the drawback but even with other betting firms its a driving license thats required or similar, I'm sure it should be possible for most people to do.  I do suggest being reasonable not slinging mud, alot of the time you deal with people in a company who are just doing what they are told.   The overall KYC legislation itself was just a requirement the company had to follow, we didnt know it'd be such a problem at the campaign start and neither did the company apparently.   I will start a thread, I'll ask around what is the best forum section to proceed with; but we'll collect details of everyone who did not pass KYC and their intentions for the missing allocated tokens from the various campaigns held during the ICO.",False

As its a consumer facing company I'd hope that is an ongoing possibility.   Theres more then a few people Im trying to gather together who were not able to get a claim in.  A couple I think have english as a second language and have been disadvantaged in submitting details and Im happy to collate information required for everyone, I'll work through any details that are missing to fill in the gap between the company and its bounty campaign participants.   Its better to just reduce the reasons for not paying then building them up with accusations I think.   Its a failure in communication to participants, even this thread keeps the same title with nothing on the opening post to show a new deadline added. Quote Quote I found the comment I missed within the Signature bounty thread 177 pages of comments, a line of text can be missed unfortunately.  The title and starting information asks people to check spreadsheet details are correct, no new requirement was added to OP or title or the spreadsheet itself to indicate no payment would be made.  Had I also done the twitter or facebook campaigns I found those avenues more clearly done but Bitcointalk itself is a forum where most of us were initially contacted, I dont especially use other platforms outside of forums not everyone does.   I did register on https://www.herosphere.gg/ at the start of October and my email address is available there but I dont think any related news appeared to alert people to report in for a change of terms.     The change to terms after payment had been promised caused some to miss the new details required, if anything is missing it would be best if the claimants contacted me or add your details to an open spreadsheet so we can get clear contact information together.   The standard way of using a forum is to alter the opening post and also alter the thread title if possible.   Even start a new thread with the new terms required would take only a few minutes and if its going to be causing losses to people involved  its worth doing.",False

Simple factors causing the dump as bonuses of invetsors and bounty payments and nobody waiting for the 20 December that still no exchanges are mentioned to be listed on. Am not saying that this is a shit coin but can't be convainced about the success of the Hero platform. Q2 of 2018 is a long period to wait when no available prototype or product.

However, I think HERO is doing it right. One step after another. They always claimed to be a long term project - and long term means more than 6 month I think we have a bright future here with this token but one need to be patient :-)",False

Please quote this message.  Hi Dev, I ask you to charge me tokens on a signature company 100% in full over the past week as I fulfilled all the conditions of the signature company. It's not my fault that you change the signatures at the end of the week when there is already a calculation of the rates especially about the changes in the signature you should have written on the main page of the company's bounty since the participants do not read all the pages with reports on the bounty it's not good for them. the rules with the signatures should come into force from the next week after September 23rd-September 29th, and then count the shares according to the new rules and not for the last week. This is unfair when you do not pay 100% for the work already done. Thank you for understanding  Signature updated. I hope you fix the amount of my tokens for 16.09-22.09 a week as the rules for new signatures were announced after 22.09 date and these rules should not apply to last week 16.09-22.09 this is logical.

This has three advantages: 1) You get a fixed reward for anything you do which does not decrease, if more people take part. 2) We hope to reduce scamming attempts by it, since bounty participants do not indirectly compete against each other. 3) More transparency.

Everyone is able to participate by simply joining or creating games. The whole community benefits from a growing activity as every HERO token holder is ensured to receive a rake back of all played games. Additionally, those who take the effort to create games receive a creators reward.    Token Holder All token holders are guaranteed a reward out of all distributed prize pools. Player Game winners receive their respective part of the prize pool. Game Creator Game creators are rewarded for their effort to create and manage games.   Contest variety - Templates   The development team of HERO coin aims to create free accessibility and constantly growing set of smart contracts, each representing a different form of the game. A game creator can use the contract which fits his needs best, to offer betting with the HERO cryptocurrency. All of these smart contracts have one interface in common which guarantees that each contract implements basic characteristics of the HERO economy like the community-reward. The fact that these smart contracts are deployed during game creation, makes them exchangeable and allow for future enhancements of game mechanics.     The online betting industry has suffered from a lack of innovation for years and the conditions for players worsened over time.  Unfair conditions Odds are created by experts based on tons of exclusive data undisclosed to the public. Lacking Transparency and Trust Centralized authorities control the payouts resulting in lacking transparency of the money flow. No Social Dynamics Social dynamics are lost as interfering middleman prevent direct peer to peer interaction.      HERO radically changes todays centralized way of online betting. The token enables you to join or create games on the ethereum blockchain. The design of HERO enforces active and passive income streams for all participants in the ecosystem. This transparent and decentralized way of betting breaks the traditional ""the house always wins"" paradigm.    The mission of HERO is as simple as it is powerful: establishing a new level of trust, transparency, and security, yet unknown in the world of online betting     HERO is intended to suite not only the community but also existing betting providers. Our public API enables to connect to the HERO network to run games with different contest templates, even centralized betting providers can use HERO as their first step towards a more transparent and decentralized future. The whole ecosystem is designed to not only bring in a variety of games but also an organic growth through new game creators, influencers, and other participants marketing their games to existing and emerging communities.   More than just an idea - A Finished Product  Most of the ICOs and tokens just sell ideas. HERO is different. HERO emerged from a real world need of the esports betting platform, herosphere.gg. Already entertaining more than 200.000 users, herosphere will be the first provider to implement the HERO token. Others have mere ideas, we build solutions.      Coming from esports  At herosphere.gg we love gaming. Our team consists of (e)sports enthusiasts, therefore we developed an innovative betting platform for esports events. Esport is a rapidly growing market. The number of esport enthusiasts is anticipated to continue growing by a CAGR of over 10 percent for the next years. In 2014, the number of esports enthusiasts was on the same level as ice hockey, for 2018 it is anticipated that esports will overtake American Football. The global esports market generated more than USD 460 million in revenue in 2016, and is anticipated by Newzoo to grow to USD 1.1 billion by 2019.
