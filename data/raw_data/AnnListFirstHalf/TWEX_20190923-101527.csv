We at Tag World Exchange (“TWEX”) have set our main goal as creating a unique ecosystem that will enable their users to buy, sell and/or trade their investments when they need or wish in a safe way. Tag World Exchange will be a disruptive platform driving a change in the crowd lending market in an innovative way by using Ethereum Protocol and some open source tools provided by the Blockchain technology.  About TWEX Tokens.  The investors can use the Cryptocurrency “Twex Tokens” to invest in registered companies and use dedicated services in the TWEX platform such as (financial audit reports, social media marketing, IT support and legal documentation)  Ø Smart Contracts to manage automated execution of investments and profit participation positions.  Ø Sophisticated Hardware Wallet to secure the authentication and investment process of the users.  Tag World Exchange is a platform that enables its investors and business owners to register their investments and offers on the Blockchain and then be able to trade the same using our proprietary technology. This system helps investors find liquidity against their investments at times most important for them and not when the company wants. If the investor needs immediate cash, they can decide to strip their investments and sell just one year’s profit participation portion of it while keeping the other years’ profit participations along with the capital reimbursement. Or they might decide to liquidate their entire portfolio at a price of their choosing because of a new venture that they might want to pursue. Usually private companies where the investors make such investments can seldom buy them out unless the company becomes publicly traded, find new investors to replace them, buy back their shares or sell their company. But in most cases, they are unable to cash them out. TWEX offers them the possibility to offer their positions to the community of investors at conditions that match their needs. The platform helps them with the valuation of their investments using the simple tools available on our site. This in return helps them set a sale price for their smart contracts.  HOW ARE PROFITS GENERATED FOR INVESTORS IN TWEX?  - A share of the funds raised for each company listed on the TWEX exchange. - 1% of the increase in sales proceeds after receipt of funding payable by each company listed with the platform will be equally divided by the total amount of TWEX Tokens issued and paid to holders. - 30% of the profits made by the TWEX WORLD EXCHANGE — said profits are made via the various services offered. - Portion of profits generated via the sale and or licensing of TWAL the proprietary secured wallet that enables a three tier verification process before granting access to user to his or her wallet, bank accounts, etc.  We also consider privacy as a fundamental human right, which needs to be protected as much as possible. All private data sent over the TWEX Platform is end-to-end encrypted. Nobody has any privileged access to any data (public data is public to everyone, private data only accessible to the traders). But, similarly, there is a stringent KYC on all of the clients and have an Anti-Money Laundering charter that the platform strives to comply with and to thus enforce.  Tag World Exchange (TWEX) is a cryptocurrency exchange that allows anyone to buy and sell TWEX Tokens in exchange to alternative cryptocurrencies also providing wide range of services which offers learning and informational environment about products and lives of companies as well as more information about the people behind the products and companies. TWEX Tokens are based on worldwide economies not just one country — but countries all around the World — the TWEX value is based on companies listed with the TWEX platform and their underlying business located the World over.  Note: Each Token acquirer receives smart contracts for capital and a profit participation + pro-rated number of tokens based on amount invested. As his or her investment will be equally distributed among all companies forming part of the Token Sale, the investor will receive many contracts from each company that benefited from their investment, irrespective of the amount invested, as long as said amount is above initial value of 50 Tokens — 10 Euros. The same process will be carried out for new ventures joining the TWEX Ecosystem until the total amount of tokens are issued. The investors can buy the TWEX tokens during the Pre-ICO and the ICO phases.  *TWEX Tokens are non inflationary and are based on real world economies.*",False

It is standard risk that is common to most of the systems and picking up those and giving a similar mitigation is nothing new. You can't reinvent the wheel and say otherwise that this is plagiarism. You need to read and understand the proposition rightly.  Here we are trying to do portfolio based crowd lending. This gives the investor a comfort that his returns would not be connected with a single company performance but a sector agnostic based portfolio which has been distributed and managed by experienced portfolio managers. Also this is a crowd lending platform that has repayment of capital as well as profit participation along with appreciation of value of the TWEX tokens which are non-inflationary and based on real world economies.  The current status is where we have the product development already done at www.twex.exchange and our token is ERC20 complaint. We don't update or give false information to our subscribers and investors and we have clearly stated our timeline for releases. Security which is prime importance for any wallet and transaction management is being handled through our most secured hardware wallet (TWAL) which has both face recognition and finger scan implemented to open a wallet and allow a transaction.  Hope you realize the importance of this ICO and respect the effort that has gone behind to come out with such a unique proposition.  So if you don't understand and miss such information or do such fast walk through, you should not comment as your view is not at all agreeable or acceptable. Yes you may choose to NOT invest in our ICO but stop giving wrong and irrelevant advises.",False
