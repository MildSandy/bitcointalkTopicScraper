All the personal data including passwords and usernames are properly encrypted with the help of 256-bit SSL method. Accidental information leakages are prevented by session timeouts that are done automatically. Moreover, you always receive notifications on your e-mail when some actions are taken in your account. * Signature affixation. Every signature is affixed to the contract. Each contact is also affixed with the audit trail that helps identify who and when signed the contract. * The authenticity of the contract. An authentic copy of every document is created before it is signed by the parties. * Reliable transaction history. Comprehensive transaction history is available for an easy reach at any time you need it. * Universal solution for any platform. You can access your rental agreement from anywhere if you have a stable Internet connection and are using a major web browser. * Easy download.

For quick money there is a trade on the exchange.

On the Rentberry platform, all information on tenants and landlords will be recorded on smart contracts and used by a smart oracle to calculate the proprietary tenant and landlord scores. Where an individual is located will not be an issue as information and scores for both parties will be saved to the platform and made available upon request and when granted permission.",False

Perhaps they are expecting quick return on investment but ICO sometime takes long time to fruit.  My other holding QRL hasnt even released mainnet even after 2 years of development since their ICO.  Be patient.  My original investment on Berry didn't bear as it asked too many questions like KYC etc.  I got my Ether back and after long patient months, I started buying in at around 3 cents each.  Will keep buying as price drops more until I have half million berries or more.  Its great bargain price atm.  Perhaps original revolutionary concept is lost to many people.  I still believe in innovation and what this team is trying to achieve.  Its noble goal and I am very excited to be part of it.  This endeavor may take a year or longer but I will keep my berries until it bear fruits.  I have been reading some of twitter posting about rental rules etc, and pleasantly surprised how knowledgeable the Mr Lubinsky and team are.  Also taking legal action against Seattle convinced me that team is up to date on rental regulations, keeping keen eyes.  I don't blame the team for not responding if needless, pointless questions are raised.  We are all busy people and do not deserve to be frustrated.  Let team do its work and be patient.  Seeing the crypto market has turned negative at the moment, unsurprisingly, I do hope team has converted the ether/btc ico funds into fiat currency already, or at least some of it.  Bear will grip the market for time to come as market sorts itself out.  Another concern would be future marketing plan.  Legal contracts  such as rental agreements are complicated thing and frequent involvement of courts with evictions and such, might dissuade many potential landlords from joining the program.  It would be nice to have a glimpse of how team is going to overcome initial objections.   I am confident about professionality of team and especially media savvy Mr Lubinsky.  I hope he keeps up his good work know that there are us who supports the team.   Thanks.",False

What they are requiring information wise is standard KYC stuff, I also still think RentBerry is a legitimate project....however who they have involved in managing their funds and KYC information is where things get really weird for me, enough so that I am willing to refuse any further involvement and continue to waste precious time.  If you are a victim of identify theft of any kind, I can totally understand why you would be so concerned after reading about my experience here....THAT is my major concern here.  RentBerry says they are only using a well know identify verification company called Onida, however it is Cryptonomos and their site that is first collecting this information.  RentBerry has now told me on several occasions, including several times here publicly for all to see that Cryptonomos is not supposed to have access to the information being collected for the KYC, with no exceptions right....claiming they are strictly following protocols of the data privacy protection act.   I have supplied them with undeniable proof of Cryptonomos staff asking for screenshots of the form you fill out with all of this PRIVATE information, with it ""filled out completely"", verbatim!  Upon looking into this Cryptonomos company I found, or should i say I didn't find a single shred of evidence showing them to be a real company....only thing I could uncover is that they are out of Russia...post no address of their so called company anywhere online that I could find....and well, are allowing their staff to request private information directly from customers/investors that their company is not even supposed to have, see or touch.  To say this voids their claim that they are strictly adhering to the privacy protection act, is putting it mildly.  Funny thing is in all the communication over this, both in Email and here on BCT...they have completely ignored this enormous breach of security and have refused to comment on it.....but again I have very clear cut proof of this activity lol.  I have insisted that if they insist I must provide this information just to get refunded my own money, a major joke in and of its self right....that they provide me secure means of supplying directly to Onida so my information is not in the hands of this very shady looking so called company in Russia, nothing of course on that either.  The also claim I must wait 2 months till this stupid thing ends in order to get my ETH back, Cryptonomos claims that refund would be automatic however RentBerry's terms clearly state you must request it and they are providing a short window of time when it ends to do so....this to me smells a bit funny, like why on earth would you need to process a KYC for an investor you are saying cannot participate (this news came to me 2 weeks after they took my funds right...that they all of a sudden required a KYC)....but you'll refund at end of ICO without it lol.  They have also refused to comment on the changing of ICO terms after taking investment, I believe this too to very problematic, questionable and possibly outright illegal.  These terms again were not posted on Cryptonomos when I invested, but were posted 2 weeks after....this is what initially raised a red flag for me that inspired me to look into this company, that day is when I had Email communication with them requesting I supply them with a screenshot of this information....that REALLY set of my radar right.",False

However it's not clear what investors will get back in return. I strongly suggest to wait and invest only in case when this toke is listed in exchanges ( that would not happen at least in the near future from current company statements  ).  Currently all investors are putting their funds to internal currency and at the moment only way to earn from this investment I see is to sell this token to person who actually will spent it for this platform services. Let's say I'm about to invest $10 and in return from current rate ( 0.0004 eth per token ) I'll get 20 BERRY tokens.  As we do know internal currencies tends to have less price value so than actual currency ( let's say it's 30%-40% ) but not having actual services prices using this token makes even hard to calculate possible return from this ICO.

Do you not see an enormous problem with security here....again this silly ass company you guys have put in the middle of this is requesting information you are saying they should NOT be getting!!!  And again, no mention from you as to why after 2 weeks of holding my funds are they just now ""requiring"" this?!  There is NOTHING on their site that disclaimed this information, this cannot be legal....to hold a persons funds for two weeks, that could have been invested elsewhere....and THEN to say this is required before you can invest....like hah, you have been holding MY money for 2 weeks!!!!  Again, I would like to know how to back out of this and get my investment back....I am NOT giving this company any of my information and they should not be in the middle of this collecting it, they have ZERO provable legitimacy and I'm sorry...Russia?!  No address, nothing on their site to give them any credibility at all....this is insane.  I have requested from them to return my ETH, they replied with ""you already purchased tokens""....holy cow after 6 Emails going back and forth, what a stupid ass question and reply to me asking for return of my funds....like our entire conversation was around the fact that I did already invest 2 weeks ago!!

We will try to place the answers below:  The value of the token is determined due to various factors on the market. We are not going to predict the price, however, some expected fees in fiat vc BRRY coins are described in Whitepaper.  BERRY is a utility token. Token holder will not receive any profit sharing, dividends or equity in the company. The purpose of the BERRY token is to make rental experience more efficient. The whole Rentberry platform will be tokenized. Tenants and landlords will be able to perform numerous transactions on the platform much faster, more secure and cheaper than before. For example, tenants will be able to pay for rental applications using BERRY tokens and landlords will be able to use BERRY tokens to promote their properties, etc. The payment in BERRY tokens will be much cheaper than the equivalent payment in fiat (for example, tenants can pay $9.99 for rental application in fiat or equivalent of $4.99 in BERRY tokens). But the main purpose of BERRY token is helping tenants to save millions in rental deposits. Community members (can be anyone) can use tokens to back financially tenants and receive rewards in return (interest rate).",False

Utility tokens are designed to be used within token ecosystem. The purpose of the BERRY token is to make rental experience more efficient. The whole Rentberry platform will be tokenized. Tenants and landlords will be able to perform numerous transactions on the platform much faster, more secure and cheaper than before. For example, tenants will be able to pay for rental applications using BERRY tokens and landlords will be able to use BERRY tokens to promote their properties, etc. The payment in BERRY tokens will be much cheaper than the equivalent payment in fiat (for example, tenants can pay $9.99 for rental application in fiat or equivalent of $4.99 in BERRY tokens). But the main purpose of BERRY token is helping tenants to save millions in rental deposits. Community members (can be anyone) can use tokens to back financially tenants and receive rewards in return (interest rate).",False

I've read the white pages etc....and they don't clearly address a few things. My first question is how are you evaluating the rentberry token in terms of its Fiat value? I see that you offer the ability to purchase rentberry tokens in the form of Bitcoin or Ethereum but with the volatility of both depending on when you make your investment makes the value of a berry token from one individual to next can vastly different.  I believe I saw somewhere that you were roughly equating one Berry token to be the equal of $0.26 USD. That was in December now that comes out to roughly $0.45 usd a berry token. Once you've implemented the token system what are you going to be valuing the token at?   I also read that the token is primarily to be used within your system and any trading outside is not condoned though it may happen. I also read that you don't want speculators buying tokens and dumping them after the Ico, and primaly you want them to be used on your platform. As an investor/ homeowner why would I want a berry token? Where is the gain to an investor.  I read that you're going to be using the berry token and Fiat as acceptable payment through the rentberry platform but it seems to me that the Berry would have to be a stable price in order for the consumer to actually find it feasible to use. I could be wrong about this but I also thought I read that once the Ico is over you will not be creating anymore Berry tokens. If that's the case who is the consumer purchasing the berry token from? Will that come from us the initial Ico investors? I'm using the term investor Loosely because again I'm not sure where the investment/ROI part comes into play.  The other part that confuses me is the part where you say that you want the initial Ico buyers to use the rentberry token on the platform but why would I prebuy a token at very volatile cryptocurrency phase when later on down the road I could just buy berry token at the stable price on the platform. Again the price has to be stable or why would the consumer use it? Why would I buy a 50 Cent USD Berry token one day when it could be valued at $0.26 USD the next day?  As an investor I find the project very intriguing but the berry token part of this very vague. I'm not looking for you guys to guarantee that my investment has a big Roi but I'm also not seeing where it has any Roi at all maybe you guys can help me understand this a little bit.",False

(at current rate) ~ On your website, it states that $30,000,000 USD is the fixed limit for the sale.  Is that the overall Hard Cap or is the 30% of tokens distributed {stated in the token sale pdf) to management, etc. on top of that?  Finally, there was a news article published a few months back regarding issues with tenant unions in AU as well as a good amount of comments also generally voicing concern (driving rent prices up in already high-demand areas ~ SF etc).

This will allow otherwise-qualified tenants who might otherwise not be able to afford a security deposit to rent an apartment, and by having others contribute to their security deposit, providing them with better reputational and financial credibility with potential landlords.

The whole Rentberry platform will be tokenized. Tenants and landlords will be able to perform numerous transactions on the platform much faster, more secure and cheaper than before. For example, tenants will be able to pay for rental applications using BERRY tokens and landlords will be able to use BERRY tokens to promote their properties, etc. The payment in BERRY tokens will be much cheaper than the equivalent payment in fiat (for example, tenants can pay $9.99 for rental application in fiat or equivalent of $4.99 in BERRY tokens).  But the main purpose of BERRY token is helping tenants to save millions in rental deposits. Community members (can be anyone) can use tokens to back financially tenants and receive rewards in return (interest rate).",False

The purpose of the BERRY token is to make rental experience more efficient. The whole Rentberry platform will be tokenized. Tenants and landlords will be able to perform numerous transactions on the platform much faster, more secure and cheaper than before. For example, tenants will be able to pay for rental applications using BERRY tokens and landlords will be able to use BERRY tokens to promote their properties, etc. The payment in BERRY tokens will be much cheaper than the equivalent payment in fiat (for example, tenants can pay $9.99 for rental application in fiat or equivalent of $4.99 in BERRY tokens).  But the main purpose of BERRY token is helping tenants to save millions in rental deposits. Community members (can be anyone) can use tokens to back financially tenants and receive rewards in return (interest rate).",False

Big red flags (at least to me) appeared  . Asking for wallet private key which I would never give out and would avoid anyone who would ask. I'll be giving this a pass.  Straight out of their token sale terms:  ""Contributions to be made in ETH must be sent from an Ethereum wallet in respect of which you can identify your private key. Your private key shall be required to verify your ETH contribution to Rentberry and to enable Rentberry to issue BERRY Tokens to you through the Smart Contract System.""  -Similar in regards to bitcoin contributions.  ""Risk of Losing Access to BERRY Tokens Due to Loss of Private Key(s). BERRY Tokens purchased by you may be held in a digital wallet or vault, which requires a private key or a combination of private keys for access. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your digital wallet or vault storing BERRY Tokens will result in loss of such BERRY Tokens, as well as access to your BERRY Token balance. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet or vault service you use, may be able to misappropriate your BERRY Tokens. Rentberry is not responsible for any such losses.""   I would advise anyone to use Extreme Caution as we all should know to never trust anyone with our private keys.  You have been warn, but if you really want to participate even after reading this: the least you should do is set up and use a new secondary wallet. Then, deposit into the secondary wallet only the amount that you wish to contribute. Added protection to anyone participating, transfer tokens right away if distributed. Be safe and good luck.

I ask this as i have read that they want to expand to europe. BUT, in europe almost all countries have rules and protection for both buyers and sellers. Rental prices can not be auctioned as prices are fixed based on appartment size, condition and stuff like that. In most european countries its highly illegal to do such auctions: you can not ask person A to pay - for example - 1000 a month, and ask person B to pay 300. Thats illegal. We have a point system here which checks the total size, amount of rooms and things like that. based of that outcome there will be a fixed prize range you can use. You can not ask 100k a month for an appartment that is worth 1k a month, even if the demand skyrockets.  So even if the rules in usa are different i see some problems with their ""expanding to europe"" goals. Sure not all countries here have the same rules, but a succesful usa system doesnt mean its going to be succesful here. Amazon, Uber, Ebay. VISA, Mastercard, they all failed here, nobody uses them here.  there is no transparancy in current offline market, and it cost a lot of headaches for both buyers and sellers? Again, here in most european countries when a house owner tries to rent his appartment through a third party, that third party can not ask any fee to the person who is going to rent the appartment. That is highly illegal. The fee has to be arranged between the owner and the third party. So, no problems at all. The whole renting market is already transparant here, so i dont see the problem. I do however see problems with Rentberry. They can not ask for a fee to their users here, thats not legal (but ok they probably find a way around this by charging paid access to the website's services or things like that).  And when i read these things: ""Rentberry charges users a $25 fee, but in the future, it plans to charge 25 percent of the difference between the asking price and the agreed upon rent. Whoever received the better deal pays the fee -- every month."" i just see a company who tries to make as much money over peoples backs. Dont get me wrong, making money with your business is good, but when you say things like ""taking away the middleman,"" while basically you are adding Rentberry as a ""new"" middleman (who fills his pockets with even more money), then you dont solve a problem, you create a new problem.  why would anyone even use such token/blockchain system? Most people dont even know what bitcoin is! It will take years before regular people will trust things like this, and when it comes to houses, people are very careful.  Startup creating new startup? Also i see that Rentberry has been around since 2015, so basically its still a startup. No problem with that, but a startup wanting to transform into another startup sounds kind of strange/worrying. In my opinion this basically means the first idea failed, or, they start a new idea without completing the old one, which doesnt have to be bad, but it tells something about the people behind it.  The current userbase looks great, but can i find some stats on how realistic those numbers are? I mean, not to be negative, but i can see that the Rentberry ico marketing team is great, as (bought)news coverages are shown everywhere (yet another reason for red flags as basically all news coverage seems to be paid ones), so how can we be sure that all those nice stories and shown numbers are real? I can easily create a fake 120k customerbase with some easy advertising campaigns just to make it look good on the outside. Im not saying Rentberry's data is fake, but are those customers just people who signed up by email (and like almost all email signups, never look at it again) or are they really using your platform on a daily base? If yes you should be able to show us a lot of statistics.",False

Once i have bought the Tokens and vesting period has passed, i can never exchange them back to ETH and get out?? Can someone please clarify.  BERRY Tokens do not have any functionality or utility outside the Rentberry Platform.  The functionality and utility of Berry Tokens will therefore be limited to interacting with users/content within the confines of a single platform. BERRY Tokens will not have any functionality or utility outside the Rentberry Platform. It is therefore intended that BERRY Tokens will continuously circulate within the Rentberry Platform ecosystem. The Rentberry Platform will therefore be structured as a “closed system” insofar as the use of BERRY Tokens is concerned. Whilst it is possible that a secondary market could develop for trading BERRY Tokens, the Company will not create such secondary markets nor will it act as an exchange for BERRY Tokens. To the extent a secondary market or exchange for trading BERRY Tokens does develop, it would be run and operated wholly independently of the Company, the BERRY Token Sale and the Rentberry Platform.  Possibility of change to the intended functionality of BERRY Tokens PLEASE NOTE THAT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF UNDERTAKING A LEGAL AND REGULATORY ANALYSIS OF THE FUNCTIONALITY OF BERRY TOKENS.

This is the point where you have to read the whitepaper very closely.  Total Supply: Initially 400 million BERRY tokens are allocated to the Token Sale. The final amount will depend on the bonuses that would be applied to the token sale. All unsold tokens will be burned.  • 70% of BERRY tokens to be allocated to the Token Sale; • 20% of BERRY tokens to be created will be part of the Rentberry Reserve and will be retained by Rentberry, as described below; • 10% of BERRY tokens to be created will be distributed to Rentberry’s founders and employees  Suppose they sell 50%. 200 million tokens are allocated to the investors. The total supply to be created is 200 M / 0.70 = 285.7 M. 10% (28.57 M) of the total goes to the team and 20% (57.14 M) goes into the Rentberry Reserve.

Rentberry is going to provide with more services underpinned by far more complex technologies. Let us give you a few examples:  1. The Rentberry ecosystem will offer the ability for community members to help back quality tenants which will be built on blockchain, smart contracts and the BERRY tokens for verifiability and efficiency;  2. The second example is the proprietary auctioning technology which reduces traditional frustrations, scam rates, time delays, and friction points in the rental process to benefit both tenants and landlords;  3. Essentially, Rentberry is the first company in the long-term residential real estate space that will operate internationally and ensure a fair, frictionless, and seamless long-term rental process for all parties involved.  In regards to dispute resolution, all the negotiated terms should be specified in the Rental Agreement which is e-signed by both parties via Rentberry website. This Agreement will have a legal value in case the landlord and the tenant have an argument.  We hope we have clarified your questions. If you have any further, please let us know.",False

The company managed to attract $4 mln from top-tier investors and VC funds like Jade Value (China), 808 Ventures (Australia), Zing Capital (Canada), and more. The platform helps thousands of landlords to find quality tenants for their rentals and, consequently, assist tenants in their pursuit of a perfect rental home.  Nearly all the industries have already been transformed by technologies, but long-term renting still relies on old-school practices that are neither cost-effective nor transparent and secure. Rentberry is designed to leverage this trend and make both landlords and tenants enjoy their rental experience.  According to a recent study conducted by Harvard University, the percentage of renters has increased among all income groups, age groups, and household types. According to projections of the Urban Institute, about 59% of new households to be formed by 2030 will choose renting over buying.

As you know we are in the process of preparing to ICO and we are getting hundreds of questions daily in different channels.  Getting back to your questions, our scoring ecosystem based on blockchain technology will allow to create an individual score for each tenant. As the score will be based on data from many sources, the lack of US credit history would still allow you to rent an apartment without a problem.  After the deposit is collected, the Tenant transfers it to the Security Deposit Smart Contract. When the tenant moves out, if there has not been a damage claim by the landlord, the Security Deposit Smart Contract will transfer BERRY tokens that have been deposited back to the tenant and to each contributor deposit.  All the negotiated terms should be specified in the Rental Agreement which is e-signed by both parties via Rentberry website. This Agreement will have a legal value and can be used in case the landlord and the tenant have an argument.",False
