Indorse uses internal reward system to incentivize users to add their skills / accomplishments and indorse those of others.   Overview    Ownership of the data — Back to the users                         Skills Economy                        Technology has allowed us to share information more freely and readily with each other, but ease of use and accessibility is a double edged sword. Issues about personal privacy, data protection and ownership of information have surfaced, rightfully, over increased flows of information. These issues regarding ownership of personal information and commercialization of such information must be fixed once and for all. This is our core focus.                                         We believe that qualifications are representations of skills acquired. In this age of constant influx of information and knowledge, the only constant is change. That, and deep skills which allow us to ride the changes. The right skills allow us to adapt to situ- ational and information changes quickly and flexibly; they are our means of navigating this increasingly complex world. So it seems the academics and governments are not that far off in their claims - our economy is the skills economy.
