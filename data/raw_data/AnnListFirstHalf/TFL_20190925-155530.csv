Genius flair and charisma are two basic stones of Tony’s success. His team created ELVIS, an AI combining science works in search of new energy sources. Looking for bright minds, Tony made ELVIS public — shaped like a fortune wheel for a little show. Any useful experiment will be rewarded to support further research.  Unique in mechanics, Tony’s Reel has 3 open reels and 3 fixed pay lines. The winning combos are formed from the outer to inner reel. The game is medium-volatile, with a 360x maximum win.  The only Wild is found on the middle reel. Appearing on a pay line, it stands for any symbol, and activates a re-spin with Wild expanded throughout the reel – thus giving a guaranteed win.  Based on HTML5, the game has vivid visuals to run natively on any modern device, bringing the ultimate gaming experience to a diverse range of players.  “In a will to enrich the player’s impressions, we turned to another well-known mechanic, heavily re-working it and adding all these small touches, that truly make the product stand out in the market. With the good initial feedback received, we are ready to offer this game to our partner network” – said CMO of True Flip, Konstantin Katsev.

The next incarnation of Flip’s Star is built around its progressive Jackpot, worth 50 BTC on launch. Given its friendly interface and authentic visuals, the game appeals with simplicity, uncommon for blockchain apps - pick 5 numbers in the main field and then a Star number.  Flip’s Star has acquired a key role in the loyalty system at Trueflip.io. A meta-game, it will grant tickets for points earned while playing other games on the platform. Also, tickets will be up for sale, priced in BTC and TFL, with bulk discounts up to 75%.  Draws will take place every Sunday around 18:00 UTC, when a genuine algorithm by True Flip extracts a winning sequence from a newly-generated, thus unpredictable, Bitcoin block hash. The concept enables a one-click fairness check on the site.  “Flip’s Star has ensured our successful business launch, and passed 590 daily draws, bringing lots of joy to numerous lucky players. After months of refactoring, the game is back in service, massively updated in core, with more features and a whole new role in our ecosystem.” – said Konstantin Katsev, CMO of True Flip.  Meanwhile, the game is being prepared to enrich True Flip’s b2b offer in late 2019, with additional value brought by a cross-platform Jackpot.  True Flip has also withdrawn another blockchain-utilizing lottery, Rapid to the Moon, to face similar updates. The instant drawing game will return to the company’s b2b and b2c portfolios before the end of the year.  Flip’s Star is available to registered players at: https://star.trueflip.io/.",False

Since then Trueflip.io has undergone thousands of updates — from deep tech to user interface. We launched 5 games, and there are more to come in 2019.  Eventually we’ve noticed a large gap between the platform and our first game. The user interest is rather low today when compared to other True Flip products. It seems, that our first born now needs a massive upgrade.  Therefore, after 590 days in operation, Flip’s Star will take a timeout — for a complete refactoring and maths update. All purchased unplayed Flip’s Star tickets will be refunded (x2) to users’ balances.  The last draw will take place on Wednesday, 26.09.  By December we’ll come up with the plans for developing and restarting the game. Meanwhile the Jackpot funds will be stored securely and publicly at this permanent address: https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1FmQr2LMFQCp74Csyzbhq4JqzMDG7uMMnj.

Based on a provably fair blockchain solution, Chain’s Code has a built-in multiplier which exponentially increases the possible win.  Six major cryptocurrencies are accepted. All payouts are in Bitcoin.  “With its fast and captivating gameplay, these so-called 'slot games’ are among the most widely-adopted iGaming products across the globe.

For centuries gaming hasn't been changing: the players needed to trust the operators, with very limited options to ensure a game is really fair. That's the key reason the industry nowadays faces an overall lack of trust. True Flip has an opposite approach in its very core: we use blockchain to make all related processes transparent and easily verifiable.  Step 1. Sign in (18+) and click the upper left button with 3 stripes for the menu.  Step 2. Choose ""Draw archive"" for the desired game and find the draw you want to examine.  Step 3. Click on the draw - a pop-up window will open, indicating the block hash that provided the winning numbers (coloured orange). Copy the hash.  Step 4. Go back to main menu, choose ""Check the transparency"". Paste the copied hash in the arriving pop-up, then hit ""Check now"". Voila! The draw's winning numbers will be indicated.  NEW! We've updated this solution in ""Rapid to the moon"" - now it shows a detailed breakdown of the random numbers generation for any exact draw chosen. That's what we call ""fairness, explained""  Step 4a. To ensure that the copied hash was trustworthy visit blockchain.info, the official 3rd party for all Bitcoin-related matters. There you can easily search with the given hash to find the exact block providing us with the winning numbers.  Step 4b. For those with a knowledge in coding or tech savvy friends, there is an open source code of the algorithm on Github, - you can analyse it as well.  Enjoy the fair gaming and, of course, Good luck!  https://steemit.com/crypto-news/@trueflip/checking-the-games-fairness-on-trueflip-io  Best wishes, TF Team",False

I apologize for the delay. To confirm, there is still no trustworthy jackpot planned for 2018? (Due to your concerns with Smart Contract security.)  So anybody playing TFL will have to hope the centralized, unregulated TFL team pay out the $ 4.5 million jackpot instead of just shutting up shop and keeping the money if someone hits it?   As stated before, we don't trust the current smart-contracts' stability and scalability - based on a huge track of known hacks and losses associate with this solution. Instead the access to the Jackpot wallet is protected by the multisig technology. And yes, running through several jurisdiction licensing and certification, presenting both the team and the product continuously on major worldwide events offline, personal communication in 10+ social channels etc. makes it, well, rather difficult to act alike with your concerns.

Here's a short digest of our trip.  If you try hard, huge shows pay off shortly. Although iGA is quite a chamber event, it gathers the region's igaming executives. Macau was a perfect place to present the team's existing success track, decent expertise and clear reputation to this respected audience.  We took part in the ICO panel, speaking as the pioneers in the evolving niche of crypto gaming. As well, TF's Konstantin Katsev was judging the Startup Launchpad. We decided to sponsor this section willing to stay on top of the nowadays paradigm. The winning project - carefully examined - seems rather suitable for TF marketing needs. We'll definitely keep watching this team's developments.  The local audience showed genuine interest both to crypto and appropriate igaming solutions - just as we expected. Blockchain is still the Pandora's box for many, though it's impact on the industry becomes clear even for the traditional market players. Therefore we welcomed plenty of traffic at True Flip's meeting point, including both international and local business.  We've carried out a better knowledge of the regional markets in Asia. True Flip went further in terms of awareness and exposure resulting into direct connections with the market leaders. These efforts give us a visible advantage in the competitive Asian market, while our technology looks awesome compared to the locally adopted solutions.  Yours, TF team",False

As stated before, you didn't ever gain (with our referral system or otherwise) the funds you are claiming for, except those you have successfully withdrawn to a personal wallet.  As our support clearly explained in response to your request, there has been a minor front-end issue resulting in an incorrect balance indication for separate users. We've been informed of the issue quite promptly, so it had been fixed shortly. Anyhow, the bug did NEVER affect any processes except the user balance indication in several cases.  You've been the only user to claim for the funds withdrawal instead of reporting a bug.  As for the referral system, either this could never be a source for obtaining 5 Bitcoins you claim to own - given the stats both we and you see in the regarding section of your user account. These include 493 registrations by your referral link, with 174 using their free tickets upon registration and SEVEN playing for self-deposited funds.  The referral system has been launched in a very beginning of True Flip as a simple yet effective solution for our promo goals. It provides you with 10% of the referrals' ticket purchases AND 15% of their wins - as an extra motivation for our supporters.  A simple calculation shows that the above mentioned referrals had brought you almost exactly the amount of funds you've later withdrawn. Thus we'd kindly ask that you double-check own calculations before developing any accusations towards True Flip.  As well, we'd kindly note that all available legal means will be implemented immediately as a result of any intentional efforts to harm this company's business reputation. In case we're forced to oppose further to any disturbing inquiries, we save the right to publish an entire story of communication related to this issue -  as a clear evidence on the real state of things.

This year iGA holds the first Innovation Start-up Launchpad, which True Flip is proud to sponsor. New projects are like a breath of fresh air in the industry, and it's a pleasure for us to lead and support this evolving market.  True Flip takes part in multiple speaking sessions, showcasing our expertise and products in front of the most influential local igaming vendors. As a result, we prepare for a significant rise in the presence and awareness of True Flip on numerous appealing markets across the region.  As always, we'll be happy to meet everyone interested on site for a short talk or a long discussion See you, and stay tuned for the news on True Flip!   Best wishes, TF Team",False

The above picture shows our team members - exhausted though positive - in the very end of this days-long sprint Firstly, thanks to all those who found our tiny booth (though the biggest we had so far) between monstrous neighbour constructions! It's really awesome to meet more supporters and have a chat in person. As always, your positive feedback's our #1 driver! And thanks for sharing thoughts and advise, as they really help us go better.  True Flip's ""social network"" grows day by day, involving more friends, partners and enthusiasts globally, which affects our workflow in the best possible matter. Still, ICE is the best place to set new connections and go for the given opportunities, and so we did. We've held a dozen of promising talks with partners from the UK, Malta, Canada, China, Curaçao and many others. Now it's time to convert these into an improved product and higher benefits for all the parties.  Alongside with the exhibition fields, we've been presented on ICE VOX conference, where probably the most interesting discussions took place with our colleagues from the blockchain igaming environment. While these guys develop their own approaches to gain players' sympathy, we deeply believe that together we build one of the most competitive and appealing infrastructures worldwide. No need to say that sharing expertise on this level is highly valuable both for the businesses and our clients.  All in all, ICE Totally Gaming 2018 has provided us with the industry's new insights and boosted awareness of True Flip in the B2B niche. At least, we clearly see that the chosen way results into good news almost daily, and these often go along with such events!  And, of course, stay updated with our news in social networks, chats and elsewhere you meet us Soon we'll report on the further travelling plans to cover some extra markets with the blockchain fair games!

What I am saying is that TrueFlip should have an easier time getting pass the regulators for being fair and transparent. Even S. Korea is trying to regulate crypto for fear their people not understanding the risks. TrueFlip business is to drive the innovation through the use of blockchain technology.  TFL=$3.50 now.   OK, looks like we can achieve that $10, so I would raise the target to $20  because of the coins amount. That put us at a reasonable 180 million marketcap a comfortable position, but still below FunFair of 225 million  .",False

So it's good you haven't spent too much on marketing because I think you will find such a small % would trust you to payout so it's not worth spending the money.  If you look at the big value players like FUN ($200 million valuation) It's all ZERO third party trust. The game is verified by the blockchain & a smart contract pays out the winnings.  Before you waste any money on marketing, do some market research and I believe you will find a $1 million jackpot controlled by a Smart Contract will be 100x more popular than an $8 million jackpot that requires you to trust a third party to pay out.  I understand the issues with smart contracts but for as long as all the jackpot/s are centrally controlled the valuation of TFL and the player base will be severely limited.  (Investors will like it too, if the Smart Contract automatically sends X% to TFL, a % to an investor fund and the remaining amount to the smart contract jackpot whenever a ticket is purchased.)",False

So rewards are uncertain indeed.  In my opinion the TrueFlip team made a bad choice here, fooling all the ICO investors. In the whitepaper and during ICO phase, rewards as in dividends were promised. When logging in on TrueFlip and visiting the token holder profile, you could make nice ROI calculations for different sold ticket quantities. Now it all turns into bullshit gambling/gaming. Even if the rewards are very small, as TrueFlip sells not so many lottery tickets as hoped, it's better to have a certain reward and % ROI, then gamble every quarter with ""free"" game tickets. You can see the huge price drop after the report, confirming that investors don't want to gamble.  As the dividends were one of the main reasons for me to invest in this ICO, I'm also considering selling all TFL. Good luck holders & TF team  Edit: looking at the 1% house edge, maybe the game is a good reward in the end. Still, forcing the token holders to play a game for their rewards, is not a nice thing to do. Most likely a marketing trick, to get them hooked to gaming/gambling?

Trust me it wouldn’t help to have this coinon 10 ex, it has no value. It’s just the team had the balls to say they were working on exchanges while they haven’t done anything at all. This model is unsustainable, they only raised 2000 BTC and have been liquidating since, while almost half of that is jackpot money. Their projection for ticket sales is that they will reach 15k ticket sales a day (from all games combined at that) IN ONE YEAR BY DEC 2018; that’s pathetic given during ico there were 10k sales, fake yeah but someone was trying to promote or do something. It took them 4 months to basically put together a normal new White Paper where they are projecting not do jack shit to boost ticket sales. They were delusional to think investors will consider this “hot Pizza” and great news. So 1.5 years until like medium sale operations, into a claiming to be a working product ico that asked for jackpot and marketing money. So 2+ years before anything...for a fucking lotto game? People build blockchains in that time. Nobody will give a shit about TFL in 2 years They have no revenue to sustain them this long, so I foresee another round of sucker investments or they will get private. If you check they offer actually blockchain tech services; one would wonder how do you have the time if you haven’t fixed your own simple project.. They are just bunch of bad devs (cause they outsource work actually) who want to get paid for learning and making shit projects. To add to all of this they are completely unapologetic; 95% of investors are saying they are fucking up, token is 50% of ico price and they say that they are doing everything right. Their useless 40 year old bold executive who pretends to be hip wearing skinny jeans had stated that speculators wanted to see 300% profit and they are unhappy; those who wait long see project developing, hold or sell at a loss. When executive has this much faith in his company at this level who else can. They are unprofessional and at this point it’s a scam as wp changed 3 times and nothing they promise actually happens and they don’t intend to compensate investors in any way. It’s a scam as company promised dividend structure payout to investors and instead just stole the money to be allocated wherever they want.

At CRAC, our CMO Kostya Katsev performed the event’s highlight speech on running a crypto lottery and presented the affiliate offer, resulting in huge traffic towards True Flip’s meeting point. Prague is a nice city, though we didn’t catch a moment to enjoy it, moving to the next destination.  EiG and BAC are completely devoted to gambling, so we tried not to miss the given opportunities. True Flip’s Head of communications Vasily Polynov took part in the EiG’s panel discussion on crypto gambling – and did all good explaining True Flip to the affiliate community. BAC was an ultimate spot to achieve promising agreements and meet TFL holders, which makes us believe this business is emerging in favor of really cool people  Though taking part in such events can really exhaust you, profits are priceless.

You wonder why the price drops on exchanges that are worthless, it's cause the coinIs worthless. Here is why:  1) ico claimed working product with a successful launch and claimed to have been raising funds (specific % allocation) mostly for jackpot. 2 months later jackpot has only been made around 100 BTC and no attempts of marketing had been made.  2) ticket sales during ico seemed to have been fake/developer generated, as they plummeted into a few hundred a day if that (from over 10k a day during ico)  3) team hasn't done anything constructive in 2 months including to fail to get on any reputable exchanges. Words such as ""minor updates"" ""version 2.0"" and ""soon"" has been the only progress in the project. Oh yeah and someone won an art competition... They deem it an accomplishment to be able to send your tokens from MEW to the site wallet, calling it successful ""parking"". Unfortunately, to even try to withdraw your tokens you have to click all these confirmations, including email  just to come to a screen that says we will get back to you in 24 hours. I've also seen countless people having issues with withdrawals that take days to get funds out and hammering support.  4) there are claims of work constantly being done but nothing to show for: no marketing, no real jackpot, no ticket sales. (Remember working product...right) they haven't even figured out how to run a simple lotto but keep saying they are working on b2b, new games and partnership. In other words money raised by ico being spent on other things, totally ignoring the investors. Just adjusting a price to the rising BTC price took 3 weeks to fix, as if it was a miracle To do.  5) constant lies by the TFL team, first it was fixing WP last day of ico to ""fix"" the language (interesting enough language waschanged that would shaft the Investors). Some bullshit was made up about SEC, but not being able to even be listed on a single normal exchange obviously shows no effort made in that direction. Since the team has promised to launch the real jackpot in mid sep and ico participant dividends would start coming in oct. It's end of sep, no lottery, no news. No real explanation other than ""we are working on it"" and ""soon"". Token price is 1/3 of what it was during ico with 5k volume if that.  6) team seems incompetent, hiring consultants twice to get on exchange and failing both times or more likely lying, as both times those faceless consultants were blamed instead of taking responsibility   So if you are happy over some bounty program for tokens that are 1/3 of value 2 months later with no product in near future and scam team, this is the project for you.",False

MARKETING PLAN: when will it start? . AUDITABLE TICKETS SOLD:  True Flip has ""fair draw process"", but how about BEFORE the draw?  If someone hit the Jackpot one day after 500 BTC being added, how can you prove to investors that the ticket was sold? Or how can I prove that I bought a winner jackpot ticket?

However should they be able to include America soon it would no doubt lead to an explosion in value.  i do feel for you as well, it is very frustrating and disheartening to see your investment plummet in value (TFL tokens are not even worth half as much as ICO price right now) and to be honest with you i am a bit upset about it, but i am just going to hold...i would be loading up more with the cheap TFL tokens because i AM in for the long run but i also have some doubts and dont wish to expose myself further to more risk.  im not a pro or a whale or even a rich ( i have a small position of 1.5btc in) but my ""guestimation"" is when the first wave of dividends come around the price will surge up a bit because it will renew the faith in the company after which we can see a steady climb if not an explosion in value by the time the third or fourth wave comes around. this is because what the company lacks is not an idea, or product but rather faith.  it seems that most of the people posting in their threads and about them are uninformed and a bit hesitant to jump in. in fact i don't even know when the first payout is.",False

It seems plenty of stuff is done to provide a smoother UX for both players and token holders. But that’s just a beginning We’ll keep you posted on the Team’s progress with this newsletter - once a week starting now.

The company initially offered up to 21 000 000 tokens at the price of 0,0005 BTC per TFL. Over 3000 participants acquired the total of 6 200 000 TFLs, while the rest of the initial amount was “burned” to proportionally increase each token holder’s percentage in the overall token amount.  The final overall amount of existing TFL after burning is 8 924 667 tokens. No more True Flip tokens will be issued, which brings additional value to this limited offer.

Also I'm sure many people will ask about exchange listings, even if it requires a small payment, it's such an important part of growing momentum post ICO and keeping investors happy. (Even great projects listed on tiny exchanges mostly trade below ICO price for months and vice versa.) Liqui would probably be a good result for an ICO of this size.  Anyway good luck!",False

I did certainly not deposit expecting to be unable to withdraw. What is the point of a transparent provably fair lottery if you do not credit users their winnings?

The system to play lottery works fine and easy to handling. Through the TrueFlip videos at Youtube I learned how to calculate the lottery numbers based on the block after the draw on blockchain. It is very transparent, even for me as a non-tech-freak.  I am very satisfied: the system works stably. I have played several draws, and even once won a small amount, even the payoff works perfectly.  Small note: It would be good if Deposit and Withdrawal were done faster for the future (automatically instead of manually by the team).   Now my worries:  Convinced by the system, I read the whitepaper and the token-sale papers at the beginning of the ICO. So I bought several TFL Tokens and am now proud token holder.  The reason for the token purchase is in my case less speculative (I am not altcoin- or token-trader), but more because I want to benefit from the distributions for tokenholders. As I understand the whitepaper, 10-15% of the lottery will go to the tokenholder. I se that like a dividend on stocks.  But meanwhile, many new information is circulating and I am something confused... I'm reading about a lottery for tokenholders (why not? I am happy to receive a lottery as a free gift). However, this does not replace the promise of the 10-15% to the tokenholders, and I am really expecting and want to receive tokens or coins for the 10-15%, and not just lottery tickets. I mean; please do not exchange the dividends with lotteries!  I also read that the 10-15% dividends are paid out every few months.  I would like to have more transparency and some explanations on this topic, if one of the team members can find the time to explain this in a few words for us, the next days here in this forum?

Thanks a lot for your emotions and concerns.  Nothing changes. The lottery for tokenholders was announced before ICO started. It is small bonus from us to tokenholders.  You concerns with revenues are understandable. But lets realise the situation. TrueFlip is working busyness. There are different rules about ""dividends"" in different countries. The regular lotteries for tokenholders with award for everyone is the way to give to the tokenholders their revenues.  We want to make TrueFlip great and transparent project. Please remember that making things are usually take more time than talking about them. And in the theory there is no difference between theory and practice, but in the practice it is.

Vslice for example has done a few million dollars in betting volume in a year+,  which with a 2% edge translates to probably less than $50 000 paid out to shareholders & they're valued at $30 million. The other $30-50 million valuations for EDG & FUN are speculative at this stage.  TrueFlip is already selling 3-5k tickets a day with a low jackpot, with the new million dollar+ jackpot & occasional advertising on coinmarketcap  they could quickly get to 15-20k tickets a day. Which would translate into a few million dollars a year for shareholders.  So VSlice would have to get 50X bigger to match what TrueFlip could already do very quickly and EDG & FUN would also require hundreds of millions in volume to pay shareholders a similar amount because the house edge of other games is much smaller.  So TrueFlip could already be valued much higher than them and if they reach their roadmap target of making it much more decentralised and automated by early next year, it could do very well indeed.",False

Best regards, TrueFlip.io  wow, so 630000 tokens which has .0005 sats each? so you will have 315 BTC allocated for the bounty.. such a huge amount.i hope your team will not reduced it since i think it will be impossible to reach the max cap withing 4 days.  indeed, thats the big amount for allocated bounty 315 BTC max cap for 4 days left is too hard, but already rised 2500+ BTC its still awsome for now  that is the main reason why too many participants interested to  join this campaign because of high allocated amount for bounties well i hope no more exchange of the bounty pool happen after the last update deduction .  Hello LEEMEEGO, mylabs01, herdiansyahdanang, TGD and other bounty participants  I've gave you incorrect information. I've check it in the Whitepaper.  The correct information is: The bounty and the team stakes will be counted after token sale finished by this way. All purchased tokens (both preICO and ICO) are 70%. We issue extra 3% for bounty 7% for advisory and escrow 20% for team.  So the stakes still the same, but the total quantity will known only after ICO finished.  Our contracts: https://github.com/TrueFlip/trueflip-contracts  Best regards, TrueFlip.io   are you sure about this? so you mean that what you have written in the OP is just a mere lie or something?  as what written in the op,  ""True Flip bounty fund consists of 630 000 True Flip Tokens.""  and now you are saying that  the bounty will be known after the ico because its only 3% of what is being sold?  correct me if i misunderstood.   Hello mylabs01  If you count 3% from 21 000 000 tokens you will get 630 000. The sum is the same as announced.  Now, when the quantity of sold tokens are not 21 000 000, the quantity of bounty tokens are not the same, but they still have the same weight - to get profits or to sold. In some ways it is even better that quantity of tokens became less.  Best regards, TrueFlip.io   so in other words, the bounty is a rate or percentage based rather than a fixed amount?  Hello mylabs01,  yes, it is.

I like the project so I had participated in the ICO yesterday, but noted a few things that I would like to get clarification on.  - There are 2 versions of whitepaper that I have seen change past 24 hours, both listed as version 1.0 (I have screen shots of both and both were downloaded from ICO page with 40 minute difference). One of them promises dividends of 10-15% to all token holders from daily ticket sales while other (latest) promises only ""special"" lottery for token holders 4 times a year. Additionally the ICO webpage still promises 10-15% dividends. What is going on and which is the correct investor incentive?  - token purchase was seamless, there was no need for extra step of contract execution, sending funds from MEW to ICO address and TFL tokens were in MEW within minutes. However, they are not reflected in TFL holder profile. As per the latest white paper version the tokens need to be ""parked"" on the token holder profile, so how is that accomplished?  - why does the number of contributions keep dropping below 1900 BTC? it was over 1900 a day ago now back below 1900.  - slack channel invitation page keeps returning tokens_voided when clicking join and no invitation in e-mail.",False

Why?  Hello aimer1488  The list is updated. Welcome!  Best regards, TrueFlip.io   Quote from: FandangledGizmo on July 26, 2017, 06:33:06 PM In the short term I hope you hire a few more support staff as it seems there are often quite a few withdrawal issues in particular cropping up and some improved communication concerns/requests. In the medium term I hope you are able to achieve your roadmap goal of making TrueFlip decentralised and largely automated by early 2018, this is clearly critical to the long term success, viability and market value of the project.   But the numbers are there.  A $1 million+ jackpot is far more appealing to recreational gamblers than other games of chance and their odds are better than existing traditional lotteries.  The 10-15% of revenue shareholders earn is much higher than any other gambling format.  There is currently low/no competition in the crypto market & it is hard to enter as it requires $ millions in seed jackpot capital.  If you do a good job, TFL jackpots could rapidly grow to a size that would be even harder for new ICO's/Competitors to match.   Lots of potential here, good luck.

Now My Questions are: 1.: In the TrueFlip Token Holder Prfile I only see the the Tokens from the BTC order, not those from the ETH order, Will it be updated so i can see the hole TFL there. 2.: Do I have to send them somehow to the Token Holder Profile to get Profiits later or do i just let them Stay on MyEtherWallet?  Sorry if already answered somehow but i realy searched and found nothing the last 60min Please answer quick, i want to buy some more before it closes but need more info  Hello Rasta87  1. By ETH you have bought directly from smart contract. This way your tokens don't appear at the investor profile. It is OK. 2. It is not necessary to hold your tokens in the investor profile. You may keep them anywhere. When the time come, there will be instruction for use special smart contract.  Best regards, TrueFlip.io   Quote from: zedsacs on July 24, 2017, 04:23:31 PM Hi!

In the medium term I hope you are able to achieve your roadmap goal of making TrueFlip decentralised and largely automated by early 2018, this is clearly critical to the long term success, viability and market value of the project.   But the numbers are there.  A $1 million+ jackpot is far more appealing to recreational gamblers than other games of chance and their odds are better than existing traditional lotteries.  The 10-15% of revenue shareholders earn is much higher than any other gambling format.  There is currently low/no competition in the crypto market & it is hard to enter as it requires $ millions in seed jackpot capital.  If you do a good job, TFL jackpots could rapidly grow to a size that would be even harder for new ICO's/Competitors to match.   Lots of potential here, good luck.",False

I've check it in the Whitepaper.  The correct information is: The bounty and the team stakes will be counted after token sale finished by this way. All purchased tokens (both preICO and ICO) are 70%. We issue extra 3% for bounty 7% for advisory and escrow 20% for team.  So the stakes still the same, but the total quantity will known only after ICO finished.

Best regards, TrueFlip.io   Hello BitcoinThief  First of all - thank you for your patience. Sometimes there are problems with smart contract.  You have started to say that everybody lies exept you. It is unfair and unproductive.  You've sent money to contract and you can see your tokens at your investor profile. Who was stolen your money?  Yes, there are some problems occur with your withdrawal tokens to your ETH wallet. If there is the standart case, we may resolve it with standart ways, but you see that something is not standart.  Developers are busy now with new stabile version of product and can't see your case immediatly.  Could you please check. I see that your tokens have gone to your wallet. Maybe I'm wrong.

I have already told you multiple times that TFL tokens had already been added to MEW as a custom coin (I did this after a previous donation that I received TFL tokens from). I tried using your contract which wouldn't and didn't work because it says i have a balance of 0 TFL that can be retrieved and yes I have eth in my wallet to run the contract (Why you would think I would try to run a contract without eth is beyond me ) Please return my money!!

The TFL I bought with ETH instantly came to MyEtherwallet. The TFL i bought with BTC came after maybe 30 min to Myetherwallet too.  Now My Questions are: 1.: In the TrueFlip Token Holder Prfile I only see the the Tokens from the BTC order, not those from the ETH order, Will it be updated so i can see the hole TFL there. 2.: Do I have to send them somehow to the Token Holder Profile to get Profiits later or do i just let them Stay on MyEtherWallet?  Sorry if already answered somehow but i realy searched and found nothing the last 60min Please answer quick, i want to buy some more before it closes but need more info",False

Whats about all people who had won, but didn't get their money because of not choosing their number?  2. The case, why you were downvoted in trust, of course it is solved now, but it happend, because of not good caring of user. 3. On contribution site, related to the actual 20 % bonus i read ""The specified bonus is non-guaranteed ..."" this is crap. 4. Your free ticket to test your lottery is still not ready as promised. If I click pay, it says ""insufficient fund"". 5. Your login procedure is buggy, logged me out often while surfing on your site. 6.

Hello virtualgoods and Fibbage  Could you please prove me with your details by PM or by support@trueflip.io (this way is more faster).  I need to know your ID transactions, registration email and full story of your situation.

Thank you!  Best regards, TrueFlip.io   Quote from: Frank37 on July 20, 2017, 12:18:47 PM Don't know why, but i cant decide to take part on that ICO. To many things went wrong.  1. Was a big Moduloerror in algorithm, one number couldn't be choosen from algo. Maybe it was misfortune with the Moduloerror, but in a lottery the algo of creating random numbers is a core element and has to be 100 % checked related to the equal distribution. Whats about all people who had won, but didn't get their money because of not choosing their number?  2. The case, why you were downvoted in trust, of course it is solved now, but it happend, because of not good caring of user. 3. On contribution site, related to the actual 20 % bonus i read ""The specified bonus is non-guaranteed ..."" this is crap. 4. Your free ticket to test your lottery is still not ready as promised. If I click pay, it says ""insufficient fund"". 5. Your login procedure is buggy, logged me out often while surfing on your site. 6. To many complaints about withdrawals and wallet-problems here and therefore no trust, that your devs can secure our funds against hacker attacks, see Moduloerror.   Not big things alone, but together it can't convince me to take part.  Hello Frank37  Thank you for your oppinion. It is important.  1. The mistake was and it is a big luck to know about it on the start. Thanks for community. 2. Some things you may know only at the way, when they happens. There wasn't plan like this. 3. This is reality. How may exactly know the time your transaction will be proceed? Maybe the time when bonus decrease? 4. Yes, they are. Free tickets and the ICO module are on the different platforms. We are sorry. You may buy one ticket to try, it works. 5. This suggest is in the improvement bounty. Now we know that there are people who feel unconvenience about it. 6. Too many complains are exist. And too many cases where everything is good exist. You haven't know about it. Or maybe don't want to know.   Everyone make his own decisions. Please, hear to your heart and brain. Only you know what do you want exactly. Take care.  Best regards, TrueFlip.io",False

I made 3 donations and the only one I got tokens from was the one that I didn't make from the  investor profile page but directly from my ethereum wallet to their ethereum address. I don't think the mechanism that they are using to credit people on that page is working properly. And yes I added it to MEW  That is not the answer to the problems that people are having.   You Have Been Warned!!  Hello BitcoinThief  Please, don't say everyone if you don't know that it is exactly everyone. The problems like your's now have people that changed their wallets from one to another.  Have you do this?  Best regards, TrueFlip.io",False

Please check your transactions because you guys owe me some of my own BTC  other than that. i like the ico and the way its going, but seriously, please send me my money.

ERC-20 token is still unverified. But there are different possibilities to get tokens to your wallet or to leave them at the investors profile. - When will the ERC-20 token be verified? - Will the ERC-20 tokens be linked to the investor profile? It just shows Your tokens = 0, Invested in total = 0, Your share = 0%. Like I said, I could have easily added more to the ICO (probably some other ICO participants tested it with as small amount as well to see how it goes) but hesitated to add more since they could not see how their tokens link to the investor profile and are just holding on to their tokens.  6. Could you please give me more details. How were you counting this interesting sum. - The Trueflip website computed that if I purchase 20 tokens, 6 tokens will be bonus and then it gave me the number of ETH required that I should transfer to the contract. I transferred the ETH it stated but the contract only returned 24.946558 TFL's. Basically, it's not 30%.",False

I was thinking that it would have sold out in only a few days for the following reasons: 1.   They have an excellent product, I mean lottery, come on, this sells everywhere and everyone would have wanted to be part of it. 2.   They are the “first” provably fair blockchain lottery. 3.     They don’t have to reinvent the wheel, Trueflip already has a solid product and even a working product.  I see several issues why TrueFlip’s ICO isn’t selling out fast: 1.   I think there is only 1 or 2 guys providing support (probably the poor IT guys again doing everything). I see lots of questions taking lots of time to be answered. 2.   Where is the management team and community team? They should have their own names/handles in bitcointalk, Slack (almost realtime reply is very important), etc. Not just the TrueFlip.io account. This past month saw the boom in ICO and almost every ICO I participated in, the entire team, from the CEO down to the Dev’s they are there to provide support. Sadly, I don’t see or feel it here in TrueFlip. 3.   I tried their Slack to get immediate response to questions some 2 weeks back, it’s not working. Is it working now? 4.   Their support in their website isn’t working. 5.   Their ERC-20 token is still unverified. Some don’t even see it when they use Etherscan.Io. (To those who have this issue, add the token manually (via add custom token). If you see it, transfer it to a new or a 2nd MEW wallet (if you have it), only then you’ll be able to see the token appear. 6.   Their bonus isn’t correct (I should have gotten 30% since I joined on the first day, but instead only got 24.5%, which I really don’t mind)  TrueFlip could have been one of the best ICO’s but sadly it’s ICO is not being run by its management properly.  I would have invested more and would have spent time to give ideas how to run multiple lottery games in one day (since it can or is already fully automated) but decided not to spend time on those ideas since I don’t see the management’s commitment.  I hope they get everyone in their team committed to the ICO.",False

Best regards, Trueflip.io   Quote from: andrejka on July 11, 2017, 07:40:28 PM TrueFlip, what about your current referral program on lottery site? I've already referred about 170 players, and I do know that a lot of them have confirmed their emails, but I haven't received a single free ticket for none of them. However you referral program rules defenitely states: ""FREE TICKET For each user who has registered and confirmed the e-mail address"" plus ""2% OF THE AMOUNT OF WINNINGS"". So would you be so kind to comment on this. Thanks in advance.  Hello andrejka  The referral system and free tickets will come back in some steps. First of all come back free tickets - in 2-3 days. Then will come the % of winning tickets from your referral and % of bought tickets by them.  I couldn't give you the defined dates, but it is the most important task his time.  Thank you for your patience.   Best regards, Trueflip.io",False

And I have more questions: I found in whitepaper that:   ""10-15% from each sold ticket will be distributed among all Token holders as dividends -   to receive a dividend, the holders must park their Tokens on the lottery server; 10-15% (the exact amount will be decided by voting) of revenue from each ticket sold will be distributed among TFL Token holders based on the number of tokens they hold as outlined in the picture. Only “locked” balances will be participating in reward payouts. As tickets are sold in Bitcoin, conversion to Ether will happen, and bonuses will be paid directly to the addresses of Token holders.""  So if I want to receive dividends, I must:    - park my Tokens on the lottery server => My TFL tokens is now in MEW, how I park them on the lottery server ?    - Only “locked” balances will be participating in reward payouts. => Does it mean I must lock my tokens and how ?

I just want to say it is no shame to ask for help. There are many people in the community who would be glad and honored to help out!!  Even if something has to be changed in the whitepaper and it will not affect us as investors too much it will be completely acceptable.  We just want succes in the end.  I hope you guys realize what we have on hand here...   You as Trueflip look pretty anonymous,  so that is the perfect setting to absolutely screw and *uck up all the Lottery systems in the world!!  I mean with all that money your team has after the ico, they can go play around in the the swimmingpools and seas for the rest of your lives around the world but whats the point? For the guys who are early investors here know what I mean..  it really isn´t satisfying after a while.  I can tell you from experience. Have been living in luxury hotels for years. but if you have Trueflip running succesfully and than go in the hotels it would feel so rewarding and you will look yourself in the mirror so proudly.  I mean if this works you will have something and created something so extremely satisfying for the rest of your and our lives.  Please lets put our heads together and create this to a succes, And we screw all the lotteries in the world together!!     Don´t loose this oppertunity please its a once in a lifetime chance!  You will feel proud that you have created something extraordinairy and will write history. please ask the community or some big names for help. I am very confident that if you would get some good names involved your ico will be sold out in a few days!  I personally want to invest a few more bitcoins, and I can easily tell some other bitcoin holders if you would do the above.  I mean you can not leave us waiting and now saying you have more time according to the whitepaper..   please guys lets join forces!!  do not loose this chance!!

I've won something (total of 0.004), but simply can't find the withdrawal option anywhere? can't really find help file about withdrawals or at least information about if there are some conditions which must be met before you can withdraw. I've got some winnings by my referrals - and they don't show anywhere except in their stats, although it says that my referral winnings are on my balance. Certain red flags about this site:  Although it looks professionally designed and general idea is ok they're trying to collect a lot of money in ICO social accounts are totally empty and inactive they present themselves as a company, but can't seem to find any additional information... It sems that someone went through a lots of efforts to make this thing look really good, but it surely does raise some suspicion..doesn't it?  Not saying anything, I might be wrong and all this might be some kind of startup hiccups, but I just wanted to warn depositing players and potential investors that something doesn't look right, at least at this moment.  trueflip bitcoin lottery ico caution last month by iawgom37$0.21 9 votes Reply 10 293      Authors get paid when people like you upvote their post.

Now Withdrawal works;)  As for the rest of your questions, in the near future we are planning an announcement and opening of an official topic in the Bitcoinstall forum, where we will answer all questions, including yours. $0.00Reply · [-]iawgom37  ·  last month Aaaaand - an update on trueflip. They have banned my account (only the referral part) and sent me the following email:  Dear player, Your account was confirmed as 'cheater' and is blocked now. Sincerely, TrueFlip Team Last night my stats showed that more than 200 people clicked on my referral link, and 70 of them have confirmed their email address.  How I promoted their site:  I run few websites dedicated to Bitcoin gambling and I do updates both on those sites (where I published the trueflip article - only ONCE I also have a mailing list of more than 1500 users (not spam, they've registered themselves), where I also sent ONLY ONCE the trueflip story with my ref link The above mentioned articles have also been shared via social media So, as a reward for doing a legit promotion of their site, they openly call me a 'cheater'.  Another thing, before I started promoting them, I've signed up by their terms: which are still available on their website:  Get free tickets inviting your friends and colleagues, and get 2% of all friends' winnings (this reward is included in the marketing budget, so do not worry - True Flip will pay this money, not your friends). Just share your personal link for signing up of a new participant, and get a free ticket for each invited user that has played True Flip. 2% of all winnings including the Jackpot, will be transferred to your account with no time restriction! So, if some of your friends gets lucky to win in, to say, 2 years, you will still be able to get a pie of their winning! Oh, they said 'do not worry' and basically - a lifetime earnings. What happens when you bring them 70 players - they ban you for being a 'cheater'. Nice, really nice...  Also, the free tickets which you earn when you refer a player were initially a fully valid tickets. 9 days ago they've changed it - small wins which are most common - don't win any prizes at all, or really low ones, so they're not really a 'full valid' tickets.  Guys, I know you're new at this business, and I really like your site design - everyone sees that it took some real efforts to start this site. I also know that in this shitty Bitcoin world there are lots of scammers and cheaters, and you need to protect your business from those. But when you start treating legit supporters like this, you can say goodbye to your investment.  My first post where I say that something is fishy here - gets more and more valid with each similar action you take.  @trueflip - Get your shit together, and become a fully valid business, or continue with this behaviour and crash&burn - like thousands of others before you did... $0.002 votes Reply",False

It really is terrible. There are countless mistakes and it feels like Google translate was used. I think that leaves a bad impression on potential investors.  I'm also under the impression that this is the case for a lot of translations. Just want to throw it out there that it might be a wise idea to hire some kind of qualitycheck manager that is verifying whether the translations are legit. He could do so by knowing multiple languages himself or asking the subforum participants if they are satisfied with the translation. A simple poll in every subforum might do the trick as well.  Feel free to let me know if you want me to rewrite the German translation. I have the tools for this job.    CrypThinkerton",False

You are right, and we have this bug found & fixed by now. The proper code is on GitHub (we try to publish the updates there as often as possible). All the following Draws will use the correct algorithm.  Also we decide to enable a permanent Bug Bounty program after the ICO. As you’re the first community member to blaze this trail, we are pleased to reward you with True Flip tokens – just PM us for details!  We will give an extra free ticket to everyone, who had played for free using number 49 from the main list or number 26 from the Powerball list. Also 2 paid tickets are provided in compensation for each paid ticket which had played using 49/26 numbers. Frankly, these days our whole resources are used to conducting the ICO, so we’ll do this in the nearest future.  As for the second issue, we’re aware and don’t consider this to be an issue in the present time. The code will be improved rapidly in case the hash starts shrinking. According to True Flip’s roadmap, we plan a massive refactoring with third-party consulting involved – after the crowdsale ends, so we welcome you and everyone interested to help us improve the code.  Again, we are open for any feedback that the community members are ready to provide us with. We will definitely encourage all useful inputs with with rewards FandangledGizmo Frank37   Best regards, Trueflip.io",False

Good to see you guys address it. However, I am still concerned why action would not be taken now to address the second issue. At present hash difficulty, the risk of duplicate draws crashing your algorithm is approx (4/49)^7 * 100 = .0000025%. Although very small, it is not safe!! Why risk this happening when it could be guaranteed correct with a few lines of code in only a few minutes? This probability is 100x more likely to occur than winning the jacket, ie, theoretically your algo will break 100 times before a jackpot is drawn. My opinion as a hopeful investor is that it does not instill confidence.  ",False

Therefore, we are making 2 Jackpots. More details in the White Paper:  https://trueflip.io/TrueFlip%20Whitepaper(01.06).pdf  "" Why do we still need to sell Tokens? Here are the main issues: 1. Jackpot. A lottery is interesting only if there is a BIG Jackpot. For a powerful launch we are planning to raise 1`960 BTC for Jackpot via Token Sale campaign. This value is achieved by multiplying: 40% * Total- SaleGoal * 80%, where 40% - is a share of funds assigned for Jackpot, TotalSaleGoal – amount of money raised during the Token Sale and 80% - is the  rst part of the Jackpot. The Jackpot will be secured on cold wallets with use of multisignature escrow involving three community stakeholders, while the development team won’t have any access to this money. So when someone lucky wins the Jackpot, it will be transferred manually. 2. Second Jackpot. We understand that the probability of winning the Jackpot is 1:49`504`950. But the risk still exists, and we must ensure that we do everything we can to maximize the pro tability of our inves- tors. Therefore, we will have a second Jackpot, the size of 490 BTC, which corresponds to 20% of the funds assigned for the Jackpot. The calculation is as follows: 40% * TotalSaleGoal * 20%. It will also be stored on a cold wallet and use multisignature escrow involving three community stakeholders, but will only be used if the  rst Jackpot is won. Thus, we minimize the risk of losing interest to our lottery if during one of the  rst drawings the Jackpot will be won. "" Best regards, Trueflip.io",False

There are 2 glaring issues that undermine the legitimacy of your lottery and are astounding given the millions that will soon be raffled on the site.  1) Any customer who has purchased a ticket using number 49 has been cheated. Your algorithm uses modulo 49 which makes it so only numbers 1 through 48 are drawn. 2) Your algorithm discards repeated numbers and moves to the next 4 character section in the hash. This is inherently ok, but there are no safeguards to prevent a bitcoin block hash that generates duplicate powerball numbers exceeding the unique hash length. This may not happen for a long time, if ever, but there are already 18 prefix 0s on the bitcoin block hash, reducing your available seeds for the drawings, and this will only decrease in time. When it does hit, your algo will crash. For a lottery based business understanding the impact of ' small odds', this should go without saying..  https://github.com/TrueFlip/prizecounter/blob/master/algorithm.py  edit: 4 character, not 4 bit edit2: this also applies to the golden ball with modulo 26",False

Trueflip aims to distribute 70% of it's TFL tokens priced 0,0005 BTC per 1 TFL.  The overall amount of the tokens issued is 21 000 000 and there will be no more issuance in the future. TrueFlip's goal is to obtain a total of up to BTC 6125.  The early bird bonus is determined the following: -   30% in TFL’s added to the received tokens during 0-1000 BTC stage -   20% during 1000-2000 BTC stage -   10% during 2000-3000 BTC stage -   5% during 3000-5000 BTC stage  At the end of the Token Sale the remaining unsold tokens will be burned and share of all Token holders will be proportionally increased, depending on the outstanding package.  The main targets of ICO are: -   forming of the largest ever online lottery Jackpot -   further decentralization and technical development according to the general strategy -   Extending the number of supported languages -   Raising funds for the promotional campaign among a wider audience  TFL’s provide their holders with the following opportunities: -   15% of each ticket sold are distributed daily with the holders, payments take place 4 times a year -   TFL will be listed on major exchanges (the exact platforms will be determined within 2 weeks following the ICO finish) -   The holders get ability to participate in making the key business decisions  20% of the general token amount is reserved for the Team: we get 20% of these at the end of the crowdsdale, 40% after achieving development KPI's and 40% in a year after the ICO.  Another 10% of tokens are allocated to finance the bounty company, escrow services and other related costs.  The obtained funds are protected in an escrow account that will be released in defined cases, described in the White Paper. The raised funds can only be accessed with the consent of at least two of the three signees and when all the conditions are met.  The lottery's Draw transparent code is released on Github.  TrueFlip resides in Costa Rica, where legislation allows online lotteries. The team is multinational.  «One of the key differences with the TrueFlip project is the approach the team has taken. Often times, a crowdsale being offered means the investor will be waiting some period of time while the foundation of that platform is built. Trueflip decided to take a more forward-thinking approach and has a fully functional platform in use today. There has been substantial work performed by the TrueFlip team over the last year in preparation for the crowdsale, which should give a boost of confidence t investors who are looking for a polished offering opposed to simply a roadmap and a long development period to follow. Between the experience on the team itself, their pragmatic approach to under promising and over delivering and the fact that the World is ready for a provably fair, decentralized lottery, there is a lot to like about the TrueFlip platform. This is one of the many reasons I am happy to be an advisor to the project, they are doing things the right away to succeed in this industry""- said Jason Cassidy (Helium Pay, Securities Commission of Ontario), the member of TrueFlip's international advisors board.

As of the current moment, our lottery website is translated into 3 languages and the main language is English. That's why we have many people from Enlgish speaking countries, not just from the US. After we translate our website into 6 more languages, the traffic will be coming from the whole world. But this all is not related to the ICO. As you have read, US citizens are not allowed to take part in any kind of ICO. Therefore, if you look at the trafic statistics on the ico.trueflip.io page, there are only 7% percents of US visitors. Other trafic comes from other parts of the world. There are many Spanish speaking people. Therefore, we are doing translations into more languages. Regardless the fact that US citizens are not allowed to take part in the ICO, we are confident that more investors from the whole world will invest into our project.  Best regards, Trueflip.io",False

Oh and by the way, here's the proof so other BCT users know that whatever bullshit TrueFlip is trying to call here is a bluff:    These are legit refs, people who didn't know about TrueFlip and joined LEGITIMATELY. Not to mention that a couple of my refs actually deposited bitcoin in your website and played with it. I had almost 0.002 in prizes from ref winnings that never made it into my account. Can you explain how a frigging botnet is able to deposit bitcoin and play on your goddamn lottery?
