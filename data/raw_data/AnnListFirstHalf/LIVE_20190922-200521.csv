Today, 28.03.2018, we have burned the tokens that were neither sold during our token sale nor included in bounty program pool, Live Stars foundation or developer rewards. As we have mentioned in our previous posts, the final amount of tokens that should be left accessible after all the distribution has ended is 54 722 997. However, as you might know, in November our Parity multisignature wallet (0x94bd4150e41c717b7e7564484693073239715376) was attacked and the funds on it are frozen. The tokens stored on this multisignature account include 14 050 114 LIVE tokens, which are now inaccessible just as Ether on this account is. Those tokens will be burned after the address becomes usable again.  The final amount of tokens that got burned during this event is 131 226 889.

We have received a lot of feedback when we released our alpha version, and now we can say that we moved a lot since that moment, and even now, several weeks before the actual beta release, we can surely say that there's a lot more to test and improve.  Most of end-user side functionality is now completed. We have implemented private messaging (all users, both models and customers, will be able to use our convenient private chat to communicate privately. Chat can not be spied even from Live Stars administration), giving and receiving tips. First prototype of our admin panel is also ready and now our platform is easily moderated. This will make the place safer for all users. Streaming now works flawlessly.  Now when everything mentioned above is completed, we are moving on to creation of model-side interface, their dashboard and streaming panel. Models are an essential part of our platform and their work should be as convenient as possible.  Beta release is scheduled for end of april 2018. We will keep you updated.  Listing is still expected in March. We would like to point out that the exchanges are extremely overloaded  and sometimes we have to wait for an answer up to weeks.

Now model can see how many users are online and has the possibility to reply to user, ban and ignore him, see token balance, send tips functionality and etc. Now we are going to develop private messaging system which will have a facebook-like interface. All in all there are lots of new functions and they are constantly being updated and optimised.  Meanwhile, work on the legal side is done in partnership with our legal collegues in order to register Live Stars business and get all the necessary licences and preparation for future legal business in several jurisdictions is ongoing.   One more great thing is that we have distributed referral rewards to the Ethereum addresses saved in the participant panel. Everyone should have received them by now.

With further development of our project, we decided to make the overall amount of tokens to 79 928 407. The hard cap was not reached, so 2% is calculated from the amount that was actually emitted (54 722 997) not counting unsold tokens, as those will be burned. Bounty pool became 1 094 459 tokens, 2% of the overall amount. Nothing was cut down, just pure calculation. The amount of funds raised during the token sale is 4 times less than we planned at the beginning, and so is the bounty reward pool, as it is calculated according to the actually emitted amount.  Please understand correctly, that only 2% of the overall amount is for bounty. We cannot provide you more, as we have agreements with both token sale contributors and referrers, too.

I don't like it, but it is what it is.  It was a mistake to NOT explain it in detail to the community.  They can't just sweep it under the rug that the lawyers told them.  Get off your asses, apologize for the way you handled it, and move on. If they fail to do that, it would bite them later on.  When that 24 days (or so) timer stops and people can't claim their bounties for work they did.. it's going to be a crapstorm.  Are they new to crypto? How do they not know this?  I believe in this project, hopefully they at least address it in a more personalized manner.",False

Another issue -when a token is experiencing high volume trading, I found the buy and sell spread column unrepresentative and transaction really slow. This is stressful, even with experience.  As an ERC20 token, noobs need to understand the concept of gas/gwei (I think this construct could have used simpler terminology like ""package size"" and ""speed of delivery"") AND manually configure gwei (speed) before making any wallet transfers  No knowledge of this is necessary for many larger exchanges (as it is computed automatically).

What i would like to see in the future as new features though  Private group chat Profile for users with pictures and bio A kind of history of progression on the platform. Some kind of rank based on views or history on the site  I noticed there are some very skillful guys around that can really keep the tension and excitement in the air. Literally these girls would melt if had no limitation by the platform. Guys did learn that these models get the average lines thrown in their faces all day, and now they have to be a little more persuasive to achieve that sweet spot on the girl. It does not mean the girl does not like it. The girls probably want some kind of security, that the guy they like is not gonna go away next day, but actually keep him as acquaintance. You see, few guys can really make the girl hot, but if is not a intimate conversation, the girl will not open so much. She wants to keep it special to the person/s she likes. That is why i think is quintessential to bring improvements. Is exciting to talk to a hot girl and connect with her! keep the things working right and will succeed.",False

Total number of LIVE tokens possible = 79 928 407  Of which, 28% go to the team and foundation, 10% presale, 60% crowdsale and the last 2% bounty.  So, if all tokens were sold, we can say 72% went to the public, which is 57 548 453  At the moment, 53% of the crowdsale target is met, but I am unsure if this includes the whitelist, which I assume is presale.  Assuming it is crowdsale only, then just 31.8% of tokens remain for sale overall. It seems likely that at least half of this amount should be sold before 14.02.18  But if we are conservative and say just another 5% are sold, then we can say the total number of tokens will be 61 385 017  Now if all were sold, we would want to know roughly what the market cap would be at open. Hardcap is 5M from the token sale, which I assume to include presale and crowdsale, i.e. 70%  Since the 70% is the 5M raised, then we can expect dilution by the remaining 30%, so approximately (0.7)(5000000), i.e. $3,500,000 is  perhaps a more truthful initial market cap.  If you want to look at it in terms of strictly the full number of tokens achievable by hardcap, then that is 5000000/79928407, i.e. 0.063USD per LIVE  If we are generous and see the price per token purely in terms of the crowd sale and presale (i.e. 70%), then we should consider 5000000/55949884.9, i.e. 0.089 per LIVE  Worst case, we can then divide the number of tokens at the fully diluted level to give us our bottomline, which is if all tokens are sold, then crowdsale tokens are worth 3500000/79928407 i.e. about .044, assuming all of the team and foundation tokens are dumped on release. Of course they will not, but it does give the prospective buyer some basic idea of the matter at hand, for the worst case scenario.  My guess is the team and foundation will wait until there is some rise in the token value before selling. The foundation has slated the 14% for marketing, software development and legal issues. The team will naturally want to see token value rise for several reasons before they sell much. We can expect the marketing to kick in and a big lift off the bottom before significant developer dumps, provided the team is cohesive.  If less than the full 60% crowdsale is sold, then the effect of dumping by team or foundation will be greater.  Please think about these numbers as only some sketches and thoughts, nothing more. To me, the value of these tokens will rise from the price at release because this sort of product has a natural and large market provided the product works well, i.e. the interaction is good in all technical respects and does not interfere with the human interaction, which is then the next most important aspect.  It could expand more into types of interaction, e.g. strip poker, online pole dancing. This is a niche product as it stands. That is a strength going in, as it means the project can get off the ground in 2018.   ",False

A market cap of 80M would take live stars currently to just under the top 200.  I think there is a slingshot effect once you are in the top 200, with even greater leverage in the top 100.

At early stage I'm quite worry for the lack of exposure to media. But, then I realized that it might be part of their marketing strategy to create FOMO within their budget. When the 50% discount is over, they can publish news about this slowly and get more investors with less discount. They don't rush this, which also give them time to develop the product.  Reading their lean but clear marketing plan, this project actually quite smart and I hope they can launch the business in an efficient way. The next challenge would be launching a working product after the alpha release. If the product launch is delayed to long, it might lower the site value. And, blockchain for adult is still new so it would be also a hit or a miss. This could be a long road.",False

The major problems that cam companies face aren't anonymity, processing fees or too many user registrations.  It is traffic.  A cam site needs LOTS of traffic to make things work.  Without constant traffic, the girls won't stay.  Without girls, no traffic comes to the site.  You need to have both at the same time to make things work.  And if you think that simply having an adult site means traffic will magically appear, you are gravely mistaken.  It takes millions, TENS OF MILLIONS of dollars invested into acquiring traffic to get the ball rolling.  Then there is the question of getting good cam models to keep the site busy for when those visitors do eventually show up.  Sure, you can use cam girl studios in Eastern European and Latin American countries to populate the site. But you'll still need some good deals to attract the A-grade models.  And NO. Affiliates will not be the ones to generate that traffic.  If the site isn't attracting users and the girls aren't good enough to make sales, the affiliates will quickly stop promoting the site.

You're wrong.  Many sites have tried it.  Some even trying to give 100% rev share to the models.  Do you know why they didn't work?  Because without enough revenue going to the company, they couldn't maintain the traffic levels needed to keep the models busy enough to keep streaming on their sites.  The reason why cam companies keep such a big chunk of the revenue is they have VERY high overhead costs when it comes to marketing.  Models will go where there is money to be made.

Go to a fiat gateway and buy ETH on an exchange. Send the ETH to your private wallet. If you are paranoid, send it again to another wallet. Then buy LIVE. You can do that now at 50% discount.  Then you can spend it directly yourself on the platform, or sell it to someone who want it.  If you are a model, you will receive LIVE. You will then need to convert it to your crypto of choice, before conversion into fiat. In some jurisdictions, this is unnecessary, eg Singapore, as Monaco allows direct loading of crypto onto plastic debit card which can then be used exactly as plastic is now.  Monaco is limited at present (basically really new), but you can see things should progress in one year.  Alternatively, LIVE can be sold and converted into ETH or other major crypto and then turned into fiat. If worried about the trail, it is very simple to create a diversionary intermediate wallet and daisy chain.

Let's say I have my fiat on an exchange and I just bought some ETH. It is really easy to move this across wallets if you wish to hide your identity, because LIVE is an ERC20 token.

In my opinion it's all about attracting the top quality models and aiming for the highest quality both with the models and the platform. If you got that, then there is no doubt that users will follow. With the money raised during the ICO, they also have the resources to make this happen and really invest in both the models and the platform.

Minimum contribution amount is 0.01 ETH.  Quote from: PS92 on January 12, 2018, 11:14:30 PM When can we start using the product?  Platform will be fully functional on Beta release. Models will be able to stream, do private chats and accept Live token payments. Final release is scheduled for Q3-Q4 2018.  Quote from: Lupanx on January 13, 2018, 08:12:41 AM The problem with this project is that normal user don't know crypto, much less what is a token. How come a normal web cam services user will understand he needs to sign up an exchange, buy a LIVE token and finally send it to Live Stars web site to use it? Very little amount of customers will bother doing all this work instead of going to a normal site and paying with a credit card.  Platform will be convenient for people unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies, as we will provide opportunity to buy tokens with fiat money as well. They will be able to get token in several clicks and they will be able get help from support staff. We will cooperate with traditional payment processors as well so LIVE token will be bought using fiat money.  Quote from: magisterr on January 13, 2018, 10:11:05 AM Do i need to be registered in white list for token sale? And pass the KYC? I cant see the white list on your site. And what price was on pre-sale and what will be on tokens sale?  White list registration is closed. However, white list sale will only last 24 hours. On 15.01, the main token sale will start, it will be public and open for everyone to participate. In order to participate, you need to register on our website https://livestars.io. We sold 5 949 885 LIVE during the pre-sale stage. There will be 50 000 000 LIVE coins sold during the token sale.   Quote from: greatteager on January 13, 2018, 11:19:26 AM I didn't think that the white list would be closed, I want to make a large amount of money, can I register in the white list?  White list was only for a certain period of time, registration is now closed. White list sales only last for 24 hours. After that, main token sale will start. You will be able to purchase tokens during the main token sale stage.

But on the infographic i can see they ask for a 20% commission. Thats not cutting out the middleman, thats putting yourself as a middleman. I hope i see this percentage wrong, but that is what i read in the infographic.  Also delays in payments arent a ""huge"" thing in nowadays adult market. Customer deposits are instant 99% of the time. But indeed the payouts to the models normally have a waiting period due to chargebacks and stuff like that, so that indeed is a small improvement.  But although there are a few good things, the question you should ask yourself: will normal customers a) know how to buy bitcoin in the first place, b) know how to send that to an exchange and c) know how to convert those into livestar coins. Well i can tell you, 99% of all normal people wont do this ever. And even if they know how to do that, it will cost way more time then just depositing with your creditcard.  And again im not saying this to be negative, but i know the adult market, customers are most of the time horny - which means they dont have any patience - and those people are already leaving a site if they even hear the word ""crypto"" or ""bitcoin"". It will take decades before the mass will use things like this. And yes offcourse new ideas/tech is always good, and someone has to try, but still... there is a long long way to go",False

There are already thousands of websites who use tokens to tip performers, the only difference is that they dont use crypto. I do see potential in the performers revenue (although yours is still incredible huge), but not in the platform itself. A simple webcam site isnt much of a revolution..  You mention ""no third party involved"", but if customers want to tip models they have to buy your coins right? To buy your coins they have to buy btc and you need a third party for that. If you have your own system and if you want people to buy coins with creditcard or whatever you can not go around a third party. Can you please explain this a bit more, maybe i dont understand it correctlyy.  Also when i look at the team i cant find any info of experiences in the adult industry besides cammodel littleroxie. Do you have any connections in this industry? For me this is important to know as the adult industry isnt like any other industry...",False

By that I mean if you buy your Bitcoin or Ethereum online your creditcard bill will show that you transferred x amount of to a cryptocurrency exchange, not that you have been on a webcam website. Live Stars tokens will probably be traded on decentralized exchanges that do not require you to sign up and identify yourself. However, keep in mind while anonymous in many cases crypto transactions can be traced.  The ""no third party involved"" refers to the smart contract, which allows a customer to transfer Live Stars tokens directly to the performer.",False

Blockchain is most efficient in cutting out the middleman, for instance a payment doesn't have to go from you >> bank >> to whatever. I can't find it now, but they had an infograph showing the 'cut' the platform/3rd party usually takes with webcam platforms. Because of blockchain efficiency the models can get paid significantly more. Better paid models is higher quality models, they will prefer to work for Live Stars compared to other platforms of course. Better models = more interest from customers, etc.  I definitely see big advantages of using blockchain.",False

Our business model implies using our token, LIVE, as an only mean of payment between customers and models on Live Stars platform, which would allow full control of funds for both models and users of the platform. You may find the detailed description of this and how it solves industry issues in our whitepaper - https://livestars.io/whitepaper.pdf  Quote from: kraterion on January 09, 2018, 04:36:04 PM I checked SnowPrincess' stream and it looks so better then VeronicaMendez' one. Btw, why they're not the same person showed in the photos? They're just a placeholder?  Yes, the photos are simple placeholders.  Quote from: GreenCrypto9 on January 09, 2018, 06:52:42 PM I'd like to hear more about the whitelist and KYC.  Whitelist registration allows anyone to enter the 24h whitelist sale, which will happen before the main token sale. We will send detailed information about whitelist sale participation to those who have signed up.  Quote from: Name_none on January 09, 2018, 07:10:51 PM Hello LIVE STARS team, tell me there are some similar projects in the crypt world already?  And from which countries are you planning to type models?  One we know is SpankChain, you may read more about them above. Platform will be worldwide however mostly models will be from Ukraine,Russia,Colombia, USA, Romania, Hungary, Moldova and others.  Quote from: denbodso on January 09, 2018, 08:44:03 PM Hello. I have a concern about anonymity. While you can hide who moves what to whom within using your token, wouldn't exchanges know who buys and who sells it anyway? If a person buys LIVE regularly and never sells it, we can assume that's is a client. A person sells it regularly without ever buying it, that's most likely a model. Quote from: denbodso on January 09, 2018, 09:36:27 PM Quote from: Bolovich on January 09, 2018, 09:26:27 PM It is not so easy to know who is the person on the other side of the transfer. It's much anonymous than paying through a bank, so I'm not worried about it. Once again, the ethereum blockchain contains transaction between you and the livestars. If you are a model and use a non-anonymous exchange (most likely), your identity can still leak. Prove me wrong, please. If a person buys LIVE regularly and never sells it, we can also assume that's is a holder Customer anonymity means for us that no personal data is stored in the platform database. You're right about the fact that transactions are saved and can be seen by anyone, however you cannot connect them to the actual customer of platform. You also can't know what is it model and the customer discuss, and any personal things that may have been told to a model by customer. At the moment, when using a traditional webcam platform, platform saves traces of all their steps, including credit card numbers, names and other parameters. This information is freely passed between platform staff and may get compromised and used afterwards. Fraud and blackmailing in webcam is now not a rare occasion. This is described in our whitepaper. Speaking of models, they will have to verify their identity and age using an ID document. Current adult-business-related laws do not allow to skip this step.   Quote from: ImGenius on January 09, 2018, 11:46:30 PM If the ico starts on january 15, how long it will run?  I cant see details about it in the website. ICO will last for 30 days or finish earlier in case hard cap is reached.  Quote from: stprp on January 10, 2018, 12:23:35 AM How about a Livestars App for Android and iOS ?  Currently, the website is adaptive and you can use it using your mobile device browser. We are going to develop mobile apps both for models and users after we release the platform.  Quote from: Lafftar on January 10, 2018, 04:03:36 AM I think it's going to be completely impossible to go mass market if people can't process payments through traditional payment channels like credit, debit and PayPal. How do you plan on tackling this problem? Of course there's a market of consumers who understand block chain tech, but it's not as big of a market as you could get.  Platform will be convenient for people unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies, as we will provide opportunity to buy tokens with fiat money as well. They will be able to get token in several clicks and they will be able get help from support staff. We will cooperate with traditional payment processors as well so LIVE token will be bought using fiat money.  Quote from: RG_Luka on January 10, 2018, 09:02:06 AM How long will the bounty run on, dev?  Bounty will be active until token sale is finished.",False

The concept is excellent. The team looks good, most of them...  This to me quickly could become a top 100 coin pretty soon. It ought to trade well once on the exchanges. Could reach fever pitch.    The question of models hodling is important. If they see the tokens going up in value, they may decide to keep some. This could prove to be a slingshot up in price, once enough models are involved.  My only concern with this platform would be to clearly weed out underage models. A single case could wreck the business. For this reason, I understand the need for a large legal warchest and a rainy day fund.  This is a use case that always sells well. It could sell wonderfully with a professional interface. I particularly like the comparison to existing structures.  If up late at night, sometimes I still see phone chat sex adverts. This is now the modern era and if livestars can appeal to age demographics that are likely to buy and sell this material, it should prove a most fruitful enterprise.  ",False

However white paper says ""During the token sale, 120 million LIVE will be available for purchasing."" So that makes me little bit confusing? Also during first sale, tokes where only 5 cent a piece. (1 million hard cap, so 20 million tokens in the market right now?). I feel this makes 20 cent tokens really expensive.  What happens when market opens and those 20 million coin owners want to cash out their 300% gains? Specially if there is 5 million hard cap and only 25 million coins are sold in second phase. Then half of the coins are 5 cent ones.  Project is great, but I'm not sure if I should buy tokens with 20cent a piece.  So which numbers are wrong in whitepaper?

But I've got an answer from the team and it is not. Originally their hardcap was $24,000,000 hence the 120 million tokens created. Now they have changed their hardcap to $5,000,000 so when they'll reached it the remaining tokens will be burned. During the Pre-ICO, they did not reach their hardcap, I don't remember exactly how much tokens were emitted but it is between 5 and 10 million. In my opinion, for real profits, you'll have to wait until end of 2018 when the project will be released, until then it would only be small speculation.",False

But then it will be probably better to just buy tokens from the open market. Half of the tokens where bought from 5 cents so those probably sell cheaper than 20 cent a piece. 20 million tokens where sold at 5 cent a piece and 25 million at 20 cent a piece. That will make average price per token to be 13,3 cents. well that would be 166% gain for those that bought at 5cents, but over 33.5% loss for those that would buy for 20 cent a piece. I have seen so many ICO's that tanks their token price in open market. When half of the tokens are sold 75% cheaper it makes it really risky to invest. If they don't sell all those 25 million tokens then this situation is even worse.  Company is worth 6 million based on token sell, still tokens are valuated as 9 million (with 20cents a piece). if tokens would be shares they would be overpriced, however everything with crypto coins are nowadays over priced, so it might not matter after all.  We can expect that coins will have good volumes, if site has enough users. Every coin that customers buy and use will be dumped back to market by models. That might make coin price more stable. (It acts more like a currency and not like a stock.)  Other things that people should consider. This is one platform and one site like livejasmin. It's not like ethereum where people can build hundred of business to drive coin price up. Site needs probably 100 000 users who all uses at least 90$ a year to be worth 9 million and that's total sales (most of the money goes for models.). However coin circulation has to be lot higher to justify 20cent price. If only half of the coins are used before models dump them back to the market, then coin prices goes down. I can't really say if coins are worth 20cent a piece. There are multiple factors that might or might not effect the price. Like will models get their payment everyday, once a week or once a month. (how frequently they will dump the coins.)Or how many buying users site has? I'm not financial advisor, but there sure are risks. Sure coins might be worth even more than 20 cents! No one really knows for sure.  I hate the idea where company just moves all the risks to investors. After coin sell they just burn all the coins, so after that coin price doesn't matter to them. They take their revenue from models and their coins will always be with market price. So there are no risks. I start to think that cryptos are perfect way to make a company with other peoples money. You own your company and you don't need to share your revenues. All those investors just have some tokens that might have some random value. if they end up to be worthless it's was just investors money that went to drains.  ",False

Quote from: CryptoCutie on December 21, 2017, 04:58:33 AM No min payout sound and no waiting time sounds nice for the models, but will LIVE STARS also pay the models in fiat how the other cam sites? We have covered all these questions in our whitepaper https://livestars.io/whitepaper.pdf  Quote from: PS92 on December 21, 2017, 01:46:48 AM How do you guys compare to a project like SpankChain?

I didn't find such informations on the website. All I know is the crowdsale will be started at 15 January 2018. I wish they will add the complete infos on the site soon!  We have covered these questions on our website in FAQ https://livestars.io/faq  and also in our whitepaper. Our hard cap is $5,000,000 , soft cap - $500,000.

I think the reward model in Chaturbate is most likely skewed very much to the developerside: viewers pay more and models receive less. In Live Stars the smart contracts will take care of all the backend stuff, meaning there's more of the pie to share: cheaper to watch, more to earn.  Correct me if I'm wrong! Webcam projects that exist have very big problems in terms of anonymity, and payments to models. LIVE STARS solves all these problems with the help of the blockchain, the models will earn more and get their money faster and the perverted users will be completely anonymous. If they populate this project to them all models and users will switch from other platforms their token will be the local currency that will be used demand and growth in price. Plus, if they make an online toy store for models for tokens or in general sex shops for tokens, then this is the origin of the sex industry on the blockchain.    How do you guys compare to a project like SpankChain?  Live Stars and SpankChain work in the same field of webcam industry, however, spankChain have a different business model. Their sold token, SPANK, is used similarly to generate another token, that can be used by models and businesses to pay fee for access to SpankChain platform and marketplace. By the way, their token sale has already ended.  Our business model implies using our token, LIVE, as an only mean of payment between customers and models on Live Stars platform, which would allow full control of funds for both models and users of the platform. You may find the detailed description of this and how it solves industry issues in our whitepaper - https://livestars.io/whitepaper.pdf",False

Hello,  Live Stars and SpankChain work in the same field of webcam industry, however, spankChain have a different business model. Their sold token, SPANK, is used similarly to generate another token, that can be used by models and businesses to pay fee for access to SpankChain platform and marketplace. By the way, their token sale has already ended.  Our business model implies using our token, LIVE, as an only mean of payment between customers and models on Live Stars platform, which would allow full control of funds for both models and users of the platform.

Hello,  Currently, the situation with the locked funds is the following. Parity Technologies decided that the best way to solve this problem is to follow the standard EIP path, i.e. propose an improvement to the Ethereum protocol, that would solve a whole class of such issues, and also unlock the frozen funds by doing so. Parity team is now working on the ideas and implementations. Current plan is to ask community and Ethereum Foundation to include the EIP into next planned hard fork, which is Constantinople, planned for 2018. In the meantime, we have found a way to get enough resources to prepare for our main token sale stage. I hope the implementation in the next hard fork will be accepted so you and all other business impacted will be able to recover your funds!",False

I can assure you that Live Stars aims on more wider range and their business model has much more chances to success instead of Rasputin. Thousands of international girls online instead of living girls in studio house. Think about business model. Rasputin has much more costs. Pay for seeing her one day in a shower? Or pay to girl who has private talk with you? Rasputin has to pay their girls for living in their house and building additional expensive house building when their business is not even started/proven? Think about it.

We have been using such multi-signature wallet to store all funds that have been raised during presale. We are currently unable to access the funds, and its entire remaining balance - 671.69 ETH is blocked. We are currently looking for a solution and expecting action from Parity Technologies concerning this accident. We hope that this issue will somehow be resolved soon.  Funds have been partly taken out of the wallet before, and we will continue working on Live Stars project and move on to our next big goals - alpha version release and token sale. However, our resources are now greatly reduced.  We will release an update concerning our future plans shortly.  Kind regards, Live Stars team",False

Yesterday, we had a meeting, which took longer than we expected. We came to a conclusion, that we have sufficient resources in order to make Live Stars much better than it is now. We have decided to add several important features to our alpha version, update our landing, make it possible to contribute to our token sale using several cryptocurrencies and make sure everything runs as smoothly as it did on presale.  Taking all feedback we received into account, we decided to reconsider our future plans and timetable.  First of all, we are moving our token sale starting date to 15th of January. We know this is quite a delay, however we believe it will be much better for Live Stars and everyone involved in our progress. Extra time will provide us an opportunity to prepare much more material, widen our marketing plan and perform an independent security audit.  Secondly, we decided that all tokens not sold during our token sale will be burned using a smart contract. Developer rewards will be calculated accordingly - 14% of the amount sold. This will ensure that participants receive a larger part of LIVE tokens. This will be included in an updated version of our whitepaper.  Thirdly, we are going to participate in Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference Moscow (https://moscow.blockchainconf.world), which will take place on 15-16 November. Hope to meet you there!

We will use servers in order to solve bandwidth problem, and peer-to-peer content distribution network in order to lower loading times and server dependency.  Quote from: gawajn on September 26, 2017, 08:43:44 PM The concept seems reasonable. How do you plan to manage the coin balance of the user? Does the user need to send the coins to the platform to tip the model or is it possible to do an 'external' payment?  Users will have to send tokens to their website account address in order to pay for the services on the platform.  Quote from: greatteager on September 26, 2017, 09:01:41 PM Interestingly, any model will be able to use your platform and earn money or you will select models? What are the conditions for participation?  The only restriction for models will be age restriction. Models will have to bypass identity verification before getting allowed to broadcast.

Any kind of paid automated subscriptions often lead to future misunderstandings. Swap will be done instant by current exchange rates via API. There should not occur any inconvenience.  I was meaning subscriptions like for instance X-period subscription paid at once,not a payment every period.  Good to know that you plan to stabilise swaps. It is common to discuss the price with a model, and every model has an option to set their own prices. We don't see a way to implement subscription plans.

Any kind of paid automated subscriptions often lead to future misunderstandings. Swap will be done instant by current exchange rates via API. There should not occur any inconvenience.  I was meaning subscriptions like for instance X-period subscription paid at once,not a payment every period.  Good to know that you plan to stabilise swaps.  won't be bad idea to start recorded shows too with subscription as additional service  in my opinion thats completely off track. recording shows trims down privacy. all words said can be replayed and so on. models on other pages sell their videos too and the devs wont have overlooked that point.  In Chaturbate, models can sell recorded shows for a price if they want, i really don't know why Live Stars couldn't just take this approach and let the models decide what they want. I urge everyone to study the competition, for science  im the same opinion like you. models should be able to choose if they want to sell their content or not. thats not a privacy thing anymore if they choose to do that in that way. but there should be a kind of protection for them so that they are protected from stealing their content from users which are recording their screens  I am not sure how would you prevent screen recording, or even why would you want to prevent that?

Our platform will have no information about personal data used during transactions on external service.

That can be done in several clicks. Currently models have to complete much more complicated things, such as setting up their computer for live broadcasts, setting additional plugins for better quality broadcast, registering and linking to platform e-wallets such as Payoneer to receive their payments. We believe that switching to cryptocurrency will make this process less complicated than it is now. There will be friendly video guides for models as well as for members.  Quote from: kraterion on September 22, 2017, 08:46:37 PM Regarding collaboration with other blockchains, what do you have in mind? I'm excluding blockchains with anon protocol like zk-SNARKs and CryptoNote built in like ZCash and Monero because eth will have full privacy as well with Byzantium upgrade. Or maybe you're planning to move to another smart contracts platform or do even your own one ? We were planning on implementing some parts of the process using external solutions, those currently include performer identity and age verification. We do not want to disclose names and exact plans in order to avoid future misunderstandings, as there are no signed agreements at the moment to prove the claims.  Quote from: flashbit on September 22, 2017, 08:49:26 PM Quote from: matjas on September 22, 2017, 08:21:20 PM I guess the most convincing reason would be the higher percentage they will earn using this platform. I dont know how is elsewhere, but according to their description, models get only 30-50% of total income but using this platform they will get 70-80%  That's what I wanted to point : for me the main asset of this project is the better income for the models,compared to other platforms.  Did you anticipate some sort of exclusivity ? I mean : what is going to prevent a model to stream for several platforms at once ? it could break your economics forecasts ?  I hope the answer isn't in the 180 posts before... It is pretty common for models to use several platforms at once, we're not going to prevent this. We took that into account when doing initial calculations, and it does not break our forecasts. It is real practice that models use 6-7 sites per stream. Models will prefer to use service where they can immediately withdraw their earnings and ask users to pay on Live Stars, where members payment is not 30-50% but 70-80%, and they will be notified about their anonymity, therefore users will be encouraged to use our platform.  Quote from: sockpuppet1911 on September 22, 2017, 10:32:48 PM What's your strategy when targeting models who do you want to hire? Where do you get them? Could one of us become a model and earn live crypto? What are your requirements? Maybe thinking of joining your crew? Is it going to be female models only or something similar to chaturbate?  We will create a separate department of model managers, whose main responsibilities will include looking for new models and approaching existing ones. They will work with models individually. Our website will be different from existing platforms with lack of limitations and holds, highest revenue share, impossibility of chargebacks. At first we are going to work with big studios in order to create quality content. Users will be encouraged to use our platform due to the fact our platform offers the largest percentage for models, and users will have an option to pay less. Affiliates will also be a great help in this cause, and we are going to make conditions for affiliates more convenient and profitable. We understand that at first we will have to introduce per-hour payments for models so to keep platform active and full of content. We will attend meetings and contact adult webmasters in order to attract creditworthy traffic. Once models start discussing our platform, that does not have a minimal payout amount, holds, chargebacks, highest revenue share, that has all their private conversations encrypted and inaccessible by website staff, stores their personal data in a secure way and that it can be easily deleted by themselves, we are sure that it will create a certain positive attitude towards Live Stars in the whole industry. We are already in contact with 2 big studios (each 300+ models) and for today we already getting new cooperation opportunities by different studio owners who email us, but we haven't yet started to promote us outside of cryptocommunity.  Quote from: Rigorous on September 22, 2017, 11:37:01 PM Why does Live Stars need to be on the blockchain? It's mentioned in the whitepaper but never explained. How does it use the blockchain and benefit from it? Live Stars won't be exactly ""on the blockchain"". We are taking advantage of some options that blockchain provides. This allows us to create a platform that is several steps ahead of the analogues and is still simple enough for current users. All advantages are mentioned in the whitepaper.

Sonjasluder is phone sex service. Why would you even compare it to our platform? What kind of anonimity do you expect from a phone service? User does not have to care about blockchain or any kind of tech behind the service, however anonymity that is easily provable by open source would matter a lot to regular customers who spend up to several thousand USD monthly using webcam services.  High prices and per-minute payments are caused by high commission fees due to many mediators and the fact competitors have to promote their product on the market. The main reason for such high fees is old and non-optimized business model behind the service. This is the main thing we set to improve.  Most important for webcam users is content and their anonymity. Content is mainly created by models, and as you said, our platform offers a variety of advantages to them. Speaking of anonymity, webcam users complain a lot about the fact their private video and text chats are not really private because website administration is able to check them out. Highest revenue share on the market means members money actually gets to the model.  In webcam, number and quality of models on the platform and creditworthy user traffic are essential for success. We do understand this and that is why conditions for affiliates and models will also be much better than the ones offered by current market.",False

But anyway it is still new experience and feelings trying to adopt VR in adult industry. Touching reminds me article I have read recently about sex robots where cyber security expert Dr. Nick Patterson warned that sex robots could be hacked more easily than a phone or computer – and once breached, the hacker would have full control of a powerful robot. Nightmare.  However, with a price tag of approximately $10,000 per sex robot, it is unlikely that people will see killer sex robots wreaking havoc on the streets in large numbers anytime soon.",False

Webcam sites have their own rules. Some of the rules forbid to do competitor website advertising, make customer giveaway, giving personal contact or payment information like skype or other messengers, so model can be paid directly and therefore website loses money. There are different personnel who is responsible for checking all these activities by reading  messages. Automatic system helps to match and highlight forbidden words or numbers(like phone number). They have to be sure if the discussion contains rule violation or they simply talked about skype company or mentioned  ""sky"" word. Models get fined for these repeated violations so this also gives webcam sites additional profit.  Just the fact that the customers stream (Cam2cam option when model sees members cam) could be also moderated by personnel staff so phone numbers written on sheet could be caught too.",False

I studied the adult live show market about 10 years ago and my main finding was that performers was highly underpaid (less than 50% of what the customer paid to see them), especially with websites/performers located in East Europe and third-world. I also talked with some performers and they all told me that they would like to be better paid, have better work conditions and more freedom.  I almost tried to launch a live show website by myself, willing to share 75% of the revenue to the performers (and already knew a lot of them, from all over the world, willing to work on a site like that); but it was a lot of work, a lot of hassle with French laws and my girlfriend at that time thought I was willing to become a pimp...

Honestly, it's great to hear from someone who had a similar idea. After working in that field for quite a long time, our team members can tell the same story.

Live Stars is not associated with Shinecoin in any way and our project is a separate entity. We did not take Shinecoin into account when our whitepaper and business model was being developed simply because we were unaware of such project. Our ideas are based on our own experience in this field and knowledge of internal issues. You can tell that by simply comparing our whitepaper and Shinecoin's. They do not have much in common.  Live Stars team does not want to risk contributed funds, so we set a task to create a product that will have the most chances of actually working when it comes to the final release. When defining our task, we came to a conclusion that our product, in order to become popular and actually enter the competition, has to be easily understandable, and the transition from the current offers to our platform should be simple enough for anyone to grasp.  When something is upgraded or improved, users mostly care about the advantages that the improvement provides to them, not about the technology that stands behind. We, as a team of developers, can take advantage of blockchain technology in order to create a product that is better than current analogues in most simple and in-demand terms - we offer higher performer revenue share, security from potential fraud, provable user anonymity - without changing the way it looks to our end-users.  We aim on solving real business issues using blockchain tech.",False
