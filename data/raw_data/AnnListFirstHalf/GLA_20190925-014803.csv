We did not realise this at first, but this is why it's called BETA testing.  The last part of the development will therefore be integrating this payment system into the platform. We have looked at this carefully, there is no other efficient way to do this.

Please stay tuned.  This detail will include what the rewards in GLA tokens will be on joining, what conditions will be required to earn them etc (this will include KYC).  REFERRAL PROGRAM - We are looking for 5000+ rewarded participants to join the PUBLIC BETA. To acheive this we will be openning up a referral program where for each successful referral, a ""bounty"" payment in GLA tokens will be rewarded to you. Full details within the next 48 hours (NOTE.. KYC will be a requirement).  Previous exciting information.......  1. REMEMBER ALL PAYMENTS FOR A SERVICE FROM GLADIUS will be with the GLA utility token. There will be an option to pay in FIAT (US$) but this will be converted backend. We plan to be offering the option for both GLA payments and credit card payments near or at launch. In the back end for credit card payments companies will still have a GLA balance (that we facilitate), but will not be able withdraw any so money transfer licenses won't be a problem. They will still have all the benefits of using blockchain tech and crypto without having to directly interact. Of course if a site wants to pay directly with GLA they would get more for their money. 2. Full Public BETA release next week. 3. Reddit AMA to be created and established before this time. 4. NEW WEBSITE next week - No longer an ICO but fully operational BETA platform. 5.

Latest release is 0.6.2 - Found here https://github.com/gladiusio/gladius-node/releases 2. From the development side. We are full steam ahead! The feedback from the BETA testers has been awesome! Truth is we have had such good feedback from you guys, we need time to catch up before taking on new BETA testers. 3. We have decided to not caste in stone an exact end date to the public BETA. Truth be said. Its not possible until such time as we uncover all the issues 100%. This means BETA testing may end in October, November, December or even January! If we had a crystal ball, be able to ""see"" into the future then yes an exact date would be possible. 4. As a result of the above. We will be completing the KYC and BETA reward....""as we go along"". Therefore once a ""tester""has completed the 72 continuous hours we will be awarding them the reward as we progress after completing a KYC (hope to have KYC prepared next week). 5. Also as a result of this awesome feedback, we will only be supplying referral links as and when we are ready to take on board more BETA testers. 6. Discord is the communities choice.

How will you work because prices have fallen on your tokens. It seems to me that now everything is massively beginning to sell everything.  if you call this the beginning of a sell-off, maybe you can enlighten me what you would call what happened back in January and February. That was a sell-off! And it was the beginning! But I do not lose hope that soon the price will be much more than this winter. I think positively in this matter and do not lose hope.  Oh man same for me believe me. I am sometimes dreaming about this it's crazy. Right now the market is bleeding out and it hurts to look at the charts. it's good. the volume so low but GLA token still can raise +10%. which mean the sell off party is over. we just need to wait till the gladius product launch  sorry but it doesn't mean anything. With low volume these movements of 10% are meaningless. Look at the market and it can continue going down for quite some time. no, it's always mean something. for example 1. low volume & GLA token can raise +10% which also mean there is less traders step in the GLA market to take short term profit with the gap between buy order and sell order 2. if the low volume become much higher than before when the price is falling. it's mean we still have some buyer come into GLA market. it has low probability that the old holder will sell their GLA token at this current price. the highest probability i think the wing community already get their GLA token. on the previous post i have ask question once about the payment for wing community but no body answered. for overall price prediction always has some uncertainty because we don't know when the buyer or seller step in the market.    but yes it's doesn't mean something for us if our prediction is getting wrong in the end. right now we only hope that the gladius product will be release successfully then we might see the new buyer will help the price up again",True

I wrote to the owners of Substratum in this matter if they would help me. They did not write back to me. It was a very important project for me, and the fucking HitBTC stock market robbed me, and I do not have the money to get 1000 substrate again, all the more that the price has grown !!! Can You help me ? If you want, I can put in evidence on the forum from the HITBTC exchange, and show the screenshots that the exchange really robbed me. I would ask for help in small amounts from people who can. If I help a few people, by paying small amounts, maybe I will have the chance to buy back the lost 1000 Substratum, which the HitBTC exchange has stolen from me. Thank you in advance and best regards.  My wallet - Ethereum - 0x3362783FF6b627A0B6D6D18b723077771728bf7b I am asking for help, if you can.  Email - sylwesterbtc@gmail.com",True

I have a question about your future product - it's written in the white paper that Gladius Network is going to utilize Ethereum network as a centralized database for storing the proxies and their associated service providers. https://i.imgur.com/kcf8Dex.png Is this a typo? Centralized database on Ethereum network?  Another, more important question is about the rewards for the nodes and pools: You stated that you're going to use Ethereum smart contracts for token transfer. Does this mean that your token is a standard ERC20 token? If so then how are you going to address an average transaction cost of $0.30 in Ethereum network? Additional problem is that to transfer an ERC20 token like yours one needs to have some ETH on their wallet. This poses certain limitations on how your system will work. Please clarify what exactly you have in mind to solve these potential problems and if you do have something why didn't you reflect it in the whitepaper.",True

The transactions are grouped together to lower the overall transaction costs, so pools could choose to pay out daily or based on the total amount earned in that period.  Our solution to that is to allow pools to take deduction from the total amount of GLA payed to a node and instead pay that portion in ether as well for paying for transaction costs.

The current position from the standpoint of the Security and Exchange Commission in the U.S. is uncertain, and that causes a lot of ICO's to reflexively ban United States citizens from participating.  But if the company that is running the ICO does some homework, or seeks legal advice, they find out that as long as the ICO is framed a certain way, there is little chance that the token will be seen from the SEC as a ""Security"" which would open the ICO to legal trouble, if they didn't register it as such (and almost none do, since it's prohibitively expensive for a startup).  We have seen the SEC actually act against two ICO's (run by the same company) recently, but if you look carefully into it, you will see that the SEC is going after just the right types of people in this case.  So by and large, if you look carefully at ICO's from the perspective of the Howey test, you will find that most of them nowadays, with few exceptions, are being careful to present themselves in a way that will not cause them trouble later.  This particular ICO is a straight-up ""utility"" token, so they are hewing the right line.",True

There is a really excellent document about this floating around -just type ""A Securities Law Framework for Blockchain Tokens"" into your favorite search engine and you'll find a PDF.  Great document - but in the back of that doc, you'll find a link to a Google Spreadsheet that actually allows you to conduct your own ""Howey Test.""  Pretty good stuff.  Of course, no one knows what the SEC is going to do but the SEC, but for us mortals it's a decent enough set of tools to guide us in our decisions, in my opinion.  Essentially, if there is no expectation that the token provides equity in the company or an expected return on investment, and if it confers utility - that is a way to use it on the network - then it's most likely not going to be considered a security.  But check that document out - very interesting stuff...",True

Import update on the Gladius Token Sale   Private Presale:  After some internal discussions with our team, we have decided to prolong the current funding period, the private presale, by 23 days until November 23rd for a number of reasons (see below).  Public Presale:  After the private sale we have decided to launch a public presale from November 24th to December 30th. This gives you, our community, the chance to get in early with a friendlier bonus structure. We will be releasing the specifics very soon. However, it’s very likely that we’ll reach the cap much sooner.  Public Sale:  We have decided that in terms of the public sale, it is in everybody’s best interest to have it pushed back to January 14th. This gives us plenty of time to build our system into a more full fledged product and grow our community to even larger numbers.  https://medium.com/@gladiusio/gladius-presale-has-been-extended-new-public-presale-coming-soon-and-more-50cc657d8d90",True

But I think burning unsold tokens would have been the best option as it looks more fair to the investors.

Spearheading these efforts is a startup called Gladius, who aim to defeat DDoS attacks by creating a network of bandwidth sharing.  The core of all DDoS attacks involves using up the bandwidth of their victims’ servers. Most servers are centralized, with a finite amount of bandwidth, so a sudden flood of excess traffic can fill that space up quickly and lead to disruption of service.  The answer, Gladius believe, lies in simply providing more bandwidth. This is tricky under the current centralized system, so they plan to create a decentralized network of servers that can share bandwidth with one another when the need arises.
