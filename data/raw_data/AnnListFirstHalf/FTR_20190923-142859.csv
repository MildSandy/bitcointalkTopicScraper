The disruptive power of blockchain technology has started to spread in different fields, showing promising capability of overcoming obstacles which we face in our daily life. Many projects from this field are therefore already showing the potential of bringing the solutions to our problems that were before seen as unsolvable.  As a project leader of Futourist I believe we need to bring benefits of blockchain technology closer to everyday users. Building a real application is important in order to show the maturity phase of this space.  That is why we are building our platform — to enable people to share their experience from the places which made them richer.  Many people think that Futourist will offer just reviews. But if you look at our Whitepaper, what we have been communicating through our channels and writing on our blogs then a Bigger picture appears. People will be able not to just write reviews and get rewarded. They will document the amazing experiences they went through with the help of pictures and videos. Content will be consumed for the purpose of informing one another and helping each other. For example someone who has been in a place which there is not much known about will know what to tell everyone else that are interested in that place — what to look out for, where to go, which food to eat, where to sleep, how to communicate, how to dress properly…  We want to create a blend of a product and a service where digital, hardware and human interact with one another. We want Futourist to become a useful application in your life — not to bother you with beeping and annoying you 24/7, but with the purpose that whenever you need it, it is there for you.  Consume, create, share and monetize The Grand vision of Futourist is to become a self suffiecient community in the everyday life of travelers, tourists, bloggers, photographers and everyone else that creates and consumes content which is made by users.  Bringing benefits of blockchain to everyday users Real time application on blockchain is needed in order to bring benefits of blockchain to everyday users. We have been following the development of blockchain from the begining and we believe that maturity phase will only come when everyday users will adopt applications like Futourist.

Bancor is a decentralized liquidity network based in Zug, Switzerland. Bancor completed a historic Token Generation Event in June 2017. It aims to unlock the long tail of user-generated currencies by solving the liquidity challenge, allowing any token to be convertible to any other at continuously calculated prices, regardless of volume and outside of exchanges.  By integrating the Bancor Protocol, Futourist token holders will gain access to continuous liquidity regardless of trade volume or exchange listings, through the Bancor Network™. Bancor will allow for instant conversion of Futourist Tokens (FTR) directly through Bancor’s simple Web App. Conversion is possible between FTR, BNT, ETH and any token in the growing list of tokens integrated in the network.   The Bancor Protocol utilizes a “Connector” token method which networks tokens together through formulaically calculated prices, without needing to match buyers and sellers like in traditional exchanges. Futourist will activate a Token Relay™ with 1% of its circulating token supply within the first week following the distribution of the FTR tokens after a successful completion of the Futourist Token Sale.  Futourist rewards users for their reviews with the help of blockchain technology. Futourist’s custom protocol solution enables rewarding users with microtransactions, is transparent and trustworthy and brings blockchain technology closer to mainstream adoption with simple use of the platform.  Some key features, numbers and statistics regarding Futourist:  General Rewards (users who contribute meaningful reviews will be regularly rewarded with FTR tokens). Contests (companies providing contests where users will be rewarded for their content with FTR tokens). OpenHours platform, which Futourist will build on pre-existing infrastructure, is present in more than 20 countries and has more than 1 million monthly users. Nearby Offers (users will spend their FTR token on offers provided by companies signed up to the platform). Service reward implementation (matching the right services with the right customers using FTR tokens). Business intelligence (customer data provided with in-depth analytics for travel providers, restaurants, leisure equipment producers, hoteliers and many others), Content industry in which Futourist operates will by some expectations be worth $310 billion dollars. Futourist Payment Card (Futourist has already partnered up with a payment card company and it will introduce users to the potential of the blockchain in an easier way with this card — users will be able to spend their FTR tokens instantly).  Futourist is not your average ICO. Futourist will already offer pilot contests and general rewards in 2018 and a beta version is planned for release at the end of 2018. Official release will be in 2019.  To know more about Futourist, visit Futourist.io and join their Telegram group.  About Bancor:  Bancor Protocol is a standard for the creation of Smart Tokens™, cryptocurrencies with built-in convertibility directly through their smart contracts. Bancor utilizes an innovative token “Connector” method to enable formulaic price calculation and continuous liquidity for all compliant tokens, without needing to match two parties in an exchange. Smart Tokens interconnect to form token liquidity networks, allowing user-generated cryptocurrencies to thrive. For more information, visit the website and read the Bancor Protocol White paper",False

But when it comes to sharing that revenue, content creators tend not the be a part of the story at all. Futourist’s team claims that they will change that.

After the contest ends, all applicable reviews will be sorted by their upvotes and downvotes.

This is from their page:  “Futourist is the first travel review platform that rewards their users through building a fair blockchain-based economy where all — reviewers, businesses and casual consumers — get the most benefit for participating. It’s a place where future tourists will make decisions about where they are spending their precious time”.  And:  “That way somebody who has a regular job and creates content as a hobby now has a chance to earn money on the side. That comes instantly without struggling years and years to come to a certain point of creating some stream of revenue for themselves”  But in common words this means:  People will get paid for interacting with other people. Will get paid for their contribution to the community and every single post or review will be rewarded! This will put more power to the real content creators as they will be rewarded from the first review they make without the need to write 200 reviews and wait months or years to attract enough audience for their reviews. All earnings will be paid in FTR (Futourist) token that will inscrease in valute with the increase of number of Futourist.io users and with growing number of reviews posted.  https://medium.com/@denismuerlin/i-am-writing-this-post-as-i-think-some-thing-arent-like-they-should-be-b4cd7054a031",False

Tokens are going to have a hard time increasing in value.    The only way that demand for FTR tokens to increase in price(outside of market speculation) is if businesses buy the tokens and use them to to host contests/promotions. Every other usage of FTR tokens involves giving tokens to the community to incentivize content creation. This will mean more selling pressure than the demand for FTR.  I think the Futourist has a good business plan and I am a huge fan of all the features it intends to roll out, however it needs to work on the ways to generate token value. That alone is the sole weak point of this project, I feel.",False

Sure, we could just list them here, you skim through and we are done with it. But we’re not going to do that. Instead, why don’t you let us take you on a little journey and try to paint the experience that the Futourist platform has to offer. You ready? Ok, let’s go.   Imagine yourself in an exciting moment at your dream destination. Take your pick, this could be anywhere in the world (or outer space). Release your imagination. Really, try it.   Are you there yet? Great. Now, think about how your experience looks like; what are you doing; what are you wearing; who did you meet; what are you eating? Let it all sink in then dwell on it for a second.  Do you have it? How does it make you feel? If you’re anything like us it’s probably one of the best things in your life and it would be great if you could share it with other people, right?   No one is left out You can earn Futourist tokens (FTR) by uploading high-quality travel-related content onto our platform. Contributing members will be regularly rewarded through our General Rewards scheme. Anyone that takes the time and contributes a meaningful review will get something in return for their hard work.  But this is just one way for you to get your hands on those sweet tokens. We’ll also be holding regular sponsored Contests with much larger honey pots. Contests will revolve around different topics and you can share your experience with that topic. It can be anything from restaurants to accommodation, parks, things to do and places to see, transport, you name it. Submit your review, and the better the community response, the bigger the slice of the reward.  Futourist is not just about the rewards To wrap it all up there’s one more neat core feature. We call it Nearby Offers. This one doesn’t reward you with tokens but it does let you spend what you made on the platform. In case you thought to yourself “Where can I spend my FTR tokens”. How does Nearby Offers work? Companies signed up to the platform will be able to post special offers for a short period of time. Think of it as real-time Groupon. You’re walking in the old part of Vienna and get thirsty for a drink. You open up your Futourist app and see there are six bars in your walking distance that have a happy hour for the next two hours. Your account is full of hard-earned FTR tokens so you can grab a couple of drinks for you and your friend at an awesome rate, show up and enjoy them.",False

They just immerse themselves into the experience. Others want to have every step of the way planned out. Guides are perfect for both ends of this spectrum and all the ones in between. They can give you a starting point to drift off from or they can give your trip a solid structure.  We want to encourage users to create all sorts of guides on the Futourist platform. We promise, we won’t hinder your creativity. You can write them, turn them into a video, or maybe make them in 3D or serve them via augmented reality. It’s up to you.  1:1 CHAT and TIP4TIP  Before inputting all the coordinates in your travel itinerary you’ll probably want some additional info on the place(s) you’re about to visit. Advice and tips from people who have already been there can literally be life-saving.  The Futourist platform will give you high-quality reviews to start you on your way. Not only that, you’ll be able to chat directly with other members of the community about your destination through the 1:1 Chat and TIP4TIP. This will be one of the many parts of the internal economy. If you’re a community member with high reputation and lots of travel knowledge others can give you their Futourist tokens (FTR) for 1:1 conversations and some sage advice.  TRAVEL LOTTO GIVEAWAYS Often when we travel we need different things for our journey — like for example a quality camera to take great photos to remind us of the places we have traveled to. When Futourist influencers (reviewers with a great deal of community respect) will want to reward back their community or increase their rep they will throw a giveaway of all the cool stuff they get from different companies related to traveling and tourism. Users interested for the giveaways will be able to use their FTRs to join the lottery and get the chance to win one of the prizes. Those will have an actual usage for the users next trip.  And don’t think we forgot about the business side of things. SERVICE REWARD IMPLEMENTATION  This one will be one of our top priorities. Matching the right services with the right customers is the holy grail. For both sides. The platform will come equipped with a dashboard where businesses can offer time-limited offers for services or products exclusive to Futourist.  BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE  As more and more people start onboarding the Futourist platform the amount of customer data will begin to increase. This kind of information should prove very beneficial to travel providers, restaurants, leisure equipment producers, hoteliers and many others.  In-depth analytics will be available to businesses for every quarter in exchange for FTR tokens. We’ll provide them with:  • Measurable results of running contests and platform positioning,  • quarterly reviews, reach and audience reports,  • improvement suggestions,  • offer suggestions,  • time period comparison.

They shape how people see things on a daily basis and most importantly – they’re directly related to business revenue. The number of written reviews has reached 500 million on TripAdvisor alone. According to recent statistics, 90% of consumers read online reviews, and 88% of them trust them. Furthermore, 89% of consumers say they read more than 2 reviews.  Travel review industry is big and hasn’t been disturbed in a long time. Platforms are failing to embrace new technologies and the whole field is stagnating.

Futourist is the first travel review platform that rewards their users through building a fair blockchain-based economy where all - reviewers, businesses and casual consumers - get the most benefit for participating. It’s a place where future tourists will make decisions about where they are spending their precious time.  Why have we decided to launch Futourist? Because there are only a handful of people who have managed to turn their content into profit, while the majority of content creators are left out without anything. Platforms associated with content do not pay their users for creating, sharing and curating content. And a large part of that content are reviews.  What is our solution? Our solution is aimed to build the first platform in the world that rewards users for creating, sharing and curating reviews. That way somebody who has a regular job and creates content as a hobby now has a chance to earn money on the side. That comes instantly without struggling years and years to come to a certain point of creating some stream of revenue for themselves.  How big is the potential market? Revenue of content industry was worth more than $ 190 billion in the year 2016 and is expected to be worth more than $ 313 billion by the year 2019 From early researchers it is estimated that almost $ 31 billion a year of UK consumer spending is potentially influenced by online reviews The market cap of travel review industry in 2015 was worth more than $ 1 billion in North America alone UN World Tourism Organization is projecting 1.8 billion tourists by 2030   What do we have available until now? Unlike many other blockchain startups, we already have an existing and working platform – OpenHours – available to us with more than 1 million monthly users.   Wait what? How is OpenHours connected to Futourist? OpenHours is an existing website with over 1 milion monthly users. We are going to connect OpenHours to our blockchain protocol, delivering contest and token distribution services, turning OpenHours to new product - Futourist.s   When will the Futourist platform officially launch? Futourist platform will officially launch after the second half of 2018.   What is the grand vision of our team? We want to build a platform that will change the perception of content creator’s value, bring balance between them and the world of business and by awarding them with tokens for their reviews. We want Futourist to become one of the most practical applications of blockchain technology, with the intention of bringing benefits of blockchain to everyday use   www.futourist.io",False

The platform spread across the EU and USA in the last decade. Due to superior SEO (search engine optimization), OpenHours receives more than 1 million organic monthly user visits. Years of advanced data scraping gave OpenHours a large database of businesses. The current platform is not one dimensional though. It’s users engage with the platform by adding reviews, photos, correcting opening hours and adding other business information.  With pleasure I will contribute to Futourist.",False

If you’ve read my last post (find it right here), you know I have a bone to pick with TripAdvisor and other travel review sites. And, this here just amplifies all my concerns ten-fold.  Early last year, Oobah Butler, a freelance journalist obsessed with the fake news reality we all seem to inhabit these days, decided to serve absolute crock to the gullible people of London — a fake restaurant that no one has ever visited — and see if they would eat that bullshit up. He had some experience writing fake TripAdvisor reviews before (and watched how those restaurants reaped the benefits), but now he wanted to push the envelope further.    If you want to check out his whole story, I suggest you take 20 minutes to watch his video. It’s both hilarious and disturbing, and nicely underscores why your reliance on TripAdvisor (and most other review platforms) is completely misguided.  If you don’t have 20 minutes to spare, here’s the crux of it.  Oobah created a listing on TripAdvisor, calling his backyard shed The Shed At Dulwich. He got a burner phone (for verification) and the listing was approved in May, 2017. He then proceeded to add fake reviews to it by enlisting his friends and family. He knew he was dealing with a fad-oriented crowd, so he wanted to create a buzz by giving emotion-themed names to his meals: love, lust, comfort, you get the drift.  Here’s one of those famous meals:  In early November, after only five months, The Shed At Dulwich secured the coveted first place on TripAdvisor — WITHOUT ANYONE EVER SETTING FOOT IN THE PLACE!  I can’t stress this enough — Oobah never served a single customer in his make-belief restaurant. The description said it was ‘appointment-only’ and he was pretty good at blowing people off when they called to make a reservation, saying that the Shed was booked solidly for months. Oh, and guess what? People called from abroad to make a reservation!  In December of 2017, Oobah decided to cash in on his story (as any good journalist would), and the jig was up. Before that, he hosted an impromptu dinner at the Shed and finally took some real reservations, serving frozen instant dinners to the unsuspecting crowd. At least one customer attempted to make another reservation.  Man, hipsters make it really difficult to like them.  You see now why you need to know about this? If a bogus restaurant can manipulate TripAdvisor into thinking it’s a real place, how easy is it to skew rankings for restaurants that actually do exist?  The answer: very fucking easy.  How Did TripAdvisor Answer To This Colossal Screw Up? If you think that TripAdvisor vowed to change the way it vets the reviews coming in, you’d be sorely mistaken. Their spokesperson said that the listing was already being investigated before the story broke (fat chance, really) and that, in anyway, this wasn’t a real-world case: who manipulates rankings for a non-existent restaurant when there’s nothing to be gained there?  That’s true, Oobah had nothing to gain. However, he did manage to expose the current travel review industry as mostly a sham. While a good number of reviews are real, an astounding number are not. In the world where we trust large information providers with our decisions, this is not acceptable.  Can Online Reviews Earn Our Trust Again?  They can, if we flip the system on its head. Right now, the Futourist team is working on a platform that will incentivize travel-related reviews, as well as people who vet those reviews.  It’s an ecosystem in which reviewers get paid not under the table, but in plain sight. The community then votes on the reviews of places they’ve visited, dined at, or shopped in, earning fractions of the FTR coin.  How is this better than the current system?  It’s not perfect and the Futourist system can still be gamed, but not as much as what we have now. Here’s why:  Futourists heavily weighs video reviews, which are difficult to fake. Everyone is incentivized for reviews, so the allure of getting paid by a business goes out of the window — review what you know and get paid anyway. The community votes on reviews — obvious fakes will have a hard time standing out.  To learn more about the Futourist check www.futourist.io",False

After some extensive consulting with our advisors and technical partners, we decided to follow the latest trends which are necessary for a successful token crowdsale. The pre-sale will take place in two stages: Limited pre-sale and Unlimited pre-sale.  Due to the changes which required a lot of legal, technical and other effort for adding the pre-sale phases into our crowdsale plan, we are postponing our crowdsale for 5 days. This means the first pre-sale phase begins February 20th.  Limited pre-sale It will last for 72 hours (3 days) or less if the hard cap is reached early. Everyone in this phase will get an 8% bonus, which will be distributed after the crowdsale (bonus only). During the Limited pre-sale, the maximum investment will be capped at 10 ETH per individual contribution. In association with Cofound.it, our closest partner, we made a special offer for Cofound.it Priority Pass members. They will be able to contribute 20 ETH per individual. Limited pre-sale means that a higher number of individual contributions will be possible in this phase. Small contributors will be able to participate before the ‘’whales’’ come in.

These same users worked really hard to build their profile to the point where they can monetise their service of fake reviews. For such users implementing some sort of ""proof of stake"" - staking part of earned tokens or part of earned level before posting can be real turn off to sell fake reviews.

One of business models we will offer is creating ""Discount offers"" where businesses who hold FTR tokens create time limited offers that users can buy. Imagine Happy Hour 50% discount on certain drink or food. Obviously all offers have limited target of users interested for that offer - numbers vary from town size, location, period etc. Once we establish and understand each offer audience is limited we know that spending more and more tokens wont increase that audience. So companies that acquire a lot of FTR tokens (in ICO phase or at any later time) are not limited by the platform but by simple supply/demand dynamic on the market. Other business models like creating competitions are again focused around specific location, audience or interest group which is limited by default. So in any scenario a business that acquires large quantities of FTR will have to spend them slowly and controlled and will NOT be able to manipulate platform.",False

For reward distribution we are using Pareto distribution. Each contest will have start and end period. On end date of the contest we create a pool of users who entered the contest + their reviews. Users are then ranked by their success and put on the Pareto distribution chart that looks like this:  https://subversion.american.edu/aisaac/notes/images/pareto-smallvals.png  If you look at the curve closely you can see the first few users reward is the highest BUT all users are part of the contest reward pool. Even the last user will receive a portion of tokens. This is called Long Tail rewarding and its intended to motivate and reward all users participating in contests.  Videos will still be handled with Pareto distribution but the time period will be different - most likely on 1 day (24h) period.,False

No one can really prevent such things from happening. On TripAdvisor, we reckon there is a whole lot of reviews being written by people with heavy conflict of interest. But the bare quantity of other reviews each business gets makes that one questionable review get lost in the crowd. We believe that if TripAdvisor can make it work, we can make it work at least as well.  The main feature of Futourist dealing with problems of trust is account Level. Users will gain trust by contributing (reviewing etc) to the platform and this will be reflected in the users account Level. Higher account levels should be trusted more and will have more voting power when calculating the reward for that review. In case of someone making an account to upvote their own business, is kind of similar to a newbie account on BitcoinTalk posting something big things about a very specific ICO - there has got to be something he's not saying out loud.  Another thing to keep in mind here, is that trust is connected to the type of content a reviewer is submitting. It's much easier to make a dishonest text review than it is to make a dishonest video review. And Futourist will prefer video reviews over text reviews.",False

In the case of 1000 fake upvotes, our AI mechanism will have an easy task of identifying this pattern. A simple way of the top of my head would be comparing view count and reactions to video. Also looking at the geolocation and timeframes of the upvotes etc. The point being here that fraudulent actions can not be prevented in advance, but they can be traced down. And rewarding users only after the community has their say about it gives us enough time to identify possible frauds.",False

Gamification pratices will be used across the app.  ACHIEVEMENTS AND BADGES Achievements are milestones a user can complete. They give the user a future goal within the app and therefore increases the user retention. Example achievements: “First to review a park in Berlin”, “Reviewed 20 places in 1 week”, “Curated 1000+ reviews”, “No. 1 reviewer in January”, etc. Users will collect digital badges for doing something special. Digital badges are going to be displayed publicly on user accounts. Achievements and badge collection are proven gamification mechanics. The point of them is to boost users engagement, give users a purpose and just make the app more fun to use. Apart from the achievements users may get additional badges like “Early supporter” for all of you reading our whitepaper and being amongst the first supporters-.  LEVELS Account level represents the state and trust of this account and is visible publicly. Users level up their accounts by contributing to the platform in various ways (posting reviews, curating, reporting, creating guides…). High level accounts get more respect from the community and getting to a high level unlocks additional features only available to the most trusted reviewers. Levels is another proven gamification technique that incentivizes the user to contribute more.  ONBOARDING Nobody likes learning, that’s why the onboarding phase (tutorial phase) is one of the key points in user experience where users must not be intimidated by the app. Game development industry has found various ways of implementing tutorials without players even feeling like they are in a tutorial, but rather that they’re just playing the game as it is. We’ll make the initial onboarding phase clear and easy, without much textual instructions.",False

Yes, besides the internal circular economy inside the platform, there is a loop where our token will go through the token exchanges as well. Eveyone will be able to spend FTR on the platform and get some benefits in return. But the loop I am talking about focuses on Businesses buying tokens on exchanges and spending it on the platform. Still, have in mind that every user (not just businesses) will be able to spend tokens on Futourist - buying offers the businesses are posting, subscribing to influencers, playing travel lotto and other features of the platform. So every user gets benefits by buying FTR on an exchange.  There is no allocation of tokens for this. The demand made by businesses will be satisfied by the supply offered on exchanges. If not, the token price will rise, which is good for all of you crowdsale investors.",False

Users on platform acting as curators will determine what type of review gets most of the reward. Reward for review within same context/type will be distributed by Pareto distribution.  Brief explanation of Pareto distribution (quoted from Wikipedia): Pareto originally used this distribution to describe the allocation of wealth among individuals since it seemed to show rather well the way that a larger portion of the wealth of any society is owned by a smaller percentage of the people in that society. He also used it to describe distribution of income.[8] This idea is sometimes expressed more simply as the Pareto principle or the ""80-20 rule"" which says that 20% of the population controls 80% of the wealth.[9]",False

On Futourist you will be able to claim the newly introduced Futourist Tokens (FTR) in return for your reviews of travel services and places, depending on the quality of that review (community upvotes).  ▄▄▄ VISION  Did you know that the online content marketing industry is expected to generate more than $300 billion (!) in revenue by the year 2019 (source)? But when it comes to sharing that revenue, content creators tend not the be a part of the story at all! Futourist's team is here to change that! Our vision is to bring fairness to online content creation by creating an economy where creators are financially rewarded for their content with Futourist Tokens (FTR).  Why travel reviews? Because they're one of the most trustworthy and helpful information on the internet. They shape how we see things on a daily basis and most importantly - they're directly related to business revenue. The number of written reviews has reached 500 million on TripAdvisor alone. According to recent statistics, 90% of consumers read online reviews, and 88% of them trust them (source). Furthermore, 89% of consumers say they read more than 2 reviews (source).  Travel review industry is big and hasn't been disturbed in a long time. Platforms are failing to embrace new technologies and the whole field is stagnating. On top of rewarding reviewers with tokens, we'll be focusing on video reviews and catering influencers - things no other review platform has successfully exploited.  ▄▄▄ HOW DOES IT WORK?  Futourist is a travel review platform, focusing on video reviews and catering the influencers. On Futourist, you will be able to review anything travel related, anywhere, at any time. From restaurants to accomodation, parks, things to do, transport etc.  Futourist for a consumer - Search, watch, visit  Participants in the ecosystem Reviewer - is a registered user that provides content (reviews) Curator - a registered user that reads the content and uses upvotes to reward his/her preferred reviews or other content (can be a Reviewer as well) Consumer - users who do not contribute to the platform but consume information from it Business - a company who uses Futourist in order to spread awareness / make direct sales / get other benefits like audience analytics etc.  Contests - core feature  The Futourist platform will reward reviewers for participation in time-limited reviewing contests. Having limited time period contests allows us to distribute tokens in a straight-forward way - after the end of the contest, to all content creators which participated, with a predefined token distribution curve. After the contest ends, all applicable reviews will be sorted by their upvotes and downvotes. Then we're going to use the Pareto principle on these reviews in order to distribute rewards as fairly as possible.",False

Go to Futourist KYC website https://kyc.futourist.io 2. Input the information and data requested, 3. Upload the necessary identification and verification documents, 4. Submit the application, 5. Wait for the confirmation email regarding your application  ▄▄▄ WHAT IS FUTOURIST?  Futourist is the first travel review platform that rewards you for your reviews with crypto tokens. On Futourist you will be able to claim the newly introduced Futourist Tokens (FTR) in return for your reviews of travel services and places, depending on the quality of that review (community upvotes).  ▄▄▄ VISION  Did you know that the online content marketing industry is expected to generate more than $300 billion (!) in revenue by the year 2019 (source)? But when it comes to sharing that revenue, content creators tend not the be a part of the story at all! Futourist's team is here to change that! Our vision is to bring fairness to online content creation by creating an economy where creators are financially rewarded for their content with Futourist Tokens (FTR).  Why travel reviews? Because they're one of the most trustworthy and helpful information on the internet. They shape how we see things on a daily basis and most importantly - they're directly related to business revenue. The number of written reviews has reached 500 million on TripAdvisor alone. According to recent statistics, 90% of consumers read online reviews, and 88% of them trust them (source). Furthermore, 89% of consumers say they read more than 2 reviews (source).  Travel review industry is big and hasn't been disturbed in a long time. Platforms are failing to embrace new technologies and the whole field is stagnating. On top of rewarding reviewers with tokens, we'll be focusing on video reviews and catering influencers - things no other review platform has successfully exploited.  ▄▄▄ HOW DOES IT WORK?  Futourist is a travel review platform, focusing on video reviews and catering the influencers. On Futourist, you will be able to review anything travel related, anywhere, at any time. From restaurants to accomodation, parks, things to do, transport etc. Futourist for a consumer - Search, watch, visit  Participants in the ecosystem Reviewer - is a registered user that provides content (reviews) Curator - a registered user that reads the content and uses upvotes to reward his/her preferred reviews or other content (can be a Reviewer as well) Consumer - users who do not contribute to the platform but consume information from it Business - a company who uses Futourist in order to spread awareness / make direct sales / get other benefits like audience analytics etc.  Contests - core feature  The Futourist platform will reward reviewers for participation in time-limited reviewing contests. Having limited time period contests allows us to distribute tokens in a straight-forward way - after the end of the contest, to all content creators which participated, with a predefined token distribution curve. After the contest ends, all applicable reviews will be sorted by their upvotes and downvotes. Then we're going to use the Pareto principle on these reviews in order to distribute rewards as fairly as possible. Futourist for a reviewer - shoot, review, get rewarded  Futourist will include many other features and token utilities which are described in our whitepaper.  Token utilities and circulation            For the explanation of the above token utilities please refer to our whitepaper.  ▄▄▄ AN EXISTING PRODUCT Futourist has partnered up with a popular service list site called OpenHours. OpenHours is a platform with over 1 million monthly active users and is present in 21 western countries. It has a huge database of services available in those countries. It has all - service database including existing reviews, established technology infrastructure (several localized web and mobile apps) and the users we can convert. We will use OpenHours for the foundation on top of which we'll build Futourist.  OpenHours mobile application (available on your app store)  ▄▄▄ MARKET  Revenue of content marketing services was worth more than $190 billion in the year 2016 and is expected to be worth more than $313 billion by the year 2019 (source). From early researches it is estimated that almost $31 billion a year of UK consumer spending is potentially influenced by online reviews (source). The market size of online review industry was in the range of $3-7 billion in 2015 in North America alone (source).  The number of written reviews has reached 500 million on TripAdvisor alone. According to recent statistics, 90% of consumers read online reviews and 88% of them trust them (source). Furthermore, 89% of consumers say they read more than 2 reviews before making a decision (source).  Competition At this moment, we do not have a direct competitor that would reward the contributors using blockchain. Our real competition exists in the old economy, with companies like TripAdvisor, Foursquare and Yelp. But these and other platforms do not incentivize their users with meaningful rewards, they did not embrace video content and they do not offer any space to travel influencers.  Main differences between us and the competition: Quality content creation incentive through token rewards Focusing on video reviews Catering the influencers (long-tail included)  ▄▄▄ ROADMAP      ▄▄▄ TEAM  The team behind Futourist is an experienced entrepreneurial team, coming from various industries - from web and app development to tourism, games and marketing.
