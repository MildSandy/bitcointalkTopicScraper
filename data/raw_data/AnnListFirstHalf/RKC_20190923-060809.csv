Quote from: Nalien Alright, so you're holding on to 82% of the total supply? 82% is the team + pre-sale to our early investors on the pre-sale stage.  As we say on our ICO page, under ICO Structure:  Quote We dedicated a pool of 20% to the public offering of currencies, 2% of this quota being sold in the pre-sale period, so in the ICO it will be possible to acquire 18% of the tokens issued (2,700,000 RKCs) and these will be frozen in the wallets of the purchasers until the end of the initial offer.  The remaining 80% are owned by the organization’s shareholders. Due to the 82% (shareholders + pre-sale) context being a significant amount, we make sure to add in the smart contract rules that make it difficult to quickly sell or transfer a significant amount of tokens.  This is because we weren't asking for crowd funding. We already have a company, team, products, sales, from which we pay salaries; and the team and the early investors have invested their money and effort into bringing us to this stage.  Also, whatever amount of RKC all of you have acquired at this point (and whatever percentage of the total supply you're holding), it will be increased at the end of the ICO automatically if the 18% will not get bought. The smart contract is designed to drive the price until it's ridiculously high, so that the users stop buying RKC. This way the contract will discover the market valuation of the token automatically at the end of the ICO. And after it, the token will spread proportionally the rest of the unbought coins to everybody who participated.  Hope it clarifies some things.",False

Using smart contracts to delay your potential exit isn't reassuring in any way either.

We have decided to use the smart contract and ICO simply to stay transparent to our early investors and the team when we would send premiums monthly to all the token holders. We didn't want to do it in the traditional IPO sense, but rather using the innovative blockchain tech. We're really glad that others joined too though.  Quote As far as I'm aware there is no limit on the maximum possible amount to be raised either and you provide no guidelines as to how much money you need for what kind of expenses, which as an established company you should at least be able to do. Many of the people that have acquired tokens initially knew us personally and what our company does. Some just read the website, because everything is explained there. But I will reiterate some key points here.  Quote What is your company? It's a company. IT company. Registered in Dubai, with the decentralized team in several countries spanned over multiple time zones.  Quote What do you do? We are selling B2B technology solutions that have to do with the blockchain to the businesses. It currently includes, but not limited to: payment gateways in Bitcoin/Ethereum/other cryptos, Bitcoin cards, cryptographic notary, fiat- and cryptocurrency exchanges, custom applications that have to do with blockchains. We provide separate solutions as well as white label mode when we host the platform for the client, adapting it to their needs and style guides.  Quote How much is it worth? We didn't do the IPO, so this information is, naturally, non-existant. At the end of the ICO it should be clear how much exactly it is worth just by multiplying the numbers.  You know the best thing about our smart contract that we're really excited about? It doesn't sell the tokens at the fixed price. It's increasing the price automatically when the market demand increases. This means that the algorithm is basically doing the market evaluation discovery for the token, and thus for the company itself. People will stop buying RKC at some point because the price has gone to the point where they think it's more than what we're worth, and we will know the exact amount by then. Not what we think how much it's worth, but what the market thinks. Nice, isn't it?  Quote What do you need extra funds for? How will you use them? We are tired of just doing what other companies are doing: providing the payment gateways and exchanges and such. It's all old stuff by now. We believe that despite the Bitcoin having been invented in 2008, the cryptocurrency and blockchain tech is still a child (we especially learned it while working with Ethereum contracts and its Solidity language), and we have so much room to innovate and come up with new products and solutions. That's our goal.  Right now we're working on a beta prototype for Tomorrow Exchange, which would be the distributed cryptocurrency exchange, a real one and a working one, unlike the rest.  Quote So far this is just another scamcoin. I'll be happy to be convinced otherwise though. The usual investment advice, as you might know, is as follows: invest in what you know enough about, and don't invest more than you're willing to lose, if something will turn out just another scamcoin. I think this is somewhat applicable here to a degree. We're not aggressively searching for the funding, and we wouldn't die without it. But at the same time, we're really excited and very honored to see the market trust in us, expressed in the investment amount. We will do our best to adhere to this trust. Since all our team has shares in RKC and we will spend 50% of our profit to buy and redistribute RKC + 50% to reinvest back to the company, by making our investors and token holders profitable we make ourselves profitable as well, and it's all transparent on the blockchain, so it's our shared goal to make this all happen and make an ROI for us all.",False

We can't get more than this amount. This is by intention, we hard-coded this limit into the formula. We can get less though if the market will stop buying until the ICO ends. Then we will divide this amount by the total amount of coins bought, multiply by 100, and we get the full market valuation of the token that the smart contract has thus discovered. And the rest of the unbought tokens gets proportionally distributed among all token holders to make everyone happy.  Quote from: Laythian Quote from: jukKas Project looks promising, but why accept only ETH in ICO? I think because it's built on the ethereum platform? You're absolutely right. We based our ICO on the rules of the open source smart contract to provide the full transparency of operations to the public. The smart contract runs on the Ethereum blockchain network, and it's not possible to send Bitcoin to the Ethereum address, as you know. We were trying to provide this service and convert BTC to ETH for people at the start of the ICO, but couldn't keep up with the unexpectedly high demand. So now only ETH is available.",False

Of course, it's impossible to buy Ethereum tokens by Bitcoin as is. In Ethereum, the native currency is ether. But we have decided to do a crazy thing: exchange bitcoin to ether for you and provide a transparent experience, as if it were possible to invest in an ERC20 token with Bitcoin and later, other cryptocurrencies. That was the plan. Well, it didn't go as planned. We couldn't even switch into a manual mode, we haven't expected so much attention frankly. As we have written in the initial message, it was more of a private thing, but it quickly exploded (no pun intended). Now the contract holds 432 ETH ($80k) and we didn't even try hard to market ourselves!  But anyway, some of you were disappointed that you couldn't buy RKC when it was still available for the better price. Well, we have logged every operation, so it was pretty easy to find all BTC attempts to buy RKC. Then we tracked all the ""PriceChanged"" events from the contract to establish the price timeline. Then we put one on top of the other and determine how much RKC would you have acquired if the transaction didn't fail. This is the results: https://app.venturekingdom.com/rkc_episode/result.  We have created a special transaction for each one called ""RKC acquired by historical price NNN"" to everybody who was trying to buy RKC with Bitcoin. Now everybody has received their fair share.  Can we create RKC tokens out of the thin air? No, of course not. We have bought some with ETH after this episode by converting your Bitcoin into Ether, but of course, the price went higher and it wasn't enough. So we will calculate the difference and send it to you from our own RKC wallets, from our shares.  The only problem is, we can't use Transfer method on a smart contract to send RKC to you before the ICO ends (smart contract blocks the transfers in ICO time). So, we have added it to the platform manually. But you may ask, how can we guarantee that we will not change it back? It's not very decentralized, is it?  Well, for that reason we have decided to create a page with all RKC accounts to date: https://app.venturekingdom.com/rkc_episode/balances_RKC (including the ones acquired with Ether!). It has your bitcoin address, and, more important, signed message about your current balance. You can download this page or copy paste your part and save it so that when the ICO ends and the Transfer() function is unlocked, you can hold us to it if we end up not depositing the difference to your account (but we will, don't worry). Our public key is located here. It's a frozen timeframe, but we will be updating this page periodically.  With that, we wish you a pleasant night, and tomorrow we will continue all operations. We are a small team, and we are choking and drowning in all the support tickets that have been created, so please forgive us for not answering quickly. We do our best right now, and we hope that with the funding we have and will receive, we will be able to bring our processes to perfection. Thank you for trusting in us.

We're glad to announce that Royal Kingdom Coin (ticker: RKC) is going to be available for purchase in roughly 8 hours.  You can follow the official website here: https://royalkingdomcoin.com, as well as see the countdown to the event.  ICO Structure  The rules (governed by the smart contract) are:  ICO starts on July 10, 2017 @ 23:00 GMT (+00) and continues for 30 days (24h periods); RKC is governed by the ERC20-compatible smart contract on Ethereum blockchain, we will publish the link for direct acquisition soon; RKC tokens can be acquired directly by sending ether to the smart contract, or using our VentureKingdom platform as a proxy; There are 15 000 000 tokens in existence; The available ICO pool is 18%; The price is being determined dynamically by the smart contract algorithm and the activity on the contract. The more/quicker someone buys, the higher the price becomes. The contract is aiming high to make the end goal impossible so that people stop buying at some point, that's the intended outcome. When this happens, we will know the exact market valuation of the token, which is going to be discovered automatically by the algorithm and the market. And when the ICO closes, the rest (unbought tokens) is going to be distributed to all the token holders proportionally; (Does not affect token holders with less than 1%) The major token holders' balances are locked to prevent quick dumping for any reason, if someone has more than 1%, this rule will be applied: from the date of the ICO, 5% of the total supply will be unlocked monthly; (Only for big players) It's not possible to buy more than 1% of the supply in one transaction, your ether will automatically be returned to you, but the gas of the transaction will be swallowed by the miners, please be careful; When the ICO ends, the transfers (and, naturally, the sale and the exchange) are unlocked; On February the 1st, we pay the first premiums to the token holders and continue monthly. The premiums are going to be 50% of profit (revenue minus costs), and 50% will be reinvested back in the company. We will use the 50% of profit to buy more RKC off of the open market and then spread them proportionally as premiums.  Resources  ICO website VentureKingdom Platform Project White Paper Slack group  How to buy directly from the smart contract:  If you are unfamiliar with this, you can buy RKC on our platform: VentureKingdom. But if you know how to do it, you can buy directly from the smart contract.  Official address of RKCToken contract is 0x6ccb56947ea1d6efdc81acfbacd8263ddfa9b202  Send the transaction directly to the contract or to the buy() method. You need to increase gas limit: recommended is 70000. You can see the price by querying ""current_price_atto_tokens_per_wei"" variable of the contract - it’s how many tokens you will receive per 1 ether. Do not send before the ICO is started (you can check the variable isICOStarted of the contract). Do not try to acquire more than 1% per 1 transaction.  Marketing  Bounty Campaign BitcoinTalk Signature Campaign    We were going to have this ICO as more of a private thing between people who already know us and want to fund our projects, so we're having an announcement a small time before the ICO opens. Anybody is welcome to participate though. Except for US citizens, sorry, you know the drill.  Please post here if you have any questions, or to ico@royalkingdomenterprise.com if your question is of a private nature.  Thanks.  Best, Royal Kingdom Enterprise team.",False
