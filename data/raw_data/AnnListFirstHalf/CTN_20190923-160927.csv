We firstly wanted to thank everyone who supported us by contributing to the token sale, helping sharing our dream or taking part with in bounty program.  Despite our efforts, our CTN Token Sale was unsuccessful. The sale has been a long and tough process for us — with our company pouring time, money and resources into every aspect of the project including concept, resources, marketing, development and more.  We have learnt a lot over our journey and have identified areas we were lacking — some key factors which we feel contributed to our unsuccessful token sale:  Lack of community ‘buzz’ Competing with other larger projects with advertising budgets Perceived ROI with a project containing ‘industry good’ Lack of private equity Despite the above our company and team have committed to carrying on Crypto Trust Network. The past few months has seen us inundated with stories from the community of people being scammed, phishing attempts (which we, ourselves experienced the first night of our sale) and more. This has only fueled the fire of CTN and motivated us even more to get our platform off the ground.  As such, CTN will be making a return within the next few months — we are restructuring our business model and will be offering a private equity sale before the public token sale to kick-start the platform.  Refunds Of course as we didn’t hit the softcap all CTN token holders will be eligible for a refund of their ETH. We are using an industry standard painless ERC20 refund mechanism which will allow you to retrieve the ETH you contributed to the CTN token sale. We will be doing a full blog post around this process and have support staff on hand to help with the process if required.  Bounty As our token sale was unsuccessful we will be re-launching the CTN token in the proceeding months; as such we will honor all bounty program contributors under our new structure. We will be sending our an email specifically to all our bounty hunters with more detail around this.  We are deeply appreciative for all the support from all contributors and on behalf of myself and all the team I want to apologize for failing to meet our targets; however after some re-development and private equity deals are finalized we will be back and better than ever.  Please feel free to reach our directly to me with any questions.  Jim Dowling CEO Crypto Trust Network",False

The telegram is an announcement channel - one of the primary driving factors for this was to help combat potential ICO phishing attempts as we didn't have 24/7 moderation resources. 2. The CTN tokens are minted in real-time by our smart contract; as such they don't appear as a conventional transfer on etherscan - this allows us to only create the amount of tokens sold, and not be generating a large amount initially. Alongside this it has TX GAS advantages. You can confirm transaction information by querying the ""balanceOf"" function on our contract found here: https://etherscan.io/address/0xc77add231ef94ca78968aa6ce7e4f4474362c544#readContract and entering any of the wallet addresses that have contributed so far 3. Correct - we delayed our launch by a month due to bad timing with end of the year and unfortunately a few sites which we contacted did not update this. You can find our blog posta bout this here: https://medium.com/@cryptotrustnet/token-sale-delayed-start-22nd-january-518d102d183d 4. Correct - we had a pre-sale available which was promoted to subscribers only giving a small additional incentive bonus of tokens, this can be inspected via our token sale contract  We appreciate you following up and we're more than happy to answer any more questions. Our goal really is to be transparent here - also don't hesitate to contact us via email if you want: contact@cryptotrust.network",False

I'm curious how you will get your dataset to train your neural network.  The architecture of the distributed processing is still to be defined as such we will have a specialist write a dedicated blog post around this.  However, the preliminary plan is CTN nodes taking instruction from a master-node; the master node creates 'todo lists' of blockchain data with verified, expected results to be trained on (and to ensure we're not wasting resources by doing re-work.)  The CTN node will then process the allocated work, training on it's slice of the model in order to find relationships within the data.  The output relationships from training data will be merged across nodes on the network, from here their results are verified before being consumed by the CTN Risk Rating.",False
