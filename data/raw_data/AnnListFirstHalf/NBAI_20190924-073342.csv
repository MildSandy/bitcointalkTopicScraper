Finance and that our price is very stable considering the volatility of the general market. I am responsible for global marketing at Nebula AI and here is some information ( that I can disclose ) about my strategy for the next two months pre Helix Mainnet.  This week:  Polish the new nbai.io website and bring it to a standard of the large blockchain & AI entreprise solution providers (IBM, HP, SAP, Oracle, Microsoft, Amazon etc).  Next month: establish a solid inbound marketing base by  publishing high quality written content and short-form technical papers as well as video for our new blog ( blog.nbai.io ), Medium, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and our other platforms and use social media to distribute this content and reach out to:  1-on one side to entreprise clients/users of our services/technology/expertise.  2-on the other to the crypto community.  Parallely we are also starting a business development program in person or via phone/email to businesses in need of AI/blockchain solutions.  Results will be obvious by late August or 1month prior to our 1st mainnet.  In September we are organizing a large event in downtown Montreal where we will present our technology to the North American business community.  And in October we are in talks with a giant blockchain event for presenting NBAI to large investors/technology users.  I'd like to remind you that we also have a 2nd blockchain (Orion based on Proof of Group consensus) coming up in 2019.  I hope this somewhat provides a general overview of our go to market plan for the next 3 months.

I think right now if you still have a few NBAI left it's best to just hold it and wait for the team to step up their marketing game. I've read on twitter that they have a new partnership and I think this is a good move to spread the word about NBAI and also a good move for NBAI to attract more investors. I hope the team will accumulate more partnerships in the months to come so that the price can finally move.

Nebula AI is committed to building a decentralized artificial intelligence computing blockchain, that reduces the energy costs of traditional Proof of Work (PoW) consensus. Integrated with artificial intelligence and sharing economics, developers can deploy their AI applications (such as price prediction modeling or genomic research computations) with ease. Additionally, developers are able to monetize their apps and earn revenue based on the AI smart contract. This is all made possible with the integration of Nebula‚Äôs payment services and API/SDK. However, the most interesting aspect of Nebula AI‚Äôs blockchain is its dedication to solving the computing power needs of humans, by converting GPU mining machines into AI computing services. This feature allows Nebula AI to easily compete with the pricing of cloud computing services from companies such as Amazon and Google. Nebula AI sets out to combine blockchain micropayments, hyper ledger, decentralized features, and AI applications to achieve the transformation of ‚ÄúDApps + AI‚Äù to ‚ÄúDAI Apps.‚Äù Additionally, Nebula AI has established an AI training center in Canada, to increase the speed of artificial intelligence and the corresponding development of the blockchain.  What is the Token Use Case? Developers will be paid in NBAI tokens from the revenue that their AI apps generate. They will also consume tokens for model training. Additionally, developers will pay using NBAI for finer models when they utilize the Nebula AI training services.  Golem is focused on building a general computing network and it is an IAAS system. NBAI is a PAAS system focus on AI. Is the private sale still available?  Early private sale for individuals has ended. The private sale for institutional investors is currently underway.  What will the KYC process be like? 1. Whitelist begins  2. KYC link will be sent to allow everyone to log in and update their KYC information, which will be reviewed 3. Send ETH to the smart contract address provided and receive corresponding NBAI 4. Anyone who did not qualify but contributed will get refunded and this will be after the token distribution.  Will the tokens get replaced with native tokens? Yes, when the mainnet is released, the tokens will be swapped off of the ERC-20 network. The release date of the mainnet will be in early September.  When will the mainnet be released? The mainnet will be released by September. Testnet is already live. What kind of partners do you have? We are working together with McGill University on research projects, focusing on bioinformatics regarding a surgery innovation program which is highly beneficial for the biomedical industry. Concordia professors Yan liu is working with us on the encryption. Multi-machine Parallelism is one of the topics we are working with Concordia now. SRED is well known in Canada for technology innovations.  How many transactions per second does Nebula AI support? Currently the same tips as Ethereum. In our Orion launch, we aim to scale our platform significantly with the research and cooperation of our strategic partners.  I've read the whitelist on this subject but just wondering if you have other resources further explaining this method? We're working with Dr.Yan Liu in Concordia about PoG. More detailed technical implementations will be posted after or during the Orion launch.  What is the vesting for the team? The tokens held by the foundation will be frozen after crowdfunding ends and are thawed in 18 stages (about 3 years).   What makes Nebula AI special compared to companies such as Singularitynet.io and Golem?  SigularityNET is proficient in building AI Agents, providing a platform for AI Agents to share services. Nebula AI is proficient in providing AI computing power, hosting DAI Applications, and solving data and algorithm processing centralization issues.",False

It can significantly reduce the traditional electricity usage on mining, by converting GPU mining machines into AI computing units. It allows anyone access AI computing resources from anywhere to anyplace in the world.  On the Nebula AI blockchain, developers can design and implement their own AI applications by communicating with Nebula AI API. Developers can get NBAI tokens by posting free or paid apps. Application usages will also generate profits for developers in the form of NBAI tokens.The remaining cost will be paid for using the Nebula AI blockchain while running AI apps. Artificial intelligence transactions recorded on the NBAI will be irreversible. Distributed computing networks also ensure adequate computing power. The AI blockchain makes the easy and cost efficiency access to AI resource possible.  Nebula AI has set up an artificial intelligence training center in Canada to increase the speed of artificial intelligence and the corresponding development of the blockchain.  Nebula AI based quantitative finance, graphics and other chain related applications are also in development.
