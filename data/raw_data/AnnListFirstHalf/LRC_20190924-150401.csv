We are scrapping the prior binding process for the airdrop, and creating a new smart contract to facilitate address binding in the coming weeks. Read more to get all the details.  Loopring is a blockchain agnostic protocol that enables people to trade tokens in a secure, anonymous, and trustless manner by using users’ private-keys in order to authorize orders directly from their own wallets. Loopring’s robust and progressive design aims to solve more than just the inherent problems that centralized exchanges experience. It is designed for the future “cyber-economy” where economic activities and value transfers and exchanges not only happen between humans, but also between smart agents (robots) powered by artificial intelligence. These smart agents think, own, and trade, powering a new, AI economy. This type of value transfer will be instrumental in supporting innovations such as drone deliveries and self driving taxis.  The Loopring Protocol avoids the performance issues plaguing public blockchains. Loopring accomplishes this by managing, sharing, and ring-matching cryptographically signed orders, all within a consortium blockchain network. Loopring thus bypasses the scaling issues by only posting actual trades as transactions on public blockchains.  Version 1.0 of the Protocol has been deployed on top of Ethereum and Qtum; currently, we are implementing the protocol on the NEO blockchain. In addition, Protocol version 1.1 will introduce a better incentive model.",False

Background & Objectives We recently released a new Loopring whitepaper in English. This whitepaper is much easier to read than the origin one but still very technical, as it is supposed to be.  We want to incentivize open-source community to translate it into the following language: Mandarin, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, German, Vietnamese, French, Korean, and Italian.  100,000 LRN and 100,000 LRQ are prepared to incentivize volunteers. As of the last round of private token sale, the price of LRN and LRQ are1.0 USD and 0.45USD respectively.  The Deliverables The whitepaper has been maintained in this github repository. The whitepaper PDF file was compiled from two source files: 1) en_whitepaper.tex and 2) whitepaper.bib, where en_whitepaper.tex is the main LaTex file and the only one you need to translate, while whitepaper.bib is the bibliography file that contains all publications we cited.  If you don’t know LaTex, here is a Word document for the whitepaper. Feel free to work with your favorite editor, when it’s ready , copy and paste your work into a Google doc — name it as “xx_whitepaper_your_name” — make sure anyone who have its URL has access for comment. Please put your team’s contact information in the doc so other contributors can reach you. When your Google doc is ready, share it with Daniel Wang for review. In case you are the sole contributor, Daniel will tweet your translation for community review. If you don’t work with LaTex, no need to translate the diagrams.  If you do know how to use LaTex we assume you know git too. Please feel free to clone the repository and make a copy of en_whitepaper.tex and rename it to xx_whitepaper.tex where xx represents the language, then you can edit the file directly and track changes with git. When your pull request is ready, Daniel will also tweet it if you are the sole contributor so people can review the generated PDF file — please make sure your source files compile.  Before starting the translation, email Daniel Wang and cc all your team members, we can use that same email thread for communication.  Rewards For each language, we have prepared 100,000 LRN and 100,000 LRQ for all contributors. We strongly encourage you to join a team to collaborate. Eventually we will only select and reward the single best work. We will send tokens to the team lead, and he/she will be responsible for distribute tokens among team members. If the final deliverable are github pull requests with translated diagrams, and the final PDF can be generated correctly, we will reward 100,000 LRN and 100,000 LRQ to the team; if the final deliverable are github pull requests without translated diagrams, we will reward 90% of the bounty reward; if the final deliverable is a Google doc, we will reward 75% of the bounty reward. Depending on the quality of the translation, additional discount may also apply. Deadline These bounties are valid until May 15th 2018. Please make sure you submit your work before the deadline.  Got Questions? Please join us in our Telegram channel (Loopring_whitepaper) for questions and collaborations on these bounties. Make sure 1) you fully understand what the Loopring Protocol is and how it works, and 2) you and your team has a way to communicate with each other — we probably won’t have time to answer fundamental questions.  https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/leaf-bounties-for-whitepaper-translation-99d593198c58",False

We are scrapping the prior binding process for the airdrop, and creating a new smart contract to facilitate address binding in the coming weeks. Read more to get all the details.  About Loopring Loopring is a blockchain agnostic protocol that enables people to trade tokens in a secure, anonymous, and trustless manner by using users’ private-keys in order to authorize orders directly from their own wallets. Loopring’s robust and progressive design aims to solve more than just the inherent problems that centralized exchanges experience. It is designed for the future “cyber-economy” where economic activities and value transfers and exchanges not only happen between humans, but also between smart agents (robots) powered by artificial intelligence. These smart agents think, own, and trade, powering a new, AI economy. This type of value transfer will be instrumental in supporting innovations such as drone deliveries and self driving taxis.  The Loopring Protocol avoids the performance issues plaguing public blockchains. Loopring accomplishes this by managing, sharing, and ring-matching cryptographically signed orders, all within a consortium blockchain network. Loopring thus bypasses the scaling issues by only posting actual trades as transactions on public blockchains.  Version 1.0 of the Protocol has been deployed on top of Ethereum and Qtum; currently, we are implementing the protocol on the NEO blockchain. In addition, Protocol version 1.1 will introduce a better incentive model.  Terminology We are going to use the following terms in this post:  -Target blockchain: A public blockchain where the Loopring Protocol has been or will be deployed. -LRx: One of the Loopring tokens. LRC stands for the Loopring token on Ethereum, LRN stands for the Loopring token  on NEO, LRQ stands for the Loopring token on Qtum. -Fund: The fiat money and/or cryptocurrencies we have raised or will raise e.g. via a token sale.  Reference Target Blockchain: The target blockchain whose Loopring token’s total cap (not the market cap on  coinmarketcap) calculated as tokenPrice(in USD) x tokenTotalSupply has become the largest among all LRx tokens for a  considerable amount of time. Ethereum is the current reference target blockchain.  Loopring’s Reference Token (Reference Token): The Loopring token on the reference target blockchain. LRC is the  current reference token. -Initial Token Distribution Date (ITDD): The date when we start to distribute LRx to token sale participants. -LEAF: Loopring Ecosystem Advancement Fund, see our 2018 R&D roadmap for more information. -Airdrop Block Height (ABH): The block height at which a snapshot of the reference blockchain’s account balances will  be taken for calculating the amount of LRx to be airdropped to each target account. There can be multiple ABHs for  each new Loopring token. Each airdrop has a corresponding ABH.  https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-token-on-neo-qtum-token-sale-and-airdrop-97fa5350457c",False

A week ago we rolled out our 2018 R&D roadmap. Based on the roadmap, we also had an engineering and a marketing kickoff meeting to bring everyone on the same page. We have strong confidence that Loopring’s core technologies will be ready for adoption during the year of 2018.  We have confirmed that three engineers are coming onboard full-time. One of them is a senior engineer working on Alipay’s core database systems. He is now working on the protocol development and deployment on NEO. Another engineer is a backend architect from meituan.com, he is very solid in high performance system and experienced in developing exchange and match-engine. Last but not least, Chen Wong will join us as a mobile app developer to work on Loopr’s mobile version.  Wallet We’ll only fix bugs and add small extra features to Loopr beta1 (available at https://loopring.io). This is because we will soon start developing beta2 from scratch, which is actively being designed.  Relay The biggest change in design is to apply consortium blockchain technology to current relay infrastructure. We need to make sure future miners can have access to as many orders as possible. Onchain and Hyperledger’s consortium blockchain technologies will be evaluated and explored in the coming months.  Looping.js This library is in a major refactoring. The goal is to make the integration with Loopring really easy for wallet developers without writing a lot of boilerplate code. The current plan is to extract 1) a core library to provide fundamental functionalities, and 2) a more advanced library to encapsulate business logics common to most wallets. In Loopr beta1, the sell and buy actions both have over 500 lines of JavaScript code and many of them are very similar; this is true for other operations including Transfer, Approve, Convert，and Cancel operation. This will not be the case in beta2 if we can use the new loopring.js library.  https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-bi-weekly-update-01-06-2018-20341d4ee948",False

From this data, researchers at Berkeley will analyze the tradeoff between trust and efficiency and determine the best approach to be taken. There are several other factors that will be analyzed and two other projects are being defined for our team to complete.  Progress and findings from these initiatives will be covered in additional blog posts from B@B and Loopring Foundation.  “Loopring is building a powerful yet elegant value exchange protocol for blockchain powered cyber-economy of the future, and we envisioned two to five years from now more token trading activities will happen in a decentralized and trustless fashion, using loopring or the like.

I love your enthusiasm but for LRC to be even 20$ it would have to be over a 5 trillion dollar market cap which is in the top 10 list. All coins in the top 10 list are running on their own blockchain and aren't ERC 20 tokens. The only ERC 20 token near top 10 is EOS at the moment and they are holding at 1 trillion. So 20$ a coin next year??? I don't know, I don't think so. I'm not fudding - I love the project but I think realistically it would cap around 5-10$ if anything , I may be wrong though - and if I am I commend you, I'm just cynical.

If I thought Loopring was going to be just another DEX it wouldn't be worth my time. It is not a decentralized exchange. It is an exchange PROTOCOL. I believe the Loopring protocol presents a big step forward in furthering the efficiency of crypto trading (especially decentralized crypto trading). Here are some 4 key quotes from their website/whitepaper/documents section that describes what Loopring does: 1 ""The Loopring mechanism allows orders to be broken into small pieces, identifies the best exchanges and times to trade those pieces on, and applies game theory logic to optimize trading results."" 2 ""Loopring is a decentralized, automated trading intelligence interface between crypto exchanges and blockchains, using our balance sheet to enable users to realize liquidity many times greater than available directly in the market, by both generating liquidity within the platform and breaking orders into small pieces that are placed across all market venues simultaneously."" 3 ""Loopring allows multi-token transaction exchange, as well as acceptance of exchange of liquidation on the blockchain under different circumstances. Loopring offers benefit to both users and exchanges by deferring risk from both parties in decentralized smart contracts, minimising fees and cost to create more profitable orders through ring-matching and order-sharing, and as a cross-platform protocol."" 4 ""Loopring is not only a protocol but also a decentralized automated execution system that trades across the crypto-token exchanges, shielding users from counterparty risk and reduce the cost of trading. By essentially rising the liquidity of cryptocurrencies, we are building the financial system of the future.""",False

Do NOT withdraw Ether from any exchange directly to our token sale address, you will lose your LRC. There is nothing we can do for you; 3. Please set gas value to at least 90000; 4. Our smart-contract only accepts transactions with a minimum value of 0.01ETH; 5. LRC will be issued and transfered to the source address immediately, there is no lockdown period; 6.

The smart contract will issue LRC immediately after receiving ETH payment to the sourcing address. DO NOT withdraw ETH from exhanges directly to the smart contract. You may lose part of all your LRC, for which we shall not be held responsible nor provide any technical support. LRC has no vesting period.  The remaining unsold token allocation will be issued within one week after token sale using the same smart contract. A detailed layout based on different fundraising scenarios can be found in below. Loopring development team believes that a capped fundraiser will promote a widespread distribution of the tokens, a necessary prerequisite to launching a robust network. Token Sale Distribution Ends in 30 days, Hardcap is 120,000 ETH, Softcap is 50,000ETH; All the tokens will be refunded within one week (minus some gas cost) if the project fail, the last transaction may cause the final sale slightly over 120,000 ETH.  The fundraiser will last for a period of 152500 blocks (about 30 days). Throughout this period, a contribution of one ether will lead to an allocation of five-thousand LRC plus a time dependent bonus. This bonus is meant to incentivize contributors not ot delay their participation. The bonus starts at 20%, meaning that a contribution of 1 LRC yield an allocation of 5000*(1+20%)=6000 LRC and decrease progressively to 0% over 10 periods(20%, 16%, 14%, 12%, 10%, 8%, 6%, 4%, 2%, 0%).  50000~60000 ETH(inc.) 32.5% LRC will be sold through Token Sale 60000~70000 ETH (inc.) 35% LRC will be sold through Token Sale 70000~80000 ETH (inc.) 37.5% LRC will be sold through Token Sale 80000~90000 ETH(inc.) 40% LRC will be sold through Token Sale 90000~100000 ETH(inc.) 42.5% LRC will be sold through Token Sale 100000~110000 ETH(inc.) 45% LRC will be sold through Token Sale 110000~120000 ETH(inc.) 47.5% LRC will be sold through Token Sale 12000 to above 50% LRC will be sold through Token Sale  The Loopring Foundation will manage the contributions according to its purpose.
