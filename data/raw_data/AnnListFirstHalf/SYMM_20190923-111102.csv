As I wrote in my initial post ( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2480514.msg28957307#msg28957307 ):  I emailed Polaris Investors AG, the company of the advisor ""Mike Henkel"". Their quick reply was ""We were not aware of the fact that apparently people are using our name on Linkedin. This guy seems to be a fake and does not work with us. Honestly, I would not touch an ICO where a guy claims to be an advisor if he uses firm names randomly"". And I got a kind remark that they would short SYMM  . I can add to that: Tom Capital also mailed back to me that they don't know any Oliver Purr, so please don't call them . Directly after I made my post I reached out to all the ICO review sites that had them on their site and luckily some of those sites responded quickly by at least adding a remark with their article. In LinkedIn, I marked all team & advisor profiles as fake. Please do so too. I sent a note to the moderator of this thread to change the title to ""SCAM..."", but unfortunately that's not allowed by the forum rules: From https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=703657.0:    I do like the idea of finding these scammers, but they covered their asses pretty well.

By extrapolation, there could be HUNDREDS of fake accounts exploiting bitcointalk.org! This is huge. I've messaged the admin and I'm waiting for a response. The usernames in question are: Captain_Jack_Sparrow, recnapon, Mutanca, FranzyFox, macolde, Chermander, Captain_Killer, gastlator,  Varsity_Blues, Beahelm, Moto_angel, Anayajurus, Grinin, Ttexav, Glen Thompson, BearuBear, Tator, Monkey_Thinker... I encourage you to check their post histories yourselves if you don't believe me.  Also, a further update and another smoking gun! I was approached via Telegram by someone who wishes to remain anonymous. I will post sections of the transcript here:  Quote I read your post on bitcointalk.org about symmetry fund (that it is a scam). I'm not registered on bitcointalk so I decided to write you here.  I checked people that you noted in your post here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2480514.msg29199461#msg29199461 . I could read Russian so I can tell you that post in Russian were made in ""life talks"" (topics with subject like ""What is your favorite sport"", ""Do you like soccer"", ""How to quit smoking"" and etc). All these people have posts in the same topics. So in my opinion they were created by one person and post in Russian are needed only to create a more real look of these accounts.  I also wanted to say that symmetry github code is quite poor. Their dividends controller had newbie mistakes (and I suppose still have) and what is more interesting it just cant check if you bought tokens on round one or round two (it is important because these rounds was supposed to have different service fee).  I asked them to elaborate on the code issues: Quote The code I was talking about could be found here https://github.com/symmetryfund/symmetry/blob/master/DividendManager.sol  It is official symm github repository and Andrew gave link to it in a Telegram common chat. DividendManager.sol was supposed to handle dividends distribution. I'm a programmer so I could read programs code. And I was interested how they solve problem of determining token round (they have to check some how in witch round token was created and devide holder tokens into two groups with different service fee). So I opened DividendManager.sol and found nothing about it. The only thing that is checked by thier code (lines 37-61) is the amount of SYMM tokens. If it is less than 1000 then service fee is 15% if it is more than 1000 then service fee is 7.5% (lines 45-51). And line 48 was fixed. Now it is:  } else if (token.balanceOf(addr) >= 1000E6) {  but 8 days ago it was  } else if (token.balanceOf(addr) > 1000E6) {  So 8 days ago there was a newbie mistake: in case you have 1000 SYMM you won't get divident at all because of error in code (there was now dividends calculation for this case).  And I might be wrong but there could be an error with initializing dividends_before_commision and dividends_after_commision variables.  Anyway this could doesn't check when SYMM tokens were bought (doesn't check round). It just check the amount of SYMMs holded. And all this code looks like it was not tested. Now it seems that they published it just to look more legit.  TL;DR: There is no code to check which round of the ICO tokens were purchased in - dividend calculation is based purely on amount of tokens held.  I have some programming experience, and to me it looks like the dividends_before_commision and dividends_after_commision (besides being spelled incorrectly) are not being initialised properly - they are initialised in the 'if' part of an if/else statement (type declared as uint256) but not initialised in the 'else' block (only an assignation). Definitely agree that it looks like this code has not been tested at all and is probably just there for show.  Back to the topic of the fake/scam accounts for now, our anonymous friend also had this to say: Quote May be they were not created by symmetry scamers. It could be another team that handle all these bots and provide kind of advertisement services. I mean you pay them to get post on forum to make a better look of your project. With more post in a topic it may seemed that more people are interested in a project.  It is very common in Russian social media so I assume that someone just make same promotion business on bitcointalk and scamers just buy post from them. Makes me think of all the reports of russian manipulation of the US election - we know it happens, is this just another example? I think that is likely.  So, to recap: 1st smoking gun - funds being transferred from ICO wallet to scammer wallet 2nd smoking gun - code containing basic errors, and not being able to calculate the dividend payout correctly as per symmetry fund's website 3rd smoking gun - this ICO is either part of a coordinated group of scams run by a single group, or has engaged the services of social media manipulators to artificially promote and lend legitimacy to their ICO.",False

So nobody has a social profile or any other coverage? That's weird for a team that claims so many years of finance & investment experience. The answer I got from Andrew in the Telegram group was: ""We are coming from old fashioned, traditional financial institutions, most of us never had or have social profiles, we just don't use them. We avoid SM as much as possible. You can search for any recognized fund manager with German background and you won't find a thing. It's normal. You are welcome to join us in Dallas, TX on Feb 16-18, BTC/ETH Super conference to meet all of us."". Conveniently after round 1 of the ICO closes. the one time they were supposed to show up, in Dubai (jan 9th 2018, Dubai International Blockchain Summit), but nobody was there. They claimed ""we didn't pay on time"", really? if they really are fund managers/investors, they probably have Bloomberg for stock rates etc. Like linkedin, Bloomberg is searchable and no Andrew LEWIN shows up. When a friend asked Andrew about it, he got banned from the Telegram group. other critical sounds are not welcome: two critical reddit posters got banned from the Telegram channel too if the team has worked in Zurich (CH) in finances, there is a good chance they had to be registered (like a bankers oath), none of the team members show up: https://zh.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml website of symmetry itself is registered through a hosting/DNS lookup protecting construction (Domains by proxy), so is fully anonymous - https://www.whois.com/whois/symmetry.fund if you look at the code of the website images, they don't have person names but e.g. advisor-2.jpg and team-1.jpg. That feels weird, most other sites I checked had more meaningful filenames like andrew_lewin.jpg etc. That is what this guy spotted too: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2480514.msg28390839#msg28390839 I emailed Polaris Investors AG, the company of the advisor ""Mike Henkel"". Their quick reply was ""We were not aware of the fact that apparently people are using our name on Linkedin. This guy seems to be a fake and does not work with us. Honestly, I would not touch an ICO where a guy claims to be an advisor if he uses firm names randomly"". And I got a kind remark that they would short SYMM Smiley. though connections, EPAM's HR department stated there was no Vladimir Savochkin there their source code in Github is available, but the person who made the first commit (almost all the code) is gone - no account there anymore, just a name: Waqas Khokhar  https://github.com/symmetryfund/symmetry/commits/master Check on the Cayman Islands chamber of commerce for Symmetry Fund: no such company - http://web.caymanchamber.ky/directory/results.aspx?Keywords=symmetry+fund I haven't seen a photo of the whole team together, which would make sense if it's just a collection of modified stockphotos. You wouldn't start a 4 million USD business without knowing each other, would you? A friend talked to the lawyer Mykola on Skype. He is real and does consulting for Symmetry, even got paid for it. However: he never saw any papers and never met anybody in person, just gave advice. So again, nobody has seen Andrew & his team. The fund meter shows 4000+ ETH collected, although only 900+ ETH show in the address where the ETH is sent to. They claim in their Telegram that the rest came in as BTC from early investors, but that's nowhere to be found.

The full COSS team was there, now it's two/three people that can't be found in real life. From COSS I got back: ""I am not an advisor of that ICO and I don't have any link to it."" The advisor named Leah Kronshage was removed from the English site. When asked about it on Telegram, Andrew stated: ""he is an impersonator"".

There's a few things I find really weird, i.e.: Official website's telegram link now directs to a group called ""symmetryfund is a SCAM !!!!!"" ... seriously? This makes me think it's a salty community manager who has either hacked or had control of the account and has had a falling out. Scammers are not batsh*t crazy and wouldn't advertise the fact that they're scammers. Many of the points listed in the original post seem very nitpicky, i.e. registering a website using an anonymisation service is quite common. And the naming of jpegs? who cares? The linked medium article now returns a page saying 'suspended' I reached out to the organisers for the upcoming conferences mentioned on their site, and have so far had one reply confirming Vlad Savochkin as a speaker at Bitcoin Super Conference The linked business search at http://web.caymanchamber.ky/directory/results.aspx?Keywords=symmetry+fund is for the Chamber of Commerce, and is a local business DIRECTORY. not a REGISTRY. I created a free account on the Cayman Islands General Registry (www.ciregistry.gov.ky), and searched for ""SYMM LTD"" which is the entity mentioned in Symmetry Fund's Terms of Service (accessible through the website's footer). There is a result, but I can't get full details without paying $40 (someone else is more than welcome to though!) Andrew Lewin DOES clearly exist - and he was previously registered under the UK's Financial Services Register (https://register.fca.org.uk/ShPo_IndividualDetailsPage?id=003b000000LVd4uAAD). However, he is marked as 'Inactive' - but that could just be explained by a geographic relocation  All that in mind though, I do find the total radio silence from Symmetry Fund on their other social media channels a bit disturbing - but perhaps these channels are all under the control of the same malicious actor?  Has anyone else done any further digging? I personally don't feel like there's enough evidence to conclusively call this as a scam either way yet.

I did my due diligence and found so many red flags that I won't invest and earmark this ICO as a SCAM, one of the most convincing ones I've seen.  Let me give you a list of red flags that I've built up: all linkedin team member profiles seem to be rather new, no recommendations present although the got ""polished up"" quite a bit over the past weeks names of individuals show nothing when searching the with Google (apart from LinkedIn & their own site). So nobody has a social profile or any other coverage? That's weird for a team that claims so many years of finance & investment experience. The answer I got from Andrew in the Telegram group was: ""We are coming from old fashioned, traditional financial institutions, most of us never had or have social profiles, we just don't use them. We avoid SM as much as possible. You can search for any recognized fund manager with German background and you won't find a thing. It's normal. You are welcome to join us in Dallas, TX on Feb 16-18, BTC/ETH Super conference to meet all of us."". Conveniently after round 1 of the ICO closes. the one time they were supposed to show up, in Dubai (jan 9th 2018, Dubai International Blockchain Summit), but nobody was there. They claimed ""we didn't pay on time"", really? if they really are fund managers/investors, they probably have Bloomberg for stock rates etc. Like linkedin, Bloomberg is searchable and no Andrew LEWIN shows up. When a friend asked Andrew about it, he got banned from the Telegram group. other critical sounds are not welcome: two critical reddit posters got banned from the Telegram channel too if the team has worked in Zurich (CH) in finances, there is a good chance they had to be registered (like a bankers oath), none of the team members show up: https://zh.chregister.ch/cr-portal/suche/suche.xhtml website of symmetry itself is registered through a hosting/DNS lookup protecting construction (Domains by proxy), so is fully anonymous - https://www.whois.com/whois/symmetry.fund if you look at the code of the website images, they don't have person names but e.g. advisor-2.jpg and team-1.jpg. That feels weird, most other sites I checked had more meaningful filenames like andrew_lewin.jpg etc. That is what this guy spotted too: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2480514.msg28390839#msg28390839 I emailed Polaris Investors AG, the company of the advisor ""Mike Henkel"". Their quick reply was ""We were not aware of the fact that apparently people are using our name on Linkedin. This guy seems to be a fake and does not work with us. Honestly, I would not touch an ICO where a guy claims to be an advisor if he uses firm names randomly"". And I got a kind remark that they would short SYMM . though connections, EPAM's HR department stated there was no Vladimir Savochkin there their source code in Github is available, but the person who made the first commit (almost all the code) is gone - no account there anymore, just a name: Waqas Khokhar  https://github.com/symmetryfund/symmetry/commits/master Check on the Cayman Islands chamber of commerce for Symmetry Fund: no such company - http://web.caymanchamber.ky/directory/results.aspx?Keywords=symmetry+fund I haven't seen a photo of the whole team together, which would make sense if it's just a collection of modified stockphotos. You wouldn't start a 4 million USD business without knowing each other, would you? A friend talked to the lawyer Mykola on Skype. He is real and does consulting for Symmetry, even got paid for it. However: he never saw any papers and never met anybody in person, just gave advice. So again, nobody has seen Andrew & his team. The fund meter shows 4000+ ETH collected, although only 900+ ETH show in the address where the ETH is sent to. They claim in their Telegram that the rest came in as BTC from early investors, but that's nowhere to be found. Check the photo under this medium post: https://medium.com/@irfanmuhammadsyamsularief/investment-with-the-symmetry-fund-f5abafde425  -> all advisors have been changed. The full COSS team was there, now it's two/three people that can't be found in real life. From COSS I got back: ""I am not an advisor of that ICO and I don't have any link to it."" The advisor named Leah Kronshage was removed from the English site. When asked about it on Telegram, Andrew stated: ""he is an impersonator"". Weird though, if you switch the language of their site to Korean, Leah is still there...  How many more red flags do you need?  My thoughts: this is a SCAM, set up by a small core group nobody has ever seen him/her/them/it in person and people asking questions about that are banned from the Telegram group. They really know their business: they show in their website and in the Telegram group quite a bit of knowledge on the crypto world, so are convincing. they did hire (and pay) some external parties to make the ICO look more legit, but none of those parties has ever met any of the ICO core team. Examples are Mykola and a guy I talked to that was paid to be a community manager. they are getting better as they go, slowly improving their scam game, involving more external people and even paying those external people. That's a good business lesson: you have to spend money to make money. They started slow, but as the ICO got picked up by some ICO rating sites and gave them more legitimacy. It's basically only self-confirmation: none of these sites really checked the team members or spoke to anybody in person.  So I'm sorry for the people who gave them their money, you can follow it through their smart contract on the ethereum blockchain:  https://etherscan.io/token/0xb54da0854f41396886eb728e0f8082382281f84a . They will probably kick me from the Telegram channel and try to remove this post, but hope I saved you some ETH.",False
