You need to use a ERC20 compatible wallet to sent funds from to us and you will receive MOAT directly back on that same wallet. MyEtherWallet is highly recommended.

As from yesterday we implemented BTC on our platform.  Here is the explanation:   The fixed price of the MOAT token will be announced in 12 days. For now, there is no fixed price. Instead, it will be determined by the community, based on people's involvement in the project. How exactly is the price going to be calculated? There is a fixed number of MOAT, precisely 250 million tokens. The minimum purchase at pre-ICO is 0.01 ETH or equivalent in BTC. The maximum amount we are set to collect, hard cap for Pre-ICO is 33,500 ETH or equivalent in BTC.  Things to consider: On the pre-ICO days 1 and 2, your purchase doubles (100% bonus). This means if you pay 1 ETH or equivalent in BTC, your share of tokens will be counted based on the twice of the price you've paid (e.g., as if you payed 2 ETH when you paid just 1). On days 3 and4, the bonus will be 90%, with the same calculation logic; days 5 and 6 - 80%, and so on.  After twelve days, when the Pre-ICO ends, we are going to divide the number of tokens (250 million) by the whatever sum we have collected summed with the bonus explained above (those 100%, 90%, 80%, etc). The number we get with this equation will set the MOAT's fixed price for ICO. For example, we have received total 10.000 ETH, but with the extra bonus, it is like we have 17.000 ETH. So, we divide the total number of tokens by this sum (in our example, it is 250 million by 17.000), and get the exact price for the MOAT token.  In this example if you would have invested on the first day of our PRE-ICO 1 ETH  you will have an amount of MOAT in value of 2 ETH what will be exactly  29.410 MOAT (14.705 MOAT per 1 ETH)",False

For now, there is no fixed price. Instead, it will be determined by the community, based on people's involvement in the PRE-ICO. How exactly is the price going to be calculated? There is a fixed number of MOAT, precisely 250 million coins reserved for PRE-ICO. The minimum contribution at pre-ICO is 0.01 ETH. The hard cap of PRE-ICO is 33.500 ETH.  Things to consider: On the pre-ICO days 1 and 2, your purchase doubles (100% bonus). This means if you pay 1 ETH, your share of coins will be counted based on the twice of the price you've paid (e.g., as if you payed 2 ETH when you paid just 1). On days 3 and 4, the bonus will be 90%, with the same calculation logic; days 5 and 6 - 80%, and so on.  After twelve days, when the Pre-ICO ends, we are going to divide the number of coins (250 million) by the whatever sum we have collected summed with the bonus explained above (those 100%, 90%, 80%, etc). The number we get with this equation will set the MOAT's fixed price. For example, we have received total 10.000 ETH, but with the extra bonus, it is like we have 17.000 ETH. So, we divide the total number of tokens by this sum (in our example, it is 250 million by 17.000), and get the exact price for the MOAT token. In this example if you would have invested on the first day of our PRE-ICO 1 ETH  you will have an amount of MOAT in value of 2 ETH what will be exactly  29.410 MOAT (14.705 MOAT per 1 ETH)",False
