Why do investors care about this issue?  Everything is quite prosaic‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe field of cryptocurrencies and investment in ICO is characterized by high risks. Perhaps some of our investors are faced with this phenomenon, some have become victims of fraud, and someone first hears the word.  You can determine is the project scam or not by the use of several methods:  1. The method of the four ‚ÄúT‚Äù. You will need to evaluate the project team, economics and marketing, technology and the essence of the token. Thus, four ‚ÄúT‚Äù are obtained‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäTeam, Tech, Theme, Token.  2. The method developed by blockchain specialist Alex Kontegna. Its essence boils down to the presence of unreasonable internal tokens, which indicates that the submitted project is a scam. This method is shown in the picture below.  3. There is also a more complex and time-consuming method, but we are not in a hurry when it comes to investing our money.  So, the first step is to draw up a risk scale of 100 penalty points. Select templates based on previously analyzed scam-projects. Evaluating the project by criteria, you can choose any number of convenient indicators. For example, let‚Äôs imagine that we have several indicators for which we charge a different number of penalty points to the project.  For example, for the factor ‚Äúlack of history in social networks of participants‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe have to add 10 points, if the history of activity in social networks is traced, then we put 0. Now consider the factor of ‚Äúmismatch locations in WP and on the map‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääadd another 10 points. The next factor ‚Äúthe absence of other successful projects‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääplus 7 points and so on.  Having completed the scoring, we analyze the results:  If the project has collected up to 33 points‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis startup deserves respect, if from 33 to 66‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit is worth to treat with suspicion, and to analyze other indicators, if the project scored from 66 to 100 points, then it is definitely scam. With such simple methods, by donating a few hours of free time, you save or increase your savings.  We wish you all successful investments!",False

Today we will talk about these trends. The main tendency at the moment is the growing interest in cryptocurrency in all spheres. We can observe this both in the sphere of state regulation of the status of cryptocurrency and in the interest of small and medium-sized businesses. Not so long ago, major market players began to show interest. According to the head of hedge fund ‚ÄúPantera Capital‚Äù Dan Morehead, the capitalization of the cryptocurrency market will reach $40 trillion. This statement looks quite reasonable. We all remember the fall of the bitcoin rate to $6,560 on April 1, 2018. Just within a month, the cryptocurrency experienced a steady growth and today its price is $9,298. Similar growth is seen in the rates of other cryptocurrencies. In particular, such altcoin as Ethereum literally grew up on 80% and its price today is $681. Most clearly demonstrated the growth of rate the token EOS, which is best experienced long-term correction of the first quarter of 2018. During the month, the cryptocurrency grew from ~ $ 6 to $19, and its capitalization exceeded $15.4 billion, which allowed it to move Litecoin from the fifth place in the capitalization rating. The total capitalization of the cryptocurrency market is $422 billion as of April 28, 2018. There is also an increase in the popularity of ICO as a way to attract investment. Since the beginning of 2018, 195 projects have been launched to date and this number will undoubtedly grow. The total number of attracted investments amounted to $6,175,256,332. During the first quarter of 2018, the Pre-ICO of the MONETO project started, which will last a month from April 17 to may 17.

If we take the average data, the price ranges 6 500‚Äì7 000 $. Most experts expect a steady growth of cryptocurrency, but so far volatility is not high enough. A significant breakthrough towards growth will require a significant impetus.  To date, many States are trying to introduce regulators in the cryptocurrency sphere and in every possible way to subjugate this market. However, crypto traders have managed to adapt to this, and these shares practically do not affect the market behavior.  Experts tend to consider the decrease in volatility as a positive phenomenon. They treat it as development and maturation of the market.  However, low volatility directly affects the hodlers. Supporters of the ¬´HODL¬ª strategy are discouraged by the low rate of bitcoin. According to a study conducted by the Reddit user, the number of comments with the word ¬´HODL¬ª in social networks and specialized forums fell sharply along with market volatility:  ‚Äî In fact, market volatility in any direction correlated with the increase in HODL references.

The beginning of the PRE-ICO‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää2018/04/10 at 0:00 (UTC-8)  Bonus‚Ää‚Äî‚Äädiscounts on the pre-ICO will gradually decrease from 35% to 5% in the following order:  1st week‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää35 %; 2nd week‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää15 %; 3rd week‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää5 %; TOKENS EXTRADITION AND THE MECHANISM OF THEIR DISTRIBUTION  Features of MTO token: ;  Name‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäMONETO; Abbreviation‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäMTO; type‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäERC20; maximum number of tokens‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää39 500 000 MTO; tokens available for sale‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää30 031 250 MTO.   The distribution of tokens will be done through a smart contract, a code that will be published in Github before the pre-ICO. The MTO token (MONETO) is a utility token (useful token), or internal project coin. It is an excellent opportunity for potential project investors to gain access to various services after the launch of the Moneto.  Therefore, for owners of MTO tokens, it is possible to issue a loan on more favorable terms in comparison with ordinary borrowers: a reduction in the interest rate for the use of a credit or the execution of a loan for the longest possible period. There will be an opportunity to lower the interest rate received on loan using partial token compensation.  The range of available services will depend on the number of purchased MTO tokens. Clients will be able to buy tokens within the PRE-ICO and ICO, and after their completion, on specialized exchanges as well. MTO tokens will be released in a fixed amount, which will ensure an increase in their value in the future with the expansion of the MONETO service.  The initial release of the tokens will be launched by the technical standard ERC20 on the Ethereum blockchain using a smart contract. The smart contract source code will be published on Github before the Pre-ICO. Depending on the volume of the MTO tokens the following services are available: 5 MTO: a user receives a 10% discount for the interest rate; 15 MTO: a credit period is extended up to three months, and the discount for the interest rate is 20%; 50 MTO: a user receives a VIP status which opens access to all the features of the service, including the maximum possible 30% discount for the interest rate, the most extended credit period, and access to the MONETO * partnership program. The purchased MTO tokens will be displayed in the user‚Äôs account in the MONETO web service. Customers will be able to withdraw their tokens from their account in the Moneto web service. However, in this case, all privileges of the project participant will be canceled. The transition to maximum tariffs will automatically happen, and the terms of credit loans will be reduced to the basic ones.  Read more about the MTO token, stages and discounts of Pre-ICO (ICO) on the official website of the project:  https://mone.to/  Our team is currently developing a partnership program where users with VIP status will be able to earn with us.",False

So, there are three scenarios in which the loan is made: standard, high-risk and floating rate loan.  High-risk loan‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe client gets fiat money up to 70% of the total value of the collateral. This, for example, may even be beneficial if the cryptocurrency rate was moving in a downward trend. In addition, this method of obtaining fiat money allows one to convert virtual currency without additional transaction costs and in a short period of time. If the Bitcoin rate is reduced by 25%, the borrower will be informed that his Bitcoin will be sold if the further reduction will go up to 30%‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsome will cover the loan amount and interest, and some of the funds will be returned to the borrower.  Standard loan‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis type of loan is more loyal to the user based on its conditions. The client gets fiat money up to 40% of the total value of the collateral. In a time of falling Bitcoin, the mortgage is not sold.  Floating rate loan‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis type of loan uses a floating rate depending on the Bitcoin exchange rate with the possibility of selling it. The loan amount is set at 50% of the value of the mortgage That is, with the Bitcoin exchange rate at the credit date, a floating interest rate is used. The floating interest rate on the loan is inversely proportional to the value of the mortgage adjusted for the balance of loan debt. The base rate is adjusted based on the difference in the ratio between the Bitcoin exchange rate and the balance of the debt principal.

You make the decision to participate in Pre-ICO of our project, but something stops? Your doubts do not give you peace of mind, You are tormented by questions a La ""what do I get in the end?"".  Let's talk about bonuses provided to our investors. Also, we are going to discuss the privileges which will be provided to our potential customers. Let's start with investors: our team has carefully thought through this step, calculations have been made, thanks to which we have confidence that we will be able to reward each of our investors with annual payments. Yes, the annual dividend payment program has been developed and has already been tested in practice in a test mode, formulas have been drawn up for which the amount of remuneration will be calculated. We will reward our investors with annual dividends, but in addition to a purely financial profit, investors will be able to participate in the creation of a service that meets the challenges of the modern cryptocurrency world together with its new realities.  And what gives Moneto future customers?  This question has one distinct answer, that we have clearly formed at the design stage of the future service. We will provide an opportunity to reduce the risks associated with the already traditional tactics of holding bitcoin during the jumps of its quotations. Talking about potential clients, we are talking about thousands and millions of traders around the world who adhere to HODL strategy (hold). Our clients will be able to get Fiat currency for bitcoins, while not selling the latter, but making them as collateral. Now, if the client considers it expedient, for example, in the case of the BTC rate growth, he will be able to buy bitcoins back in a few clicks, and in the case of the opposite situation, when the cryptocurrency rate collapses, the prudent BTC owner will be glad that he sold them at a high price.  Thus, the Moneto project satisfies the needs of both investors and clients, acting as an integral part of HODL strategy, as a reliable companion of absolutely every sensible trader. The decision to invest now or use the services of the service later, or to participate in both, depends on you. We hope we were able to answer the questions first and dispel doubts about the need to invest in Pre-ICO                                                                               ",False

What is the bounty program?  On the website BitcoinWiki look definition:  ‚ÄúThe bounty program‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit is ability to obtain tokens in the blockchain startups without investing their own funds. To do this, the company that enters the ICO offers to perform certain actions aimed at promoting the startup and attracting new users, and pays for them with tokens.‚Äù  Now look at the translation in GoogleTranslator: ‚Äúbounty‚Äù is translated from English as ‚Äúgenerosity.‚Äù  It seems that everything is clear, this is a program of generosity, when a startup is ready to give you a part of tokens in exchange for your repost, likes, comments, subscriptions, etc.Thus, this is a good way to earn additional income, over the past few years, a whole layer of fans have formed to profit from the startup. These people keep track of new ICO, and since the announcement of the sale of the tokens fill up the mail of the developers of the typical questions: When bounty? Will be an airdrop?  After the generosity program is announced, prudent users begin to work at full capacity, increasing activity on the pages of the brand in social networks, attracting their friends and this is correct. After all, to join the community, to like the record and share it on your page will not take much time, but the efforts spent significantly enrich the owner of tokens when he sells them on the cryptocurrency exchange.  Now imagine that this simple operation could be done with so many ICO, as you have enough time and effort. But we strongly recommend to participate in bounty of projects that will transform our world, bring new technologies or improve old ones. Then you will feel not only satisfaction from multiplying finances, but also moral pleasure. And all this because there is a second side of the ‚Äúmedal‚Äù participation in the bounty program. When you share information about a newly formed startup, you help the project to find its investors. And thanks to significant investments, the project will be able to start working fully, changing our world for the better.  Now that you have firmly decided to try your hand at participating in bounty programs, we share with you the instructions on how to participate in Moneto bounty project on the example of Bitcointalk forum. The following steps are universal for most startups:  1. To have an account on the bitcointalk forum.  2. You need to have a rating of Jr. Member and higher.  3. To place a special signature on the account.  4. Put the Moneto logo on the avatar.  5. Write at least 10 posts a week. For us to count them, the posts must be substantial and meaningful.  6. In addition, you need at least 3 posts to leave in the discussion Altcoins.  7. The length of the post must be 75 characters or more.  8. Do not remove the signature as long as it is not to be counted as your final rating.  9. The posts won‚Äôt be counted if:  - you uploaded posts for 1‚Äì2 days (they must be evenly distributed throughout the weeks);  - the post is useless or doesn‚Äôt make sense, or you wrote a very similar comment;  - you have not fulfilled one of the conditions listed above.  In principle, it is not so difficult as it seems at first glance. Usually, the conditions of participation in bounty differ slightly, so that almost the same way the tasks are performed in other social networks.  For more information about the bounty program Moneto project can be found at the link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3076984.0                                                                 ",False

All this time, governments around the world didn't know what to do with this breakthrough in the digital economy. What measures might be used in relation to a decentralized system? The absence of a responsible party created conditions for the development of a positive trend: in the worst case, Bitcoin is prohibited by government decree, at best - is accepted as a legitimate means of payment. If we speak averaged, at the moment we can see the following situation - in most countries draft laws are being developed to regulate the status of cryptocurrencies in particular in relation to BTC. You should also be aware that often what is prohibited to banks in relation to bitcoin is allowed to individuals. For example, you can buy some goods in Japan for bitcoins, pay taxes, or use of your BTC-wallet in China, if you are an individual. The most favorable situation for the use of cryptocurrency has emerged in Switzerland: there it legally treated as foreign currency. At the moment the progressive part of humanity is beginning to be more loyal to cryptocurrencies, which undoubtedly affects legal position of bitcoins. Based on the measures taken in relation to cryptocurrencies in certain States, we can divide them into two conditional groups - the first should include those countries that develop draft laws to regulate the status of Bitcoin or at least do not prohibit It: 1) Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Japan, Ukraine, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Singapore, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States etc. In the second conditional group we composed countries that restricted the use of cryptocurrency on their territory, or even prohibit operations with it: 2) Bangladesh, Bolivia, China, Ecuador, Iceland, Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Russia, Thailand, Viet Nam, etc. The situation is constantly changing, and where yesterday was anarchy, today came into force bills that restore order in the sphere of cryptocurrency.

This cryptocurrency continually grows, even after severe drops in September 2017 or in January 2018. And this is the first reason why you should not sell your hard-earned BTC-savings. 2. It is not necessary to make BTC/Fiat money exchange. Some services can redeem your BTC-savings with fiat currency for a specified period, and later you can return your bitcoins by paying the same price with a small fee. 3. If Bitcoin rate falls to the bottom, you can only rejoice that you have already sold bitcoin with a right price. 4. Skeptics claim Bitcoin as a bubble which is about to burst. Decades ago some voices claimed Internet would not get accustomed and compete with TV or radio. Be open to the new and don‚Äôt let yourself rust. 5. HODL stands for accumulation. You increase your finances with minimal effort. P.S. The risk always exists. There is the only solution that can protect you from going broke. Go off the game.

Many people think that this is a ponzi scheme but if they think such a system is a ponzi scheme, than letm e assure you the dollar itself, is a ponzi scheme.  We have to think outside the box and we have to understand the truth of economy and how the value of things are determined, in my opinion well organized lending platforms can bring in astonishing revenue and income, the market cap can continue increasing as long as the circulation is circulating, I am sure you get what I mean.  However, since the balancing of loaning platforms and projects is quite difficult to maintain, due to any unforeseen obstacle the whole circulation can crash, this makes loaning platforms vulnerable, but that DOES NOT MEAN THEY ARE A SCAM.  High security is a must, focusing on how to prevent people from using stolen information to take advantage of Moneto platform is one of the most important concerns you guys need to address and focus on. On the other hand, realizing that such projects can grow so fast and crash so fast, its all a matter of being careful on maintaining the circulation natural with no obstacles like major FUD or similar to what happened to connectx, getting legally chased.  IN short, Moneto is approaching the lending world and shaping it as they see more fit, I trust in a team of members who had difficulties and failures in their lives, as these type of people are the ones who know what success really is, and how it can be achieved.  I wish you the best of luck team members, keep your goal infront of you, learn from the past with an eye on similar projects results, and prepare for the future. Good luck!",False

Now the bitcoins costs two times less. And you don't want to pay $10k for what costs $5k. Use your $10k cash and buy two times more bitcoins.""  According to your whitepaper, in a standard loan you offer 40% of the BTC value. So in your example if you received $10k for your BTC it means you deposited the equivalent of $25k in btc.  For your original BTC value to drop BELOW $10k that would be atleast a 60% drop in price, and that's huge even for a volatile asset like BTC.  The only possible way for the user to win money in a downtrend market is if there is a BIGGER crash than the one we just witnessed.  Lets assume the maket crashes to 50% of the value. So now your original BTC is worth $12.5k. You now face the decision to return $10k to get $12.5k back. If you can't pay moneto still wins $2.5k (even with a 50% reduction in prices).  In the end MONETO is going to win BIG with defaults. And will only lose if there is a huge market crash.  It would work like an insurance company for your BTCs... you keep your money if there is an absolute crash. Otherwise you just wasted money.  the conclusion is that there is no ""free money"" script with this system and it is VERY misleading the way is is portrayed.  In the end there are only TWO situations someone should be using MONETO: 1- If they need fiat money AND  know they can pay back in time AND think that BTC will have price increases. 2- If they think there is a possibility of a 60%+ market downtrend.  Any other situation is just wasted money. If you need fiat currency and don't care about BTC prices, you just sell it at any exchange at better prices. If you think there will be a downtrend <60% then MONETO will be useless.  The company model is legit and profitable. But it is not ok to try to mislead people. That's worse than banks.",False

Conditions dictates that my few twitter followers will disqualify me for the social media feedback campaign logic leads me to conclude that I will go with the Bitcointalk Feedback Campaign: https://[Suspicious link removed]/forms/Nd8MXFnDZaCOA1o53 which I did.    The Moneto platform is quite convincing and interesting, the roadmap indicates that for the 1st quarter of this year it is still in the process of Company Registration, VQF membership agreement and PRE-ICO. The Buy Back Scenarios for both ups and down of Bitcoins offers a sense of security to investors and enthusiasts hence the claim of instant loan secured by Bitcoin can be realized.

What is the value of the Moneto project? What are bitcoin loans? Isn‚Äôt it like easy money in my city?  Are you sure my bitcoins will be given back to me when I try to repurchase them a few weeks later?  These and many other questions came from our future investors with various periodicity. Let‚Äôs start with the first issue, and we‚Äôll give a general response. Let's introduce ourselves! Take notice that you won‚Äôt hear the ICO clich√© from us: ‚ÄúWe are a team of young enthusiasts who are going to change the world, blah-blah-blah.‚Äù Our youth is in the past already. Each of us has had a difficult life experience; we are not revolutionaries, and turning the world upside-down is not our intention. We are just people who moved to success 20 years ago by overcoming difficulties, and we know what hundreds of young competitors missed. There comes a point in time when life opens a window of opportunities to everyone, but not everybody can recognize it because of difficulties that have to be overcome to take a possible chance. Even more rarely after finding this ‚Äúwindow‚Äù do we overcome our fears and doubts and open ourselves not only to new opportunities but also to new challenges. Here comes a moment that prevents us from moving ahead: lack of funds. It's very simple. Nine times out of ten, new opportunities are attended with new difficulties, and only a vast amount of money can help to resolve new problems. Let's be honest with ourselves. It happened to each of us. You couldn‚Äôt invest and open with friends a chain of cafeterias flourishing now without you; you couldn‚Äôt buy another trend goods on AliExpress or eBay and sell it successfully; you didn‚Äôt manage to invest in Bitcoin in 2010; you didn‚Äôt buy a ticket to a place you dreamed about your whole life because you lacked money, and now you are old and forgot about your dreams ... Shall I go on? There are enough examples, I suppose. So, let‚Äôs get back to Moneto. This project solves some important issues enough to explain why we are here. The first and most important task is to transfer your money needed for different purposes. We allow you to take a great deal of money from the blockchain system at that actual current exchange rate. The second, no less important task to solve, is to keep your savings in BTC. You will be able not only to get money out of the ‚Äúblockchain stash of cash‚Äù in time and use them in the opened window of opportunities but also to return your bitcoins later, after the rate increases. And the most important thing: Bitcoins will be repurchased at the same rate you sold them to us. That‚Äôs it! Having repurchased them with some extra payment, you increase your savings because of the difference between the old and new cryptocurrency rates. So, of course, you have the question: What does the Moneto team get? What is the benefit? It's simple: We‚Äôll charge interest rates of a small percent for giving money to you and keeping BTC until it is repurchased. In fact, you won‚Äôt notice it in contrast to the received amount.",False
