With 100s of projects on here, you have to realise that eventually lots of them will look similar.  As mentioned though, I know Mihai personally and if it was really such a big issue I have no doubt he would have Whatsapp'd me to ask me to change them and we would have done so happily.

Alttradex is structured differently and holders really will get value for their tokens.

A proper infrastructure behind the platform costs considerable money.  With no fee or extremely low fee trading platforms, the platform owners need to decide whether to invest in proper support & development or make a profit and we think you will find they will choose the latter 9 times out of 10.  Also users tend to gravitate to the platforms that have the best tools and a good customer support structure, as existing users act as ambassadors telling their friends and network, rather than the lower fee platforms.  There is little point trading on a sub par platform that will not respond when you have a problem if you are simply looking to save 0.1% and users who are interest in that are not our target demographic.",True

If you look at Binance, who did a similar ICO 3 months ago, their token is worth several times its ICO price and has not been anywhere near the ICO price and their structure is very similar to ours.

That being said, one of the main reasons for the ICO is to be able to gain users on the platform from the beginning and generate revenue within the first month of the platform being operational.  The softcap will mean that the revenue share kept by the platform can be put into marketing to grow the number of users exponentially over the first 12 months.  We will modify the post to make sure this is clear, thank you for pointing it out.  Thank you also for your interest.",True

Also another big part of a platform that many overlook is the whole structure behind it, hence many platforms under delivering when it comes to support and communication.  As cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, this is something that platforms will not be able to get away with.  Furthermore, while our exchange is yet to be trusted, there is little known about most people who run exchanges and they more or less need to answer to nobody.  By bringing people on board at the ICO stage, we are not only building a user base to grow volumes, but also a community who's feedback will constantly be taken on board and implemented where possible.  On top of that, we are very close to becoming the first platform in the world to hold a traditional financial exchange licence and are positioned to work with the regulators rather than around the rules they implement.  As for the decentralized exchanges, we too are working on a decentralized wallet system.  However, even with the emergence of decentralized systems, those who trade cryptocurrency professionally or have portfolios they speculate with will need all of the trading tools in order to make sure then can manage their portfolio to the best of their ability, so there will definitely always be a need for professional grade trading platforms.

So 60 % of the revenue will be distributed to coin holders. Where is the payout given, on the platform itself? Furthermore you are saying youre buying back coins to burn them regularly. So coin holders will receive a bigger stake over time?",True

Yes, 60% of the revenue will be distributed to coin holders.  The payout will be given on the platform itself, as if you hold the token it makes sense to trade on the platform as you will impact revenues.  Yes, 5% of the total number of coins issued will be put aside as a buyback fund and all of the revenues from the coins held in the buyback fund will be used to purchase coins that will in turn be burned.  Buy back reports as well as proof of remaining coins in circulation will be provided regularly.  This indeed means that coin holders will receive a bigger stake over time.",True
