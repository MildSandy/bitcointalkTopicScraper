We are a trustless platform, which means you don’t need to trust us with your money. The payment layer is built on open source Ethereum smart contracts, so everything is transparent and guaranteed to work as expected. We are aware of the current difficulty in using cryptocurrencies and we are working hard to solve this issue through a nice and simple UX, while not compromising on security.   https://i.imgur.com/IVrY2Qx.png   ICO is live Check NOW       A bonus of 30% applies to contributions of at least 3 ETH (eg: For a contribution of 3 ETH in the first week someone will receive 3 * 17500 * 1.3 = 68250 DLT);        https://i.imgur.com/Cq7s9Zm.png   Technology Stack   Ethereum Smart Contracts IPFS  Blockchain-based open source platform for building decentralized applications (Dapps). A new generation of applications that run on the blockchain, thus providing transparency, censorship-resistance, security and availability. Even more, because these applications run on the same blockchain, integrations between them will be trivial in most cases, so the more Dapps will be built, the more powerful they will become.  The backbone of DLS Academy is built on Ethereum smart contracts, written in Solidity language. All the core functionalities like transparent payments, reputation system, voting mechanism, governance model and even content storage will eventually be built on Ethereum and will take advantage of the rich ecoystem that was built around it, like ENS and Swarm. Our team is looking forward to new projects on Ethereum and we will constantly try to build integrations with other projects when it makes sense. IPFS aims to replace HTTP and build a better, decentralized web by offering high speed content delivery, eliminating duplicates of data in the network, making important content persistent throughout history and uses cryptography in order to provide security and privacy. The latter is the reason why IPFS is easy to integrate with blockchains, and Ethereum would be a perfect match thanks to smart contracts. For example, IPFS “links” (by which a file can be identified within the network) can be stored in a smart contract, and thus being timestamped and secured. WHY DECENTRALISED APPLICATIONS?
