While, bbt is launching a carefully crafted sellers program, to onboard as many sellers as possible. Any marketplace requires liquidity on the supply side to succeed, and liquidity means sellers. Building this liquidity is not about shilling the token, rather It is about reaching and talking with potential sellers, something that obviously goes unnoticed in social media and the blog. As soon as Bitboost have these sellers willing to accept cryptocurrencies for exchange of their goods and services and they board on this platform, it will launch a regular digital marketing campaign to attract buyers, the other side of the coin, to gain liquidity in the demand side. With liquidity in both sides, hopefully we will get the network effect, the key for the success of any marketplace. In this case, there will be much more listing, more listing means more tokens purchased, more tokens purchased means a higher price of the token. Do you see the mechanism? Everyone is focused on listings which team is working hard to get it listed on more exchanges, but I would say look at the bigger picture of the puzzle and see how these indices fit in to each other to create a continuous stream of token demand based on an actual marketplace.",False

The BitBoost team has been working together for years on their blockchain marketplace. We are not talking about a rush-for-the-ICO half-baked idea, but a practical application born of the innovative thinking of some real pioneers, who started coding on the blockchain as far back as spring 2014. They saw a need, and an opportunity. Three years later, The Block is a reality and moving towards beta testing.  The initial BitBoost team first met within the community of the blockchain platform NXT, and they built their first marketplace – NXT FreeMarket, a downloadable, functional shopping app on the NXT blockchain. This project was started by Paul Mahone, our CEO, and Andrew Lekar, who was involved in NXT blockchain from the beginning. In the following video, you can watch Paul introducing this app in Amsterdam in 2016.  However, the limitations of the NXT blockchain for a marketplace quickly became apparent and the user base was limited from the outset. Seeing these issues as roadblocks to future success, the team decided to move to the Ethereum blockchain in the summer of 2016. At this time they were joined by Samuele Maran, who was in charge of initial marketing and business operations. These three are the founders of the BitBoost project.  Shortly after, several more people joined to help to craft The Block. Maksim Sergeev started working on the user interface early this year, as the founders recognized the non-technical challenges of a decentralized marketplace to user adoption, such as the requirement to localize The Block in many different languages and to tailor and adapt it for the needs of widely varying legal jurisdictions. The team also incorporated developers to craft mobile apps, such as Riccardo Scanavacca for iOS, and Gianluigi Davassi. BitBoost believes that mobile e-commerce has a strong future, so the plan is to make The Block mobile friendly from the very beginning, allowing people from both mature and developing markets to use the app on their smart phones.  As a result, we have been developing The Block app, in its current Ethereum form, for more than one year. Specifically, we have expended more than 7 months and 222 days crafting the code. You are welcome to join us for beta testing!  As the application was going through development, the team decided to start building a business around it. BitBoost started researching markets and business models (read more about this in our white paper). The team expanded to include people from digital business and marketing, to form the backbone for a fundamentally sound company. Alessandro Tozzi, from Boston Entrepreneurship Center, and Alvaro Rodriguez, in charge of marketing and communications, were added. Yessin Schiegg, a seasoned financial and blockchain expert, joined as an advisor at the same time. Finally, we became officially registered as a company in Zug, also known as Crypto Valley, in May 2017.  Now, BitBoost is facing a last sprint towards launching at the end of 2017. A token sale to fund The Block will be announced this summer, but unlike the vast majority of these events, BitBoost is not asking for money based solely on an idea. Tokens will be sold to use on an existing platform, as soon as we go live. You will have less time to wait before you can actually use them.  The BitBoost team is confident that 2018 will be a great year. With a running app, and many ideas for more features to implement, you will see The Block expand within the e-commerce and digital platform markets, redefining services through the blockchain and decentralization. Updates will come soon. Stay tuned!  https://www.bitboost.net/blog/bitboost-team-history/",False

The orig one was Freemarket on NXT platform. And the final Freemarket shares CAP was > then current BBT cap after new ICO. Hard to say it's success. Also not much communication. But was neither in the past. Big questionmark. If the team will not change communication/marketing/pr approach wont get much credibility, and that one is also needed to get to another exchange as a trusted solution worth sth. Maybe even overall strategy review is needed. I think there is a few other solution on the market. First one will take it all - like amazon. Tech is one part,  getting good relation with publicity 2nd. Also a community is needed as it helps verify assumptions and grow the product while resources are limited. Here I do not see community, just group of investors. Growing community and attracting people is a different skill. You need an enthusiast visionary with some charisma. Of course commercial success can be there even without community, but community helps a lot in crypto. And if you are able to build community (sells skills here) then you can also sell the solution to final customers. Similar skills: building enthusiasm based on a vision. Sth that tech guys do not always get or see as important. Let's see what will be there in 12 months.",False

Sellers won’t sign up unless there is a big market already using the site. Buyers won’t use the site unless there are a lot of sellers. So it’s extremely hard to launch a service like this.  In order for people to use the service it needs to have clear and big benefits. I don’t really see any at all with this service unless you are a trying to sell/buy stolen or illegal goods.  If I understand correctly the listings will not be censored? If so, that’s really unethical and will contribute to creating a brand image of a service used by criminals and perverts. No reputable seller will want to have anything to do with the service and there will be boycott campaigns.  The existing market places today are not really expensive at all and already have the users sellers want. And the users can pay with fiat, which almost all prefer to do.  Just some thoughts.",False

This is similar to the system that eBay and many other e-commerce platforms use; merchants who offer consistently high-quality products, good communication and prompt and reliable delivery will naturally receive better feedback, and their enhanced reputation will lead to future business. This crowd-sourced reputation system will provide a first line of defence against substandard merchants and outright scammers. The Block does not require any personal information for users to access its services. No email addresses are collected as a condition of registration/use. Merchants and customers create their own aliases when they begin using the platform. BitBoost does not send messages to anyone as a matter of policy, and the absence of user information collected means there are few channels by which to do so anyway.

Open your NXT wallet and click on the Assets box. On the next page, find FreeMarket in your list of assets, and click the “Transfer” button in that row. For the Recipient field, use this address: NXT-5ZNG-7DLM-7ZQJ-CQS8P.(this is BBT recepient address) For the quantity, this should be your entire balance of FM assets. When you transfer your FreeMarket assets, be sure to include the address of your new Ethereum wallet. You can do this by checking the “Add a Message?” option. Enter your wallet address in the Message field. Check the boxes for “Encrypt Message” and “Message is Never Deleted.” Enter your account passphrase and click the “Submit” button.  3.

These remaining tokens will be sold at a significantly higher price than the initial pre-sale of 25 million and the main-sale tokens. You can find this information at https://www.bitboost.net/pre-sale/index.html  Hard cap will reach if all token sold out in the main sale included unsold token in the pre-sale if the team still has a substantial portion of the token to the closure of the Ico, could sell them in time to max the price.  we will have to have the attention with the market growing, and I hope that BitBoost turn on the rockets   I think you're talking about this conversation.

Here is a simple explanation, in traditional e-commerce stores, Buyer sends money to purchase an item, this money is held in escrow, while seller sends product purchased. Funds would only be released to seller until buyer has affirmed that he has received item and is satisfied. If there is discrepancies in item or goods did not arrive, buyer would open a dispute after resolution, funds would be returned back to buyer. Now for Bitboost, same principle applies using it's escrow system, payment for the item is held in an escrow contract and will be only released to the seller if both parties indicate that they are satisfied, or if a given period of time has passed without the buyer having opened a dispute. If a dispute is opened, the designated arbiter will be granted control over the escrowed funds and must determine whether they should be returned to the buyer, transferred to the seller, or to both in some ratio depending on resolution. So with this no seller would run away with your money when you purchase item.  Bitboost went an extra mile to introduce proposed reputation system where every seller and buyer will have a reputation rating derived from their conduct and the quality of their products during and after every transaction. Users with a low or negative reputation score may be filtered out, in order to protect all sellers and buyers from fraud and wasted time. Hope my explanation helps you have a better understanding?",False

The Block utilizes Ethereum smart contracts to list items for sale, to organize the buy and sell process, to hold escrowed funds, and to allow communication between buyers and sellers. Smart contracts enable a transparent and safe trading process. Messages, mandatory to the purchasing process, are stored on the blockchain. Non-mandatory and private communications can be moved to an off-blockchain platform to reduce costs and improve speed. As all data on the Ethereum blockchain are publicly visible, private communication requires encryption. The Block uses the elliptic curve Curve25519 for private-public keypair generation. On a high- level summary, each Curve25519 user has a 32- byte secret key and a 32-byte public key. Each set of two Curve25519 users has a 32-byte shared secret used to authenticate and encrypt messages between the two users.              Advanced encryption standard (AES) is used for data encryption, and one-time private keys are generated for the buy session. One-time keys allow the buyer and seller to share their communication with a third party, e.g. the arbiter, without revealing their private keys. The Block shares private keys for both encrypted communication and Ethereum wallet generation. The private key is stored in the user data folder in JSON format, encrypted with the user’s password.",False
