We had to spend some time making corrections as the market still plays with us. ETH fluctuates at around 850 USD level that is 25% lower that ICO level (that was 1130 US per ETH). We had to sacrifice post ICO marketing budget and market making budget in order to keep the product development safe. In March we will also have only very cost efficient marketing activities together with Waves mainly to support a launch on Tidex. We had to postpone launch on Tidex to mid-end March due to market situation and in order to have it closer to the product release and make sure we get 100% of it. We hope that market becomes healthier but till than our main goal is to keep the product roadmap safe.  The development of product goes very active, we have a number of new hires and everything goes according to the initial plan. The first release will happen in April. In our future updates, we’ll start sharing details of the features that will become available.  Once we are close to the product launch, we’ll be able to start a much more aggressive marketing campaign and this will be the part when we’ll need your help to spread the word and help us to reach the audience. We’ll have special bounty program for it, please stay tuned in order not to miss it.  On the 26 of February SIMDAQ Team took part in Vienna Waves Meet up.  Our team members had an existing event full of networking and new contacts. We had an opportunity to talk about Simdaq project features and it's current development progress.

Our project has a different approach for understanding the market and creating the trading strategies. The detailed information is presented in whitepaper. Making it short, we believe that the basics for any idea about making trading descisions is historical data. And we have a tool for trading simulation on historical data using which you can quickly and risk-free get trading experience, master your skills and test ideas about making trading decisions. The next step is to formalize and automate the trading algorithm. This will allow you to quickly test the strategy with huge amount of historical data and either verify that strategy is reliable or identify weak spots. We develop a visual modular environment for trading robots creation. Also, tools and services can’t exist in isolation from the community, so an important part of the system is the decentralized Simdaq market place.  Simdaq market place allows purchasing of trading signals and robots, social trading, group and individual training with mentor, decentralised tournaments. So, we have a good synergy with all the modules of the platform and none of the modules can exist separately. Integrity makes it possible to make things in the right way.",False
