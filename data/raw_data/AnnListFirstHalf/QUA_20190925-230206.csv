So on the first page of this thread it shows how Qtum will be used. It shows how the ""crypto community"" will buy tokens which will then be used to bring liquidity for markerts.  What I am interested in is how businesses who decide to use Qtum will use Qtum. Will they just be using the blockchain or will they need to also buy tokens to use their service?  If they wont be buying tokens then how will price ever rise in a meaningful way?  I have researched so many coins and tokens. So many projects are dead, have had their funds diminished, their teams have broken down due to infighting, communities have lost faith. One of the main ones I have found with projects which are still hanging on is how they will actually be used in the real world. Payment coins are basically competing with BTC and LTC so their USP doesnt exist. Coins which offer a service based on smart contracts are competing with ETH, EOS and NEO. Then we have projects who do actually have a USP and have partnerships but it turns out their partners dont need to buy the tokens so what is their point exactly?  Qtum seems like one project out of 1000's which has real potential but if the tokens arent needed then its pointless imo.  Any help would be appreciated.   Thanks",False

I don't have proof. I actually think the report is kinda a nice step up from before.  The red flag for me is that they claim to be earning 2% per trade. Unless they are doing some crazy arb like USA to Korean exchanges (which have a massive spread), or that they are doing directional trading (and perhaps manipulation) of some kind. Most market making activities and triangle arbitrage, or arbs between exchanges in the same country would run no more than .05 - .1% per trade at best, maybe double that if you were very selective.  So my personal opinion is that it is BS  Can you prove me wrong? Have these reports been audited by a reputable firm?

Also ofcourse he did not mention all the tokens held by people in exchanges (Gatehub, Livecoin and HITbtc) tokens which are NOT seen as separate wallets in etherscan but just as 3 wallets. And ofcourse he did not mention that the whales are holding strong.  And as you say, development: marketing (a marketing plan is ready to roll), getting into more exchanges (under progress, they just got a legal advisor to confirm that QAU is not a security etc), Doing bigger buybacks/burns (buybacks already doubled with bch proceeds, and will be even bigger with btg, new partnerships and other various other ways) and keeping the earnings after earnings, buyback after buyback, burn after burn... I would say it's a matter of development and TIME, that's it.  Popoola, Pointing on a decreasing value of any alt right after it's ICO and when the market is all about Bitcoin forks is kind of unfair to say the least. Look at ICONOMI graph performance for example (and there are many other examples), since it's ICO, and you might understand that what's happening to Quantum's value is rather normal and makes sense. That said, if your not just spreading FUD for buying lower... or are really are scared... For enormous gains you need to look for amazing long-term investments and hold STRONG because you can't time the market. Quantum Project is that good with it's model, team, etc... But not all people can hold strong during falls, and not all people can hold and not sell when they see ""minor"" gains (in crypto terms). Only the strong hold through good times and bad times waiting for the REALLY good times and make enormous gains.",False

That said you obviously are a noob wanting to see the coin pumped by the team and you don't care about the substance of what's behind it, just get it to exchanges, pump it with marketing and get some volume somehow who cares how... and that's buddy EXACTLY how shitcoins work, no substance just pump and dump without value nor substance just aggressive marketing campaign.  Quantum Project are working hard on the earnings/buybacks/burns & on the B2B liquidity platform knowing that the real volume will come through the success of those 2 things and NOT by a marketing pump or more exchanges, yes, better marketing are and more exchanges are important and they are working to get them better, BUT they understand what's most important are making bigger buybacks and burns and the B2B liquidity platform (that will btw use QAU as a utility token)... Let's say they'll get the QAU destruction to be 7,000,000QAUs a mont, instead of the current 1,000,000QAUs a month, then oh how much organic volume and marketing it will create as people all over crypto land will market Quantum Project on the tremendous gains possible and what a price of QAU will be at as people see how big the project buysbacks are (They buyback the tokens from sellers on exchanges(!) and then they burn the tokens)... But you are a noob thinking small looking for another pump and dump with ICOs that have no value and will have no value, only marketing and exchanges, maybe utility. To summarize: Marketing and exchanges are important and are and will be addressed but what's most important value wise is that QAU will make more earnings-buybacks-destructions and the B2B platform.  One Last thing about TokensNet: TokensNet will support and provide services to Quantum Project and Quantum Project will support and provide services to TokensNet, the one is a liquidity provider and the other is an exchange, they'll work together and from the same offices, that's a positive, thinking otherwise is pure silly. Putting your FUD even further, what's really going on here is that Damian Merlak the co-founder of both projects (and Bitstamp) gathered some of the top people in the field of crypto in Slovenia and is building a liquidity provider and an exchange, both projects will have a token that has utility in each project's platform AND both tokens get value from actual earnings that are then reflected in the buybacks and burns, NOT pure speculation.",False

I think that if the QAU value rises then the liquidity pool value rises and that allows bigger earnings to be made through market making. Now, since all QAUs value rises (QAUs in the liquidity pool & QAUs in exchanges), they need to spend more money to buyback the QAUs from the exchanges. So if I'm right about the above, my question is: if the liquidity pool is bigger because QAU value rises, can they buyback more/less/same amount of QAUs from exchanges?",False

It's more interested how much value is burned each month, and over the last few months it has been around $100k. Hopefully the yield from the liquidity pool will rise over time, but the amount of QAU's bought might go down. Still, that will translate into more value to the existing QAU's in circulation. Otherwise, if they keep the momentum with around 500k QAU burned each month, we'll run out of QAU in 13 years",False

That said, remember that Ethereum just recently got available on Bitstamp... and Ethereum is a very strong cryptocurrency for a quite a long time (in crypto time). I think it might be that since Bitstamp is regulated (the 1st exchange to be regulated btw, which is quite amazing) adding new cryptocurrencies to it takes more time. Also Bitstamp is currently dealing only with BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP, USD & EUR. Not any erc-20 token yet. It makes sense that they'll make tokens available for trading in the future now that the exchange support ETH, but we don't really know if and when.

I'm a little worried.  For the first time (embarrassing I know) I was just looking at the Etherscan page for the Quantum token at: https://etherscan.io/token/0x671abbe5ce652491985342e85428eb1b07bc6c64#balances and I noticed something slightly alarming.  According to my reading, of the 246,436,893.3789 QUA in existence, 87% are currently located at one address... What's that about?  Sure, the Quantum Project developers said two thirds of all the QAU (66%) created would be kept in order to increase the liquidity pool, but it would seem to me (I am fully prepared to be proved wrong) that with 87% held at one address, they're doing more than just burning around 500,000 QAU a month, they're also buying up a huge amount on top of that. Millions and millions.  Of course, I hope I'm misreading the implications and this is not the case.  On top of that, while ICO participants totaled 486 people, Quantum tokens are currently spread across 376 addresses. What makes this even more alarming (to me at least) is that only 265 addresses now hold more than 1000 tokens.  Am I wrong in finding all this a worry? Are the exchanges (Livecoin and HitBTC in particular) merely granted IOU's for QAU still held by the devs? Somebody please explain this to me in terms I (a not too bright person) can understand.

Why would the devs work when they can just sell off their own QAU covertly over the next few months or years at the expense of those holding? If they don't do or say anything then nobody can accuse them of failure in light of the post-ICO profits they advertise so prominently. As soon as they get more proactive it will become clear how little future Quantum has.  They're essentially relying on those who hold whatever happens (just as they have stated they intend to do with BitcoinCash) and 'black holing' a 'token' amount of QAU every month (that I expect will decrease gradually over time) to keep the illusion alive that the model has some promise.  Sure, the model might have promise in another group's hands, but not in this case. Why expect anything of devs who are unable to fund the production of a new website despite receiving millions during the ICO at the helm? I imagine the next few months will consist of the occasional whale dumping their QAU as they come to their senses, followed by the still devoted (but ever decreasing) followers buying up at what they think is a bargain price, only for the cycle repeat until there are a few desperate souls holding onto hundreds of thousands of tokens with a value of $0.00000000005 each.",False

The devs seem to be all about avoiding raising red flags over as long a period as possible. Burning ""$200,000"" of tokens prevents them losing more than ""$200,000"" of value (through investor dissatisfaction and suspicion) on the tokens they still possess. When so much else is lacking, it really isn't anything to applaud.  Being upfront with investors in terms of their identities and meeting promises regarding the greater transparency shown in the 'apparently' upcoming website is the most positive thing the devs could do at this point.

I think Gatehub listing QAU is a big deal: - Gatehub is definitely not a scam and. - Gatehub is not listing just anybody. - Gatehub's COO Gregor Gololicic said ""We have build a partnership with Quantum project and knowing the team [Quantum Project's team] we have the needed trust in the project itself"". https://www.xrpchat.com/topic/6299-gatehub-fifth-quantum/  I think Hitbtc & Livecoin listing is a big deal, both have with millions of dollars in volume in various coins, everyday, and that's a big deal.  I think Damian Merlak Co-Founder of Bitstamp saying ""I am involved with the project and it is definitely not a scam."" is a big deal.  I think Gasper Kenda, CEO of Xaurum, is escrow, is a big deal. https://twitter.com/BelTirid/status/854769427929280512  I think 200,000$ made in two months is a big deal, most companies don't make any income from their product or service for a much longer period time of time, if it all.. and I think that's a big deal.  I think the deflationary aspect, buyback and burn is genius and will prove itself.  I think 3 months after ICO is nothing, there are many many coins that didn't move for months and than got a decent rise in price. Also remember that the ICO price was 0.05$ per QAU and we're now at around 0.2$ per QAU.  I think Quantum Project are right on spot with what they are doing right now: Focusing on the new website, transparency, PR & IR.  There are more steps to come like: Providing more liquidity to various exchanges and institutions which will increase QAU burn rate making it more scarce & getting QAU to trade on more and bigger exchanges like Bittrex & Poloniex.  Now if you think Gatehub got scammed, Gregor Gololicic is lying, Damian Merlak is lying, Gasper Kenda is lying/got scammed, already made 200000$ of income is nothing, 3months for building a new site means it's all a big scam etc... by all means get out..",False

There are so many arbitrage opportunity in the crypto-market, just this last week BTS was trading 10-15% higher on the Chinese exchanges for quite a while on heavy volume, given how fast it confirms, you could have bought and sold multiple times. This week I bought both TKN & QRL on Liqui for 10-15% less than it was trading for on Trex & was able to turn a nice profit. However it's something I just dabble in when the discrepancy is obvious and very large, so to invest in a project that is doing it professionally, 24/7, could be very lucrative indeed.  The other great thing is that whether the market is up or down, these opportunities exist, possibly even more so in a down market. So QAU's USD returns may be fairly independent of overall market direction. So when 99% of alts should & do fall in a crypto downturn, I think we will find that QAU could be quite resilient.  Communication is a big aspect of creating confidence, especially with a fairly centralised operation, so the more information you can give and the more frequently you can give it, the better imo.

It's a blindspot, yes, but I don't see it as much of concern, especially if the code is on github and you can see the block explorer and if they pre-mined it (all the red flags).  So often that actually creates a powerful investment that is under the radar and not quite clear, at least at the beginning.  For instance, look at Minereum.  There are only a few developers on it, and they are heads down focusing on the code, roadmap they've promised and technical aspects.  This one is the first self-mining smart contract, which sounds like a lot to take in but truly brings a lot of value to the market if/when they deliver.  Like QAU, the website leaves a lot out of essential language out of view.  But again, that's why it makes for an advantageous investment because it hasn't quite gotten the attention yet, but we understand it has massive potential and there aren't any REAL alarms yet.  I think early-investors of QAU, whom understand the technology and trust the project, leadership, and roadmap are in for serious gains as it gets on other exchanges and goes through blackhole events (deflationary).",False

If these future shares are offered at or (preferably above market price), It would actually be beneficial, because larger liquidity pool, more $$$ burned. Also if they are creating a deflationary system, it would be smart to reintroduce more tokens once the supply pool has dwindled or diminished...  b) by retaining 2/3's of all tokens created, let's say the crowdraiser ends with 3.5 million dollars....now there company is worth 10.5 million dollar valuation, because they retain the other 7 million worth in tokens.  It's quite genius to do this.  If you start putting, 2 and 2 together, it becomes pretty evident dev is pretty smart and knows what they are doing.

Also the main factor to determine if the price gonna increase or decrease is the bounty and giveaway that handed during  ico the more bounty and more giveaway = more dump or less increase *2 instead *3 or 4   it is because most people taking this bounty or giveaway   is taking it to sell ( less interest on holding the token they have ) .

The first is that tokens will be issued at one time and there will be no more tokens, meaning that there will be no new mined or created coins entering the market. The second aspect is that the number of tokens, not only will not be bigger but on the contrary, will be smaller. With the repurchase of tokens their number will be decreasing with which they will be more valuable. And then there is the third aspect, which is very interesting from a psychological point of view. The fact that every month the platform repurchases tokens tells the holders that someone is going to buy their coins. That is, the person who owns the tokens knows that at least once a month someone is going to enter the market to buy those tokens which can allow higher selling prices to be maintained. It will be interesting to check the effects of this process over the months.",False

(How much will 1 Quantum cost?  The presale price of 1 Quantum will be set at approx. 0.05 USD.  How many tokens will be distributed during the presale period?  1/3 of all tokens will be made available to early adopters during the presale period.  How is the rest of Quantum tokens going to be used?  2/3 of the tokens will be reserved to be able to support further development and to increase the size of liquidity pool in the future. This will boost the ability to make markets as they grow larger and more liquid. The increased amount of funds in the liquidity pool will also speed up the destruction process of all tokens in existence and add more upside potential to the growth of the value of a single Quantum token. ) .   There is a lot of good info that is in the site and not posted yet to this thread and i think dev should update the main post with this info not everyone visit the site so it will be helpful to include that kind of info here in the live thread .  And congrats 530 BTC and yet 11 days left  just awesome. we gonna see 1k BTC by the end ( Hope so ) !!,False

Since from the whitepaper, this amount will be 1/3 of all the tokens, that means, we are having an approx of 30.72M QAU tokens so far. The total QAU tokens as of now is still small as compared to the other projects that have this billion range supply. So I believe, this one has a good future. But let's wait until the presale period is over as we can easily determine the final supply of tokens. 15 more days to go!

Let's say Quantum project collects 100 BTC in the presale (and the price of bitcoin is $1000). In that case 2,000,000 QAU ($0.05 per QAU) are issued to the presale investors.  Quantum project then deploys those 100 bitcoins to the market, engaging in lending, arbitraging and market making on different crypto currencies. These activities generate 1 BTC profit after a month of activities.  This 1 BTC generated during the month is then used to buy back QAU on the exchange that has the lowest price available. Let's again assume, the price of QAU after one month is still equivalent to $0.05 on the market and that bitcoin is still sitting at $1000.  That means we buy back 20,000 QAU and send them to the black hole address. The black hole address will be stated on our website and could be audited using any blockexplorer available on the internet.  After all that we are left with 1,980,000 QAU in circulation (2,000,000 issued - 20,000 destroyed). This process is then repeated on a monthly basis and slowly destroys Quantums over time.",False

The thing is that collecting different currencies creates problems for investors as the values of those currencies float against each other.

But if bitcoin goes up 100% during the presale period and ethereum stays the same (or the other way around), 75% of tokens would get distributed to bitcoin investors and only 25% to ethereum investors.

One of the main reasons preventing large players from entering the crypto revolution are illiquid order books and wide market spreads. This prevents sizeable cash flows from entering and exiting the markets in an efficient and cost effective way and leads to scepticism among traditional money managers. To support this fast growing ecosystem of various crypto currencies and digital assets, the crypto economy needs a professional and large provider of liquidity across all crypto related markets. This will lead to a faster and more stable growth of the entire crypto economy.  -- HOW IS QUANTUM DIFFERENT FROM OTHER CRYPTO CURRENCIES --     Most crypto currencies constantly create new units in a process called mining. Since this process is very expensive, majority of the people running this operation constantly sell newly created coins to cover their expenses. This creates downward pressure on the price and new money has to flow into the market just to keep the price at the same level.     We put this process in reverse. Quantum tokens will be destroyed constantly and the amount of units in existence will decrease over time. Just as mining of other currencies creates downward pressure, Quantum destruction process puts upward pressure on the price. This process will cause the value of Quantum tokens to increase over time even without fresh money flowing into the market.  -- IS QUANTUM A DEFLATION CURRENCY --     Yes! Because Quantum tokens will get destroyed on a monthly basis, the amount of units in existence will decrease each month. This makes Quantum one of the few real deflationary currencies in the world.  -- HOW ARE QUANTUM TOKENS DESTROYED --     Any excess funds generated from the liquidity pool operations will be used to buy Quantum tokens on the market and sent to the black hole address. This process will be transparent and auditable in real time using Ethereum blockchain.  -- HOW ARE FUNDS IN THE LIQUIDITY POOL GOING TO BE USED --     Quantum project will deploy all funds in the liquidity pool to provide liquidity on all crypto currency and asset markets available. This will be done by providing funds for margin trading to exchanges, connecting various markets by arbitraging price differences and making markets using price neutral algorithmic trading. New ways of improving our processes will be constantly developed and implemented when suitable.  -- HOW ARE LIQUIDITY POOL EXCESS FUNDS GOING TO BE USED --     Any income generated from the liquidity pool will be used to buy back Quantum tokens on the market at the best possible price and destroy them by sending them to the black hole address.  -- WHAT PROTOCOL WILL QUANTUM USE TO ISSUE TOKENS --     Quantum tokens will be issued on Ethereum protocol.      --  WEBSITE  --     support@quantumproject.org  --  FACEBOOK  |  TWITTER  --      PRESALE START: April 15th, 2017 | PRESALE END: May 15th, 2017 | PRESALE PRICE: $0.05     ESCROW: @BelTirid (Gašper Kenda) (CEO of Xaurum project)          Quantum presale finished at $4,122,708 Thank you for investing!
