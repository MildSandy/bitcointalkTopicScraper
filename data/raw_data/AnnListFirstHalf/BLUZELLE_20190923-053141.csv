They are a way for us to get more customers to use the our decentralized database. Thus far as Bluzelle Lovelace pointed out, we have integrations into Ethereum and NEO. We have previously announced working with Zilliqa and their high throughput blockchain. Our goal is to become the defacto database service for all blockchain platforms.  As part of our Phase One (which ended June 30) we are happy to announce three more partnerships with blockchain platforms. All three are blockchain world leaders building up large support. These are:  ICON: Building a decentralized network that allows blockchains with different governances to transact with one another without intermediaries.  QTUM: Like a hybrid of Bitcoin and Ethereum, a value transfer protocol which can support dapps and smart contracts.  Wanchain: Building a series of decentralized exchanges connecting all ERC20 digital assets in one location. No more exchange-hopping.  It’s been a pleasure to know these teams for almost a year. I got to know Patrick (QTUM), Henry (ICON) and Jack (Wanchain) well in advance of our ICO and we formed relationships while our respective technologies advanced.  The Bluzelle development team is excited to be working on these platforms as they solve major challenges and open us up to interesting dApps to use Bluzelle. We’re currently in China presenting alongside these teams at various Bluzelle: New Data Economy events.

A common question asked is how we stack up against Filecoin, Storj etc. This blog post answers that.  https://blog.bluzelle.com/how-is-bluzelle-different-from-ipfs-filecoin-storj-sia-and-ethereums-swarm-1d1d792658f8  Another comparison is to BigChainDB.  BigChainDB's current product is a technology where you either have to get your own nodes and run your own network that is built around MongoDB, but decentralized. This is fine if you want to manage your own nodes and have your own IT and is a far cry from anything that is ready to go and requires the developer to be actively involved in managing their own DB nodes and all upkeep. Quite different from Bluzelle. BigChainDB also has IPDB, which is a more ""world database instance"" kind of database. It does not appear to have any sort of swarming or crypto-economic model that guarantees decentralization and instead relies on ""caretakers, which are organizations that agree to share the responsibility of managing the network. Very different from the mass-decentralization model of Bluzelle that scales on the fly and accepts farmers at will to act as resource-providers for the network, incentivized by the cryptotoken.  We are looking at OPE (order-preserving encryption) to do searches and range queries. Basically, and simply, OPE keeps the relative order of A, B, and C, so that the ciphertexts for A, B, and C are still in the same relative order. There are some challenges around this that we are working hard on.  You can do distributed searching this way despite the data being kept private, which is obviously very desirable.",False

They decentralize the storage and access to files.  According to Bluzelle's FAQ on the topic of decentralize file storage:  They operate purely on the manipulation of files, which has a very different application. File decentralization can be used for access to website resources (images, stylesheets, html, etc) or to enable globalized scalable access to documents. Bluzelle’s data decentralization services would be consumed by software at a more intimate level, that is opaque to the end-user, replacing existing database systems.  https://bluzelle.com/faq/",False
