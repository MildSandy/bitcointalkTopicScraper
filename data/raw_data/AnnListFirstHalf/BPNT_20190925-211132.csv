The BitPlus Network is an ecosystem of business applications that rewards it’s users for engaging in provable VISA/MasterCard transactions via a native token, BPNT.  Why should you buy BPNT?  Our two live platforms, Interactify and Acadia POS ALREADY HAVE MERCHANTS USING THEM IN THEIR STORES! This is huge, as the majority of projects are ideas that have yet to be realized.  When you purchase BPNT during the presale/Token Generating Event, you are buying services at a discounted rate. After the Token Generating Event, new BPNT can only be generated through provable transactions on the platform. Merchant token holders can use BPNT to pay for the BitPlus Network services and hardware. All token holders can use their tokens to pay for products from participating merchants. In addition, BPNT will be available on an internal exchange.  Merchants will also have access to blockchain based, secured and unsecured business growth capital on our soon-to-be released Funding module.
