'CEO' wanted some super eazy cash, project is on 'stand by' now  From the webpage:  Integrative Wallet is a project that started several months ago, with the dedication of each one of the members, We had high expectations, and we believed that we were going to raise at least the minimum amount of funding that went into this.  We had many preparation expenses, as you know, it is not easy to make an ICO, all the means of communication or marketing expenses were made with our pockets, some had collaborated with us contributing to the advertising.  During the middle of the collection, the price of ethereum and bitcoin were down, so to cover expenses and not go into loss, the payment was made to the main investors.  The total cost of the project was approximately 28,600 dollars. Our expectation was to reach at least 150,000 thousand to be able to carry out the first stage and thus cover all expenses.  After the collection we realized that it could not be financed, we thought about a second collection with a new contract, or take it as a pre ICO.  Not everything went as we expected, we will make the payment so that the token finally enters Mercatox or another exchange, but the project is temporarily suspended.  Payment of the remaining bounties will be paid in full by today 29-10-2017.",False

Bounties program will reward a total of 25.000.000 IWT (25% of the total supply).  Really?   Act serious at least...  Yes you are right, I have read it in white paper, reward campaign 25% of total supply. The allocation of reward is clearly greater than the allocation for project development. I am not sure whether the future of this project can develop well.  Maybe you guys have missunderstood or we weren´t clear enough, this is a project that aims to integrate cryptocurrencies so the rewards for the bounties has been calculated specifically to reward the highest amount of people possible in order to gain a bigger exposure and use of our future products. Also, we don´t aim to have a multi-millionaire ICO, it would be of no sense to gather 50 millions in funding when we have calculated that the total development of the project will cost way less than that.",False

What is Integrative Wallet? Integrative Wallet aims to integrate crypto currencies at a global scale, increasing general knowledge of crypto currencies and making them easy to access to everybody. It consists on the development of three products which will constitute what we call ""The Integrative Ecosystem"", this three products are: an Integrative Wallet, which basically is a multi wallet that can hold any coin/token that is available on the market; the Integrative ATMs, this product will be focused on deploying Crypto ATMs all across the globe, in order to be able to make the conversion of CRYPTO/FIAT and viceversa easier for anybody; and the Integrative Card which is a physical card connected to your wallet, that can be used like a debit card.  How will we achieve this? We are a strong team of programmers, engineers, designers and marketers from different spanish speaking countries. This idea surged on a dedicated Crypto spanish group and we decided to start developing it. We are currently looking for people who would like to work with us, since we strong believe cryptos have a lot of space to grow and are a fantastic technology that should be available to everybody. We will develop the project in three stages which are further explained on the Whitepaper. The first stage will consist on the development of the Integrative Wallet and setting up all the necessary things for the further growth of the project.  How do we expect to fund it? We expect to fund the project with an ICO in which 45% of the available supply of our tokens (IWT) will be sold. Tokens will have an important function on the project, since they will allow its owner to receive payments from the profits generated through our products. Funders will receive tokens in exchange for their contribution. IWT is a ERC-20 token that runs on the Ethereum blockchain, it has a limited supply which means no additional tokens will be created.  ICO will take place from the 31st of August 13:00 UTC until the 28th of September 13:00 UTC. You can check additional details at Whitepaper There will be 45.000.000 tokens to be sold with a maximum recaudation cap of 63500 ETH. The ICO will be performed in 4 weeks, each week the amount of tokens received per ETH will be reduced.   How will we use the funds? Funds will be allocated at four different Ethereum accounts, in order to easily track how and when they are used. You can find a further explanation at the whitepaper, but basically they will be divided to be used for Development Purposes, Legal Advisors, Marketing & Public Relations and Reserve Capital.   __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ http://i.imgur.com/uUPh4wd.jpg  The bounties will be paid from 9/29/17 until 2/10/17.
