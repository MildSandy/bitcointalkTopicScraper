Results? Daily returns decreased by -59%, 5 out of 17 days at a loss and 1 out of 17 day at 0% gain, with highest daily loss recorded at -1.126%. With the old system (looking at the 2 months data before the forced intro of this hybrid arbitrage), average daily gain was much better and NEVER recorded a daily loss. Why the hell did they force this upgrade if it performs so badly? Couldn't they just leave the normal instant arbitrage and introduce a SEPARATE service/wallet that dealt with futures for those users that wanted to diversify their risk profile with futures? Why did they go and break something that worked well and forced it on their users, without choice/notice/data/explanations? And based on what? No mention of simulations being run on historic data to justify the goodness of this new hybrid arbitrage investment strategy, nor of its results. Again: -59% vs previous versions.

What industry needs smart contracts and Blockchain more than anything? O: The “Intelligent Contract” can help the users avoiding the loopholes in contract or code, I think it will be very useful for the decentralized exchanges’ security work. But for the centralized exchange, I don’t think the intelligent contract can help much with the cold / hot wallets. I think there are some industry needs blockchain more than others, such as finance or sharing economy business, such Uber, ofo, Airbnb. If you need transfer data or asset in your blockchain network, the smart contract would be necessary.

O: At this moment the most important thing for MATRIX is to explore our developers ecosystem, because the applications are the bridge between the personal users and our platform, high-quality applications will bring millions of active users for the platform. With the features of MATRIX, I thinks there are some industry more suitable for MATRIX than others, such as the big data industry (they need our AI calculating power to deal with their data), new terminal equipment, share economy business and so on. The industries who needs AI services and blockchain solutions, they will need MATRIX.    Arbidex: We are super excited to have you as Arbidex Advisor. Are you somehow familiar with exchange arbitrage or crypto trading?  O: A little, and if you need, I can introduce some experts for you.   Arbidex: Here at Arbidex we recently closed the ICO and now are at the very beginning of a long journey. Any tips and advice you could give to an emerging fintech startup? O: Arbidex is a great platform, but as far as I know, there are already more than 7,000 crypto exchanges all over the world, the business model of Arbidex is good but you still need more powerful products of features to keep the users staying on our platform. By the way, safety is always the most important thing for a platform. https://medium.com/@arbidexpromo/arbidex-interviews-matrixs-owen-tao-ebad817e1fd0",True

We had a massive feedback and interpreted the survey results to identify an Arbidex user profile that helped us a lot in creating an ultimate user experience:  *Most of our users are independent enthusiast traders aged 29–35 *Tried trading crypto several times before and would like to trade daily *Would like to see the likes of Binance and Poloniex to be integrated into the platform *Would like to be able to monitor trading and withdrawal history to feel safe on the platform  We thank everybody for amazing involvement and precious contribution!

The desire to get a lot of digital assets at relatively low risk attracts more and more scammers and experienced hacker sharks as the exchanges are often the first and last points of contact between users and the market, making them the most fruitful areas for innovation according to statistics, between the 2011 and November 2017, more than 980,000 Bitcoins have been hacked out of exchanges at all.  Digital age pirates had already succeeded in cracking top world’s exchanges. Today we have prepared a top of the most famous and largest virtual robberies out to date:  1Coincheck hack — NEM token worth of $530 Million stolen.  The most known and reputable Asian crypto currency exchange had recently shocked the world with the news of the record-breaking theft.  Unidentified hackers had stolen $530 million from the Japanese exchange. ItвЂ™s officials, of course, promised to partially refund almost 260,000 crypto currency investors affected by the theft вЂ“ , no timeframe is established for so far and it is unknown where would the platform get such amount of money anyway.  The hack occurred at the end of January, eclipsing the estimated $400 million in stolen from Mt.Gox in 2014.  Coincheck reported the hackers stole customer deposits of NEM, a less well known digital currency. The exchange promised to use cash from its own funds to pay out 46.3 billion ($426 million) towards covering its users losses. Sadly enough for users, but that makes 20% less than the total value of the virtual tokens that had been stolen.  The price of NEM plunged almost 20% after the theft came to the light of public, but it had since recovered those losses.  2 Mt. Gox — 744,408 Bitcoins (nearly $400,000 million in 2014) stolen.  B No doubt, the most famous theft case and the biggest loss in the history of crypto exchanges in an infamous Mt. Gox hack which led to the largest known loss of Bitcoins so far.  The Mt.Gox, also based in Japan, had been the world’s biggest crypto currency exchange in 2014 when hackers had stolen an estimated $400 million worth of Bitcoin back in the days. Mt.Gox went bankrupt shortly afterward and affected users still haven’t been compensated. The theft of top coin had been a result of a group of high-skilled black-hat hackers attack who had used certain security vulnerabilities in order to get unbelievable number of BTC from the exchange.  Later it became known to state officials that MT. Gox ended up working without a license in the US, which naturally attracted the attention of the feds. Coinlab also filed a $ 75 million lawsuit for breach of contract. The subsequent investigation led to the seizure of another $ 5 million, which caused a significant blow to the reputation of the company.  Unfortunately, it was only the tip of the iceberg — it turns out that the organization had deeper problems. Serious trouble began when the company has ceased to create a healthy culture of development for their software. Since the Director General had to give his approval before approving most of the innovations and processes, platform developers had to spend a lot of time implementing technical solutions.  As with any extremely valuable asset, vultures are always circling — hackers took advantage of weaknesses on the stock platform to gain access to Bitcoins — within a few minutes there was a large-scale sale of coins for millions of dollars, most of which were sold literally for cents. In General, world prices for Bitcoin have stabilized soon after the incident, but the damage has already been huge.  In the end it became known that Mt. Gox lost about an equivalent of about $ 400 million. The stock company was supposed to declare bankruptcy and hundreds of thousands of people have lost money. Japanese authorities arrested the General Director for fraud, later he pleaded not guilty and was released.  3 BitGail — $170 Million stolen  Another fine example of the latest high-profile cyber attack happened just recently the official statement from Italian BitGail crypto exchange confirmed $170 million worth of token missing after the exchange hit.  This is another record-breaking exchange hack during the early 2018, following the Coincheck token theft.  At this time the company behind the exchange had not revealed the exact date of the incident, but the legal authorities had been informed and all transactions had been frozen. According to the official statement, “internal company checks revealed unauthorized transactions which led to 17 million of Nano tokens shortfall, an amount forming part of the wallet managed by BitGrail’’.  The company however also states on its website that it doesnвЂ™t believe any other tokens were affected by this hack.  4NiceHash — $70 Million stolen  The Slovenia-based company NiceHash specialized in helping crypto currency miners in the purchase or sale of computer capacities provided its transactions in Bitcoins. The miners were not exposed to third-party threats, the main feature of the platform is absence of prepayment, and buyers also are paid in BTC.  B On December 6, 2017 there had been a serious breach in the servers security. Reddit users had reported that they are unable to log in to their accounts or make any transactions — when they tried to log in, everyone had been notified of technical work on the platform. The service platform had undergone a powerful cyber attack as 4, 736, 42 (at the rate of 6.12.2017 the losses amounted to almost $ 70 million) of Bitcoins had been stolen.  Despite the incredibly high losses, NiceHash was able to continue its operations and provide services on crypto currency mining.  CEO and founder Marco Kobal left his post to the project got a new management team. However, with it the company managed to restore the investor confidence quite fast and began to strengthen its protection and defense systems against future intrusions.  5Bifinex — 119,756 Bitcoins ($72,000 millions in 2016) stolen  The Bifinex was the world’s largest crypto currency exchange until it was consumed by ANX.  On August 4, 2016 an unknown group of hackers stole 119,756 Bitcoins (almost $72 million at the exchange rate of the date) from users accounts. The attackers had been able to withdraw tokens from their wallets even despite the multi-layer security system. Hacking occurred through the procedure of execution the multi-entry signature, which allows the transfer of funds. Nevertheless, BitGo announced on its social networks that the violation was not recorded on any of the servers.  In consequence, Bitfinex was transparent about the entire trial and reassured it’s understandably angry customers that they had been working to establish some kind of compensation. The company purchased some of its assets from ICO to pay users, but the stolen money was never tracked. Bitfinex and then manages the transfer of BTC, LTC, ETH, and even Fiat money.  https://medium.com/@arbidexpromo/top-crypto-exchanges-hacks-the-industry-problems-and-future-1bdfe24871e9",True

Following the crowdsale launch, on February 5 we are rolling out the core feature of Arbidex — an automated exchange arbitrage window that will be displayed on the MVP website and becomes available to users depending on their levels on the platform — Upgraded, Silver, Gold and Ultimate:    ABX-tokens amount necessary to obtain a specific status and arbitrage limits  The implementation of the key functionality of the platform is our core priority, that’s why working on operational management and development of the product occupies 80% of our attention. We built Arbidex on the basis of existing arbitrage cryptocurrency fund that has been running since the beginning of 2017. We reinvested the company profit in the development of a mathematical algorithm. Since October 2017 we’ve been building a stable system, where the automatic algorithm eliminates all the risks. The process of implementing of arbitrage strategies involves a number of complexities that require a well-considered technical and software base. The platform is able to analyze thousands of pairs of crypto-currency and find the most profitable chains, earning up to 1.48% from each. We will be implementing a technical roadmap demonstrating the various modules including the open source and POC (proof of concept). We are trying to do our best to deliver our community the opportunity to start making profit as early as at the MVP stage.    By virtue of the ability to track the actual difference between the rates of traded currency pairs on several exchanges, a robot-system automatically makes transactions with an accurately calculated effect based on real data. Users receive system recommendations that rely on the current course of automatic trading and can perform arbitrage transactions using their own funds. The platform will deduct a commission (the so-called “success fee”) of up to 50% of the revenue of such an operation. The return on investment to a user in the arbitration reaches 0.2% of the amount of the deposit per day.  We believe that the arbitrage functionality is pretty awesome, because it allows trading without any risks on highly volatile cryptocurrency market. Log in to MVP website on Feb 5 to test the product. Your feedback is very welcome, so that we could improve the product.  https://medium.com/@arbidexpromo/on-february-5-arbidex-is-going-big-automated-arbitrage-is-launched-af71d8e1004e",True

We have to extend the presale period to the Jan 19th. There are several institutional investors who want to get in and some time issues not allowing them to enter earlier than in 8 days. For such inconvenience for our supporters we decided to give you special terms of participating in presale:  *40k and more = 20% bonus  *10k and more = 10% bonus  So, you still can participate in the presale till the Jan 19th. Just leave a message in our chat “I want to participate in presale” and we’ll connect with you (it may be @Yardy, @Grishakof or @Kamarslanova). Right now it is 1,5M USD already gathered and we plan to close 4M up to the end of it. After the presale we’ll post smart contract address. We can’t do it right now because every investor have his own contract with Arbidex describing terms of presale.  PLUS  We plan to modify our MVP and tokensale strategy and upgrade our servers up to January 15th. You’ll get a chance to do a manual arbitrage by yourself (SWT-trading). We did not expect such traffic. More than 1000 users tried our arbitrage and we that’s why the system let us down a bit. Thank you for your feedback and we would like to improve security, capacity and fault tolerance of the system and for that purpose we’ll upgrade our servers.  If you haven’t completed our survey, please do, because you’ll be able to receive a free tokens after that.  You might ask what’s about the tokensale. Well, we have to move it to the end on Jan. We want to finish our work with MVP and make it stable and functional.

The cryptocurrency market has been growing exponentially too attracting millions on new investors who got into the loop. Still, the market is rather complicated to enter and buying coins independently may become a tedious endeavour. As a result we get a rather high input threshold for newbies. Moreover, crypto-world is extremely volatile and bears great risks in addition to attractive investment opportunities. However, this doesn’t scare off the enthusiasts striving to buy some crypto, and their number is growing.  Besides direct investment by means of buying crypto with fiat money, there are hundreds of other ways to get coins. Bounty campaigns is one of them. Every project that is launching an ICO is having its Bounty campaign. Basically, it is remuneration for participants for promoting the project. Participants do all sorts of things — advertising, social media marketing, generating content, translating, etc. ICO projects would normally pay in their tokens that a participant can either sell at the exchange or keep on their wallets waiting for project development and token price increase. An important thing here is that the majority of bounties won’t require significant effort on your part, and in fact are pretty reasonable option to get to know the crypto-market and get your first token.",True

Arbidex is the first trading platform that aggregates liquidity from exchanges. Right now we have Bitfinex, Bittrex, Poloniex, WEX, Kraken and GDAX connected. A user has an opportunity to trade on these exchanges from a single account and single window. The system will allow users to exchange their cryptocurrency with a best possible exchange rate automatically and the total commission fee will be lower than any of those that exist at the moment.  One of the main features of the platform is an automatic arbitrage. Did you notice that BTC price is not the same on different exchanges? Sometimes price spread is up to 4-5%. Arbitrage is a process of buying some asset on one exchange and selling on another. Plus, if you add 1-4 intermediate assets and earn some percentage on each of these transactions. That is called arbitrage chain, this is how our automatic arbitrage feature works. Detecting Profitable Rates Algorithm (DPRA) will allow you to frequently buy and sell different assets and benefit from the difference in their price. You can always go to arbidex.ch and check the most profitable arbitrage chain (MPAC) of the day. Arbidex MVP — Arbidex-Promo.com  MVP is fully functional. Here's our short MVP video review:   You can check the interface and even send some money to automatic arbitrage. The limitation for arbitrage without having ABX tokens is 0,1 BTC. It is a maximum amount of BTC available for you. Plus, there is a limitation of withdrawal for the time of token sale. Attention!! If you deposit your BTC to the Arbidex MVP you won't be able to withdraw it until the end of token sale and only after identity verification.  This is how arbitrage chain is visualized in our MVP on Arbidex-promo.com:  We exchanged BTC-BTC with ETH and DSH as intermediate assets.   Arbidex Referral Program  Yes, we have referral program! You can find it in our MVP, in your investor profile: There are your referral link and list of your referrals. Your link should look like this:   To attract a referral you just need to send him a link to register.  Terms of Referral Program: You will receive 10% of profit of your referral from automatic arbitrage and 2,5% of his investments in ABX token equivalent on presale and token sale stage.  User Verification In order to follow KYC procedures all of the users have to verify their identity to be able to withdraw funds.  ABX Token  ABX — native utility platform token. Token functions: Increase amount of BTC in arbitrage (it depends on the token hold size) Lower the commission fees on trading up to 0,07% instead of 0,2% (it also depends on the token hold size) Listing new tokens and voting for it ABX will be traded on the next day after the token sale and on the domestic exchange with high liquidity. Community elects new coins for this domestic exchange by voting, companies pay for listing in tokens, we provide high liquidity to new coins   Tokensale Details  1 ABX token = 1 USD Total token supply: 25,000,000 ABX Total tokens on sale: 17,200,000 ABX Total team tokens: 2,800,000 ABX Advisers: 2,000,000 ABX Reserve: 2,500,000 ABX Bounty: 500,000 ABX  PRIVATE PLACEMENT (COMPLETED): CAP: $2,000,000 Bonus: 20% Token amount: 2,400,000  PRESALE: Dec 11 — Dec 25 CAP: $4,000,000 Bonus: 20% Token amount: 4,800,000  TOKENSALE: Jan 23 — Fe 15 CAP: $10,000,000 Token amount: 10 000 000   Funds Distribution   WEBSITE | ONE PAGER | WHITEPAPER | TWITTER | FACEBOOK | TELEGRAM | MEDIUM | BOUNTY",True

But with the growth of user number there wouldn't be any arbitrage chances. Thus the idea of the project kills itself.  2) There has been 2 ICOs of trading platforms recently that you mention in the Whitepaper - B2BX (Raised EUR 8.1 mln) and Stex (Raised USD 9.2 mln). These projects had solid whitepapers, social groups (Facebook, Telegram, Twitter etc), financial models. B2BX ICO ended November 17, Stex ICO ended December 10.  Do you think there is still demand for 1 more trading platform even with the automated arbitrage feature? If so why there is almost no members in your social chanels - <200 in Facebook, <150 in Telegram.
