It seems your entire life's existence is solely this thread(you're welcome btw for creating the thread for you). There is nothing constructive in your posts and you have nothing of substance to say, perhaps if you did I would be able to answer you.  How does not launching the exchange as of yet make us con men? Did we ever once say that the exchange would be up before November ended? The answer is no we didn't.  Our platform is right here if you want to see it - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XWlj8zxfM  However I do not expect anything constructive from you, I expect more personal attacks against us some of which already have been borderline homophobic and racist and I can't for the life of me understand why you are still even allowed on this forum but there you go.

As you can see its now 10 months later and we are still here.  I suggest checking out our updated site www.digitexfutures.com  and the demo of our platform which was done live at the Malta Blockchain Summit where we had a stand - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9YxGxSBM5o  Domain registered for only 1 year (They probably will delete website after ICO). Our domain is registered for 5 years, our ICO was 10 months ago, we are still here.  30% referral gains (Over exaggerated referral gains for get the funds as soon possible and run). Again, 10 months later and we are still here, referral payments are on the blockchain which doesn't lie. The referral rates were very high, but this drove demand for the token. We sold out in 17 minutes.  Rude team (Basically they¬¥re laughing and insulting future investors in Telegram, scammers don¬¥t care about people). I guess our tolerance for FUD was not to this persons liking. Screaming SCAM without any form of proof does not make for a good discussion.  No github. This is true, not something we have denied but we are building something new. Check out the links above to the website and the demo if you want proof of what we have built. Do other exchanges have a public Github? I mean actual code not just API sockets.  No prototype and nothing, just few pics. Answered above, but the whole point of the ICO was to raise money to build the platform.  They don¬¥t want to ask questions that aren¬¥t in the whitepaper. As long as questions are asked in a polite manner, they are answered.",False

There is a reason why decentralised exchanges haven‚Äôt taken off and part of the reason for that is the fact that they are slow and unreliable.  Our futures exchange is more of a hybrid model because the order matching system is purposely going to be on a centralised server because it‚Äôs much faster and much more reliable. This will be in combination with non centralised account balances. So we are combining the speed of centralisation with the safety of non centralised account balances in which only you own the private key to your funds.   State channels are also something we are looking at but again, the actual order matching system is centralised, it‚Äôs impossible to do real time trading on a fully decentralised platform. Hybrids provide the best of both worlds.",False

Short version: WHAT: 100 million DGTX tokens will be offered for sale to the public on February 15th, 2018. HOW: We have bought back 148 million DGTX tokens from a very large buyer who bought them in our ICO on January 15th, 2018. WHY: We were uncomfortable with one buyer owning such a large amount of DGTX tokens and we wanted to redistribute them amongst thousands of smaller buyers for the long term benefit of the project going forward.  To participate, you buy DGTX tokens by sending ETH (Ether) to our smart contract address which will be published in the Auction Panel on Feb 15th.  Token auction will start at 9am EST on February 15th, 2018. Token auction will offer 100,000,000 DGTX tokens for sale to the public. There is a 10 ETH maximum buy in to ensure that no whales can buy large amounts of tokens.  Token sale mechanism will be a reverse auction where the DGTX token price starts high and then drops in price every hour until all tokens are sold at a price the market deems to be fair. As the DGTX auction price drops every hour, you send ETH to our token auction smart contract address when the price drops to the level at which you are happy to buy. If you are happy to pay whatever the market price is, you can send ETH to our smart contract when the auction starts and you will get DGTX tokens at whatever the final price ends up being. The token auction ends when the amount of money raised divided by the number of tokens for sale is equal to the auction price. The final DGTX token price is determined when the token auction ends and is guaranteed to be equal or less than the price you entered at. All buyers of DGTX tokens get the same price and the correct number of tokens will be distributed to each buyer at the end of the token auction according to how much ETH they sent in. The token auction page will clearly show the current auction price and how much ETH has been raised so far and will calculate and display the forecasted final DGTX price. Refer your friends and earn 30% of the ETH they spend in the token auction. Token auction smart contract code has been fully audited by SmartDec.net and will be posted publicly on github before the token auction.  Register for the reverse auction - https://digitexfutures.com/token-auction/ More information on the buy back of tokens from the whale - https://digitexfutures.com/dgtx-token-block-trade-on-feb-15th/ Our CEO Adam Todd explaining the reverse auction - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHFXpaRAB3Q",False

It started at 25 cents and dropped 1 cent every hour for 24 hours. This was to ensure the overall market decided the price they wanted to pay, whether you sent in at 25 cents or right at the end - everyone got the same price. The final price was $0.0197.  We are now looking to press on with the development of the Digitex Futures Exchange. We believe a commission free cryptocurrency futures exchange can be huge and ensuring this platform is as good as it can be is our main priority. Whether you are a trader looking to trade commission free or someone looking to capitalise on the demand for the platform by holding on to the dgtx token and selling it in the future, we hope it will be fruitful for all.  All the best.",False

(as example taken directly from white paper) which will cause ""little"" inflation for existing token holders and overall price of token will decrease to let say $0.40. fair enough ( technically that is your transaction fees right there because it is decreasing the value of your portfolio) but lets accept it. real question comes here that if everyone knows that in 2021 digx is about to issue new 23.3M tokens which will decrease the price per token from 0.43 to let say 0.40 ( TINY INFLATION) will every one not sell it before even the release of new token to save that inflation ( frankly if i knew i can sell at 0.43 and will have a chance to buy back at 0.40 why wouldn't i?) so if everyone start selling before the issuance of new tokens the price per token start to go down and they have to issue more tokens to cover that 12 month cost of 10M which will cause more inflation for existing token holders. anyone can explain this? if not i am good with transaction fee rather than no transaction fee. and why would you save transaction fee when you can lose chunk of capital value?",False

PLEASE READ  http://www.realscam.com/f8/digitex-bitcoin-futures-trading-5095/  More on above link. I just copy one of the post bellow.  WARNING  DIGITEX has a business plan designed to make > them < real money while promoting the idea that all you need in return is a promise that their worthless tokens are worth the real money that you gave them.  Sounds like a great idea? They'll even make it easy for you:  1. Send them real money.  2. Receive their worthless tokens in return.  3. Enjoy your time staring at your computer screen getting goose bumps as your worthless tokens magically multiply.  DIGITEX does requires you to believe that:  1. Traders speculate on the price of Bitcoin against the US dollar.  2. They can be successful enough at speculating on the price of Bitcoin against the US dollar that they can pay a 30% referral fee to the shady pimps who are willing to promote this SCAM to gambling addicts plus the usual gullible and/or greedy people.  DIGITEX features a sideshow involving them announcing:  1. That maybe because so many people will want to play their tokens game by sending them real money that their limited supply of tokens will maybe increase in value.  2. That it's a ""no cost"" exchange! ... Because they promise that the only way they get paid is ""by creating a small number of new tokens each year"" that they give to themselves.  3. That of course as with any Ponzi SCAM, they also have the option of just keeping all that real money you send them for themselves and leaving you staring at the worthless tokens on your computer screen.  This sounds like a real recipe for disaster, doesn't it? No idiot would fall for this sh*t, right? So why am I wasting my time writing this?  Because the core of the DIGITEX plan to get > themselves < rich off this SCAM is:  PAY THE GREEDIEST, MOST CORRUPT ""PROMOTERS"" A WHOPPING > 30% < REFERRAL FEE  The worst Ponzi pimps are already fighting each other for the pool of suckers:  Simon Stepsys Faith Sloan Ari Maccabi Steve Lawson Danny Turner  Spitting out 30% of incoming money up front will make DIGITEX one of the most short-lived Ponzi SCAMS of 2018.

Zero trading fees combined with high leverage and an intuitive one click ladder trading interface allow traders to pursue high volume, ultra short term trading strategies without getting killed by commissions. With its own native currency, called the DGTX token, the exchange covers costs by creating and selling a small number of new DGTX tokens each year instead of charging transaction fees.  The DGTX Token At the heart of the Digitex Futures Exchange is the DGTX token. As a true protocol token, its an integral part of how the exchange can operate without charging transaction fees. All account balances on the Digitex Futures Exchange are denominated in DGTX tokens and the tick value of every futures market is 1 DGTX, meaning that all trading profits and losses are in DGTX tokens.  Anyone who wants to trade on the commission-free markets of the Digitex Futures Exchange must therefore buy DGTX tokens, meaning that a busy futures exchange will be a massive source of demand for DGTX tokens. It is this demand from traders that makes it possible for the exchange to create and sell a small number of new tokens each year to cover the costs of running the exchange without charging transaction fees.  DGTX Token Sale Starts January 15th The DGTX token is a unique cryptocurrency that will be in high demand from thousands of traders who want to trade futures with zero transaction costs. There will be an initial supply of one billion DGTX tokens (1,000,000,000 DGTX). On January 15th, 700 million DGTX tokens will be sold to the public at a price of USD $0.01 per token (1 DGTX = ETH equivalent of $0.01). The DGTX token is an ERC-223 Ethereum based token. The DGTX token sale will stay open until February 15th or until all 700 million tokens have been sold, whichever comes first. Any unsold DGTX tokens at the end of the token sale on February 15th will be burned to increase the value of the DGTX tokens that were bought. When the commission-free Digitex Futures Exchange becomes popular, demand from thousands of traders who must own DGTX tokens to participate will drive the price of DGTX considerably higher than its launch price of $0.01.  Commission-Free Futures Trading - How Is It Possible? Digitex uses its own cryptocurrency, called the DGTX token, as the native currency of the Digitex Futures Exchange. Your account balance on the Digitex Futures Exchange is denominated in DGTX tokens and all your trading profits and losses are in DGTX tokens. Digitex eliminates transaction fees on trades and covers operational costs by creating and selling a small number of new DGTX tokens each year. All new token issuance events must be approved by DGTX owners through a democratic system of Decentralized Governance by Blockchain. The demand from thousands of traders who must own DGTX tokens to participate will easily absorb the small number of new tokens that are created to cover costs. Traders want to trade on the Digitex Futures Exchange because there are no trading fees and decentralized account balances.  Main Features & Benefits of Digitex Zero Trading Fees Decentralized Account Balances Highly Liquid Futures Markets Automated Market Makers Digitex Native Currency Token Issuance Revenue Model Bitcoin, Ethereum & Litecoin Futures One Click Ladder Trading Interface Large Tick Sizes High Leverage No Auto Deleveraging The Best Technology Off-Chain Price Discovery, On-Chain Settlement Decentralized Governance by Blockchain Complete Privacy Blockchain Driven  Zero Trading Fees There are no transaction fees of any kind on the Digitex Futures Exchange. Traders can submit Maker orders or Taker orders at any time under any circumstances and pay 0% commissions on all trades forever. Digitex‚Äôs revolutionary token issuance model makes commission-free trading fully sustainable indefinitely, and it actually thrives as the exchange gets busier, ensuring the long term success of the Digitex Futures Exchange.  Decentralized Account Balances Traders do not need to trust Digitex with holding their account balance in order to trade on the exchange. Your account balance is held by a decentralized, independent smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, not by the exchange. Digitex cannot freeze/mismanage/lose your funds because we physically don‚Äôt have access to your money. And in the unlikely event that Digitex is hacked there are no funds for the hackers to steal.  Highly Liquid Futures Markets When you remove the constraints of transaction fees you get highly liquid markets because traders engage in high volume, single tick trading strategies that are not viable on other exchanges due to commissions. Liquidity is further enhanced by the presence of automated market makers, funded with 20% of the total supply of DGTX tokens, that are programmed to break even whilst keeping spreads tight at all times, even in volatile market conditions.  Automated Market Makers Digitex market makers are automated trading bots with algorithms that are programmed to break even. With their highly active trading strategy and a large trading bank of 20% of all tokens in circulation (200M DGTX), they help create liquid futures markets that have tight bid and offer spreads, even in volatile market conditions, giving traders the confidence of always being able to enter and exit positions which further enhances liquidity.  Digitex Native Currency The Digitex Futures Exchange has its own native cryptocurrency, called the DGTX token. The tick value of each Digitex futures market is 1 DGTX token, meaning that all trading profits and losses are denominated in DGTX tokens. Margin requirements are payable in DGTX tokens and traders account balances, deposits and withdrawals are denominated in DGTX tokens. Therefore, traders must own DGTX tokens to trade on Digitex‚Äôs commission-free, trustless futures markets, which creates demand for the DGTX token.  Token Issuance Revenue Model The Digitex Futures Exchange is revolutionizing futures trading by eliminating transaction fees on trades and instead generating revenue through token issuance of its native currency, the DGTX token. Because the DGTX token is in demand from traders, the exchange is able to create and sell a small number of new DGTX tokens each year to cover costs. The inflationary cost of a small increase in the DGTX supply is offset by demand from traders who must own it to participate in Digitex‚Äôs commission-free futures markets.  Bitcoin, Ethereum & Litecoin Futures Digitex has 3 futures markets: BTC/USD, ETH/USD & LTC/USD. Each futures contract has a large tick size, which eliminates a lot of noise and allows prices to be displayed on a one click ladder style trading interface, even in volatile market conditions. The Tick value of each futures contract is 1 DGTX token, meaning that all trading profits and losses are settled in DGTX tokens.  One Click Ladder Trading Interface Digitex futures markets are displayed on an intuitive ladder interface that allows traders to submit buy and sell orders instantly with a single click. With minimal mouse movement and without needing the keyboard, traders never need to take their eyes from the price action. Bids and offers move up and down a central price ladder that allows traders to visualize the market as the price literally moves up and down.  Large Tick Sizes A distinctive feature of Digitex futures markets are their large tick size. In futures trading, a tick is the minimum price increment that a futures contract can move up or down. For example, the tick size on the BTC/USD futures contract is $5. This removes noise and allows volatile futures contracts to be displayed on a scalper-friendly one click ladder trading interface without the price constantly disappearing off the top of the page and off the bottom of the page.  High Leverage Digitex futures markets offer traders very high leverage of up to 100x, allowing them to realise large percentage gains (and losses) from relatively small price movements. But unlike other Bitcoin futures exchanges, Digitex does not cancel your winning trade to protect itself from losses if your counterparty‚Äôs losing position gets stopped out because he was too highly leveraged.  No Auto Deleveraging Unlike other Bitcoin futures exchanges that offer high leverage, Digitex will not close you out of a winning position to protect itself from losses when your counterparty‚Äôs losing trade is stopped out because he was too highly leveraged. It‚Äôs out of your control whether the counterparty to your trade is at maximum leverage or not and you shouldn‚Äôt miss out on a profitable move that you correctly predicted because the exchange canceled your winning trade.  The Best Technology The Digitex Futures Exchange is built on the Erlang/OTP stack, the same technology that powers 70% of the world‚Äôs telecommunications software - and WhatsApp. The futures trading interface updates prices in real time and is completely web browser based with nothing to download. The Digitex order matching engine matches trades in less than one millisecond. The software architecture is being built with the capacity to scale to millions of concurrent users if needed.  Off-Chain Price Discovery, On-Chain Settlement Digitex is a hybrid futures exchange that combines the speed and reliability of a centralized order matching engine with the trustless security of decentralized account balances on the blockchain. This offers traders the best of both worlds when it comes to speed of execution and the safety of their deposits. Traders enjoy the benefits of real time trading on a blazing fast order matching engine without needing to trust the exchange with their money.  Decentralized Governance by Blockchain Digitex uses blockchain technology to eliminate transaction fees by minting a small number of new DGTX tokens each year. This token issuance revenue model is governed democratically by its traders, for the benefit of its traders, through Decentralized Governance by Blockchain. This means that all DGTX token owners collectively decide on when, if and how many new tokens are issued to cover the costs of operating the futures exchange.  Complete Privacy Traders on Digitex can start trading immediately without needing to submit their name or any identifying documents of any kind. As an offshore exchange that accepts only DGTX tokens, Digitex is not bound by intrusive, ineffective and pointless KYC/AML regulations that intrude on our users privacy and which put them at risk of identity theft by making the exchange a target for hackers seeking personal information. The best way to protect our users personal data is not to collect that data in the first place.  Blockchain Driven Digitex is driven by blockchain technology. From the use of its own cryptocurrency to eliminate transaction fees, to storing account balances trustlessly in a decentralized smart contract, and allowing its traders to determine the rate of new token issuance, everything that makes Digitex revolutionary is only made possible by embracing the disruptive power of new blockchain technology that until very recently didn‚Äôt even exist.   The Team The Digitex Futures Exchange is the idea of Adam Todd, programmer and ex futures trader and betting exchange trader. As a full time trader on Betfair.com‚Äôs horse racing markets, his bets would sometimes account for 10% of a horse race‚Äôs total matched bets volume, and his longest winning run was 240 consecutive winning days.  During this period, Adam developed a one click ladder trading interface that allowed him to submit his bets faster with only a single click. Originally built for his own use, BetTrader soon became a popular trading interface for thousands of Betfair traders, and 14 years later the software and its 25,000 strong community of traders are still going strong.  As a very successful short term trader who has also successfully developed his own trading software and built a loyal community of users around it, Adam is uniquely qualified to create the Digitex Futures Exchange. It was the authenticity of BetTrader that led to its popularity, because it was built by Adam to scratch his own itch. Digitex will have that same authenticity because it is being built for the same reason.  Mickael Salabi is the Founder and General Partner of Tokenpot, a cryptocurrency hedge fund diversified across a wide range of cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects that produced returns of over 3,000% in 2017. Mickael offers invaluable help and advice on the many aspects of running a blockchain project. He was an early investor in Digitex who loves the idea of sustainable, commission-free futures markets that use blockchain technology to eliminate transaction fees.  Lee Mayne owns RacingTraders, a 25,000 strong community of Betfair traders. Lee is a software developer and a designer. He is actively involved in a wide range of cryptocurrencies and ICOs and enjoys the mechanics of being an active token investor.

This is possible because DGTX tokens are the native currency of the exchange in which all account balances and trading profits/losses are denominated, and therefore they are in demand from traders who want to trade with zero trading costs. Other futures exchanges that have account balances denominated in Bitcoin cannot utilize token issuance and must use transaction fees to generate revenue, which penalize active traders and stifle liquidity by discouraging trading activity.  But there ain't shit for free - new token issuance comes at a cost of a small inflation rate on the value of DGTX tokens which is borne collectively by all DGTX token owners. For example, if we need to create 50 million new DGTX tokens in a year to cover costs, this is a 5% increase in the DGTX supply of one billion DGTX tokens which will theoretically cause a 5% drop in the value of DGTX.  However, this small inflation rate of a few percent is what pays for a highly liquid futures exchange with no trading costs whatsoever. Such an exchange will attract thousands of traders who must own DGTX tokens to participate, and this demand for tokens will create a DGTX price rise far greater than the 5% that it cost to create that demand.  DGTX token owners will vote through a system of Decentralized Governance by Blockchain to determine how many new DGTX tokens must be created each year to cover costs. This way, it is the DGTX token owners themselves who are determining the inflation rate they are happy with in order to fund the exchange which provides the utility and demand for the DGTX token.",False
