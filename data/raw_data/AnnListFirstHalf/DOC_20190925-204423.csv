And yes, tokens can be burnt if successful conditions aren't met. Please see this quote from my previous post here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2947691.msg30335622#msg30335622  Quote from: solariN on February 15, 2018, 11:20:51 AM ....""so what will you do with the coins left unsold?"" We keep the coins for future emissions. Why? Picture this: after the ICO there are 10 million tokens sold, and 10 million usd worth real estate properties. Now DomusCoins starts to appreciate and it goes up to 3 USD each. At the same time the real estate value didn't appreciate so fast. So, how to compensate the gap? We emit 10 more million DOCs at the market price, means we get 30 million dollars which buy 30 million dollars worth properties. The situation now is that there are 20 million coins issued and 40 million dollars worth properties. Doing the homework, it comes out that the minimum value for each DomusCoins went from 1 to 2USD, and this value is consolidated. If the case scenario above doesn't happen, tokens will be kept there or burnt. In fact, as stated on our whitepaper, the DomusCoins company formally commit not to inflazionate the value of the coin.  Last but not least, board members' coins are released only and only if tokens are sold in a proportional way well documented on the whitepaper.  ",False

We need a reserve and it is good for everyone holiding DomusCoins: when the price of DomusCoins appreciates, we can bring in more properties, hence being able to sell the DomusCoins in reserves at a higher price.

Participate in the ICO of the first real estate-backed alt coin! Facebook | Twitter | Youtube | Linkedin | Telegram   ICO start on March 1st, don't miss this opportunity! Quick facts:    Coin name: DomusCoins Coin abbreviation: DOC (DOCs for plural) Total supply: 1,000,000,000 DOCs ICO: 10,000,000 (DOCs) ICO start date: 1st March 2018 ICO end date: 30th April 2018 ICO price: 1 USD = 1 DOC Based on Ethereum EtherScan verified smart contract!   How it works:   ICO guaranteed: issued tokens have a real estate value backing them. Tokens are immediately spendable for stays and holidays in any apartment in the DomusCoins network ICO is 10 million tokens = 10 million usd = 10 million usd in properties Total supply, 1 billion. The remaining tokens might be issued in the future if and only if new properties will be brought into the company (so there is no inflation) DomusCoins holders will receive semi-annual dividends based on the real estate revenues generated DomusCoins can be purchased by bank transfer, paypal, btc/eth/ltc/xmr     Who we are:   DomusCoins is a UK registered company  https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/11120970 DomusCoins has an office in Dubai where you can meet the team Founder is Luigi Menghini, looks like a cool guy https://www.facebook.com/menghini.luigi     WHAT IF...  …people could participate in the purchase of real estate properties with no need of lawyers or authorities to be registered but at the same keeping a universally recognized right on the purchase?  …astonishing real estate projects could be owned by a larger amount of people instead of the sophisticated and inaccessibile groups only?  …everybody could make a profit from the real estate business even with a small investment?  …everybody could live in these apartments? Why DomusCoins is Cool?  There are some aspects that make the difference, both for ordinary people and for cryptocurrency buyers and for real estate operators too. In general, those who buy DomusCoins have the same benefits that are expected from cryptocurrencies plus those that real estate generates, but without having to commit with the same amount of money.  With DomusCoins you will have 3+1 gains:  DomusCoins appreciation. The increasingly widespread use of cryptocurrencies will lead to an increase in the value of those currencies that present strong collateral. DomusCoins has all the characteristics to be a protagonist in this market. In any case, the value of DOC will grow at least as much as that of real estate. So you will always be able to sell the DOCs at a higher value after a while.  Renting. When you own a real estate property it’s likely that you rent it out and take a profit out of it. DomusCoins rents out the properties on short-term basis to maximize profits. Profits will be shared proportionally with all the DomusCoins’ holders.  Selling. When you sell a property you do it to make a profit. Again, this happens with DomusCoins: when a property is sold, the profit, in DOCs, is shared with all the DomusCoins’ holders. Even after a sale, the emission value of your DomusCoins will always be guaranteed.  Hassle-free. Last but not least you don’t have to worry about bureaucracy, DomusCoins’ team will take care of all the procedures.  Moreover, you can stay in any of the properties that are part of the network, paying in DOCs at the discounted price reserved for DOCs owners.    Come and join us at www.domuscoins.com   BOUNTY!

What it means: We don't get your money to buy real estate properties, we already have real estate properties and we sell coins backed by the properties we already own. To sell all the coins, we would need 900 million dollars worth real estate properties and we simply can't afford this.  If we sell 1 million DOCs at 1 USD each, it means there are already 1 million USD worth real estate properties.  That said, there is one more reason too, which is even more interesting and practical: ""so what will you do with the coins left unsold?"" We keep the coins for future emissions. Why? Picture this: after the ICO there are 10 million tokens sold, and 10 million usd worth real estate properties. Now DomusCoins starts to appreciate and it goes up to 3 USD each. At the same time the real estate value didn't appreciate so fast. So, how to compensate the gap? We emit 10 more million DOCs at the market price, means we get 30 million dollars which buy 30 million dollars worth properties. The situation now is that there are 20 million coins issued and 40 million dollars worth properties. Doing the homework, it comes out that the minimum value for each DomusCoins went from 1 to 2USD, and this value is consolidated. If the case scenario above doesn't happen, tokens will be kept there or burnt. In fact, as stated on our whitepaper, the DomusCoins company formally commit not to inflazionate the value of the coin.  Last but not least, board members' coins are released only and only if tokens are sold in a proportional way well documented on the whitepaper.
