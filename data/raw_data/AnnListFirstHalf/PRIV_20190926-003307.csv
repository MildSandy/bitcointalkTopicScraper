Website: https://anonhotels.com/   “I am free, anonymous man. My flights and falls occurred while I was wearing a magical cap of invisibility, my successes and sins sailed on in invisible corvettes, and films and books flew off into the abyss in invisible strongboxes. I am free, anonymous.” ― Tadeusz Konwicki, A Minor Apocalypse  Market Problem We are waiting for a holiday all year. It should be a time of peace, relaxation and fun. The carelessness, however, spoil the formalities and the enormity of the dances that we must give to the hotel or the owner of the rented apartment before the holiday. In addition to your ID, passport, and address, we often need to share an email address, phone number, even our hobbies and interests. The hotel monitors our orders, shopping, sites we are looking at in the internet while using hotels wi-fi, visits in the restaurant or in the bar. Everything so that after the holidays spam our box with personalized ads and offers in hope that they tempt us. There is no privacy or anonymity. We feel they are following us. Constantly under the watch of ""Big Brother"".  More and more people are tired of this approach, looking for peace and privacy, but still want to enjoy the amenities that offer hotels. The answer for such clients is Anonhotels.  Anonhotels Solution We are the first international chain of hotels offering its clients a no-compromise stay.
