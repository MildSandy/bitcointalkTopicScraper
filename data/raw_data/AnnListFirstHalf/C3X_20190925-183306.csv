Even if you get all the coins (not gonna happen):  Proof of Work Block time: 4 minutes  For a MN, you would need 100 000 coins divided by 40 to get number of blocks you would need (2500) and then multiply that by 4 (minutes)  gives 10 000 minutes  which is 166.66 hours which is just under a week. Now consider that unless you have a really powerful mining setup, you are probably going to represent maybe 0.1% of the mining pool so your mining will take around 1000 weeks which is only a little over 19 years. Of course we have this to deal with:  from block 129601- ‚àû = 10 C3X coins  Which means that the infinity symbol ‚àû rings more true than ever. (it is not going to take 19 years to get to 129601).  If you don't have enough money to buy a mn or a substantial portion of a mn (and make up the last tiny bit with mining), then you are best to just walk away or look for a shared mn. I might look into a shared mn or a pos pool but will have to see since the coin will have to prove itself.   If anyone know of a site doing shared mn of this coin and/or pos pooling, please post here or pm me. Thanks",False
