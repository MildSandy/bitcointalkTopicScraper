If you're spreading demand too thinly you risk never creating a true market. We can't be listed on every single token holder's favourite exchange, it's just not doable.  Also, we're building a much more far reaching relationship with QUOINE, which should definitely benefit our token holders in the long run.",True

First thanks for all your questions. We for sure will offer a bountry program but need to be careful how much publicity we make before the ICO starts, we can only do a big PR push once but I would like to keep this poat active with questions about the project.  We are still in seed but would like to make more awareness and describe the project more to those that are interested in what we are building.  The project is truely a first as no one has offered a decentralized ratings platform for investment intelligence. The fund aspect is simply designed  as a rewards mechanism.  If you have some questions and would like to get involved please post here.  Or visit www.igniteratings.com and get in touch with us there.  Thanks again!",True

I think it's one of the best ICOs I have seen yet, for these reasons.  1. The Idea  Ignite is solving a massive problem. The lack of information. As an investor in many ICOs myself, the first problem I notice is the lack of credible information. By bringing a community that is incentivised by trading gains together, we can ensure we receive top quality information, before anyone else receives it. Knowledge is Power!  2. The Team  No matter how good an idea maybe, the success of the idea depends on a strong team. And after personally interacting with the team over the past few months, I can vouch that the Ignite team is not just here for a pump and dump, they are here to solve an issue for the entire crypto community.  Just take a look at some the articles written by them, for instance, did you know the first IPO ever held was that of the East India Company?  https://medium.com/igniteratings/financial-markets-to-crypto-markets-history-repeats-itself-again-9e3881a23d7d  3. Adjusting to Market Conditions and Taking Feedback  It is not enough to have a strong team, we need a team that takes constructive feedback and implements it. The crowdsale was initially set at 20,000,000 IGNT tokens, but on feedback from the community, the cap was halved to 10,000,000 tokens, while keeping the price same!  This to me is the first sign of success as the community is shaping decisions in a true decentralised manner, and it shows the team is always responsive and pro active.  4. Media Awareness  We all depend on media to aid us in our decisions, and Ignite has been featured on many publications like NASDAQ, CoinTelegraph, TokenMarket and ICOBench, in a positive light.  From the NASDAQ release:  As all community members share the common goal of profit, interests are fully aligned across the community to ensure that individuals rate well and rate honestly. The end result is a decentralised ratings agency which, according to swarm theory, should provide superior returns, while providing real-time ratings information to the industry.  5. True Diversification  The Ignite Index will only invest a maximum of 1 percent of its current net asset value into any one asset, which makes the token itself an incredible diversification tool in its own right, as it provides token holders with exposure to the highest-rated ICOs, based on truly decentralised insights.  This is going to be a massive idea and will definitely revolutionise the entire cryptocurrency landscape.",True
