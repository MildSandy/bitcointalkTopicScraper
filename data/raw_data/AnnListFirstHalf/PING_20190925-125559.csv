Feel free to comment and reveal possible inaccurate information. Disclaimer: I have invested in $CRYPTOPING during the ICO and after the ICO when the price of the token has been either sub-ICO or close to the ICO price in terms of FIAT USD.  And I am writing this article to get different opinions - I'd like to know if I am inaccurate or have misunderstood something.   First of all, the CryptoPing guys have performed pretty well. Their website has done well, pages work well, information is rather clear and accurate, even though some of the pages have not updated recently.  For example, on the URL https://cryptoping.tech/#subscription on the right side they have published the current total amount of subscribers, 78109 from which unfortunately only 210 are paying subscribers of the premium signal service.  I have selected to pay $20, because I can whitelist or blacklist tokens and receive also DOWN signals and support their project in addition to the original ICO contribution.   If I make even one or two successful trades based on the CryptoPing bot signals the subscriptions fees will be paid.  My way of using the CryptoPing bot is the following:  Step 1) receiving a signal Step 2) making a comprehensive due diligence with the purpose of substantiating possible fundamental reasons for the volatility Step 3) completing the trade -- if there is a reason to believe that the price of the signaled token keeps going in the same direction in the near future --  in other words there are both momentum and fundamental reasons (real news) behind the move.     Advice to the CryptoPing Team  After learning that there are only 200 paying subscribers, I have advised the CryptoPing team to generate some cash flow by disallowing masses of free floaters to use their service without even an intention to pay anything. I suggested that possible $3/month fee would be reasonable, even though 50% of free floater would end their subscription there would be a pretty hefty cash flow, in terms of numbers it would be $3 x 50% x 78109 = $117,163 per month or 390,543 tokens in month subject to redeem and furthermore to be partially burned.  Redeeming all tokens would last less than two years or 23 months. 9,000,000 / 390,543 = 23.04 -- if the above would be implemented.  Offering something for free does not make most people happy, because the fact is that people do not value 'free' products. That is basic psychology.      About Burn of Tokens and Supply and Demand  Unfortunately, the burn rate of the redeemed tokens is not anymore 75%, but 25% because the time period of six months appears to be passed. However, it does not matter how many tokens are issued, the only factor relating to price discovery is supply and demand. However, I understand that this fact can upset some investors anyway.  However, sooner or later there will be a lack of liquidity of tokens and the price will go up, especially if CryptoPing makes adjustments to their pricing structure.     Reason for Not Using My Advice  It can be possible that CryptoPing guys want still to wait and allow the amount of 'free floaters' to grow to several hundreds of thousands and later change the rules by sending new contract in which the customer will be allotted one or two months free trial period and after the time has been passed there is two choices: pay the $3 fee for the basic bot or $20 for premium.      About the Correlation Between the Token Price on the Secondary Market    and the Primary Market (ICO)  The token price on the secondary market is obsolete for the success of CryptoPing project because they have received their funding from their primary emission. In fact depressed token price benefits them, because they can re-purchase their tokens back on the open market. I would do that. It benefits them and also patient investors who believe in the project like me.  The only people who benefits from the inflated token price are speculators or those investors who have bought their tokens not for truly making contribution for the project or for using the project, but making an investment decision just in the hope of fast profits.      Free Floaters, Free Lunches and Guesstimates of Reasoning for the Delay  Everyone knows that there are no free lunches, because someone has to do the work and pay the fees. Building a trading bot is behind enormous and tedious work and such kind of work is not necessary fun.  Especially by knowing the unreliability of application program interface between the end user and an exchange. Things won't go so easy as some slick sales agents let us understand.  Furthermore, I guess that the CryptoPing guys knows very well that they have delayed with the publication of their social trading platform, because Autumn has passed.  From one reason or another the guys have not issued any explanation.  However, public accusation of scam and other rude language will not accelerate the success of the project or motivate anyone to work harder.  Furthermore, there is no communication and if I worked at CryptoPing I would concentrate on developing the product with efforts to keep time tables as little delayed as possible. Additional explanation by the CryptoPing team is obsolete. Their project timetable is delayed.  Furthermore, perhaps they have no time to issue reports to general folks, because all of usable time is being used for their core business and keeping ""promised"" time table.   Typically any kind of software projects are delayed by 30% (based on a study), especially that is true concerning projects that are dependent on third parties and third-party software.   I have personal experiences of above. I have personal experience of managing software engineers who are very devoted on their work, but they don't use any time to communicate -- even though brief communication would be recommended. A small amount of communication is better than NO COMMUNICATION   I have re-read CryptoPing's White Paper and there is no language of any exact time table relating to planned project or any extensions of the products. However, there is such kind of language on their website in the section ""ROADMAP"" https://cryptoping.tech/#roadmap and this is the reason that some inpatient investors are disappointed in conjunction with depressed token price on the secondary market.  MY ADVISE: A SMALL AMOUNT OF COMMUNICATION IS BETTER THAN NO COMMUNICATION.  Perhaps CryptoPing guys should just update their website and tell briefly the reason for the delay.  However, the token price on the secondary market does not affect the CryptoPing project itself, but just accelerates the ""burn-rate"" of redeemed tokens. If the token price on the secondary market is lower then the amount of tokens needed to pay the $20 monthly fee is greater. Furthermore, the latter leads to a greater amount of tokens being subject to burn and to pressure on price hike. Furthermore, a depressed price allows the CryptoPing team members to purchase their tokens back gradually.  Investors should be patient and allow the CryptoPing guys to do their work and be positive.  Instead of complaining the investors and users should try premium service and use tokens to pay the fees. Furthermore users should give feedback on the trading bot. If the investor has bought tokens without understanding the project, white paper or its language, there is not anyone else than the investors itself to blame.  Any kind of investing contains also irrevocable risk to lose investment capital partially or completely. Also, an investment into such kind of project can keep your funds held in for years. The aforementioned is true relating to any kind of investment -- even making an investment in blue chip companies contains risks.     About Price Behavior of CryptoPing  I am happy that there is not too much hype or price manipulation on the secondary market and I am able to purchase more CryptoPing tokens. Especially by knowing that their customer base is steadily increasing according to this:  https://cryptoping.tech/ico   Even though the page has not been updated recently there is an up-trend of subscribers and the most recent published number of customer is 78,109 -- CryptoPing guys should just update that.     About the Communication by CryptoPing  There is also some tiny inaccuracy in information relating to the subscription prices.  https://cryptoping.tech/faq/token  ""I bought 100 PING. How many signals I can receive for that or how long can I use bot? The price is fixed at 0.01 BTC/mo in PING. PINGBTC rate is determined by the market. Subscription grants you one month of bot usage without any limits. Oh, and we have a free tier too.""  And elsewhere: ""Subscription = 20 USD/mo in $PING charged daily, based on $PING price on exchanges, you can turn subscription on and off at any time""  Bitcoin is not anymore 2,000 but much more. Lol.  HOWEVER, BASED ON MY REAL SUBSCRIPTION 20 USD/monthly fee is most accurate. The deduction of tokens takes place on a daily basis based on the formula  $20 / <$PING toke  price  in terms of $>  / 30    AGAIN: I am not ADVISING ANYONE TO MAKE ANY INVESTMENT DECISIONS. Even though I am in the process of registering as a registered investment advisor in Florida State and SEC -- I do not give any advice and will not suggest anyone buy or sell without A PERSONAL UNDERSTANDING ABOUT RISKS, THE NATURE OF INVESTMENT and possibilities. A deep understanding of risk is essential. Furthermore, investors who use leverage or borrowed repayable funds are ALWAYS in a weaker position in terms of RISK CORRECTED RETURN.",False

So at this point we cannot confirm or deny any possibilities of PING being listed on any exchange, until it actually happens, if it does.

More news here.  Today we're launching subscriptions with the initial set of features available for subscribers only. What's new: signal frequency settings and coin filtering with whitelists/blacklists, daily volume and market cap thresholds and by mineability/premine/ICO. Some of the features from earlier now require subscription, those are the signal analytics page and ability to select exchanges. Subscribed users are also getting access to all upcoming bot updates (for example, signal analytics will get some additional info and indicators soon) without any changes to sub fees, and also to our other upcoming services.  The bot will also keep working for free for everyone, but with less frequent signals and all exchanges turned on by default in the free mode.  Subscriptions have to be paid in our token, PING. It is currently traded on Cryptopia and YoBit. Rolling out subs also means that we start burning tokens from subscriptions (75% of subscription fees for 6 months, and 25% of subscription fees for a year after that).  We're watching closely all the feedback we get about signals and their quality/precision, and will be making various adjustments to our algorithms over the course of the next week. We will also line up a series of updates to the bot and website that we'll work in the coming weeks, and start getting busy with the social trading platform.  We've also set up our Slack hoping that it would provide a place for our users to hang out, and for us to stay in touch with them, maybe fast-track some easy customer support cases, post announcements, discuss features and such. Being a brand new slack it's currently empty, but feel free to drop by. You can grab an invite here.",False

Or we can jump in & prepare the exit as fast as possible, after couple % up, then when it start dropping, exit quickly. But this strategy is very risky sometimes the price move up & down very fast. We need to watch & learn the market first a little bit. Study how the price move, toying with the chart (this is important) etc. If you look at the price movement, it usually moves in wave. Move up, retrace, move up higher retrace. Even when it drops it has the similar behaviour. Move down, retrace up, move down lower retrace up.  We need to learn some basic technical analysis as well. Learn about the trendline, how to draw support & resistance line etc, and then play with it. Normally when I received the signals I don't jump in right away. Most of the time i pick the signals of the coins that i've already watched through chart. Take a general look at the chart once more to determine where the price at that moment. Is it at the top, middle, low relatively compared to the previous days, weeks etc?   By this we can estimate/expect roughly how far the price can go. Is there enough room for the upside etc?

Here's the strategy I use:  1. Follow the signals (choosing signals is subjective, the result can depend on luck). 2. Spread the money to more than 1 alts. Don't put all the money in one coin. The more the merrier (it also minimizes the risk & increase the chance that one or more signals we follow hit the pump) 3. Not every signal is followed by pump. Therefore we need to SET UP STOP LOSS (it's a must for safety reason) just in case the signal isn't followed by pump we can exit fast and wait for another signal .  4. Most of signals are followed by an increase in price. We can profit from this (it's vary, from 1% - hundreds %). 5. Don't get too greedy if signals follow by ""huge"" pump. Because usually after the pump the price will drop fast. When we see the price start to drop, exit as fast as possible.   Disclaimer: This strategy works for me but it doesn't necessarily work for you. Crypto market is very volatile & risky. Do your own research & trade at your own risk.  Happy trading!",False

Waves Platform is a technology too. The wallets they have created for their platform (what we call Waves wallets) are used to store not only Waves as coins, but all the assets issued on Waves Platform, including PING, just like you can use MyEtherWallet for ERC20 tokens.  You cannot withdraw to Bittrex because first, PING isn't listed there, and second, your Waves address on Bittrex is not your wallet. It is your deposit address you can use to transfer Waves coins to your account to Bittrex, and Waves coins only. Sending any other coin to your Waves address on Bittrex won't make them magically appear there.  And yes, you can send some of your PING to Cryptopia and then back to your Waves wallet.",False

You are referring with it to signals you send and their max value after 1h, 6h and 24h. So It means you should have to exit position exactly correct time on all 40 ish trades you make in a day to see that kind of results in a day. That would be impossible . I think even I could randomly pick 40 spots in a market a day and show very encouragin results where I show only max value of  those position on a day. I think If you change your parametres for showin max negative results in 1h 6h and 24h you could see very similar results. Actually would be interesting to see those results and show the bots ability.  I think for total noob trader like myself the software doesnt bring much additional value at least for right away. I can see that you explain in your site what those announcment numbers mean by definition but I still dont have any idea how 1/7d signal is better or worse than 5/6d signal for indicating future price strenght.  It would be interesting to play with stats so that I could for example filter all signals which have larger than +300% buy volume for example and see the avarage return for a day or an hour. Also would be interesting to test out and simulate trading stretegies with your signalhistory, for example what Roi% it would bring me if I would buy all trades which passes my filter settings (for example >300% buy vol and <3/7d signals in a week) and use stretegy to buy or sell automatically if value increases or decreases 5% for example.  At this point your signals brings numbers which don't mean much to avarage joe like myself. I think you need better quide and examples for high quality trades.  I will follow closely how this develops and invest ico if I see this developing in right direction.  If you find this useful you can use my referralcode https://cryptoping.tech/?i=28017",False

First of all, all the people who submitted their translation work were sent the thread pictures previews to verify the result and then proceed to posting. We know it's a bit too late but we still would like to do it. We apologise for not reaching out to you sooner, but we had to shift our resources towards customer support and technical matters.  Indeed, it took us a while to get back to this thread. Since we posted the initial announce about our ICO, the number of our users has grown more than twentyfold! And it doesn't seem to slow down. We get a lot of feedback via email and spend considerable amount of time not only maintaining our server infrastructure and working on new features, but handling customer support requests too. To help everyone, including us, with that, we have rolled out a FAQ section on our website. It is built partly from your questions here, so thank you all for that! We also added the Guides section which we’ll keep expanding over time, finally answering one of the most popular questions “what does 5/7d mean”.  Next, we’ve announced the subscription features. Some people were initially concerned about subs, so here goes: CryptoPing will have free tier and it will keep functioning like it does now, but the signals for unsubbed users will become a bit less frequent. Subscriptions will provide users with quality-of-life improvements like coin filtering, extended information in signals, signal parameters customisation, and of course access to our upcoming social trading platform for altcoins. You can find more details about subscription here.  Last but not least, we are about to start sending signals for YoBit exchange.  Turns out that more than 1600 users have already purchased some PING for themselves and we’re slowly approaching 300 BTC in gathered funds. This is very motivating, we’re grateful and excited about things to come.

I have tested the bot and although I have been initially impressed there are products already on the market that can do extactly what this does: ""Coinigy""  $PING sole purpose will be for subscriptions to the product, this is a very limited scope of use.  This bot is really aimed at new traders, who will have little knowledge on altcoins to start with and will most likely stick to an exchange rather than having multiple wallets, so you are giving them another learning curve of trading their bitcoin for some $PING just to buy a subscription to this service.  For this reason I see subscriptions to be on the low side.  The only Plus I can see is that waves is trading at about $3.50+ and the ICO for this coin works out about $0.26 per $PING so because the coin is based on the waves platform then it may see atleast a multiple return if you quick enough to sell your share once it hits an exchange... other than that I do not see a long-term price in $PING unless the scope of its use is considered for other project uses.

We are running this token sale to fund further bot development and also to fund other things that we want to do (see roadmap). Of course we don't have what we want to do in the future yet, but that's entirely the point of this sale — to secure funds to get us there. Isn't it why projects do their ICOs?  We put our project forward, invite everyone to try it out and see if it's working for them and if our vision is worth investing. Without extra funding we won't be able to operate on a larger scale and as fast as we would like to. For example, we think that social trading platform for alts has lots of potential, but it's times bigger commitment than the bot beta, so we would like to probe the interest in that as well and ask for help in developing it in the form of crowdfunding.  On a practical level, how will you benefit from buying and holding the tokens? If the token price rises in BTC, if you subscribe to our services, you will pay less and less fees with your tokens over time, because we plan that the token price in BTC will rise, so essentially by buying tokens early you get bigger token stash to pay for subs longer for the same price in BTC.  Or you will be able to sell tokens on exchange and profit from your investment. Or both. Why do we think the price will be higher? Because we will increase demand and decrease supply of tokens over time. Please see our reply to Storm_Guardian_N7, where we discuss that in details.",False

If 1BTC = example 400USD today it could be 2k USD tomorrow; done this way that means if it were priced 1BTC that I'd be paying 400/per month one month 700/next month 2k/next month (exaggeration) so if the 'flat price' doesn't adjust based on real world values then it's technically not pricing itself accurately; we could be overpaying or underpaying.   Quote How much of a discount am I actually receiving if I purchase tokens during the presale and not afterwards?  Depends entirely on the post-ICO market, but we're going to help with that by limiting the supply over time, please see our ICO page, Post-sale supply maintenance section for details on how we plan to burn tokens. I've read the ICO page in-depth, it's my understanding that is lacking.    Quote The bot tells you ONLY when the pump is happening at that moment … + It gives you information on every single coin,  Or rather it brings your attention to something you might never notice because you cannot observe all the markets all the time. Perhaps disabling entire exchanges from your profile could help with not receiving signals about certain coins. We’re not saying the interface to the bot is perfect, but there’s a workaround. True, it does bring attention to things I haven't noticed; due to not being able to observe all markets at the same time. But is that worth a price that could be $24 today , $50 - $150 tomorrow? It's not hard to program a bot that does this; your bot saves the work of someone coding it themselves; and that's a great thing. But.... how accurately is the bot priced to reflect the actual value it is offering?  As a side note, I have already disabled exchanges I'm not using; disabling the exchanges doesn't work. I use Poloniex AND Bittrex; and those are the only two exchanges I have up there. That workaround does not work well enough to be considered a true workaround.    Quote it doesn't tell you when a dump is happening and doesn't send any signals right before it.  Yep, that’s maybe the top feature requested by the users and it’s on our list. But while it’s missing you can still create your own price threshold alerts in the bot for specific coins, so if you want a warning, you will get one if you set it up. The problem with that is that I pay ~$100 yearly for a service that already sends me alerts on the specific coins I want at the price I want. Coinigy. I tried Cryptoping for that and realized if I was manually setting it; that I was getting the same alerts I get from Coinigy. What set this bot apart was that it had a bot that was already scanning the market so that I didn't have to manually set those indicators.    Quote The bot tells you ONLY when the pump is happening at that moment  We respectfully disagree. As we previously posted here on this topic, the bot reacts to a number of factors, and it might send you signals about a coin for days before any pump actually happens. For instance, one-time price spike from a large buy, that is inconsistent with the trend, is not a pump, but can trigger a signal. Even then, considering current state of markets, pumps are happening all over the place, and things are moving too fast, and we understand where that “post-pump” signal impression can come from.  I agree. But the bot isn't clear on this/doesn't differentiate as far as I understand it. It just says Signals: 2/7d, or 1/7d, there is no explanation on what that actually means if that is how it does this, and there's no guide to explain how to interpret those signals either. At best it's good for observation and monitoring, but my problem with this is, it is not hard to monitor a market based on volume using a bot, bots are all over the place monitoring and triggering execution/buy and sells based on that type of data. What is hard, and what to me would differentiate this project (other than the fact that it's one of the only ones marketing itself and trying to get people to purchase it) would be it's ability to actually observe, monitor, and clarify what you've just said here; because that's not clear. Other than just telling me when X has occurred overtime.      Quote not sure if I want to pay X amount of money per month just to be told a pump has happened in coins I'm already watching and getting alerts for via coinigy.  You don’t even have to pay anything yet, because the bot stays free until ICO finishes and then some time after, and also because it will have a free tier that might suit you just fine. If Coinigy works for you better, then great! We love it and use it too. However, as we see it, if the bot doesn’t help you, you’re not required to pay for it and use it, but if the bot signals help you with your trades, then subscription fee is small enough to keep the service easily available to you. I'm thinking long-term in the future. I realize I don't have to pay anything yet, but I'm asking these questions here because I am on the border. I know I don't have to pay anything, and am aware there is a free-tier, but I'm questioning it's (fluctuating) value to help determine my own decisions.  I was interested in the ICO, but had some concerns before buying in. Since there is a free-tier it might be better to wait and see how this project grows. Either way I'm interested and watching closely for improvements.    Quote Until someone can explain to me exactly specifically how to profit from the bot I am going to hold of investing and will continue to test it. I do like getting signals about large volumes of BUYS on a particular coin but as they say you have to use your own systems judgement etc so these are not specific buy signals really just info that may or may not make you any money.  One of our goals with this project is to bring more people to crypto and help them learn how to trade, with or without the bot. We keep getting asked about it a lot and we are working on basic guides on how we would recommend to use the bot, and intend to release them soon.   Next stop in that quest is the social trading platform for altcoins, which is on our roadmap. In short, you’ll be able to follow other traders and receive filtered signals, and with that get more insight into what works for you and what doesn’t.   Thank you for voicing your concerns and the discussion!   This is what I like about CryptoPing because this is my mission as well. I see it as a tool that could possibly help me help others in the future without developing my own platform; but at the same time. I have concerns that seem to be remedied by just sitting back and watching the project grow. It has potential.",False

We’re sorry if we were not clear enough in the materials we have released, so please let us try that again.   To us, the questions quoted are sort of one matter altogether, and that is the matter of price vs value. You mention fiat, and indeed we cannot escape it for now, but we seriously tend to think that one bitcoin is just one bitcoin, since you trade most alts with it, and so we base the price on it. Having said that, we consider adjusting the sub fee amount should BTC price change drastically over a short period of time.   But then, how can you determine the actual value of the bot to you? Programming a bot might be not hard for you personally, but for somebody else it very well might be, especially with crypto ecosystem gaining more and more public attention. Next, the value that you perceive the bot provides to you (or doesn’t) may change over time with the features we release or with the markets you trade. The project was in a closed beta for some time with a group of about 200 initial testers of various levels of trading experience, and we determined that 0.01 BTC/mo is quite acceptable if you find that signals help you with your profits, especially given that we intend to continue the development.  Regarding the discount, we can’t give you any numbers, because we cannot determine the future, but we can try to design it. We presume that after we add the token to exchanges, we will help the price to keep rising by burning tokens during certain period of time, while developing the bot and introducing new features and even products (social trading platform + apps), thus limiting supply and increasing demand for tokens at the same time, increasing their price in BTC compared to the original ICO price, while maintaining same subscription fee in BTC.   So it’s not about the discount compared to some token price in the future, but about increasing token rate over time. We want our investors to gain some nice profits from selling tokens later, but we also want to them have an incentive for holding tokens for some time as well. We don’t have any secret token stash to control the market and we don’t want to, so we are going to stimulate holding, increase token rate according to our plans and keep working.    It just says Signals: 2/7d, or 1/7d, there is no explanation on what that actually means if that is how it does this, and there's no guide to explain how to interpret those signals either. At best it's good for observation and monitoring, … because that's not clear. Other than just telling me when X has occurred overtime.  We have already realised that we’re lacking in that department and hope to fix this soon. Would be great to hear your feedback when we release our first set of guides, maybe they will improve your experience with the bot too.    This is what I like about CryptoPing because this is my mission as well. I see it as a tool that could possibly help me help others in the future without developing my own platform; but at the same time. I have concerns that seem to be remedied by just sitting back and watching the project grow. It has potential.  Thank you.

Our sale went live just when we got the user #8000 registered!   First, to all the translators we didn't contact or reply to yet: we apologise for not contacting you sooner and will return to you as soon as we can. We were (and are) a bit overwhelmed with the feedback from users and are focusing on user support first, answering loads of emails and explaining things. We definitely underestimated the interest to the project, but that's a good thing, isn't it.   Now to address the concerns raised in the thread earlier, in no particular order.      Subscription is fixed in BTC value for the time being while coin rates are tied to it. We prefer to think that 1 BTC = 1 BTC.    How much of a discount am I actually receiving if I purchase tokens during the presale and not afterwards?  Depends entirely on the post-ICO market, but we're going to help with that by limiting the supply over time, please see our ICO page, Post-sale supply maintenance section for details on how we plan to burn tokens.    The bot tells you ONLY when the pump is happening at that moment … + It gives you information on every single coin,  Or rather it brings your attention to something you might never notice because you cannot observe all the markets all the time. Perhaps disabling entire exchanges from your profile could help with not receiving signals about certain coins. We’re not saying the interface to the bot is perfect, but there’s a workaround.    it doesn't tell you when a dump is happening and doesn't send any signals right before it.  Yep, that’s maybe the top feature requested by the users and it’s on our list. But while it’s missing you can still create your own price threshold alerts in the bot for specific coins, so if you want a warning, you will get one if you set it up.    The bot tells you ONLY when the pump is happening at that moment  We respectfully disagree. As we previously posted here on this topic, the bot reacts to a number of factors, and it might send you signals about a coin for days before any pump actually happens. For instance, one-time price spike from a large buy, that is inconsistent with the trend, is not a pump, but can trigger a signal. Even then, considering current state of markets, pumps are happening all over the place, and things are moving too fast, and we understand where that “post-pump” signal impression can come from.    not sure if I want to pay X amount of money per month just to be told a pump has happened in coins I'm already watching and getting alerts for via coinigy.  You don’t even have to pay anything yet, because the bot stays free until ICO finishes and then some time after, and also because it will have a free tier that might suit you just fine. If Coinigy works for you better, then great! We love it and use it too. However, as we see it, if the bot doesn’t help you, you’re not required to pay for it and use it, but if the bot signals help you with your trades, then subscription fee is small enough to keep the service easily available to you.    by the website I can tell they are not native English speakers gives me pause. What is to stop them from running with all the ICO bitcoins and shutting down the bot?  To quote our “ICO is live” email, we prefer to remain anonymous, for instance, because we would like our project to speak for itself; because we think that team visibility guarantees nothing; because we do not like authorities, regulations, and taxes. Being able to put faces and names to the project doesn’t automatically save your assets if the team decides to run with your money anyway. Don’t invest what you cannot afford to lose.    Until someone can explain to me exactly specifically how to profit from the bot I am going to hold of investing and will continue to test it. I do like getting signals about large volumes of BUYS on a particular coin but as they say you have to use your own systems judgement etc so these are not specific buy signals really just info that may or may not make you any money.  One of our goals with this project is to bring more people to crypto and help them learn how to trade, with or without the bot. We keep getting asked about it a lot and we are working on basic guides on how we would recommend to use the bot, and intend to release them soon.   Next stop in that quest is the social trading platform for altcoins, which is on our roadmap. In short, you’ll be able to follow other traders and receive filtered signals, and with that get more insight into what works for you and what doesn’t.

We’re not saying that the bot is perfect and we’re very keen on improving it. But the bot sends tens of signals daily.

The dashboard stats can be delayed by about 20 minutes, but that's only statistics numbers. The signals themselves are sent to Telegram immediately. The bot reacts not strictly to price spikes or strictly to volume changes, but to a number of factors and patterns, and more confirmations of situation can be needed for a signal to occur. Take recent signal on STRAT, for example, it was delivered right on time, and we observe that same goes for the rest of signals.

But instead, if you want to help to spread the word for some extra tokens, we offer referral bonuses for investors: if you send a referral link to friends and they invest in our ICO, you will be awarded with 10% of tokens they get. You can find your referral link in your dashboard after you sign up on the website.  Quote from: EDisney on May 16, 2017, 06:05:47 PM Info on the team? We prefer to remain anonymous. We are aware that team anonymity raises concerns among investors, but then team visibility doesn't guarantee anything by itself either. We already have the product, and we use it every day just like the rest of our users. You can check if it works for you or not right away and easily decide if it's worth it.  Quote from: xfunk on May 16, 2017, 11:45:58 PM you have a cap of 1000 btc and dicsount for people who invest 100+ btc, isn't it opposite to idea of decentralization? While we as developers and traders certainly are pro-decentralisation, it's important to note that our project is private, we ask the community to consider investing in it, so the project evolves and investors profit, no decentralisation here. Regarding discounts, it's a known fact that people sometimes invest in ICOs in groups, so it's an offer for such groups.

As for notifications, they are evaluated within a day or so after the signal happened, so the percentage gain that is showed on the bot website indicates the price gain within that period. In case of VRC (that you mentioned in your deleted post) the bot reacted right — it notified you about sharp volume increase. When somebody buys 10 BTC of a coin with daily volume of 50 BTC, that is suspicious, so there's a notification about that.

A small subscription fee will be introduced when ICO ends and PING is added to exchanges, and payment options will be PING tokens, bitcoin and some altcoins, available to everyone.  Price manipulation is a fair question for every signalling service. We think that manipulating prices using bot signals is against our interests, because we want the project to be successful and healthy. Manipulation would be hard to do on big markets, but clearly visible on small ones, so gaining bad reputation by manipulating prices is not on our roadmap.",False
