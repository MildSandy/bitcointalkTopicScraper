Welcome to the future of the internet. Here at Internxt, we're creating a range of simple, beautiful decentralized internet services. We believe that there's a need for a more private, secure and independent internet, an internet where you are the true owner of your data. Our first service, X Cloud (available in summer 2018), will be a decentralized cloud file storage service which will strive to compete with services such as Dropbox or Google Drive.  X Cloud Peer-To-Peer cloud file storage service and Internxt's first decentralized internet service. Thanks to decentralization and encryption, we are creating a platform where you can enjoy all the benefits of cloud services such as Dropbox, with the security, privacy, and independence you deserve. You'll only be sharing those files you really want to share. All the others will be available in a cloud that's only accessible by you. Unlike with other massively adopted cloud storage services, with X Cloud your files are split up into smaller pieces, end-to-end encrypted and decentralized. If a hacker was to gain access to a file of yours, he/she would need to circumvent our X Core's software security protecting your file, find the machines which are hosting the other pieces of the file and circumvent the world's most advanced encryption systems. This is fairly more complex than gaining access to your file if hosted on a centralized, non-end-to-end encrypted service like the one you might be probably using now. In the event that the hacker gained access to your laptop or wanted to access your account from another machine, a password and a 2 Factor Authenticator (2FA) would always be needed to decrypt your files. Internxt won't have access to your files at any time. These are hosted on a truly secure, private and independent P2P network.  INXT Internxt's coin, INXT, will be used as a means of payment to hosts who participate in our X Core program. There are 629,000 INXT circulating. This supply is also INXT's max supply since no more INXT will be generated. At X Core, users can earn money by hosting small pieces of encrypted user files. Customers will be paying hosts, directly or indirectly, in INXT. In the event that the customer decides to pay for our services in fiat or any other cryptocurrency different to INXT (say, btc), those btc will be used to automatically purchase INXT at market price, and will then be sent to hosts participating of our X Core program. Thus, directly or indirectly, customers will require INXT to purchase Internxt's services. Internxt will reserve a very small % of all transactions made for our products, to be used on improving our products and services. This follows a similar mechanism to the one companies like Airbnb or Uber have. INXT can currently be traded on EtherDelta, Mercatox and CoinExchange.  ---  Website https://internxt.io/  CoinMarketCap https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/internxt/  Twitter All relevant news are posted here https://twitter.com/internxt_io  Medium All relevant announcements which need >280 characters to be explained are published here https://medium.com/internxt  Telegram Here our community discusses with Internxt's team all news published on Twitter/Medium https://t.me/internxt_io  Whitepaper Updated as of September 2017.

Cloud companies need to pursue the zero knowledge system, where they host and process content on behalf of customers without having access to it themselves.” - Edward Snowden  “Internxt is starting to work on helping shape a new internet with the creation of distributed internet services that are attractive to the mass-market. Just like Apple did 30 years ago with the personal computer and later with the smartphone, Internxt (unlike similar decentralized internet solutions) is crafting mass-market attractive internet services.” - Clinton Senkow, CEO Influencive  “Old: do your own backups/migrations for every computer. New: one folder in sync across all devices (Dropbox and Google Drive). Newer: do everything in a browser (Chromebook). Future: decentralized web, my data is replicated around the world but only I control the keys.” - Brian Armstrong, CEO Coinbase",False

Maybe the fact that it also claims to host Websites and not just files, ok...  BUT your project is not open source.  That makes it vulnerable to the Gov if they decide to arrest the owners of the project, because if no one else has the source nobody can continue the project.  So it's like saying this project is centralized i.e. it has a single point of failure.  Right?",False
