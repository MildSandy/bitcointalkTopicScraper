The token is already deployed on the ethereum blockchain. The contract source code is published and verified so it's fully transparent. It is a token that could be nice to have in anyone's portfolio, but it also brings a very high upside potential. If traded for ether on exchanges, the lowest possible bid price will be 1 wei, it can't be lower than that. 100% of tokens will be distributed during the token swap event. No presale, no discounts, no bounty programs. Everyone gets the tokens on the same terms.
