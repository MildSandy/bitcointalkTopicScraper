The Sudan Gold Coin project is one of the few stable coins in a cryptoworld that backs up its assets with real gold, as has happened in various countries in the past. But what’s more important is that our project not only buys and stores gold, but mines it independently. This is the moment where the banks as a partners — is a “must” thing. And we have something to tell you about it. Our CEO and ideological inspirer of the project, Dmitry Konoval, being in Korea, met and established a contact with Hari Eppanapally, who is currently the vice-president of BNY Mellon bank. It is impossible to underestimate the benefits of this contact, because now the Sudan Gold Coin project has an extensive network of contacts in the banking sector, which includes Switzerland, Italy, UAE, and now the United States. Of course, in order to conclude formal contracts, the project must receive official permission to operate from FINMA, the largest financial regulator in Europe, but we are successfully moving in this direction, soon you will see everything for yourself. And there is another piece of news that our team would like to share with you: the Sudan Gold Coin project is much more than the usual ICO, we were told about an idea that was supported by both the Sudanese government and Swiss representatives. From now on Sudan Gold Coin can only be considered as the beginning of something large…but we will tell you about this later Thank you for staying with us, stay tuned and visit our website www.sudangm.io for more info about us.  #Sudan #Gold #Coin #Token #Cryptocurrency #Crypto #Cryptoworld #Cryptofam #Mining #Bitcoin #Ethereum #Altcoin #Blockchain #Blockchaintechnology",False

Dear friends! We’ve noticed that our community is getting bigger and new members are joining to SGC family. For these people, we’ve created a post that will help our newcomers to understand more about our project.  Because amidst a general ebb in the ICO market, there are ones that compel us to sit up and take notice. While all the arguments about significance of crypto currency and its effect on the financial market are going on, our Sudan Gold Coin seems to allay some apprehensions of investors. Few crypto currency enthusiasts would miss such an ICO. The Sudan Gold Coin ICO has come up with an unique element of guarantee in the form of physical gold.  Features of Sudan Gold Coin ICO  · Perceptions about future valuation that drive crypto market and crypto ICOs have a tangible backing now. The Sudan Gold Coin ICO issues tokens to investors. These tokens have the backing of real gold. Lack of physicality that was the norm in crypto investment, is now gone for good.  · The ICO will help investors route their investment to production of physical gold in Sudan. This is a real mining and purification plant that will produce real gold. Even the land for the projected gold mining plant has been acquired by the project from the Sudanese Government by way of a Concession Agreement.  After the ICO  It is the stage after the ICO that investors are often hysteric about. What is going to happen next? As far as the Sudan Gold Coin project is concerned, it envisages incremental production of real gold from its Sudan plant. Once it starts producing gold, the same will be distributed among the investors to the extent of their investment. It is envisaged that the value of each coin which is 0.05 grams of gold during the ICO will continue to climb as the tokens would appreciate in value through quarterly distribution of physical gold mined through this plant. If you want to lay your hands on the gold physically, you can do that. Otherwise, you can accumulate it electronically and sell during trading in crypto currency exchanges. So, you continue to earn since the tokens continue to appreciate in value through accumulation of real gold against each of them.  Guarantees That The Project Offer  Uncertainty is the only certainty in financial market, let alone the crypto currency environment. On any given day Bitcoin as well as other crypto currencies may experience extreme volatility in valuation. It is really difficult to keep a tab on your investment portfolio in such a situation. However, Sudan Gold Coin promises to be different. The ICO is different in its perspective of the future. It has built some promises into it.  · Gold mining promise  As you invest in the ICO and buy tokens, the project owes you 0.05 grams of Gold for every token. What is more, the company is obliged to mine at least that amount of gold before expiry of first 10 months of the ICO.  · Instant Profit  You can make instant profit since each token from the ICO is worth 0.05 grams of Gold. However, the price of gold in the market is higher. So you can make instant profit.  · The Promise Of Price  After the first phase of distribution of gold is over, the demand for tokens is bound to increase. People would like to acquire such tokens since there is a build in system of more gold being mined against each currency. This itself would provide the required impetus to the tokens and their price would increase. There is likely to be a dramatic rise in demand for Sudan Gold Coin leading to rise in its price.  · Security  The tokens issued against investment in the ICO are safely stored with a Swiss Company called Netarc AG. FINMA, the official Swiss regulatory authority, is due to grant legal permission to the Sudan Gold Coin company to conduct its ICO after going through the Project in detail and conducting an audit of it. So the safety of your investment is more or less guaranteed by an internationally recognized authority. In fact, it is protected by Swiss regulation.  · The promise of gold  While your investment is safe as SGC tokens in Switzerland, your money is working to mine gold in far-away Sudan. Even the site for the gold mining plant is given by the Government of Sudan.  · Safe deposit of gold  Even the mined gold is safely deposited in Dubai. You can also request for physical delivery of the gold from Dubai. If you need to sell them, they can do it for you.",False

And we will do it! Thank you, our community, for being with us at all stages of this journey. We know that our project is not perfect, because hasn’t started under the patronage of a bank or a “shadow” leader. We really started this project as a team of enthusiasts with certain knowledge and connections, and were able to achieve results what others could not. We understand the possible negative behavior from the part of community and will make all possible efforts to justify your trust, because this project has become not just our work, but a part of our life. And our team is happy to go online every morning and move towards our goals. This project will be successful, thus making a breakthrough in the world of cryptocurrency and ICO platforms.

As it is said on CoinTelegraph: “In the last 12 months, the ICO market has shown a fluctuating trend, reaching two peaks, both for the number of ICOs and total capital raised: in December 2017 and March 2018. Afterwards, the amount of resources gathered by ICOs began to decline, in spite of the temporary recovery in June 2018. Nevertheless, the number of ICOs launched during the last year is above the value of September 2017, with a trend often diverging from capitalization. This movement implies a reduction of the average availability of resources per ICO.” It means that an average investor is getting more and more educated and cautious when we’re talking about ICO investment. And SGC team thinks that it’s good. Because people are starting to trust not to bright colors and promises, but facts, legal documents, detailed descriptions and reports. This is the ICO version 2018, and this where SGC is going to shine. Having already made agreements with Sudanese Government, successfully processing with FINMA, SGC is going full steam ahead. Because the next year will be a year of great changes for ICOs and for cryptocurrencies. And everyone should be ready for it.",False

That means that from now on we do have a legal background and legally approved plans for the future. But it also means a few external updates that should be made in order to keep everything in legal borders. These changes will not affect the basic project mechanics, but will update them and make our project more secured and safe, but at the same time will help us not to intrude in our investors’ personal lifes.  SGC Project has already started the creation of a huge platform, which will include info, charts, news and analytics of different minerals. Gold will be the first one included in this platform. Each SGC token holder would be able to use the functionality of this platform on a free basis, but you can also use your SGC tokens for “premium” functions such as deepened analytics, banner ads, etc. Also one of the features of the platform is the ability to purchase minerals on this platform. And, as you might guess, the gold, mined on SGC Sudanese facility, weighet and accounted via our unique blockchain solution, will be available for exchanging for SGC tokens.  This way of cooperation between SGC and our supporters is the most secured and will not affect our community’s life in legal terms. So this is the best solution, suggested to us by our Swiss legal partners in order not to just only keep the project basics, but to improve them.

Depreciation and swings in value have added to a sense of instability in crypto currency market. Yet, there are some new and promising ICOs in the market which appear as a beacon at the end of a dark tunnel. The ICO brought by Sudan Gold Coin seems to be one of those. It offers an opportunity for crypto traders to hedge the risk of crypto trading. The lure of physical gold has been aptly capitalized by this ICO. It may just be your once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make it big in crypto contribution. The unique thing about this ICO is that if offers a kind of guarantee without explicitly mentioning the same. The mute point of this ICO is that it has conceived a unique platform. It is a blockchain-in-mining platform that can make the life of mining companies easier. It can vastly increase security and transparency in weighing and accounting process of minerals. The subscribers can purchase gold through this platform and the gold for that purpose will also be mined by the company. They have not only conceived a gold mining plant, but have even got the land for the plant from the Sudan government for that purpose through a concession agreement. As investors subscribe to the project, they are issued with tokens. Through some time they will have the ability to exchange these tokens for a real gold or to use them for certain platforms’ priveleges. The built-in system ensures that the amount of gold is mined, accounted and reserved for each SGC token holders’ account and kept in a vault in Dubai. As more and more subscribers decides to support the project, the demand for tokens is slated to increase. This will definitely pull up the price of the tokens. As the price of tokens increases there is an automatic need for mining more gold against each token. As more gold and mineral is mined, part of it is proportionally distributed to the number of tokens in their possession. Blockchain technology will help the project keep a tab on the entire mining and distribution process. Such distribution will take place quarterly. Subscribers can hoard their tokens, use them for premium functionality, exchange them for gold or sell them on cryptocurrency exchanges. It is entirely the choice of subscribers. The project is also drawing up plans for a Minerals Coin Chart. The legal team has spelt out that this chart should be incorporated in the ICO process itself. Through this chart subscribers can also get general news about mining, mineral price charts and other information that will help them decide about hoarding, selling or exchanging tokens.  Present Status • The founders aim to get the FINMA green light for the project. FINMA is the Swiss Financial Market Supervisor Authority which regulates the financial market. Getting the FINMA go ahead involves a lot of legal dwellings. So the founders are now busy in implementing the opinions spelt out by legal audit to meet FINMA standards. • The legal audit has spelt out some changes in the project description and distribution. Even after implementing the terms spelt out by the legal team this is still a project involving gold as its basic asset. So, basically there is no change in the terms of investment or security. • Each token holder can exchange his gold for gold at prevailing gold-to-token rate. However, he has to go through a KYC procedure for this. The token is one utility coin for gold storing, trading as well as exchanging. • To implement all the terms spelt out by the legal audit, the project founders have pushed back the closing date of the ICO to January 31, 2019. The time is needed to meet all the legal requirements before closing the ICO. It also needs to create a prototype platform, contact various exchanges and make agreements with them and have a complete project to abide by FINMA regulation. • The security for the project is ensured by a Swiss company, Netarc AG. All the funds and resources are placed with this company in Switzerland whereas the gold mined in Sudan and is stored in Dubai. It ensures going by FINMA regulations as well as security both of the funds and gold.

The Sudanese President Omer al-Bashir has arrived in Beijing on Saturday to participate in the China-Africa Cooperation Forum (FOCAC). During his meeting with al-Bashir on Sunday, Xi Jinping said his country appreciates the harsh economic conditions that Sudan continued to suffer since the secession of South Sudan.  “China would cooperate with Sudan to overcome these difficulties and challenges,” said Xi Jinping according to the official news agency SUNA He pointed out that they would consider extending the grace period on China’s debt to Sudan, saying his government is keen to remove obstacles and create favourable conditions for cooperation between the two countries.",False

It may not be an exaggeration to say so. Among all the arguments about crypto being good, bad or ugly for the financial market, this one ICO by Sudan Gold Coin may be a breeze of fresh air. It is an offer that few crypto enthusiasts would miss. It is a new ICO project called Sudan Gold Coin. The hallmark of this project is that there is an element of guarantee in it. Though guarantee is a very rare find in financial market, let alone crypto, you can get it here to some extent. An Element Of Physicality To Crypt Investment •   Most crypto projects project high returns on the basis of perceptions about valuation of their tokens or coins. They lack the element of physicality in their projection. •   The ICO launched by Sudan Gold Coin helps investors to channelize their crypto coins into production and acquisition of physical gold. The project not only multiplies your money, but also lets you make use of liquid money in physical as well as digital worlds. •   What is very unique here is that the project adds an element of tangibility to your crypto investment. The project envisages that crypto coins that you invest would be used to establish a gold-mining plant in Sudan. Even the land for the mining plant has been granted to the project by the Sudanese Government through a Concession Agreement. The Next Stage In The Project So, what happens next, after the ICO is over! This is the question that most investors ask. The project envisages that once the plant starts producing gold, real gold would be distributed to the investors in proportion to their investment in Sudan Gold Coins. Though all Sudan Gold Coins bought during the ICO will have an assigned value of 0.05 grams of gold, the tokens would continue to increase in weight through quarterly and proportionate distribution of mined gold. You can obtain the gold physically, accumulate it electronically or sell it while trading the tokens in cryptocurrency market. So the SGC project allows you to earn in two ways - through crypto-trading and production of real gold. Promises Built Into The System Promises are very hard to keep in financial market since uncertainty is the keyword here. The crypto currency market is even more unstable. With severe intra-day highs and lows in values of various crypto currencies, it is very difficult to keep a tab on your investment. The ICO by Sudan Gold Coin is different in its perspective. There are, in fact, few promises built into it. •   The Promise To Mine Gold As you buy SGCs from the project, the project becomes indebted to you to mine 0.05 grams of Gold for every coin that you invest in. There is even a timeline for that. They are obliged to mine that amount of gold within the first 10 months of the ICO.  •   The Promise Of Instant Profit Since each SGC equals 0.05 grams of Gold, you are buying gold at a price lower than the market price of Gold. So, you make instant profit.  •   The Promise Of Price Of Token It is estimated that as soon as the Sudan Gold Coin hits the crypto market, its price would increase. But this is neither an assumption nor a wild guess. It is anybody’s guess that a project of this stature and backed by real gold will start to get more attention when the investors start to get more and more gold against the same coins. So, after the first phase of proportionate gold distribution, there is bound to be a dramatic rise in demand for Sudan Gold Coin. Thus, the price of token is bound to increase and therein lies the promise.  •   The Promise Of Security The SGC tokens that you invest in are stored safely with Netarc AG, a Swiss Company. This is the parent company of the Project. The official Swiss regulatory organization, FINMA, is in the process of granting legal permission to this company to conduct the SGC ICO after they complete the audit of the Project. So the promise of safety of your investment is promised by a national governmental authority. Your investment is under the protection of Swiss regulation and it is working in far-away Sudan in a gold mining plant, the site for which has been granted by the Government of Sudan. Can safety be any more credible in crypto investment?  •   The Promise Of Safe Deposit Of Gold Mined gold is kept in a safe deposit in Dubai. All your requests for physical delivery of gold is done from this location. They can even sell it for you if you so desire.  As Good As It Sounds Invest in Sudan Gold Coin and reap the benefits. •   Transform all your crypt coins into gold. •   Keep the mined real gold in a safe deposit vault in Dubai •   Continue to increase the value of coins with regular distribution and deposit of gold. •   Withdraw gold as and when you need them. Can it get better than this in crypto investment environment!",False

As you probably remember, it was announced earlier, that SGC team had initiated the Project Legal Audit, conducted by outside experts and focused on the analysis of Project documentation, structure and logistics. Having in mind the best interests of our investors, SGC team chose one of the most reputable legal auditing company in this area for this purpose: Brightman.io For those unaware: Brightman is a FinTech law firm with a key focus on providing legal solutions in Corporate, E-Commerce, Technology commercialization, Cryptocurrency, Seed & Venture financing, and Compliance practices. Today we are happy to announce that the audit results are being delivered, which timely correlates to the current stage of our project development. We do admire the fact that literally each day contributes into Project Maturity Level and delivers additional value, bringing us yet closer to Project’s successful realization! Engaging Brightman has proved to have been a smart move because of many reasons. One of them is the major reshaping of the structural architecture of the project, which they have suggested. In order to maximize ICO Security and Transparency, Brightma recommends to establish the company responsible for investment collection in Zug, Switzland. It does not exclude the earlier-announced Dubai legal entity from the Project design. Dubai entity will stay responsible for the DFI and operational activities in Sudan, while investors will directly cooperate with Swiss company under the protection of Swiss legal system. Currently Zug, an affluent Swiss municipality and town, provides an optimal for a new ICO combination, comprised of its tax framework, legal environment (extremely friendly towards crypto-currencies) and proven experience of crypto-business registration. On careful consideration of Brightman proposal, SGC team leaders have agreed to accept it, with the Swiss company planned to be established during the next few weeks. So, our congratulations on the considerably increased level of Project Transparency and Investment Security!

And indeed it is. But confidence does not arise out of nowhere, it is all thanks to our team members who work hard each and every day. In the Sudan, the project of the SGC caused an agiotage, thus, many experts expressed the desire to participate in it. However, there is one talent that participated in the project from the very beginning. And ""talent"" is not an empty word. Meet our chief mining engineer, Elhadi Mohammed. He is a man who has dedicated his entire life to gold mining and has achieved reputation in Sudan. For 25 years Elhadi took serious positions in the largest gold mining company of Sudan - Ariab Mining Company. What is also curious is that this company is a state company, thus, it complies with the maximum quality standards of mining procedures. Having worked in it for a quarter of a century, Elhadi retired with honor, but instead of deserved rest he decided to share his knowledge with others by opening his own consulting company. It was at this point that he became acquainted with the Sudan Gold Coin project, when it was still at the earliest stages of its development. Being an expert in geology and mining engineering, Elhadi was extremely important for the successful implementation of the project, so he was immediately invited to our team as one of the key experts in Sudan. Having extensive connections and knowledge, Elhadi regards the project with great enthusiasm and does everything for our projects' success. https://www.facebook.com/sudangmc/photos/a.337540716657385.1073741828.337179706693486/471902346554554/?type=3&theater",False

As opposed to physical currencies (even if it’s a global currency like the US dollar, the euro, or the pound sterling), it is only slightly affected by its market price fluctuations. It doesn’t how low is the currencies exchange rate - your golden investments will remain valuable even in the most critical international economic situation. One important question with golden investments is where to store them.  A dedicated storage must be available to you at all times and you must be able to exchange the gold for real money or get it in ingots. On the other hand, the storage must be extremely safe and reliable to exclude any possible scams. Moreover, the country where the storage is based must be in a stable political situation - you may lose all your savings if the local authorities suddenly decide to pass the gold expropriation law. You must also take care about access to the international market and your own capabilities to buy and sell gold stored in a certain dedicated place. All these requirements call for a reliable, protected governmental safe with full access for you and an ability to get your funds at any time. We never let our investors get scammed or lose money. That’s why we’ve chosen one of the top 3 countries with the most favorable conditions for holding precious metals (particularly, gold) to store the mined gold. Currently, the top 3 is London, Hong Kong, and Dubai. Our pick is Dubai because that’s where the state authorities offer the most profitable conditions for foreign investors. Particularly, there is a duty-free zone in Dubai, with the help of which you can get your gold without having to pay any fees. Generally speaking, Dubai is sometimes called the ‘City of Gold’. Consider how ultra fast it turned from a humble port in the Persian Gulf into the world-renowned business center with jaw-dropping real estate prices. The latter can be explained by the fact that Dubai is positioned as a place where all gold traders gather. There, you can meet suppliers from the most gold-rich places on the planet (countries of Africa, mostly) as well as potential buyers. Notice also that in 2003 alone, the annual turnover of the Dubai market comprised only $6 billion; in the last few years, however, the numbers have been steadily reaching a $75 billion mark. Basically, the tax exempt status of Dubai makes this country one of the cheapest places for gold purchase in the world. The reputation of Dubai as a center of golden trade strengthens by day. On top of local investors, the Emirate has been attracting foreign investors looking for an ability to buy gold at reasonable prices or to store part of their precious metals abroad since the early 2000s. A necessity for safe storages appeared due to such a tendency. Recent changes in the regulation of the European banking center made ultrasafe personal storages all the more demanded while traditional storages available in many countries of Western Europe are steadily losing both potential and existing customers. The reason being the increase in interest rates for storing services. The Dubai storage is the safest place to hold investor gold with an ability to withdraw or sell it at any time!",False

However, everything becomes much more significant when something you are investing in is also really useful to the people it was made for initially. The Sudan Gold Coin project is more than a source of passive income for our investors. For the people of Sudan, it is an excellent opportunity to get a new, extensive transport infrastructure and acquire constant access to technical and potable water due to the expansion of the central water supply system. Our each and every investor makes a precious contribution to the establishment of Sudan as a developed country, which was initiated with the cancelation of the USA sanctions that had previously restricted trading relations of Sudan with other countries. Local authorities very invitingly accepted the fact that we want to help develop the country with our business, instead of solely making our investors richer. After successful negotiations with Sudanese government representatives, we have been provided with utterly profitable terms of cooperation; we are allowed and licensed to extract gold on the dedicated location up until 2023, with an ability to then prolong the license until 2033. Consider the fact that other foreign companies only managed to get as much as 70% of total profit – isn’t our deal an ultimate success? As for Sudan, the country is finally beginning to increase GDP and enhance external economic relations (again, mostly to the canceled USA sanctions). Such tendencies are leading the country well along the way to enrich the governmental budget and create optimal conditions for the further growth of Sudan. Especially, considering the extremely rich with minerals Sudanese soil. Generally speaking, the Sudanese government plans something truly huge. In particular, they are planning to leave the ’third countries of the world’ list. That’s exactly why Sudanese authorities are interested in foreign companies’ projects (like ours) aimed at acquiring a stable-performance investment source. But that’s not all. Unfortunately, due to the current inconsistency of most businesses based in Sudan, manual labor, mostly, isn’t automated there, which often provokes danger to a human life during manufacture. The Sudanese government is aimed at fixing this situation, but many years are required to purchase all equipment for all manufactures owned both by the government and Sudanese entrepreneurs. We are planning to involve the people of Sudan in the extraction of gold, but also give them professional, safe equipment – bulldozers, drilling outfits, measuring devices, etc. Due to such an approach, hundreds of Sudanese people will get new job positions with decent salaries and safe labor conditions.

As I said before, good things take time, real sector is not something you can do with a flick of a finger it takes time, a lot of work and dedication.

As it was reported by Kevin Rooke, who had taken the statistics from Coinmetrics: “Bitcoin has reached more tx volume than global gold markets since early 2017. BTC: on pace to process $1.1 trillion in 2018 transactions Gold: on pace to process $0.4 trillion in 2018 transactions” And we think that this info is not surprising. At all times gold was a way to retain and hold your capital, thus — it was often kept withheld statically under protection. Bitcoin, in turn, was designed as a dynamic currency for quick and secured trading operations. We are witnessing a new era of currency where money (and other valuable things) are becoming more and more dynamic, flowing through the world via fast payment systems, credit cards and, of course, cryptocurrency transactions. When the whole world is becoming more and more developed, it needs something for fast and secured transfer of values. But the Gold is outside of this system, it never gets old. It is a proven method of securing your savings.

Gold at all times was a static asset, it was accumulated by individual people and entire countries. Gold helped the countries to provide the budget, was its reinforcement and procuring. There were wars for gold and its extraction was always associated with risks, including the risks of theft, both at the production stage and during the transportation. Naturally, only a few companies are allowed to transport gold and safely keep it. Therefore, the world turnover of gold is a rare phenomenon, not only because its transportation from one point of the world to another is a risky thing, but also because not so many countries would voluntarily agree to exchange gold assets in large quantities. For a quick exchange of finances, a fiat currency was created, as well as multiple exchange systems. The good old credit systems like Visa and MasterCard is a perfect example of this moment. However, even with the creation of global banking systems that allow us to move ourassets throughout the world, the issue of time and anonymity has not been completely resolved. It was at this point when the crypto-currencies entered the game. Anonymous transactions allowed anyone to quickly transfer a staggering amount of assets by using just a simple smartphone. And, at the same time, any turn of finances in any of the cryptocurrency networks can be tracked, thus, everything is both anonymous and seemingly protected. Why seemingly? Because not everything is as smooth with cryptocurrencies as they tell you, in fact, there are a few dissapointings. First — they are not provided with anything. In this regard, there is a high risk of losing part of your assets as the rate of the most of cryptocurrencies depends only on Demand Offer factor. What’s even worse, the risk of being hacked, deceived by people using loopholes in the algorithm of a certain crypto currency is very high. As a result, you can be left with nothing. It would seem that gold and crypto-currency are two faces of the same coin. Reliability and time-proven factor (however, the impossibility of rapid asset transfer at least without some serious legal procedures) on the one hand, and speed of transactions, anonymity (however, riskiness of such operations) on the other.  The Sudan Gold Soin project was created in order to solve these issues and give the world a fundamentally new cryptocurrency, backed by real gold. Now, each user has two radically different options: you can quickly and effectively trade your tokens on exchanges, while being confident in their rate, because each SGC token is provided with real gold. Or you can decide to keep your assets and multiply them, because with each distribution of mined gold, the “golden weight”, and consequently, the price of each token will also grow with time. At the same time, you can still sell the part of your already grown tokens on the exchanges… or you can even exchange them for real, physical gold. For this you will only need to provide a proof of ownership of the account in our system and a unique certificate specially generated for you. Until then, your gold will be safely stored in a vault in Dubai under the patronage of the Swiss company and will bring you profit for your one-time investment every day. Sudan Gold Soin is the currency of the future. And the future will come very soon … https://sudangm.com",False

It is only reasonable to invest in something that is guaranteed to bring profit. However, everything becomes much more significant when something you are investing in is also really useful to the people it was made for initially.  The Sudan Gold Coin project is more than a source of passive income for our investors. For the people of Sudan, it is an excellent opportunity to get a new, extensive transport infrastructure and acquire constant access to technical and potable water due to the expansion of the central water supply system. Our each and every investor makes a precious contribution to the establishment of Sudan as a developed country, which was initiated with the cancelation of the USA sanctions that had previously restricted trading relations of Sudan with other countries.  Local authorities very invitingly accepted the fact that we want to help develop the country with our business, instead of solely making our investors richer. After successful negotiations with Sudanese government representatives, we have been provided with utterly profitable terms of cooperation; we are allowed and licensed to extract gold on the dedicated location up until 2023, with an ability to then prolong the license until 2033. Consider the fact that other foreign companies only managed to get as much as 70% of total profit — isn’t our deal an ultimate success?  As for Sudan, the country is finally beginning to increase GDP and enhance external economic relations (again, mostly to the canceled USA sanctions). Such tendencies are leading the country well along the way to enrich the governmental budget and create optimal conditions for the further growth of Sudan. Especially, considering the extremely rich with minerals Sudanese soil. Generally speaking, the Sudanese government plans something truly huge. In particular, they are planning to leave the ’third countries of the world’ list. That’s exactly why Sudanese authorities are interested in foreign companies’ projects (like ours) aimed at acquiring a stable-performance investment source.  But that’s not all. Unfortunately, due to the current inconsistency of most businesses based in Sudan, manual labor, mostly, isn’t automated there, which often provokes danger to a human life during manufacture. The Sudanese government is aimed at fixing this situation, but many years are required to purchase all equipment for all manufactures owned both by the government and Sudanese entrepreneurs.  We are planning to involve the people of Sudan in the extraction of gold, but also give them professional, safe equipment — bulldozers, drilling outfits, measuring devices, etc. Due to such an approach, hundreds of Sudanese people will get new job positions with decent salaries and safe labor conditions. This factor additionally boosts the interest of the Sudanese government in the further development of our project.  The Sudanese authorities realize that the successful implementation of the Sudan Gold Coin project will attract new foreign business owners to cooperate with the country.
