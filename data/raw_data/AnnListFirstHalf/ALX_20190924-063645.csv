One with the Eth address in a compressed password protected file and another with the JSON MEW file. Since they were deleted over 30 days ago (probably 31), I can't recover it from Dropbox. I even upgraded to the paid Dropbox plan, since they keep deleted files for longer, but that did not work.  From what I remember, I normally copy and paste password protected private keys files out of my Dropbox to the Desktop, for security reasons. To not have my private key unencrypted in my Dropbox, which in theory could potentially be access by someone at the company, or if someone else gets access to my Dropbox. Both highly unlikely. I must have simply moved it to the desktop, instead of copy and pasted it. So trying to be extra careful created an extra point of failure.  Another thing that I do is backup all of my files to an external hard drive, so I'm running undelete software on it. It's currently scanning it, and it's going to take 14 hours to scan each sector of the hard drive. Hopefully, since the files are less than one kilobyte, they were not written over by new files added since it was last saved there.  It's almost like a curse. Because like I mentioned earlier, I also have it saved on a page with all my Eth addresses, but for some bizarre reason this ALAX one only has the address but not the private key. So the one address that gets lost does not have the private key. It’s got to be a curse.",False

So that will make the difference. Everything is on the blockchain so you can check it by yourself (We also had two minor participants who decided that they do not want to make their KYC and want a refund). The final coefficient has been calculated after all these unprocessed and reclamation payments had been done and people who didn't make their KYC and didn't ask for a refund have their ALX tokens frozen until they make their KYC (They cannot ask for a refund anymore so this coefficient and number of tokens you got will stay the same forever now - no more changes).",False

Participants get all the unclaimed tokens based on their TGE stake. So eg. if there will be just two participants and one buys one token and second three tokens, all remaining tokens will be divided among them in 1:3 ratio. -> This means that participants WON'T LOSE but WIN. Since the TGE is only 30 % of all tokens and if the 10 % would be burned - it would mean that ALAX team would have a stronger position and bigger share - 70:20 instead of 70:30. So thanks to not burning - participants will get more tokens but with the same value so it does not have any negative effect on their investment since their TGE share will be the same but they will have a bigger share of the whole cake. We decided to take this path because we think it is fairer to the investors and the circulation supply will be bigger.",False

By making a joint venture there is a huge time-saving effect since we do not need to create a whole new blockchain or marketing the product to new users. We will already have users from day one. The second thing is the system of two tokens. It maybe looks complicated and unnecessary at first but when you will think about it, you realize how it is important for the future success of the project. Many projects have only one volatile token and you have to buy it on crypto exchange and this is something what will ordinary non-crypto people never do. They just want to buy games. They don't want to get bothered by some bitcoin, private key, and exchange and transfer fees. They would never go this way. and won't force them.

We do not see them as a competitor since the segment of the market they are focusing on is PC and console games and ALAX si focusing on mobile games and apps. On the other hand, there are small similarities for the usage of the tokens (used by players and by developers, rewarding players for playing games) but even there are a lot of differences such as gamer won't be able to change ALA for fiat but developers will, we also have a two kind of tokens to ensure more stability - ALX will be tradable on exchanges but ALA will have fixed price to FIAT (CRC will be volatile).  I would say that we taking into consideration that a lot of gamers and developers are not a part of the crypto community (and probably don't want to be) and our project is trying to solve the existing problem without forcing people to get involved into the crypto word. They will be able to buy ALA tokens without even knowing that there is an ALX token on some cryptoexchange or anything (but we will reward them if they do). CRC token is forcing everybody to get involved in crypto trading and or pay a fee for not doing so.  So to sum it up. There are some similarities but there is definitely a lot of differences and the main one is the approach to customers (gamers, developers, and crypto investors).",False

The project is a collaboration between DECENT and Dragonfly, a well established distribution platform for gaming apps.  ALAX’s blockchain-driven platform for games and apps is powered by DCore, DECENT’s proprietary blockchain technology and platform. As an integral part of the DECENT ecosystem, the technology boasts fast transactions, low fees, DPOS, and more, which will be utilized by ALAX. Purchases within the new platform, as well as the small fees for miners, will be fueled by DECENT’s crypto token DCT.  ALAX will take advantage of one of the main components of DCore which gives users the ability to create their own custom tokens based on DCT, similar to what ERC20 tokens do for Ethereum. While there are a number of ways to use custom tokens, for ALAX, these tokens will behave just like credit used in mobile payment processing, providing a familiar user experience for ALAX customers while at the same time enabling instant and direct payment settlement for developers and publishers on their platform....",False
