One question, are elocoins the same as elotokens? I see on your website that you get 50 elocoins for registering an account. Further you can buy 100 elocoins for 1 usd, which is cheaper than the elotokens for sale during the ICO.  Can you let me know what the relation between those two is? Next to that, how can people buy elotokens after the ICO, do they need to buy them on an exchange directly or will you make some GUI that allows them to buy these tokens on the exchange via your website?  And how much is raised during the pre-ICO?  Thanks in advance.",False

That's two different things.  Here's info from Eloplay whitepaper: At the moment, the main accounting unit and reward for the players is the virtual points called Elocoins. Elocoins are centralized and have a fixed exchange rate (1 Elocoin = $0,01). Elocoin is used for payment purposes and for rewarding tournament winners. It was implemented as method of work with fiat money. Having Elocoin onboard allowed the team to test some of our hypotheses.  With time Elocions will be removed from the platform and Eloplay will use only tokens.  Apart from classic pre-ICO, Eloplay had order book for early token orders. $200,000 were raised during that stage.  Thank  you for your questions.",False

How will platform define a winner - with help of a specific algorithm or an AI? Typically we use game's API's for that. For instance Counter Strike give you very specific and detailed information on game results and player statistics. We also have a tournament API from Riot (a developer of League of Legends) which is also used for that purpose.   2. Let's imagine a Dota 2 team has won a smart-tournament. As a reward, the team has received, for instance, 213 tokens. How will be these 3 tokens allocated among the players? Now team competitions work with clans. And you gather 5 players for a game as a clan leader. When you win  tokens are sent to a clan account. And clean leader decides whether to distribute them among the players of leave on clan account for future tournaments.",False
