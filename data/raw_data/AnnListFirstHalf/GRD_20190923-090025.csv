With cryptocurrency thefts on the rise - and users’ anonymity routinely infringed upon – it is only natural that owners of digital assets feel increasingly concerned about their possessions. Diamond Guard is a personal device to protect your cryptocurrency, while also providing a safe interface for operations with it. The device can also be used as a VPN node to ensure user's anonymity and protect him or her from hacking attacks.    3 Things That Make Diamond Guard Special:  It is convenient to use Diamond Guard can be connected to other devices via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Our device supports a screen interface to visualize operations, including cryptocurrency transfers.  It is virtually invulnerable to identity thefts and hacking attacks Diamond Guard uses multifactor authentication system including hardware, digital and biometric mechanisms to protect owner’s assets. Additional controls also force user to press a special button on the device to confirm vital transactions or when accessing private keys.    It ensures user’s anonymity Diamond Guard allows owner to create decentralized VPN connection disguised as SSL/http traffic. Using VPN also guarantees user’s protection from man-in-the-middle attacks.    http://s018.radikal.ru/i519/1711/45/5a055df15d87.jpg  ICO DETAILS  We are planning to launch ICO in January.
