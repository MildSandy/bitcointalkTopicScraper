Our interest was in exploring opportunities in cryptocurrency markets, with the goal of exploiting various market inefficiencies to generate steady absolute returns (not correlated with market movements) with low volatility or simply put, steady profit without major drawdowns. We have already developed and tested a set of automated trading algorithms and have run them on the real exchanges. We have a fast and reliable infrastructure to execute our algorithms. Our current returns are over 25% per month.  More information can be found on our website: http://www.TensorBox.com (in Japanese: http://www.TensorBox.com/jp ; in Korean: http://www.TensorBox.com/kr)  Our Edge: -Combination of statistical arbitrage strategies and market-making strategies with extremely low holding periods that deliver absolute returns not affected by market direction -Our cutting-edge geographically distributed IT infrastructure for monitoring market anomalies and shifts in statistical patterns with microsecond delays -Lightning-fast order execution -Proprietary risk management models and optimal capital allocation are at the core of our trading methodology -Quantitative alpha models that generate trading signals based on statistical machine-learning and numerical optimization methods -Order execution models based on optimal stochastic control and reinforcement learning  Examples of our trading strategies Description of our trading system  Details of ITO-1 Crowdfunding starts: Oct 02nd 2017 Crowdfunding ends: Oct 16th, 2017 or until the maximum cap is reached Maximum cap: $0.5 mln Minimum cap: $0.2 mln Currency accepted: ETH and BTC Token price: 1 TBX = 1 USD Bonuses: Early Bird Promotion: during the first 24hrs tokens will be sold at 20% discount to our subscribers (only first 100 k tokens). Pre-registration is required. See below. There will be no other bonuses or bounties Token distribution process: tokens will be distributed after the end of crowdfunding, a number of tokens received by crowdfunding participant will be calculated by the following formula: Number of Tokens = “contribution in ETH” * “ETH to USD exchange rate” * (1 + “bonuses”), where “ETH to USD exchange” is the exchange rate on Bitfinex at the end of crowdfunding. Same formula applies for BTC No more tokens will be issued after that point. If the minimum cap is not reached, all the contributions will be refunded.  The collected sum will be used for: further project development ($100k or 20% if the Max Cap is reached) forming a trading pool (up to $400k or 80% of collected funds is the Max Cap is reached).  Each TBX token holder has rights to: -his share of trading profit: every month 20% management fee will be taken from the net profit (using the high watermark principle); 50% of the trading profit will be distributed to token holders in ETH; 30% remain undistributed to grow the trading pool (to gain compounding interest in future) -withdraw any amount up to his total share of the trading pool by sending us TBX tokens once a month after 6 months from the end of ITO-1. -receive 30% of profit earned by Tensor Box (from 20% management fee) as monthly coupon payments, until the total sum covers $150k ($100k taken for the further project development + $50k premium)  The token value will be updated weekly, based on our trading performance:  -total US$ amount of funds in the trading pool will be published weekly; -total number of issued tokens remains constant; -value of 1 token= (total US$ amount of funds in the trading pool)/(total number of tokens issued)  In 1Q 2018 we are planning to run ITO-2: new tokens will be issued under the new terms: Tensor Box is collecting 2% of the initial deposit as a management fee + 30% of net profit as a performance fee.

Fair point regarding the website It's being updated and soon you'll see the new verion..with our photos. As for LinkedIn, it's actually banned in Russia (because they store personal data outside Russia or something like that). And while it's still possible to use it via VPN, it's not popular here at all. Me (George) and Rinat had LinkedIn accounts many years ago while it was still available but we're not using it at all. Vadim had his entire career in London, working for various Investment Banks (Royal Bank of Scotland and ING) as a trader so he's the only one who actually uses it - https://www.linkedin.com/in/vadim-kuchinskiy-8178164/ and here's Dmitry's profile - https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitryshalagin/  As for WP, it will be released shortly, as mentioned on our website. But you can find details on what we do in our blog on Medium: https://medium.com/tensorbox. I'll publish more ""technical"" (or rather ""mathematical"") article about our trading algorithms tomorrow. Feel free to suggest ideas for the upcoming articles!  And if you have any questions, I'll gladly answer them here.",False

But I do have some questions.  In your white paper you write:   Could you elaborate more on the empirical evidence? Is it available online? Is your own research?  Crypto markets should get more efficient as they mature, do you think your expected returns will get lower as the markets get more efficient? Do you think there will be a point in the future where there are insufficient market inefficiencies for your trading strategy?",False

On our main page we posted 2 very good examples: cross-exchange spreads and bid-ask spread on one exchange.  Quote Crypto markets should get more efficient as they mature, do you think your expected returns will get lower as the markets get more efficient? Do you think there will be a point in the future where there are insufficient market inefficiencies for your trading strategy?  Our trading results in narrowing spread, for example. So yes, we do expect that markets get more mature and returns won't be that enormous. Still even in the most mature and liquid markets inefficiencies exist, thats why quant funds like Renaissance Technologies show something like 30%+ returns net of fees managing $50+bln portfolios. Of course they are the best of the best, but also competition on traditional markets is much tougher. Arbitrage opportunities exist even on the most liquid and mature markets, it is possible to arbitrage EUR-USD but margins are tiny and opportunities exist only fractions of a second.",False

We've shown it's possible to capitalize on market inefficiencies, without making directional bets on the price of certain coins. We make money by providing liquidity, making markets more efficient and each volatility spike opens up new opportunities for us.   But the performance of two trading strategies based on exact same signals may vary greatly, depending on the execution algorithms. Our new article shows basic framework that we use to optimize our algorithms: https://medium.com/tensorbox/stochastic-optimal-control-and-optimization-of-trading-algorithms-4011269a9aea   If you like our approach and want to invest in quant trading strategies that generate steady income without drawdowns, you can contribute in our ITO until Oct, 16th 2017. Dividends will be paid monthly. We take effectively 0% management fee and 20% performance fee based on the high watermark, which means we only get paid if we make you money. After that, we'll be managing money at 2% management fee+30% performance fee.   Contribute before Oct 16th, before the 0+20 fee structure is gone forever!
