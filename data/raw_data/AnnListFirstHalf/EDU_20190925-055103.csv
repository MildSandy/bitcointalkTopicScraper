They are building their blockchain smart contract technology on top of an existing blockchain, namely Ethereum, using ERC20 tokenization mechanics. LiveEdu is using similar blockchain smart contract mechanics to what Steemit uses. They are building for the online education market what Steemit built for online publishing. They use EDU blockchain smart contracts in their network for payments and rewards. In about three years, after they have fully built out our external ecosystem, they will build their own protocol blockchain and migrate from the Ethereum protocol.  The LiveEdu ecosystem consists of two networks, namely the internal ecosystem and the external ecosystem. The internal ecosystem participants are project creators (content creators), viewers (learners), community moderators, project quality moderators, and LiveEdu API application developers.

Quote from: chocopapaya on December 01, 2017, 09:03:15 PM I have been trying to find information on this but haven't been able to.  Is there any update on the bounty program since the ICO is delayed? Will the distribution be the same or will there be a reward for the extra work those have put in that have joined from the beginning?  Thanks!  Could you please be so kind an answer.

Now there is no place for some serious discussion about your ico.All we can see Is links lol  No, there is and they are answered. what did you want to ask? Just ask.  And, you don´t answer question, I asked you 2 times at old bounty thread, 2 times here and also PM, you just ignore this question, answering something completely different.  I will repeat question: ICO postponed for 2 months. Are you going to pay bounty hunters same amount for 2 months extra job? It is not fair.    Quote from: Wapinter on 21 October 2017, 01:49:00 You will be awarded ""stakes"" for each task you successfully complete in each pool. Two weeks after the end of the ICO (15th December 2017) the entire value of the pool will be distributed to the stakeholders based on the number of stakes they hold. i.e. someone with 1000 stakes will get exactly double the amount that someone with 500 stakes will get.

Have you all considered including commercial training applications? There's big market potential in providing services like that to private companies. Most quality training content producers have slow development life-cycles that sometimes don't agree with fast paced business environments. Your project seems like it could carve out some good market shares in that industry.  Anyway, good luck and can't wait to see how this develops!",False

I am not fully understand  I saw that ICO is postponed till 15Jan2018, what does it mean for us - bounty hunters ? Will bounty campaign run till end of ICO - 10 Feb? So that means 10Feb + 2 weeks = 24 Feb?  Quote from: Wapinter on 21 October 2017, 01:49:00  You will be awarded ""stakes"" for each task you successfully complete in each pool. Two weeks after the end of the ICO (15th December 2017) the entire value of the pool will be distributed to the stakeholders based on the number of stakes they hold. i.e. someone with 1000 stakes will get exactly double the amount that someone with 500 stakes will get.   How should we act with social media campaign - should we make same job till 10Feb2018 for a same bounty pool?

The total supply is limited by the ether hard cap of $8M. As soon as this is reached the public sale will be closed automatically. This approach avoids minting tokens and then having to burn a ton of tokens like Kick, Tokencard and Etherdesign have to do. Depending on bonuses, we expect it to be ca. 250 million EDU tokens.  https://tokensale.liveedu.tv/faq/faq-questions/",False

LiveEdu is building the YouTube for online education. You can also describe the ecosystem as the next-generation Lynda.com. Unlike existing online education platforms, LiveEdu is not focused on beginners, but mainly intermediates to experts. People learn on LiveEdu by watching how peers build real projects and can also download all project resources and files. The new LiveEdu platform is set to launch in 2018 and will start with eight topics: Artificial intelligence, Cybersecurity, Game Development, Data Science, Cryptocurrencies, Programming, Design, Augmented and Virtual Reality. Project creators in the LiveEdu ecosystem will build 10,000 projects for these topics. LiveEdu plans to also cover projects in Chinese and Russian language.   Our product is available in our network either as live stream or video. We are starting with the 8 topics Artificial intelligence, Cybersecurity, Game Development, Data Science, Cryptocurrencies, Programming, Design, Augmented and Virtual Reality. In 2019 our network will be opened for all topics. Our users come from the US, China, Korea, Japan, Europe, Russia and South America.    Main Sale Date: January 15, 2018 at 5pm UTC  Link to our Smart Contract on Github is Here    Our team is available on our Telegram chat for Q&A:      The LiveEdu marketplace is a classic model that is highly suitable for blockchain smart contract tokenization. The blockchain will  decentralize key product development decisions that are made on both the supply and demand side.  Tokenization is a key approach LiveEdu plans to use to solve its chicken-and-egg marketplace problem by incentivizing early premium project creators with a mix of EDU tokens and cash. Tokenization also enables LiveEdu to launch a native payment currency which is deeply embedded into the product and used for all payment transactions.            LiveEdu does NOT compete directly with existing online learning platforms as it is focused on practical tutorial projects (project-based learning) and users who have passed the beginner stage. Compared to the indirect competitors like Lynda, Pluralsight and Udemy: LiveEdu does not have expensive content production cost (< $500 per project). Premium project completion speed on LiveEdu is faster  (< 1 month). LiveEdu uses only project-based learning. Real practical tutorial projects. Real production level work. Learners  watch how to build a complete product. Interactive Q&A chat to discuss things in real time. LiveEdu is a peer-to-peer marketplace (decentralized) which gives it access to a bigger content creator pool.    LiveEdu is led by founder and CEO Dr. Michael J. Garbade. Our core team members are the same since launch; Alex Zhukov, and Ilya Toka.  We are a young team of business guys, educators, backend engineers, frontend developers and tech marketers with work experience from Amazon, General Electric, Photobucket, Rebate Networks, Lashou and Mail.ru.    The tokens are minted post ICO. The total supply will be determined after the ICO is completed and all bonuses have been accounted for. There is a hard cap of USD$10M for all contribution types. The total token supply is limited by the hard cap. As soon as the hard cap is reached the ICO closes.
