After all, the message ""Payments on the bounty completed"" is dated November 12, and complaints of non-payment were sent earlier than this deadline, that is quite logical.  About another ones, you can also read above an explanation - ""Despite the fact that softcap was not assembled we paid a bounty to those who followed the updates of the branch and followed the instructions.""  ""Followed the instruction"" is the main phrase. Every bounty has some rules that participants must adhere. And every bounty has a right not to pay if even one rule is violated.

Instead of following rules to get your rewards you are still trying to hurt us. Politics in Russia is a dirty thing. And when you're doing your job you're receiving such dirt in tabloids. As it was explained earlier police and municipals stopped an attempt to steal government property. Criminals tried to influence the investigation with such publications. It did not help them. Max and his team have improved rating from 49 to 10th place comparing all municipal regions just in 2 years. So Max got a gratitude from the governor of Moscow region and proposal to work in the government of the Moscow region. Here is official publication: http://nfreg.ru/novosti/kadrovye-perestanovki-v-administratsii-rajona/  Quote The change of leadership of the district administration was announced today at an extraordinary operational meeting of the head of the Naro-Fominsk district. The head of the district, Vadim Andronov, informed about his decision to the heads and chairmen of councils of deputies of settlements gathered in the hall, heads of institutions and structural divisions of the administration. According to him, this was a difficult decision, but necessary for the consolidation of the district community.  He described Maxim Breus as a good professional, a reliable member of the team, expressed the hope that he will help the district already from high positions. The new candidate for the post of head of the administration was Roman Shamne, who worked as the first deputy head, in charge of the main block of issues - economics and construction.   This message was commented by Mikhail Kuznetsov, Deputy Prime Minister of the Moscow Region - Head of the Governor’s Administration: “The decision to replace the head of the administration was worked out as part of the work to form the city district. This made it possible to look at the situation from different angles. It is very important that the area be one team. Therefore, we hope that Roman Lvovich, as a local person and has been working here for a long time, will be able to gather his colleagues around him, to rally the team. And Maxim Breus was offered work at the regional level. ”   Along the way, Mikhail Kuznetsov, evaluating the work of the administration, noted that the final rating of the Naro-Fominsk district rose by 15-20 points. With these words, he handed Breus the Gratitude of the Governor of the Moscow Region.   Maxim Breus summed up the brief results of three years of work as the head of the administration, thanked the team and each of his deputies for well-coordinated work, emphasized the effective work of Roman Chamnae in the most difficult area, wished success and assured that he would help his colleagues in the development of the region. Also, Maxim Breus expressed hope for a worthy completion by colleagues of the work on the begun administrative-territorial transformation.  In turn, Roman Shamne noted that his main goal is to preserve all the positive aspects in the work of the administration, improve the quality of the work of its structures, organize effective interaction between urban and rural settlements with regional and federal services. In a separate paragraph I raised the issue of the clear and understandable work of housing services, municipal institutions. And he formulated a strategic task for the near future - the creation of an urban district.   Recall that the candidacy of Roman Shamne will be proposed to the Council of Deputies of the district for approval as the head of the administration. A meeting of the Council is due next Tuesday.",False

The sales start in just a few hours, so let's get you up to date. There is a lot of news happening.  It is truly holiday time when the importance of trust resonates loudly in the world.  During these days, your SilentNotary team has been especially busy. We have begun sales under our B-2-B plan so our revenue traction has been launched.  In addition on December 6, we signed important agreements in our B-2-G business. This is a major step. Shortly we will begin providing the technology used in a state land inspection to certify land-use development and in control over burial cites.  The two agreements are with the Naro-Fominsk district of Moscow, the first of many districts where we have relationships. So Naro-Fominsk is just the beginning of our development plan.  A Lightstamp patent has been filed and accepted. This is great news. Now our Lightstamp technology can be used in any full-scale field inspection. With this technology customers enjoy the broadest array of communications. They can conveniently and legally certify the existence of critical evidence.  With so much business activity, it’s time to review our Initial Coin Offering. Our hardcap was initially set at the level of 100 000 ETH. The last pump of cryptocurrencies makes it an unnecessarily large 65 million USD.  After recalibrating, we decided a hardcap set at the level of 15 million USD including tokens sold during the first stages was best.  Thus about 12 million USD is left to close the hardcap.  A Smart Contract will lock up all unsold tokens for one year with partial unlocking for future development.  All details are described in the token sale agreement.  This is an exciting period in the evolution of blockchain technology and SilentNotary is on the leading edge with first mover advantage. We invite you to help us celebrate the holidays by joining in our mission to rebuild trust.  Best Holiday Wishes,  The SilentNotary Team   ps: Register NOW @ www.silentnotary.com  If you are already registered, please go to www.sntr.io",False

We are standing at the start of a great future. The momentum, potential, and target markets are greater and bigger than ever. The last two months were a preparation, a preparation to enter the target markets and utilize our First Mover advantage.  We have finished most tests and now it’s time to look back and summarize most of our achievements so far. SilentNotary is a re-develop company, with a new branding, identity, products, and strategy. Lots of positive feedback has been received throughout different channels.  When we started SilentNotary we were only focused on the Business to Consumer market with one product, The Notary Chatbot. Now SilentNotary will enter additional markets such as; the Business to Business, Business to Government, and even the of the Internet of Things with new developed mobile applications, our patent pending LightStamp Technology, new prototypes, and launching customers. SilentNotary will be serving the full scope of data registration in almost all markets, from registering an event and recording data to a global network of notaries and lawyers for applying local legislations.  We were joined by fantastic Partners: Pascal Thellmann who joined as our PR Advisor who writes for CoinTelegraph and has a great network, Nate Flanders joined as our ICO & Crypto Advisor who is the VP of Operations at DECENT.BET that successfully raised 17 million during their ICO. People with a great vision and relevant experience joined us in our journey.  An excellent team is created with expertise in Sales, PR, Development, Legal and Finance. We have tested almost all marketing channels: Social media (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn), a referral program, a bounty campaign, Google AdWords, Social channel and group advertisement, banner placements, articles, and press releases. All channels were measured, benchmarked and analyzed. Of course, we have raised funds during this phase, over the 700ETH from more than 400 contributors.  Here is one of the most important things we created; a direct sales system based on our own experience in Sales in different markets such as; Finance, IT Corporations, and other Startups.  Our goal is to reach our hardcap and make SilentNotary a reality, not only throughout the current crypto players but also with business angels, personal investors, hedge funds, VC’s, and others. At the moment we’re engaged with more than 12 funds and investors that are all showing high interest in SilentNotary and recognize the market and revenue potential.  Now the time has come to prepare for our main ICO which will start soon. Follow the news and be ready for our ICO!  With Best and Kind Regards, Your SilentNotary team",False

Quote from: Spotika4 on November 12, 2017, 12:47:55 PM  That's what I tell you guys - if the campaign decided to pay, then it simply pays, not creating many additional conditions for PM, telegrams and others. I made all the retweets, although I was a little late with the tweet 42, in the table I credited your tokens, but I did not get anything! Why create a lot of topics on the forum? I can not follow you and as a result I missed some information. I read the opinion of different people that this was done specifically not to pay. I'm starting to think like these people. If a notary deceives, then this is not a notary. I have to agree with this if they have intentions to pay all they would make the process easy like all other campaign  without all that BS , But it was clear that they was trying hard to make the process complicated so more people can not claim there bounty .

Let me introduce myself.  I have a computer science background and passion for programming. In my career, spanning more than 7 years, I have worked on different applications ranging from line of business applications to Video surveillance applications.  I also have a passion for doing humanitarian work. Since I have always liked working with people I have organized teams for community work. It gives me immense satisfaction in helping the under privileged in whatever ways I can.  I do possess experience in managing communities. I have worked in several communities  so far as a Community Manager and as a Bounty Manager for few groups. I have seen communities grow in front of me, also I have expanded few groups from 0 to 500+ members in a week or so and still counting.  So this is a small step towards new journey and there are many more to come.  Lets work together in making this project a huge success. I know we can, do you think so?",False

Instructions are described below.  We want to express our gratitude to all of you for your trust, for the valuable advices and support.

At the expense of available reserves we double the number of tokens of the investors who decide to stay. 3. We conduct full-fledged TSO involving professional organizers. 4. We launch MVP and listing tokens on the exchange by the end of the TSO.

At the 6000 ETH target stated in the whitepaper, even if the entire ICO was to be held at the initial rate of 100 million tokens per ETH, the maximum number of tokens sold would be 600 billion or 60% of the minted tokens. But given the declining rate/increasing price, the actual attainable amount is much lower than that, leaving more than half of all tokens to be ""distributed among team members"". By the way, there's no word in the whitepaper about those tokens being locked for any period. One can only imagine what happens to the token price when those 50+% of the tokens flood the markets. The idea is good and rather unique (at least as of current), but the token distribution scheme is totally upside-down.",False

Yes, we issue a lot of tokens, but they are extremely cheap!))) One hundred million tokens costs only 1 ETH at the start of the token sale. Such large numbers are due to the low cost of notarization and high price of ETH. Since the tokens are always integer (there is no a half of token), you need to release a huge amount of tokens to provide transactions for a cheap service. For example, for an common user the cost of the notarization will be $ 0.2. Then, at the cost of ETN= $ 300, the smart contract will take 667 SNTR tokens (detailed calc. in WP). So 3 digits will be enough for accurate accounting. Thank you for interesting question!   ",False

They say that the token will be sold at their web at the rate of 20 times the initial ico price.  But, if the token could be brought in much less price from ico price, no one would buy at that price and the token would be dumped once it hit in any exchange at much lower price.  This means there is no point in selling token at a high price at their official web site as long as there are exchanges that sell at much low, which value is determined simply by supply and demand.  So, it is likely that only a few of us who would buy token very early from ico could sell a higher price than what they obtained and the rest of us would end up to hold it till their business goes well or dump the token with the market demand rate.  So, simply this is nothing different than any other icos and I guess there is only negative point in giving lots of price advantage for the early contributors.

In addition to the chatbot, we developed a mailbot and a webinterface to notarize e-mails and any files. All prototypes are already available for use. We gave a possibility to all messenger users to notarize any event without installing any apps. Now everybody can notarize video, photo, audio message which contains, for example, a verbal agreement. You can run multi chat - SilentNotary will generate and notarize the protocol of the negotiations.  Of course, Dapp-notaries this is a new phenomenon. When it will be widespread, we expect significant changes in many business practices. Everyone can be an insurance agent, a photo can be acts of acceptance of works, there will be deals in chat and verbal agreement by phone.  In addition, our project provides both financial and legal support of the crypto community in General and Ethereum in particular. First, the duties of a notary will be transferred from Fiat currency into the Ether, contributing to the maintenance of exchange rate stability. Secondly, in the process of project development we will develop the legal basis for the blockchain (or rather Ethereum), decentralized applications, token and ICO.

One hundred million tokens costs only 1 ETH at the start of the token sale. Such large numbers are due to the low cost of notarization and high price of ETH. Since the tokens are always integer (there is no a half of token), you need to release a huge amount of tokens to provide transactions for a cheap service. For example, for an common user the cost of the notarization will be $ 0.2. Then, at the cost of ETN= $ 300, the smart contract will take 667 SNTR tokens (detailed calc. in WP). So 3 digits will be enough for accurate accounting. Thank you for interesting question!",False

It can be divided into two stages during the TSO and after the TSO, no pre-sales, contract deals, etc. All participants are in equal conditions.       Step 1. TSO.          On the start of TSO we set the exchange rate of the coin 1M SNTR = 0.01ETH. Total issue is 1000 000M STNR (such huge volume coused by the requirement for flexibility of service pricing). Assume that someone payed 1ETH. He receive a 100M SNTR. We recalculate the exchange rate based on the realized SNTRs (the algorithm is based on the linear function - for more details, please read WP and code on github), the price rises and becomes 1M SNTR = 0.0101 ETH, i.e. each participant buys tokens little bit more expensive than the previous one, at the same time the price depends on the previous requests (following the ideology of the blockchain business . )). At a certain point, the purchases stop at the point of the market appreciation. In addition, we have limited exchange rate of 1M SNTR = 0.2ETH when ICO automatically stops.     Step 2. After the TSO.           There is a moment before start in commercial mode, the price is determined by the market, depending on the results of the team. We are intrested to reduce this period as much as possible. For the convenience of the holders, we will try to list our tokens on the exchange.           After start of commercial mode the service uses a smart-contract that changes the tokens (from all holders pro rata) at the rate of 1M SNTR = 0.2ETH.           Thus, your benefit is to exchange ETH for SNTR at a rate of 1M SNTR = [0.01; 0.2)ETH and sell SNTR at a fixed price of 1M SNTR = 0.2ETH, i.e. 1:20 to the start price. At a certain point, all of your tokens will be exchanged. Note that the revenue of the service is formed in USD and your benefit is in % expressed in the ETH is as more as less is the ETH rate, but with the increase of the rate it still not remains to equal zero, so this is a specific hedging instrument.           There is only question that where the contract will take so much airtime to exchange tokens for this course? Where will the Ether come from? Answer - We devetoped service for a wide use, most of our users don't know anything about cryptocurrencies. The main revenue will be generated in fiat cirrencies, on agent-SPV accounts, and SPV will purchase the Ether to pay for the service by smart-contract buyback mechanism.",False
