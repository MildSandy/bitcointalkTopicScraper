How you will be measure when you finish SALE 1 as a periode in situation when you will not sell the target nr. of tokens. For me corect is to set every SALE periode with specific duration, for example one week, or few days, etc.",False

Every opinion is valuable to us. The current ICO model is our business vision. We've thought about it for a long time. Let it stay as it is Thank you.   Quote from: Slimdaddy on December 16, 2017, 11:44:41 PM Charity projects have all been overlooked by the crypto-community for a long time. The most common reason people gave was that it doesn't have a way of generating profits for investors. Some say it's difficult for the token to add value.  I just hope CharitySpace can change all that.  You're right. However, you must understand that we are not a ""token"". The basic difference is that our charity is the charitySPACE internet platform. We do not issue a charity token. We issue a token that will be used to take part in entertainment. The entertainment is the participation in the prize draw. This is our charity vision. You will not support the needy with this token. But you can pay for participating in the prize draw. There have been many opinions that this is not pure charity. Of course it is not. However, our answer is: it is better to donate 200 ETH to UNICEF and take 30% of it for the prize and commission than give them 0 ETH.  We want to create a product whose slogan is: ""we bring people together, we do public collection, we collected 200 ETH, we donated 160 ETH from this pool to the needy, 60 ETH (30% of 200 ETH) is an award for our donors and our commission"" - how can this not be a charity action ?  Many people ask what our commission is for. The answer is simple. Most of the funds from ICO are allocated to the production of charitySPACE. The rest is marketing and building the brand image. The commission is the current maintenance of the company. Many people ask why the prize for the winner is as much as 25%. The answer is also simple. It must be attractive. Not everyone on a daily basis helps those in need. According to our data, it is 20% of the population. Not much true? Our product is to aggregate the remaining 80% (our dreams ) or more real - if we reach 20-30% from the crypto community - it will be a success for us.  We try to be very transparent.  You must understand that we do not create a token. We create a platrorm, to help those in need.",False

We changed the start date.  New CROWDSALE will start on APRIL 16, 2018  Due to fluctuating exchange rates of Ethereum and Bitcoin, which are inconvenient for our investors, we decided to suspend ICO.

We believe that the situation will stabilize in the next few months, therefore, we postpone the ICO for 16 Apil 2018. This decision is difficult for us, however, after deep reflections, we do not see a different solution at the moment. We are not able to guarantee a satisfactory return on investment in our project at this moment. Daily fluctuations in the currency rates, which are close to 25%, distort our business model.

Do you already know who you want to help? Are you going to establish permanent cooperation with specific institutions or help centers?    Of course we know who we want to help We are deeply convinced that man is a human being. Maybe you should ask a question - what does it matter to whom we want to help? The fact of help is important. Our mission is to gather capital from the Crypto market and hand it over to other people in need.  However, we are aware that our users (donors) have a need to choose the organization we have received.  At the beginning (according to the roadmap), we focus on the European market. In addition to our native Polish charity foundations, we inform more well-known foundations about our project. E.g:  UNICEF (unicef.org), World Food Program (wfp.org), Save the Children (savethechildren.org), British Oxfam (oxfam.org.uk), French Action Contre la Faim (actionagainsthunger.org), and other more local  An interesting project is GiveDirectly.org. The organization, looking at satellite photos, chooses the poorest families in Kenya and Uganda (those whose roofs are not covered with sheet metal) and checks them. The chosen person transfers money in the banking system using a mobile phone. Indirect costs are low, so from every dollar of donors, as much as 91 cents goes to the poor.  We are also planning to introduce the functionality that allows you as users to submit your organization proposals that we would like to support.  There is a lot of potential for the development of our platform. Do not forget, however, that the primary goal is to support all people in need. All these organizations, even if we gathered 500 of them, certainly will not waste this money.  The markets of the USA and Canada are probably the end of 2018. Mid-2018 is Russia, Japan. Because these countries have their own organizations operating only and exclusively within their territories.",False

We do it publicly through the exchange. Then, our Company—registered on the territory of Poland—transfers FIAT currency funds to a bank account of a selected charity organization (a legally registered entity with the status of a foundation, or a public charity, or public benefit organization). All of the mentioned entities must have a legal status. We do not provide private bank accounts to people in need.  We are aware that the topic you raised is a real problem. If the collection model guarantees a contract, then the further flow of money depends only on us. We have talked about it with many foundations. Unfortunately, payment in crypto is not possible. As a company, we plan to disclose our finances. The company's annual tax return is also public. Unfortunately, it requires you to take certain actions. You must reach these documents.  As a team, we are considering the possibility of introducing a financial intermediary. It raises our credibility because it is he/she who powers the bank accounts of charitable organizations on our behalf. We are already in talks with several European financial houses. Another example of an intermediary can be the Humble Bundle service. They support payments in crypto.  The financial intermediary charges commissions. This commission is paid by us. It does not reduce the amount transferred to a charity.  We also know that Poland is not a large and well-known country. We are conducting talks with local foundations to embrace our company with their patronage.",False

It is something to be proud of to help needed people. Would You develop independent programs as well as support existing charities? One concern is admin costs and the 25% given back to the donators. Isn’t 5% a high fee to charge (unicef is 1%)? Why give back something to token holders when you can reinvest such amount into the charity programmes or advertising, for example? A lottery is senseless for people who donate. No need to try to win money back which was donated to needy people.",False
