It is companies like this that will eventually cause the bubble to burst. Do not get me wrong, I am heavily invested in crypto, but its this type of shit that makes my blood boil. I took my time and read Karma's white papers and am convinced whoever posted this either works there or stupidly bought a ton of pre-sale tokens. Look, there are probably 100-200 people in the world qualified to build a new internet protocol. This team is not one. In fact, they claim to have a ""Karma protocol"" its just a sham bc they are actually planning on using the ethereum protocol as their base. Let's take a quick step back though. Karma was founded in 2005 - 4 YEARS BEFORE BITCOIN WAS EVEN INVENTED. A quick search and I found there Vimeo page which hasn't been updated in years. Specifically, three years since they joined Vimeo and their bio reads - ""An exclusive, private membership organization dedicated to connecting exceptional & inspirational individuals both socially & professionally."" So obviously this is going semi well for them as they advertise on their website that they have netted 32 mill in revenue over the past 12 years. But then boom blockchain goes mainstream and probably about a year ago they slap the lipstick on the pig and go for the moon. This company (sham) has a larger marketing team than blockchain experts (and frankly I question the blockchain ""experts"" expertise). THAT SHOULD CONCERN YOU. I get they put on networking events, but have they ever heard of staying in your lane. How the fuck does a networking event company pivot to crypto? But rather than bicker about this lets simply focus on their value prop. ""There are three primary customer verticals which will aggregate the revenue streams for Karma: 1. Physical membership organizations (such as country or golf clubs) 2. Virtual membership organizations (universities alumni chapters, business networking organizations, etc.) 3. Non-pro t organizations, which lack the operational backbone (CRM, ERP, BI, etc.) to raise funds from their donor base transparently."" Wait...WHAT? I'm sorry, who thinks that country clubs and colleges are going to want to do this? A general rule when analyzing a company is to see if the idea already did not work in a centralized network then why would it work in a distributed one? Here I honestly, cannot even grasp the overall point. Karma is not fixing a problem or filling a need. Rather, they looked around decided there weren't any players in the ""leisure club / alumni network"" space slapped together a half baked idea and boom issue a token sale and raise 4.1 mill. Sit back for a second and ask yourself how does blockchain tech help country clubs and college alumni groups? crickets As for the charity arm, kudos Karma International you are just a few years late (see Bithope or Bitgive). All of this being said if you want to throw away your money go ahead, but you'd probably have more fun trying to bounce silver dollars off the wall and into the toilet.",False
