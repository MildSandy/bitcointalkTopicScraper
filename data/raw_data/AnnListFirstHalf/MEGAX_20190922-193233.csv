As advised by our counsel and as we await regulatory feedback, we have decided to set the sales dates to  Pre-sales: 9 Oct 2017 1800H (+8 GMT) - 16 Oct 2017 1800H (+8 GMT) Public Sales: 17 Oct 2017 1800H (+8 GMT) - 17 Nov 2017 1800H (+8GMT)  It is important to push the dates as we need to meet compliance fully to protect all initial purchasers of our tokens. We apologize for the delay as the landscape shifts and we are reacting to it positively. There will be no further push-backs, and we chose a date we are very comfortable with.  Apart from awaiting regulatory feedback, we will be making full use of this time to do a full PR release on major media and tech blogs. You will be hearing about us a lot from other channels. This is an e.g of one of our initial angles http://fintechnews.sg/11902/mobilepayments/mc-payment-cashless-proposal-singapore-hawker-cofee-shops/  For the many users who have indicated interest to purchasing, we will be contacting you nearer to the pre-sales date. Interested parties, do leave is your email via www.megax.io  We will be hosting a sharing on our token sales at an exclusive 'investors'* event on 7-8 Oct (http://www.singaporerendezvous.com)  Also, we will be accepting fiat payment for purchase of MegaX and are now drafting up instructions on how to transfer payment either through ethereum or fiat.

The problem with most of us in the crypto space is that we are older than the millenials. And I know a lot of us ""get so annoyed"" with the young people coming in here and bickering about crypto. But the wise people will try to understand them and sell to what they like. Retail is driven by millennials. They no longer save money like our generation.",False
