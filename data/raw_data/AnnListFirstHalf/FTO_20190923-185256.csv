The incognito is the ICO.  Why is the ICO important:  Simply, what we want to do is a stable coin, that is supported on the downside, and protected on the upside.  To make this, we need it to be liquid, it must be traded on a good exchange, and have a decent numbers of traders that everyday buy and sell it (buy low, sell high, make easy profits).  This is where the ICO comes in the equation, we need the ICO for: - distribute the coin to as many people as possible, thus creating a starting user base. - be able to get the coin listed on decent exchanges.   Many people think ""oh nice, this project seems cool, if they really can make a coin that is supported and safe to trade everyday, i will trade it once it is listed on exchanges, and i will make nice profit everyday! nice.."". Yes it's all nice, but we need also people that get the Coin (fractal token) from the ICO, we need a userbase, otherwise no exchange will ever list a token with 0 holders. This is the reason we are doing this ICO.   What are the pros and cons of getting FractalTokens during the ICO?  CONS:  - perceived risks. participating in ICOs is always risky, there is the risk of scam, the risk of getting a token which will trade below ico price in the exchanges, the risk of a project not succeding for some reason, and not getting refunded.  Our answer to these risks:  - forget about scam, the team is serious, the ceo have 15+ years experience in financial trading, the project is based on a revolutionary technical analysis and trading-system approach, that has been made opensource and available for whoever is interested in it (it's a bit hard to digest if you are not a professional trader though). About a thousand professional traders use our systems everyday as of now, with great success. This number keeps growing day after day.  - forget about risk of getting a token which will trade below ico price, the whole project is about making this never happen.  - if for some reason the project cannot be executed, it is implied that whoever invested in the ico, would have a total refund, again, we are not here trying to play tricks on the people. What we want to do, is create something new, something that will be useful and helpful for the cryptocommunity.   PROS:  - by participating in the ICO, you are helping the whole project to become a reality. As we stated earlier, the very purpose of the ICO is to have a decent initial userbase that will allow us to get the token listed in good exchanges. So, if you participate in this ICO, you are helping to make the project succed.  - you secure a small initial profit for yourself. By getting tokens during the ICO, you are getting them at the lowest price possible, if you get them during the pre-ico you get even a lower price! That is a safe profit, a well earned profit as your very participation is what will make the project become real.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------   We have introduced a SOFTCAP for this ICO, the softcap is fixed at 100 ETH, if not reached, we will refund everybody and move on.  If you like this project, and you want to see it succed, and you want to be able to trade an safe-to-trade token everyday, then you should do your part, invest in this ICO, and talk about it with other crypto-investors, crypto-traders, help it to become popular.  The ICO world in 2018 is extremely inflated, hundreds of new ICOs are created everyday (most of them crap, sorry no offense!), the popular ones are the ones who spend ridiculous amounts of money in marketing, in advisors, in reviewers, etc.  We will do it too, but as of now, we need a starting push, we need seed-investors, we need advisors, we need marketing specialists, we need ICO experts etc. The core team have great experience and knowledge in various financial fields, but we lack ICOs and Marketing experts, so if you can help, just get in touch!   Thank you and have a nice weekend!       - The CEO  https://fto.ninja",False

About Fractal Token, our mission is to make a token that is at the same time supported by its own cryptofund, and protected from pump and dump ""attacks"".  How much can it go up in one month? We don't know it yet, it depends on many factors, but don't expect anything spectacular (like +10000%), because fast upmovements are always followed by fast crashes (like happen in most tokens and cryptocurrencies), i've seen that too many times, people on various groups being sad because ""i bought at the top, now it's -90% "" (i happened to read things like that more than once!).  Fractal Token is about safe and healthy appreciation over time, not a short-term speculative altcoin!!!   ",False
