Team members have worked at major studios (Nintendo, Electronic Arts, Bungie), and on popular titles (Super Mario World, Halo 5, Madden, Battlefield).   The Projects:   8 Circuit’s mission is two-fold.   The first goal is to create games that tell compelling stories while demonstrating the transformative potential of blockchains and cryptocurrency.   The second, more ambitious goal, is to create an ecosystem/development platform that empowers gaming studios and communities to achieve their goals and thrive in symbiosis.   Players should have true ownership of their digital assets. Game developers need better collaboration tools, and deserve to keep a higher percentage of their profits than is possible when relying on legacy publishers and distribution networks. An inclusive approach to game development in which the team consults with the community (see: Star Citizen) has enormous potential for unleashing creativity, and producing innovative games.   Our planned ecosystem will make all of this possible.     The Studio’s First Game: D-PARC  The team started development of its launch title, D-PARC, just over one month ago. D-PARC is a roguelike space ship simulation/management game with FPS elements. Players take control of an AI tasked with transporting a ship of cryogenically frozen humans to a newly discovered habitable planet.   The game will include player controlled blockchain-based assets that can be freely traded on markets. An Alpha will be released in August, with version 1.0 scheduled for a Q4 release.

In spite of the numerous scams, it’s clear that genuine innovation is also being funded through this new crowdfunding mechanism.  https://venturebeat.com/2017/07/01/ethereum-startups-dont-need-silicon-valley/    We are conducting a token sale in order to attract supporters who share our long-term vision and will be active participants in the ecosystem. Funds will be used to take D-PARC from alpha to version 1.0, and to start building our broader blockchain-based gaming ecosystem. For now, we’re focused on developing D-PARC and the initial functionality of tokens will be limited to purchase of in-game assets. In the future, tokens will enable advanced functionality such as community voting on the studio’s development decisions.   The total supply of 8BIT Tokens will be 100,000,000. 33% will be sold in the token sale, 33% will be retained by the team, and 33% will be allocated for distribution to incentivize participation in the ecosystem. There will be a cap of $33 million on the sale which starts July 17th.
