Would you be surprised if we told you that soon your physical existence or at least feeling of security could be affected by blockchain?  Let us introduce Aeron, a blockchain project for aviation safety.  In aviation the human factor is crucial. According to statistics, more than 50% of all aero accidents happen because of pilots’ poor physical condition, mistake or even a false experience record. When boarding the plane you can never be sure if all the systems are fully functional, or if pilots had enough sleep. Nevertheless, you trust your life and possibly your loved ones’ lives to the airline crew.  There are some databases and systems that gather information about the above mentioned features but they’re extremely dispersed, incomplete and mostly unavailable for all the stakeholders. Aeron solves this problem.  The project collects all the pilot flight log data starting from enrollment into the flight school to the licensing and further into career progression, and provides it to the host flight schools, aviation authorities, pilots and, of course, offers the summaries to potential passengers. As Aeron is based on blockchain technology, it guarantees complete unforgeability of data stored. You’ll have an opportunity to see proof of your pilot’s diploma and license validity, which is especially critical for general or private aviation, when you don’t have a large airline with its systems and procedures to rely upon.  Aeron’s goal is to completely eliminate the risk of any aircraft-related document forgery, and we hope this approach becomes a new standard in aviation safety.",True

This plan helps the stakeholders in identification of major safety risks and actions to take.  While year 2017 has been the safest year ever for commercial aviation, the situation is dramatically different for general aviation. This is where Aeron strives to make an impact.  Refer to section “5.5 General Aviation” on page 52:  “In the last years, accidents involving recreational aeroplanes have led to an average of nearly 80 fatalities per year in Europe (excluding fatal accidents involving microlight airplanes), which makes it one of the sectors of aviation with the highest yearly number of fatalities. Furthermore, in 2016, there were 78 fatalities in non-commercial operations with aeroplanes (2nd highest number) and 20 in the domain of glider/sailplane operations (2nd highest number). These two areas present the highest numbers of fatal accidents in 2015. The General Aviation Road Map is key to the EASA strategy in this domain. This area is a strategic priority.  Although it is difficult to measure precisely the evolution of safety performance in GA due to lack of consolidated data (e.g. accumulated flight hours), it is reasonable to assume that step changes in the existing safety level are not being achieved at European level, despite all initiatives and efforts.”  With pilot flight log records recorded in blockchain, the entire pilot’s career progression will be verifiable, leading to more transparent qualification system and eventually to safer skies.  Aeron apps are coming soon on App Store and Google Play. We look forward to community feedback and adoption by major flight schools and training institutions in Europe and beyond.  https://medium.com/@aeronaero/aeron-highlights-from-easa-european-plan-for-aviation-safety-epas-2018-2022-6a67708b5447",True

We can confirm that Aeron pilot flight logging application will be fully complaint with FAA and EASA standards for such records.  Paper printout (manually signed) is still necessary for aviation administrations, as example for the purpose of license revalidation, and it can be easily produced through our application. We continue efforts to make Aeron blockchain based solution recognized by aviation administrations and airlines as an authoritative data source, by further education and contacts on both national and international levels. We believe that going forward secure blockchain recording principles will be recognized and paper duplicate of an immutable record on blockchain will no longer be required.  We expect that one or several national administrations will be on the forefront of adoption.",True

Aeron whitepaper, roadmap and other information available at https://aeron.aero fully explains our project background. However based on the community opinion and feedback from our supporters, we will publish and repost materials which would bring holistic view of what we do and why we believe that Aeron makes a difference.  We are inspired by the industry trends over the last six months. When we started our project in early 2017, that was the first attempt to apply blockchain technology in general aviation. Today we see that such trend has caught public recognition and major players in the aviation industry do actively adopt blockchain based technologies to improve the day to day operational efficiencies.  At present, we can define the term “blockchain in aviation” as the distinctive industry segment.  Several use cases have been made public, as example Lufthansa announced partnership to look into blockchain based technologies; British Airways, Heathrow Airport, Geneva Airport, Miami International Airport and SITA Lab joined hands to examine how blockchain technologies can safeguard the flight information and many others. We are posting related industry news in Aeron official twitter at https://twitter.com/aeron_aero  It may be a long time till blockchain takes central part in setup of the aviation industry, however the rate of acceptance of the early projects makes us confident that it will be a significant impact. There will be more aviation companies and airports looking into blockchain technologies in this year.  Our first article of the series would explain what is general (or private) aviation, what is special about it and how it is different from commercial aviation. The second article would explain the prevailing issues with logbooks and why blockchain can help to solve these. The third would tell the story of Aerotrips web portal and its relation to Aeron token (as payment mean for the ecosystem being created); the forth will be about the new business niches being explored, to be unveiled at Aerotrips.  https://medium.com/@aeronaero/blockchain-in-aviation-latest-trends-and-aeron-team-commentary-f8cb4d0346b5",True

As you remember, bitcoin made a powerful leap at the end of year 2017 and reached the all time high close to $20k. This was accompanied by a huge infusion of capital into all crypto assets, including altcoins.  We are pleased to note that at such take-off time, among the huge number of altcoins, Aeron project did not go unnoticed.  Aeron (ARN) token, even though at the very early stage of its deployment, reached the significant daily trading volumes. For us, this is a very positive assessment by new and large cryptocurrency market players.  We believe in our business prospects, but it is important and reassuring for us to see the evaluation of professional market participants, and note that our project is evaluated as strong and promising. We are working hard to execute on our roadmap.  At the moment, correction takes place on all cryptocurrency markets. It is estimated that the market has deflated by over $200 billion.  According to estimates of the analysts we have been talking to, it is expected that some $500 billion may be channelled into the crypto assets, pushing bitcoin back to the $20–25k range, and that would also give significant rise to reliable altcoins. The intention of some traditional rating agencies to expand their scope and cover a number of crypto assets would also contribute to the market recovery.  Our team is not experienced in trading an market evaluation, and we remain focused on the development. Yet we believe it is important to share opinions we have been hearing.  https://medium.com/@aeronaero/aeron-team-views-on-state-of-the-cryptocurrency-markets-a7135dbce5ca",True

Also they say in White paper work with airlines, in the Q & A they say they dont want work with airlines now, only Flight Schools and General Aviation.  This project serves NO PRACTICAL purpose, can not improve what already exists, and to be connected to some central register with Civil Aviation Authority, would require a much a massive amount of resources, what ever ""toy apps"" they are presenting is a joke.  Example Airlines today already have a fully automated system, that copies every flight into electronic logbooks, with no need for subscriptions by pilots.  Also there is not much issue with false log books, and even there was, this is not a system that would improve the security of this, as whatever you garbage date you insert, will give you garbage data output also.  When I read the website, knowing what I know from working for an airline, and been working with flight schools and pilots, I have to laugh, ignorance can really make some people a lot of money.

I simply like looking at projects and seeing what they're for.  Second, I just registered on the site for the first time to respond to this comment.  I know that might seem odd, but please hear me out here;  While I get the FUD here, let me try to play devil's advocate a bit.  Er, in reverse I guess.  I haven't read all 79 pages here so this might have been covered.  This concept IS interesting to me, but I think the only way it works is via some kind of hardware timer.  IF the pilot had a portable device that could log the flights, this kind of technology actually could be very useful.  In addition to the data logging for verification for flight training, it could log all of the flight's data for review.  Even if simply to review the flight from a performance standpoint.  Now, I understand that right now, that might be a stretch.  However, IF the team/group/company behind this could possibly lobby hard enough for this kind of concept, it could get implemented.  What would be very cool is if the pilot had a handheld which registered his time/work and if the aircraft had it's own recorder that pumped into the chain, that could result in some interesting data that could be useful in a lot of areas.  Especially in verifying flight time during training for your license.  No way to fake it if the pilot's handheld communicates w/ the aircraft's recorder and logs everything.  I think this is super early in the stage to speculate that it can't be done.  Given the amount of money flying around in this space (pun intended), something like this could grow wings and take off (I can't help myself).  Of course, you could be right and the whole thing is a scam.  I really hope not.  I think something like this could be really useful.",True

Tokens are available on Binance, HitBTC and some other exchanges, you can see them on CoinMarketCap.  I think this is a very promising and perspective project. The idea is great and I really like the fact that the group members publicly revealed their identities, which is a rare thing nowadays, I don't see much projects around with known developer team members.  The project is new and tokens currently cost just 4.5$ and it is a limited amount of them (20 million), which is great too. For example, Populous Token has maximum supply of 53 million tokens, currently costs $57 and is ranked 27.  ARN has a way to go on the ranking and in price.",True

I got this email from thier team yestarday. They will burn unsold tokens now.   Dear Subscriber,  Aeron is fully funded to execute on its roadmap. Offering clarity to the token holders, we have decided to burn the unsold tokens on November 27, 2017, reducing the total Aeron (ARN) token supply from 100,000,000 ARN down to 20,000,000 ARN.  The circulating supply stays under 12,000,000 ARN (60%). Remaing 8,000,000 ARN will remain frozen. Aeron development and management team has opted not to accept any team tokens on this stage, with motivation not to dilute the paying token holders.  You may check live ARN total and circulating supply values at: https://tokensale.aeron.aero https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aeron  Having fulfilled the liquidity commitment to Aeron (ARN) token holders, Aeron was listed on HitBTC and Binance:  https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=ARN_BTC https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=ARN_ETH https://hitbtc.com/exchange/ARN-to-BTC https://hitbtc.com/exchange/ARN-to-ETH  You may also trade ARN on Tidex, Gate.io, Mercatox, EtherDelta, Token Store and IDEX.  More exchange and product announcements will follow soon.  In the meantime, you may take part in ARN Trading Challenge arranged by Binance and win a trip to Cyprus and other valuable prizes: https://www.binance.com/activity-arn.html  Please do not hesitate to join our support chat on Telegram for any queries.

Flying is considered to be generally safe but even so the amount of accidents each year are troubling. In the United States alone there were 1290 accidents in the year 2014 according to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Aeron are trying to change that by using technologies such as the blockchain and smart contracts. Cointelegraph asked Artem about what ails the skies and how it can be fixed? His response was, “We would like to enable a system where a pilot can maintain a transparent and verifiable record of the flying experience. This starts from the flight school and develops towards a private pilot license and further a commercial license, and appropriate renewals and hour building, with Aeron applications available to log the hours. Apart from bringing convenience to the pilot and the flight school management, we would not like to see the horrific cases of pilots taking the wheel without experience, as you can read in media such cases are frequent and recurring.” A number of really alarming cases were cited by Artem to support his argument including one in which a fake pilot flew planes for thirteen years before he was discovered.",True

Its fast expanding growth over the last 100 years not only shows how important aviation is for the modern world, but also brings certain ‘growing pains’. Due to global diversity there is still no unified solution to many of safety-related problems. This may put air travellers into unnecessary risk.  With over 100,000 flights made daily, serving over 2 million people, safety is still a major concern. Accidents related to air transport average to about 265 yearly, mainly due to human error. The significant concern is in pilot experience, as there were incidents where flight logs , recording progressive experience, could have been forged. Aircraft operators also contribute to the problem by often underreporting the operating history of the aircraft. Aside from human error there are also database intrusions.  Remember how aviation has changed the world and drove the technologies for all of us? Now it’s time to use the newest technology to change aviation! Of course we speak about blockchain here.  The advantages of the blockchain system are that information is stored safely, cannot be altered and the history of records is completely transparent to all the users. It is secured by a multi layer authentication system, preventing any alteration of data.  We at Aeron are developing a blockchain-based, accessible, secure and transparent database for all the flight and aircraft related information, pilot logs and other data. It has a potential to make a revolution in aviation management, not only solving some of the old system defects but also making air travel safer for every passenger.

Unfortunately, this is not a guarantee. The current system for logging training and flight hours is easily manipulated to show numbers that the pilot wants to show. Flight logs are still done on paper, with the numbers, signatures, and confirmation stamps all being done manually.             The point of a flight log is to monitor the progressive experience of a pilot. This is one of the ways that determines when a pilot can be licensed. As an example, to become a licensed private pilot, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires 40 flight hours to acquire experience and skill. However, since the logging is done on paper, it is possible to forge these numbers to get a license faster. Legal trouble is not the worst outcome for forging these documents.             In 2008, millionaire Paul Spencer crashed his helicopter only moments after taking off, killing him and his wife Linda. The investigation into the crash discovered that Ian King, Spencer’s flight instructor, had submitted fake flight logs to get Spencer his license faster. This incident of fake documents was costly. Two lives were lost due to inadequate flight training and an instructor who let it happen. Ian King was jailed for six months.   There is no doubt that the current system of flight logs is dangerous and outdated. There is no way for centralized aviation authorities such as FAA or EASA to identify forged hours on a log. However, Aeron.aero has developed a solution to make flying safer for everyone. Aeron’s solution relies on blockchain technology to track aircraft maintenance and pilot logs. Aeron is constructing a database and an online system that is decentralized, hosting global data on aircraft, flight schools and pilots. This electronic logging system would force pilots to have logs that reflect accurate flight hours, making aviation safer for everyone involved.  If you want to help build a safer aviation experience, support this project by participating in a token sale. The funding will go to finalizing the technology and assist with legalizing the system with aviation authorities. If you cannot buy a token at this time, please share this article with your friends and family to bring awareness to the dangers surrounding the current flights logging system.",True

But current systems cannot guarantee the integrity of critical data and therefore leave the doors open to potential risks to passenger and crew safety. One start-up company, calling itself Aeron, is betting that the unique characteristics of blockchain technology can rectify this situation and in the process allow them (and maybe you) to profit from saving lives.  The same techniques that decentralized digital currencies such as Bitcoin use to maintain an unalterable fraud-proof log of payments and balances can also be used to ensure the integrity of safety-critical records in the aviation industry.  One key area targeted by Aeron is in the recording and maintenance of accurate flight logs. Current flight logs can easily be forged or changed, and incentives exist for people to do exactly that. For example: pilots may alter logs to make it appear that they have more experience than they really do, flight schools may fake pilot experience and aircraft operators may wish to under report aircraft flight hours in order to save on compulsory maintenance costs. Using blockchain technology to create a fraud-proof distributed database for this information can help to eliminate these safety risks. At the same time, it can provide a convenient way to reliably share information between interested parties.  In addition to a data hub and apps for pilots and aviation companies, Aeron is also building a consumer facing portal for passengers and flight school students to access a validated global database of aviation services. The first version of this portal is scheduled to launch as early as November 2017.  The token sale  Aeron is currently running a token sale in order to raise funds for the development of this technology.  A total of 100 million ARN tokens have been issued. These tokens are secured by the Ethereum blockchain and are ERC20 compliant. Out of the 100 million total, 60% are being sold in a crowd sale, while a further 20% are allocated to incentivize participation in the ecosystem and drive network growth, 18% issued to the development team, and 2% retained for covering administrative costs.  These tokens must be purchased by anybody wishing to access Aeron services, and will additionally be usable to book flights through the aerotrips.com consumer portal. In this way, they are expected to increase in value if the company is successful.  Tokens can be purchased up until the 23rd October 2017 for $0.5 USD each. Bonus tokens are available to the early buyers.  Visit the Aeron website here: aeron.aero for more information.",True

Pilot errors, possible corruption in the flight schools all contribute towards unsafe skies. Aeron, by implementing Blockchain technology, can benefit pilots, airlines as well as ordinary consumers.  They are planning to integrate Blockchain in such a way, so that pilot logs become more verifiable and transparent. They are also going to implement solutions that will help verify flight school credentials and help aircraft operators access uncorrupted data.  All of this is possible because the Blockchain itself is immutable and records once stored can’t be changed. Combined with the deployment of smart contracts and a cryptographically secure database, Aeron would be able to eliminate falsification, create verifiable logs and basically deliver an “airline in a pocket” through its deployable applications.  The workings of Aeron are rather simple. All persons involved in the operation of the aircraft will have access to customised apps. As an example, pilots will have the functionality of personal flight logging in their app.  Aviation companies have the ability to collect and verify data from aviation schools, service companies, airlines and aircraft operators. In the wider ambit, if there is any data mismatch between any Aeron data source, it would be possible to quickly detect the problem and take corrective measures.  Aeron will also enable expired pilot licenses to be detected while giving flight school students and consumers the access to a verified global database through aerotrips.com. Aeron has put up a one-pager to explain the workings of the project succinctly.",True

Konstantin Gertman, Chief Development Officer van Aeron, merkt op: “Het belangrijkste probleem is dat piloten en vlieginstructeurs vluchtschema's kunnen vervalsen om te doen alsof ze ervaring hebben die ze niet daadwerkelijk hebben. Ongevallen worden ook in grote mate veroorzaakt door onvolledige gegevens: of het nu kwam door gegevensinbraak of een gebrek aan juiste registratie.

Binance will list Aeron’s ARN token, as its first exchange platform, once the Aeron token sale event is completed in October 2017.  Aeron is a software company building a global decentralized aviation record system called Aeron Register and focused on flight safety. Powered by blockchain technology, this comprehensive online system includes a global aviation database accessible by online portal or mobile applications.  Aeron Register system allows to solve a range of problems related to aviation safety such as discrepancies in data and human errors. The system can track pilot and aircraft log records which are stored in blockchain, available for public audit and can’t be forged. It could facilitate data exchange on every step of communication between clients, airports, aircraft maintenance and service companies. Thus, all people, involved in operating and flying an aircraft use customized apps — pilots for personal flight logging, aviation companies to collect and verify log data from flight schools, aircraft operators, fixed base operators and others. The Aeron Register system can be also applied to aircraft maintenance records and tracking of spare parts, to confirm that spare parts are authentic and maintenance has been performed according to standards.  Artem Orange, CEO of Aeron commented: “Since the successful launch of our token presale earlier this August, our team has received hundreds of inquiries from users regarding our plans for listing of the ARN token at the crypto currency exchanges. Today, we are excited to partner with Binance to announce the agreement to enable Aeron users to trade the ARN token conveniently and securely. Binance is one of the most advanced digital asset exchanges and we believe our users will benefit from access to its excellent trading engine.”  Deposits and withdrawals of the ARN token on Binance.com will be enabled once the Aeron token sale event is completed. More details will be available on Binance official web site.  About Aeron Aeron is the new standard of aviation safety powered by blockchain. We believe that aviation safety is closely related to record integrity. Once the log records are stored in blockchain, available for public audit and can’t be forged, both authorities and passengers can be confident that a pilot actually has the experience claimed. Aeron will work with all target audiences: pilots, aviation authorities, maintenance companies, flight schools and the airlines. Aeron’s team has extensive flying experience and includes certified pilots, aviation engineers and developers. Aeron has launched token sale from September 19, 2017.",True

You may remember it: according to that report digital tokens are securities and therefore fall under the US law regulations for this financial instrument, i.e. the Securities Act. Since Aeron is offering its own digital token (ARN) through a Token Sale, it is very important to us to communicate our understanding of its status in relation to the DAO report. Together with our lawyers we have formed the following opinion. ARN token, as we see it, is a utility token that will be used in the Aeron ecosystem to access various functions in the Aeron application or to purchase Aeron services on the future stages of its development. Since this token will be primarily used inside the Aeron ecosystem, we believe that ARN is not a security and therefore DAO report’s findings do not apply to upcoming Token Sale. For further clarification we put ARN token through the Howey test — a check first introduced by the Supreme Court of the United States. Please follow this link to read the complete report on our website. Under the Howey test, a transaction is an investment contract if: It is an investment of money There is an expectation of profits from the investment The investment of money is in a common enterprise Any profit comes from the efforts of a promoter or third party. Based on the test outcome, ARN token is unlikely to be treated as a security and does not have to be registered under the Securities Act. We will continue to pay close attention to the US and global financial regulators’ position on cryptocurrencies and digital tokens, and will act in compliance to their recommendations.

Civil aviation carries passengers and delivers cargo to almost anywhere in the world. Availability of civil aviation is a key facilitator of economic growth. Civil aviation connects the entire globe, providing much needed economic benefits both seen and unseen for consumers and businesses. Civil aviation has been a major force behind decreasing barriers to trade, aircraft industry is a unique engine for innovation and technological progress. The aviation industry nowadays supports $2.7 trillion (3.5%) of the world’s gross domestic product. Introduction of the mass aviation marked a turning point in the world’s progress. Air transportation connected different countries and continents like never before, enhancing diplomatic contacts, business, trade and tourism. Upon its arrival the aviation was on the frontier, utilizing the most modern technologies of its time as well as inspiring the new ones; many inventions would not be here these days if it wasn’t for aircraft industry, aviation safety and comfort. For example, a significant progress was achieved in engine manufacturing due to the constant search for better, lighter, more powerful solutions for aircraft. Thorough studies of every air incident brought new safety protocols and inspired the invention of construction materials and many technologies that we now take for granted.    All that being said, like everything in the world, aviation isn’t perfect. Its fast expanding growth over the last 100 years not only shows how important aviation is for the modern world, but also brings certain ‘growing pains’. Due to global diversity there is still no unified solution to many of safety-related problems. This may put air travellers into unnecessary risk. With over 100,000 flights made daily, serving over 2 million people, safety is still a major concern. Accidents related to air transport average to about 265 yearly, mainly due to human error. The significant concern is in pilot experience, as there were incidents where flight logs , recording progressive experience, could have been forged. Aircraft operators also contribute to the problem by often underreporting the operating history of the aircraft. Aside from human error there are also database intrusions. Remember how aviation has changed the world and drove the technologies for all of us? Now it’s time to use the newest technology to change aviation! Of course we speak about blockchain here. The advantages of the blockchain system are that information is stored safely, cannot be altered and the history of records is completely transparent to all the users. It is secured by a multi layer authentication system, preventing any alteration of data. We at Aeron are developing a blockchain-based, accessible, secure and transparent database for all the flight and aircraft related information, pilot logs and other data. It has a potential to make a revolution in aviation management, not only solving some of the old system defects but also making air travel safer for every passenger.",True

We can’t imagine business and holidays without being able to get on a plane and be carried away hundreds of kilometers away within a matter of hours. It wouldn’t be an overstatement to say that safety of aerotravel is imperative. On the one hand, air transport is considered to be one of the most secure means of transportation. On the other hand, the number of accidents related to it is 3302 per year on average (including general and commercial aviation).   Aeron has a strong belief that aviation safety can be drastically improved with help of blockchain technologies. Such issues as lack of piloting experience, possible corruption in flight schools, wrong stats from aircraft operators and general lack of a system for data tampering prevention can all be tackled with new technologies.      The solution offered by Aeron will ensure the immutability of stored data, as blockchain is a transparent environment where everything can be traced and proven, but can’t be altered. Additional protection of data will be ensured by multi-signature authentication system. Thus, any possibility of fraud, censorship or loss of the essential records would be excluded, minimizing the risk of accidents.        The ecosystem will consist of 3 key products: pilot app, the web portal and the aviation company app. The pilot would keep record of the flight hours in the personal app, while the companies would use the application to enter  the logs from flight schools, aircraft operators and other sources. The web portal would serve as a convenient database interface for passengers, flight school students and general public interested in aviation. If any irregularity or mistake happens, it can be quickly detected and resolved by competent authorities.    Aeron (ARN) token has been introduced for further development of the platform and is currently on ICO stage. Apart from trading it against BTC and ETH, holders will be able to pay for flight offers with it and pay for Aeron services.

Our booming Telegram chat brings more and more interesting questions from the community including aviation professionals. We have selected several very interesting questions and answered them. How does Aeron plan to compete with the privatization of air traffic control? We are not involved with air traffic control industry and commercial aviation. Our project focus is on private pilots and general aviation, those who enroll in flight schools, own or operate a small aircraft. Our applications and portal at aerotrips.com (which is already available to public in beta version) are aimed to let the pilots log their flight hours with recording in blockchain, as compared to current prevailing paper log books. As to mentioning of ATC (air traffic control) in our materials, in certain areas where technically feasible and ATC coverage is available, we intend to establish an interface which enables to cross-verify log records self reported by a pilot, against aircraft logs and ATC data. This is an intended process to detect self reporting of flight hours while the actual flight did not take place (i.e. fake experience).  Why would it be beneficial to book a flight with ARN tokens rather than with Bitcoin or fiat?  The intended primary utility of ARN token is for payment of the transactional fee for flight log book entries. Secondary — for payment of Aeron commission for flight booking and other services. Assuming you would like to book a demo flight with a flight school or a sightseeing flight with a certain private pilot, when you pay commission in ARN you will get a 20–30% discount compared to fiat payment.  What is your primary market focus for the next time: is it private aviation or commercial aviation?  We are starting with private (general) aviation as it’s a more easy market to enter.  What is your primary business case focus: is it “pilot logbook” or “maintenance record”? Would your app ensure BTB traceability?  Primary business case is “pilot logbook”. We will also start with maintenance logs and schedules. Back to birth traceability for components will require much more development and cooperation from the parts vendors, and we can not promise it at this stage of project.  Do you have any partnerships from aviation industry?  We have partnerships with flight schools for live tests, including our primary partner Griffon Aviation, the first licensed flight school on Cyprus  If you will sell your technology to some bigger aviation player, will ARN token owner get any compensation?  In case our technology would be sold to a third party, we will have an open discussion with the community and the buyer to establish a long term plan for ARN tokens.We can’t publicly promise to link equity to tokens as ARN is a utility token. What about your competitors (blockchain projects in aviation)? Do you know any, when do you expect any? How do you expect to win the competition? We are not aware of any direct competitors for blockchain based pilot logbooks.  How will Aeron ensure of the accuracy of data reported by pilots, flight schools and aircraft operators?  The data self-reported by the pilots will be cross-verified against logs from aircraft operators/owners or flight schools, as the case may be, to ascertain that the flight has actually taken place. In case of mismatch in records, this will be highlighted. Additional data sources for verification include positioning track from mobile application (if this function is enabled by the pilot and application is running in background) and ATC data on the later stage (in areas where coverage is available).  What is exactly the information manipulation issue that you are going to solve?  The issue is quite simple. Hours of experience are reported by the pilots in flight logbooks. Experience building is necessary for license renewals or new qualifications. These hours may be reported without actually flying the time reported. As an outcome, as an example, a person without 200 hours mandatory experience may obtain a commercial pilot license. With Aeron system such instances would be less recurring.

Challenges of war time sped up the introduction of the reliable jet engine, metal plane body and many other important features. When the war was over, many pilots and aircraft were available for commercial use. The era of civil and cargo aviation begun. And ever since the progress in the aviation industry was no longer driven by military demand, but rather by safety concerns. The growing scale of air travel quickly revealed that aviation still had a long way to go before it became the safest way of travel as we know it today. For a long time it took an air disaster to find and correct a problem that just was not acknowledged before. This is why they say that safety rules are written with blood. Here are some important changes that were introduced this way. Window shape The de Havilland DH 106 Comet was the world’s first commercial jetliner. Three crashes one after another put the very idea of mass air travel on question when airplanes literally came apart mid-air.    Investigation revealed dangerous stress at the corners of the square avionics windows. As a result, the Comet was extensively redesigned with oval windows and that became a new standard for all aircraft after them.    Air Traffic Control The first major mid-air collision of two planes in the history of civil aviation has occurred in 1956. The airspace over the canyon at that time was not under any type of radar contact as many other areas in the world were the same ‘blind spots’. The standard at that time required that the crew would regularly update on their position when in range. Two aircraft approached the Grand Canyon at the same altitude and nearly the same speed and their real position was unknown on the ground. It is believed the planes passed the same cloud on opposite sides and the flight paths of the two aircraft intersected over the canyon.    This accident really brought the primitive nature of air traffic control (ATC) to light. As a result the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 was passed, creating the Federal Aviation Agency. The FAA was given total authority over American airspace, including military activity, and as procedures and ATC facilities were modernized, mid-air collisions gradually became less frequent.  CRM  United Airlines Flight 173 was a scheduled flight from in New York to Portland, Oregon. Late 1978 the aircraft flying this route ran out of fuel and crashed in a suburban Portland neighborhood. On approach to Portland International Airport the attention of the crew was captured with vibration of unknown origin and unclear indication of the landing gear system. The crew went in a holding pattern to figure out the problem and spent an hour in air trying to do so. During this time, none of the three cockpit flight crew monitored the fuel levels. As a result, the aircraft ran out of fuel, lost both engines to flameout and crashed. The investigation stated that the problem was about the crew resource management. This incident triggered major changes in airline crewmembers training procedure. Now pilots are trained to delegate responsibilities, react quickly in emergency situations and make correct decisions. It is credited with launching the Crew Resource Management revolution in airline training.    Years and years of aviation incidents being investigated and solved created this very safe and comfortable air travel of today. Modern aircraft are technically perfect machines that have a double for every important function. Human factors, including pilot error, are currently the factor very often found in aviation accidents. Pilot’s training, professionalism and experience become the vital information when it comes to the safety of travel. Aeron focuses on bringing just that into aviation. Using the most up-to-date blockchain technology it will provide a transparent and immutable database to record important information such as pilot’s flight hours, aircraft logs etc. This will become a new standard, making flying even safer.",True

Also here is video on Youtube with CEO AERON is bringing the integrity of the Blockchain to the Aviation Safety! AERON believes that Blockchain technology can transform pilot and aircraft maintenance logs, which at best are in cumbersome databases and, at worst, are in paper binders. The blockchain will ensure that spare parts procured are legitimate and can offer a “virtual copy” immutable record of the provenance of every part on the plane, every time it has been handled and by whom, from the beginning of the aircraft’s existence. This visibility is profound, and can take the practice of aircraft maintenance, safety and security to new levels. AERON will also utilize the ARN utility token. The ARN will be incorporated in Aeron products. It helpsto enhance product usage, allow contribution to the ecosystem, product access and ownership. ARN is a bootstrapping engagement. While the token will enable access to valuable features within the Aeron platform, it won’t be limited by the Aeron mobile applications. AERON has already secured Crypto exchanges: Binance and HitBTC for ARN trading and acquisition.  https://youtu.be/tYUoyhAUEHc",True

Aeron, an aviation centered project are currently having their crowdsale. Safety of the skies is the priority for them and they will be harnessing the power of blockchain and smart contracts to devise solutions to improve aviation safety, usher in transparency and create solutions for all the stakeholders in aviation sector from travellers, pilots to airlines and others.  In a recent announcement, Aeron have disclosed that they have entered into a partnership with Binance, a leading exchange to facilitate listing of their Aeron (ARN) tokens after the crowdsale is over. We talked with Artem Orange, CEO of Aeron about their new partnership as well as other issues surrounding Aeron and the Aviation industry.  Listing of Aeron (ARN) Tokens on Binance in November  In a press release made available to Coinspeaker, Artem Orange, CEO of Aeron states, “Since the successful launch of our token pre sale earlier this August, our team has received hundreds of inquiries from users regarding our plans for listing of the ARN token at the crypto currency exchanges.”  He adds, “We are excited to partner with Binance to announce the agreement to enable Aeron users to trade the ARN token conveniently and securely. Binance is one of the most advanced digital asset exchanges and we believe our users will benefit from access to its excellent trading engine ARN tokens would be distributed to the investors after the crowdsale is over.”  In response to our question about their partnership with Binance and if they were considering other exchanges for listing, Artem reveals, “The listing would be done after the token distribution event takes place in late October. The tokens will be freely transferable without any lock-up and listing procedure at Binance should be completed in the beginning of November. We are in talks with HitBTC and a couple of other major exchanges and will announce agreements upon approval from the respective exchanges.”  Investors Can Participate in Aeron Crowdsale to Get ARN Tokens  After successfully conducting a pre sale that raised over US$ 1 million, Aeron is launching a crowdsale that will help them build their platform and also develop the necessary technology. The proceeds from the crowdsale will also help boost lobbying efforts and liaison with governments and aviation authorities. In the ongoing crowdsale, 60% of the total 100 million Aeron (ARN) tokens would be available for investors.  These tokens are ERC20 compliant. The last date of the crowdsale is October 23, 2017 and investors can purchase ARN tokens for US$ 0.50 each. Early investors stand to benefit from a bonus, which they can receive by visiting the Aeron website.   Transparency Can Create a Better Flying Experience  A project the scale of Aeron can have many priorities but it is always interesting to see where they are going to start. We asked them about that one big challenge they would like to tackle, in response Artem says, “We would like to enable a system where a pilot can maintain a transparent and verifiable record of the flying experience. This starts from the flight school and develops towards a private pilot license and further a commercial license, and appropriate renewals and hour building, with Aeron applications available to log the hours. Apart from bringing convenience to the pilot and the flight school management, we would not like to see the horrific cases of pilots taking the wheel without experience, as you can read in media such cases are frequent and recurring.”  License to Kill in the Skies?  While transparency and the ability to verify credentials is important, it assumes the shape of even more pressing problems when the lack of the same puts people in danger. There have been instances of pilots forging their qualifications and even the case of a person who flew thousands of passengers before he was found out to be a fake pilot.  The whole process of forged licenses can leave a bad taste in the mouth. It can be a great reassurance to members of the public if they can find out if they are being flown by an experienced pilot.  Artem tells us how they intend to do that: “What happens in general aviation is that a pilot has to report a certain flying experience for the license renewal, a number of hours flown within a period of time. As its an expensive endeavour and not every pilot owns a small aircraft, there is an incentive to log the hours not actually flown.”  He continued: “With paper log books this does not take much effort. Further with career progression, to become a commercial pilot one has to report a significant number of hours (typically 200 hours or more), which is a large investment by any measures (typically in excess of $50,000). We would like to see that hours to be really flown, by offering incentives to a pilot and a flight school to use Aeron applications for logging. General public can access qualified offers from flight schools signed up with Aeron through our portal aerotrips.com”  Aeron Can Save Lives with Technology  On their website Aeron promotes blockchain for aviation safety and proclaims that they are saving people’s lives. They are trying to implement ingenious and out of the box solutions, which can transform general aviation in the near future. The tools are all here with us today and it only required someone to get their act together.  Aeron is playing that role. Artem says about the change that is coming to the skies: “We believe that all private pilots will turn to blockchain technology to log the flights and paper documents will gradually disappear. The electronic register of flights and routes for general aviation will be introduced and the same will be confirmed by local authorities in every area.  “General (private) aviation may have a faster pace to adopt electronic logging in a distributed database and related smartphone applications, compared to commercial aviation, as there are many enthusiasts amongst the private pilots, there is more flexibility and less regulation,” he added.",True

Advantages of the blockchain system are that information is safely stored and completely transparent to all the users. It is secured by a multi-sig authentication system, preventing any alteration of vital data. Our aim is to create “airline in a pocket” — a smart blockchain based solution. The way it works is simple. The pilot’s application is used by a pilot for personal flight logging. The company application collects and verifies data from aircraft operators, maintenance organizations, flight schools and fixed base operators. In case of any mismatch in data between any Aeron data source with either the Air Traffic Control, pilot, or operator, aviation authorities can quickly detect and eliminate the problem. Aviation authorities can also detect any pilots operating with an expired license. As a consumer, or flight school student, you have access to the verified global database through aerotrips.com.

I am a FAA com/multi/inst pilot since 1994. I can go into the 4000 reasons why it wont work, but I will give you a couple. Most of the flying in the entire world happens within the US. Yes you need 40hrs at least for a private pilot - you actually even need less for a sport license. This will not stop Joe Blog from getting in his own private aircraft and crashing and killing himself. Nothing will. Even making the license requirements 400hrs will not stop it. Airliners on the other hand require an ATP license which at mininum is 1500hrs and that wont even get you into a right seat of a little puddle jumper. To get into the major airlines you need a good 10000 hrs. Private individuals, flight schools, mechanics, maintenance shops will not want to share their data or even update it online - and even if they had to by law, nothing prevents a mechanic from saying he did the work when he didnt - just like what happens currently. Even less will be the airliners. And doing things on paper has for the most part ended a long time ago - every pilot I know uses an electronic flight logbook - google it. The airliners dont even use flight time for their logbooks - the pilots use block time(which is not flight time), then the plane airframe is different from the pilot time, and even the engine times are different (for each engine) - and thats for every flight. And good luck trying to get the times from simulators which also counts to flight time - yes you can log a certain amount of time in say MS flight simulator and it counts. In the end, this will not validate actual flight times - and more importantly it will not improve flight safety. Flight safety can only be improved by the actual pilots/mechanics due diligence and their standards.  We wont even talk about dealing with the FAA - think DMV that has a bad year and you're the next 'customer'",True

Unfortunately, this is not a guarantee. The current system for logging training and flight hours is easily manipulated to show numbers that the pilot wants to show. Flight logs are still done on paper, with the numbers, signatures, and confirmation stamps all being done manually.             The point of a flight log is to monitor the progressive experience of a pilot. This is one of the ways that determines when a pilot can be licensed. As an example, to become a licensed private pilot, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires 40 flight hours to acquire experience and skill. However, since the logging is done on paper, it is possible to forge these numbers to get a license faster. Legal trouble is not the worst outcome for forging these documents.             In 2008, millionaire Paul Spencer crashed his helicopter only moments after taking off, killing him and his wife Linda. The investigation into the crash discovered that Ian King, Spencer’s flight instructor, had submitted fake flight logs to get Spencer his license faster. This incident of fake documents was costly. Two lives were lost due to inadequate flight training and an instructor who let it happen. Ian King was jailed for six months.   There is no doubt that the current system of flight logs is dangerous and outdated. There is no way for centralized aviation authorities such as FAA or EASA to identify forged hours on a log. However, Aeron.aero has developed a solution to make flying safer for everyone. Aeron’s solution relies on blockchain technology to track aircraft maintenance and pilot logs. Aeron is constructing a database and an online system that is decentralized, hosting global data on aircraft, flight schools and pilots. This electronic logging system would force pilots to have logs that reflect accurate flight hours, making aviation safer for everyone involved.  If you want to help build a safer aviation experience, support this project by participating in a token sale. The funding will go to finalizing the technology and assist with legalizing the system with aviation authorities. If you cannot buy a token at this time, please share this article with your friends and family to bring awareness to the dangers surrounding the current flights logging system.

So basically i lend you my ethereum at 0% and take on price risk in the underlying ethereum? Please let me know if I am incorrect in my understanding.  Wanting to know what you will do with the ethereum raised and how that will be spent. Assuming you are raising money in order to deploy your business model. So how will you use the funds raised to make that business plan successful? Thanks,True
