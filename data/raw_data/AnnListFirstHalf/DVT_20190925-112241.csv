DATAVLT is a company that aims to develop smart affordable data analytic platforms that serve various purposes for businesses/entities who are looking to future-proof themselves. DATAVLT is an on-demand, self-service, data analytics platform, secured by Blockchain technology, that has been designed to provide users with an integrated overview of their state of their business. Backed by artificial intelligence and learning capabilities, this platform aims to track, gather, analyse and correlate different types of data, e.g. Enterprise data, online marketing performance data, third-party reports, and information, etc., onto a singular smart dashboard that can empower businesses, especially small medium enterprises (SMEs) that are looking to grow their internal capabilities cost efficiently, regardless of industry, Essentially, DATAVLT is an end-to-end data/information management platform.   What market challenges or problems or unmet needs does it resolve? The world is running at a speed where technological adoption far exceeds the digital capability growth of economies. Businesses, especially SMEs which make up a large percentage of the ecosystem in many nations, have yet to fully grasp and leverage on the advantages of performance tracking, let alone keep up with advancements. Whilst governments may offer aid, mostly in the form of grants, to help willing entities improve their business intelligence skills, there is very little middle ground. Instead of diving into the deep-end of developing their own infrastructures and analytic tools, which entails heavy investments, businesses should be given the opportunity to choose more palatable and friendly ‚Äòstepping stones‚Äô that provide similar if not equivalent or better results. Currently, most affordable ‚Äòoff-the-shelf‚Äô data analytic tools provide partial perspectives to a business or have limited scope functions. This potentially means that any business that may want a more holistic view of their progress will need to procure a bevy of different tools and spend a large amount of time correlating results ‚Äì ironically, businesses, like SMEs, are almost always strapped for time and resource because of their constant focus on the bottom-line. Sense of security is a real-world challenge today as it is not uncommon to read about enterprises being held hostage against their own data and infrastructures. There are only a handful of platforms out there that aggregates information, not necessarily correlate. Below are a few reasons why, we feel, companies have yet to resolve this gap in the market: a.   Technological developments ‚Äì up until recently, data analytic capabilities meant the need for superior computing requirements simply because of its volume and processing intensity. This was a challenge from a processing cost perspective as backend infrastructures are not easily affordable. b.   Funding ‚Äì traditionally, entities with such ambitions would have required heavy investments which means a high probability of skewing original intentions to manage investor expectations with faster go-to-market and ROI strategies. c.   Talent pool ‚Äì the is a real shortfall in the number of data science talents previously, as compared to today. Most would have been hired by large corporations (not necessarily in the data science field) which can offer above market salaries to fulfil and manage internal business intelligence requirements. Today, with the disruption in the funding and advancement in technology and its offerings, there is a real ability to provide a robust platform to the regular business in any market.  DATAVLT has been created with these challenges in mind ‚Äì to help budding entrepreneurs and current business owners manage, grow and sustain their ambitions.   How does the product work? In summary, the platform works as described below: i.   Initial parameters must be set together with the client. ii.   Enterprise/research data and other identified data sets are then directly drawn from sources, e.g. via APIs or our backend platform, etc. Other data sets can include native analytic tools, third party reports, trending news, listening results, etc. iii.   The Blockchain technology will be activated to ensure data transaction integrity and security. iv.   Data is then processed and sent into the DATAVLT cleaning, tracking, tracer modules. v.   To ensure quality and consistency of the data, metadata of the cleansed data is fingerprinted and distributed across the blockchain repository. vi.   The artificial intelligence component is then activated to learn the user‚Äôs data sets. vii.   After which, clean information is flowed back to the users via secured Blockchain technology and sent to an integrated smart dashboard. viii.   Artificial intelligence will also be activated to learn user habits via the smart dashboard, adjusting information displays per usage preferences with time. ix.   Users can collate reports on-demand and customise their dashboard to suit their needs. The potential to apply this process to various product verticals are endless. For more information, refer to the DATAVLT whitepaper.   What parts of your product are centralised vs decentralised? DATAVLT is backed by hybrid of layered decentralised systems and in specific, as the tools are developed on Ethereum, DAPP will be decentralised channelling clean dataset via the Blockchain.    Why do you think your team can build this product? There are a few reasons why we can build this product: i.   Together, the core team has a collective of more than 60 years‚Äô worth of professional experience in different industries. This wealth of experience will ensure a pragmatic and sustainable approach to business and product growth, viability and stability. ii.   DATAVLT has already begun developments on several modules within its analytics process and to date, has proved to be functioning and producing positive results. At present, the team is working on optimising the integration of Blockchain, artificial intelligence and predictive learning with the correlation module. iii.   Additionally, the core team is supported by collaborative expert teams in the areas of research, development and implementation. These partners hail from reputable innovation centres housed in Singapore-based institutions.    Roadmap         Website  -  Facebook -  Telegram  ",True
