1,msg24356467,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2384050.0,,418,Announcements (Altcoins),2017-11-10 15:40:39,ICOfan,Newbie,10,0,,[ANN] [ICO] Fortitude Ranch Initial MemberCoin Offering,"Fortitude Ranch, a recreational and survival community, is creating a tradable cryptocurrrency token for advance membership sales to fund expansion to provide more people with a cost effective, affordable means to survive a collapse. Our cryptocurrency token, called a Fortitude, gives you a discount price on Fortitude Ranch membership, protection from membership price increases, and priority in joining when there is a waiting list. This is a utility token, an advance purchase of membership, with no equity or security features that should not result in any future securities regulation issues.  We are “coining” the term Initial MemberCoin Offering to emphasize that this is a utility token. The value of our membership token may rise because Fortitudes give both a locked in price and priority to join when waiting lists form to join Fortitude Ranch.  In the event of a major crisis or media reports on threats, demand for membership in FR will surge beyond our capacity, and the price of Fortitudes may spike since those who want to get in will need Fortitudes to have first place in the wait list. A maximum of 150,000 Fortitudes will be sold (priced in Ether at 100USD), and an additional 20% for company reserve and later sale.  No further Fortitudes will be issued and the number will decline as they are used to purchase FR membership. TOKEN SALE An ERC20 Token IMO Start:  7 Dec IMO End:  30 Jan 1 Fortitude = 100 USD (ETH price set to equate to $100 on Dec 6) Maximum Sale:  150,000 Fortitudes Add’l Fortitudes Coined for future company use:  20% Fortitudes issued to staff and owners:  None Maximum Fortitude issue:  180,000 Tokens not sold destroyed, Fortitudes used to purchase membership destroyed, no further issue  The advance sale of Fortitude Ranch memberships via our Fortitude token will fund our expansion from two existing sites to a dozen sites across the United States, and an international location.  FR is a large survival community that can keep members spread out (for virus protection) with sufficient size to deter/defeat marauder attacks and raise crops/livestock.  We are fully equipped to survive any type of disaster and long-term loss of law and order, managed by full time staff.  FR is affordable because of large numbers of members and economies of scale.  FR is especially attractive to join because it is a recreation/vacation facility as well as a survival retreat.  We locate in remote locations in mountains and forests, ideal for hiking, fishing, hunting, and all types of outdoor recreation. Historically ICOs have funded development of new blockchain technology. The Fortitude Ranch Initial MemberCoin Offering (IMO) marks a turning point in ICOs—funding existing companies applying blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is very valuable for FR to keep our member identities and their security passwords for crisis entry into Fortitude Ranch locations absolutely secure, for voting and polling using blockchain, and for the issue and trading of “Fortitudes”—our cryptocurrency token for discount, priority membership purchase. Unlike most ICOs offering tokens for services or businesses that do not yet exist, FR is an established, market tested, proven company. There is no R&D or business development spending needed for this business, just rolling out the proven business plan by building out our existing WV and CO sites, and expanding to new locations across the U.S. and overseas.  Most software development startups will fail; FR is an established business with a membership token whose value should never fall below our membership price, and will likely be much higher due to the priority it gives to join when there is excess demand.  Owners and staff of FR are not taking any Fortitudes as profit from this IMO—all funds raised will go into land, building and equipment purchase to fund the expansion of Fortitude Ranch so more people can survive a collapse. A pandemic is inevitable, with bioengineering, nuclear proliferation, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and many other new technologies increasing the capability of a small nation state, terrorist group, or even an individual to trigger a huge disaster.  Our “Just in Time Delivery” economy, daily food shipments in cities, and dependent populations, are very vulnerable to a collapse in a functioning economy and loss of law and order that could last for months or years.  Food delivery trucks will not come into big cities during a pandemic, electric outage, or other disasters that trigger panic and lawlessness. Rather than focusing on these growing threats and protecting the population, Big Government is focused on buying votes and increasing its power via entitlement programs and regulations shaped by Big Corporations.  In the United States these are largely unconstitutional laws that ignore the 10th Amendment to the Constitution which bans any federal government exercise of power that is not specifically mentioned in the Constitution.  While Governments have shelters for their top leadership and priority protection from police, they are not working to protect citizens from collapse disasters.  Everyone needs to be a “Prepper,” taking steps to ensure family and friends can survive a long-term collapse of a functioning economy and loss of law and order.    Founder and CEO of Fortitude Ranch is Dr. Drew Miller.  Drew is a USAF Academy honor graduate, intelligence officer, and retired Colonel.  He received an academic scholarship to Harvard University where he earned a Master’s Degree and PhD.  His PhD dissertation was on underground nuclear defense shelters and field fortifications.  After serving as an intelligence officer on active duty, Drew entered the reserves and started a business career.  He served as a Manager of Corporate Planning and Development at ConAgra Inc. (a Fortune 25 Food and Agriculture Company), VP of Business Development for Securities America, a broker-dealer, and Managing Director of Blockchain Business Consultants. Our lead blockchain developer is Aaron Jaramillo, a specialist in Ethereum smart contracts and advanced Bitcoin blockchain technology.  He served as the Chief Technology Officer and blockchain developer for the SLVR ICO. IMO Advisors include: •   Charlie Shrem, a Bitcoin pioneer, the founder of the Bitcoin Foundation and founder and CEO of BitInstant LLC, an early Bitcoin start-up for buying and selling Bitcoin, currently Chief Operating Officer @ Jaxx.io, the leading digital currency wallet •   James Barry, a former IBM executive and leading Blockchain expert, worked on building out a secure Blockchain based IOT platform initially aimed at large industrial Internet Of Things installations, currently working on a Small Business Innovation Research Grant from the US government, the first US grant covering blockchain innovation, and advisor on several ICOs •   Larry Hall, CEO of Survival Condo, with over 25 years experience in high tech medical and military application development, working with NASA, Northrop Grumman, and AT&T Wireless. In accordance with Blockchain and Libertarian philosophy, the way ahead for responsible citizens is to create survivable communities that respect and protect individual freedom by leveraging blockchain, cryptocurrency, and collective action of independent groups.

Unlike most ICOs for startup software development projects with low odds of success, FR is an established, market tested, proven company. There is no R&D or business development spending, just building out existing WV and CO sites, and expanding to new locations across the U.S. and overseas. 2.   Fortitudes are a “utility token"" with no equity features, less legal risks than most ICOs 3.   Little downside in the token's value because it is an advance purchase of membership at a 25% discounted price (+20% discount if purchased in first 24 hours of the IMO), and prices likely to go up. 4.   Because of the priority right to join we designed into the Fortitude, it has huge upside potential.  The Fortitude price will periodically surge as there are alarming crises, well publicized warnings, and developing threats that lead more people to determine they need our service. 5.   FR is an anti-fragile business—in a disaster that will tank the stock market, demand for our services and the price of Fortitudes will surge.",False
