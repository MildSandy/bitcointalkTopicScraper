Hiveterminal is a blockchain platform where businesses can sell their invoices at a discount, getting their funding immediately from investors who hold HVN tokens. After fronting a percentage of the cash, the investors funding these businesses get paid the full amount of the invoice on its due date. Beautiful and simple, and heaven sent by its admirers, HVN has however long flattered to deceive. Until recently it’s been loitering around the low 500s, but there are some very good reasons for this poor price performance — and why things are set to change.   Although it’s been rising up the ranks in recent weeks, Hiveterminal’s non-existent crypto marketing means that, of all the tokens in this list, they are furthest off the pace for a slot in the top 50. Taking an unusual approach to raising awareness, they steadfastly refuse to market to people already interested in cryptocurrencies. Their argument? They are wary of exchanges, see listings as a waste of ICO funds, and HitBTC has been ranked in the top 10 for trading volume for at least 2 years. There’s no need for another, and the long delayed Nauticus listing is expected soon too.  But I still think they’re a top 50 token. Here’s why. Although unorthodox for this industry, their arguments makes sense. Their biggest factoring and invoice financing competitor, Populous (PPT) (ranked #74), has no publicly available metric for platform activity and is reluctant to produce any evidence of invoices sold. Unlike their competitors, Hiveterminal also took the very responsible step of fully documenting the first invoice sale from the perspective of the investor and the small business — they seem to have been the first (and only) factoring token to do this. That’s why confidence is building among investors that Hiveterminal has the potential to grow the fastest of all the tokens on this list. If for no other reason than people are naturally attracted to winners and revenue generating platforms.  Since a major deal fell through last year, which crushed the price beyond belief, the mood among the community has been dark. During this time, Hiveterminal’s CFO Ugur Yildirim has been steadily turning what at first glance looked like an unflashy and deathly boring finance platform into one that is generating an internal rate of return (IRR) of around 40% for its investors. They are all getting paid too.  Yildirim’s efforts have been bolstered by the experienced CTO Dejan Jovanovic, who has been busy working with their long-term partner Adacta to develop a plugin for the MS Dynamics NAV (desktop version) and Dynamics 365 (web-based). This will allow Hiveterminal to communicate not only with the ERPs of Adacta’s clients, but any ERP service based on MS Dynamics. With release of the plugin expected any day now, this will serve as a strong foundation for international expansion after gaining traction in their domestic market of Slovenia.  Meanwhile, the fight for the invoices already posted has been intense, with most getting snapped up in just a few minutes. But with less than 20 invoices raised so far, they will need to start relaxing the entry criteria for small businesses to use the platform. Once the floodgates open, however, things should get interesting very quickly. They already opened up to institutional investment last week, which should attract more businesses looking for funding.  They have made buying HVN easy for non-crypto users too by introducing an over-the-counter (OTC) feature. The price of one HVN is set at EUR 1, and the price on HitBTC is currently around approx EUR 0.01. There’s even a USD/HVN fiat gateway at Livecoin. These seem to be the biggest gifts that Hiveterminal are giving the crypto community, and the prudent are accumulating already. The HVN token is essential to view and access the platform (currently HVN 50) and the investor fee of 1% of the funded invoice is also paid in HVN.  If invoice financing, factoring and audit really are perfect fits for blockchain technology, as argued by the Big 4 (PwC, E&Y, Deloitte and KPMG), then the future looks very bright indeed for this little Balkan beauty. They’ll be having a nose around soon enough, simply because they’re the only factoring platform on CoinMarketCap that’s actually generating significant revenue.",False

Dont get me wrong, thats VERY bad busines practice by Kucoin, but they did not extort money from them like Hive Project claimed to be.... Furthermore Verify did publish their bad experience with Kucoin, obviously they are not afraid that other exchanges won't deal with them anymore.

With that attitude I have a problem with!  And if you sit back and think about all the hints, you would realize what will be clear in the end of 2018, that HVN will fail.

Also, why would you pay the extra money they want when you're on the cusp of releasing your platform, doesn't sound like a good allocation of funds.

If I would have a sound business concept I'd wish that the ""competition shills"" come and ask so I could crush them with arguments. (As long as they behave well, alot of members who discussed well-mannered got banned!) If the use case and concept is strong why fear critical questions? Stay on topic instead of getting personal (""you are competition, you are an idiot, you are a clown, you dont have many posts here..."") and let the bulletproof concept speak for itself!    In terms of exchange, point out any top 20 exchange that lists shit coins left and right? Bittrex is on a massive delisting spree, the opposite is actually true. Binance rarely lists coins now too, maybe on or two every couple weeks. Its tough to be listed now and the token has been approved they're just waiting for their turn. Bittrex didn't list a new ERC20 token for AGES because of their Ethereum wallet issue, I'm sure they have a huge line up...  DYOR... provide constructive conversation... both these accounts have 1 and 3 posts respectively on bitcointalk... clearly no actual intent going on here      Okay I'll make it easy for you and do your research #DYOR    This are the coins BINANCE #1 Exchange by volume listed in the last month: -QLC -WAN -XEM -QTUM/BNB and QTUM/USDT Trading Pairs -STORM -ONT -ZIL -POA -NCASH -RPX  This are the coins OKEX #2 Exchange by volume listed in the last month: -ONT -DADI -WFEE -REN -TRIO -RFR -GSC -AUTO -GTC -TRA -BKX -ABT -MITH -BEC -INSUR   This are the coins UPBIT #4 Exchange in volume listed in the last month: EMC2, VTC, ARDR, STORM, ICX, EOS, SRN, WAX, ZRX, BCPT, VEE, TRX, TUSD, LRC, XMR, PIVX, DASH, ZEC   Okay, lets get a little bit further down the list. This are the coins BIT-Z #12 exchange in volume listed in the last month: PC, VCT, UC, GBC, BCV, CRE,  BTV, WOC, PXC, ECOM, PIX, SGCC    You asked me to point 1 exchange, which lists shit coins left and right. Are 4 exchanges enough or do you need more? #DYOR    You cant make up your own reality just because HVN doesnt get listed and the random fact that Bittrex delists many coins. That doesn't mean no coins get listed on other TOP20 exchanges, just to find an explaination for the (soon to be) broken promise of listing HVN.  As said the excessive censoring and unsucessfull attempts to list HVN on a reliable exchange points to problems behind the curtains. It seems they have money problems, else they would just pay for their listings (and dont need to ask members to lobby/vote for their listing). We will know it for sure in a few days. Lets see!",False

Those providers will be integrating the Hive Project platform directly into the ERP software the business users already work in every day. This means that the users will not need to know about or understand blockchain technology or cryptocurrency in order to load their unpaid invoices into the Hive Platform. They will briefly interact with the same ERP software they use everyday and the invoices will be available for buyers to purchase. There are more details of course, and I suggest you join the telegram group and ask for Oliver Muldoon if you would like more specifics. The bottom line is that there should be a very low barrier to entry for businesses to sell their invoices and get the financial liquidity that they need.  In case anyone does not know, ERP stands for enterprise resource planning. In companies, the term ""enterprise"" is often used to describe business processes that encompass all departments or elements of the business. Basically, this is the critical software that is used to run the business and Hive will be built right into it as another essential piece of daily operations.  So far, they are partnered with Adacta, which covers a 700 billion dollar invoice factoring market consisting of Central and Eastern Europe as well as Russia.  In addition, they have also recently completed deals that will cover the huge Latin American and Turkish markets.  Hive also has important partnerships with Lendoit, InsurePal and FintruX which will help it succeed and shows the seriousness of the project.

However, the butcher still wants to expand. The butcher goes to Hive Project and publishes its expansion business plan there, looking to issue bonds worth EUR 10 million in total. With real-time credit scoring and triple entry accounting, any investors would be able to have a real-time insight into how credit worthy the butcher is and how viable its expansion plans actually are. Everything is 100% transparent and immutable because it is on the blockchain.  •  If the butcher requires liquidity, he is limited to the invoices he was waiting to be settled. Let’s say that the total amount would be something like EUR 200,000, that would be peanuts in comparison to the EUR 10 million required for expansion. Therefore, factoring may end up representing just 5% of Hive Project’s income, with the other 95% coming from other revenue streams such as bond issuances, loan issuances and so on.  •  Forget about invoice factoring. Hive Project’s real-time credit scoring and triple entry accounting will serve as a powerful platform for a variety of revenue streams. The figures in the business plan are a joke because they are extremely conservative. So multiply all the revenues by 100x if these guys start issuing bonds.  •  Hive Project hired Gregor Storman from Sberbank, Russia’s biggest bank, and this expansion is the reason why he was hired.  •  Ignore exchanges and just focus on delivering the platform.  •  Start thinking pragmatically. Only one more QUALITY exchange is required.  •  The biggest task will be to continue making deals with ERPs and convincing end users to start using the service.  •  The biggest potential will come from any financial instruments where real-time and flawless credit scoring is required, basically everything Hive Project will be able to provide.",False

It gives users the ability to register for an account, verify their e-mail address and interact with the platform as an invoice buyer, invoice seller and the SME’s original customer. It is a fully clickable demonstration of the Hive Project Platform capabilities and interacts with a private instance of the Ethereum blockchain.  Hive Project Platform v1 - Q2 2018  Hive Project Platform will be released to the public. It will allow for invoices to be bought and sold. It will also feature a KYC system and a multi-tier verification system that will allow for different functionalities based on the roles and permissions for each user tier. The Hive Project Platform will feature the first ERP integration, which will allow SMEs to upload their unpaid invoice to the Hive Project Platform using tooling they use on a daily basis and are familiar with.

We’ve had an unbelievable year here at Hive Project HQ, making not only December a month to remember, but also 2017 a year to remember too! When we started our crowd-sale, even our wildest dreams were blown away when we released our DEMO version a mere 6 months later — with a strong business lined up and ready to be plugged in too! And when reading through our Telegram channel and social media, it becomes increasingly clear how much strong progress we have made in becoming a real fintech giant to be reckoned with!  Ending 2017 in Style: A DEMO Revealed — Backed up with First Business Deals!  It has been an epic journey. Since our award-winning ICO, Hive Project has progressed from promise and potential to becoming a recognized and trusted fintech brand with a DEMO version of the platform to show, but there is still no end in sight to our progress. My team and I are still working all-nighters to deliver the first ever blockchain based platform to give SMEs worldwide fast and low-cost liquidity. And on time too, just as we promised. We just keep on delivering: our Proof of Concept (PoC) in Las Vegas and the DEMO version a week ago being two examples!  The fact that we have been focusing solely on the product and ensuring its long-term future by backing it up with business deals is, in my opinion, the best investment in Hive Project’s bright future! There is no time for bulls**it here. We are here to deliver and create long-term value for our contributors! And that is why it gives me such great pleasure to get so much feedback, emails and phone calls of support and praise from SMEs (debtors) and investors (factors) from all over the world! This confirms that we are on the right path to achieving success, and we will continue to work just as hard in the future. For those asking about how you can test out our DEMO, you can play around with it HERE! As my co-founder and CTO, Dejan Jovanovic, explained, the Hive Project DEMO is a fully clickable demonstration of the Hive Project Platform’s capabilities, and interacts with a private instance of the Ethereum blockchain. With added functionalities, drastically improved performance and an intuitive user experience, I believe we have made a crucial first step towards ensuring the Hive Project Platform’s long-term viability.  And when adding our first ERP deal (!) and the FUNDS (!) committed in our “Jump-Start Liquidity Pool” to the equation, it is now becoming crystal clear that 2018 will be HUGE for Hive Project and our amazing community of contributors!  2018: SCALING UP TO A €2.5 TRILLION MARKET!  With our development team working wonders on a daily basis, we have been keeping pace with the business side too. We made our TELEGRAM ONLY ANNOUNCEMENT on our ERP deal just last week — going public with Hive Project’s integration into a leading regional ERP provider for SMEs. We are delighted that Adacta (https://www.adacta.si/) has seen what Hive Project Platform can bring to the table for their customers, and that they will fully integrate us into their systems. With this agreement now signed, sealed and delivered, we are already working on other ERP providers to follow. For now, however, we will be making Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Germany, the Czech Republic, the UK and Russia (!) our first go-to markets when delivering our platform during the period Q2 to Q3 of 2018 — and there will be more countries to come!  Tomaz Volk, Founder and Managing Partner of Adacta Holding: “Hive Project’s blockchain-based liquidity-providing platform is a unique solution for SMEs around the world. It is a truly revolutionary product and we are looking forward to implementing it into our systems and making it available to our clients.” For more information about Adacta, please check here: https://www.adacta.si/  With a powerful business backing up our development, we are surer than ever that we will deliver exactly what we promised — and create long-term value for our contributors in the process! The numbers are there for everyone to see. And we believe that that the targets set in the Business Roadmap Summary are eminently realistic and achievable.  Let there be no doubt about it. Our first go-to markets have incredible potential, including powerhouses of the European economy, and we will do our best to continue delivering as we have done so often until now!  With 5.67 million small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in Russia (!) and an annual turnover of USD 2.5 trillion for the companies in our first go-to markets alone (!!), we have laid strong foundations for our success and scaling up in 2018! Although we made some strong steps toward success in 2017, I am certain that we will make giant leaps forward in 2018, and make Hive Project a fintech unicorn in the process! Our team is extremely dedicated and highly motivated, and our amazing community continues to back us up. So, here’s to making 2018 a year of success for Hive Project!",False

Even though the owners will make a solid profit.  Anyway, you can not blame other guys here who are angry because they can not withdraw their tokens from hitbtc so they see it as a big problem. I've faced the same problem and if you got decent money in the tokens (project), it makes you desperate and hopeless.  Also you can be sure that my post has nothing to do with FUDing. I hate FUDs just like we all do, but between expressing real problems and FUDing is a big difference.  Without decent new exchange soon this project fades away.

The transaction was pending for 5 days until I've received it. I 've already posted this issue I had around that date on this thread.  I've also tried, just like hundreds of others to contact hitbtc via email and at their website support page. No reaction at all from their side, just one email from a bot that they are sorry and I have to be patient.  So my suggestion is: stay relaxed, you will not (99,99%) loose your tokens, it just takes so much fucking patience and I know how frustrating this is.  The bottom line is that we need better exchange asap just like me and others suggested on this thread. However I don't know what it takes to be listed on big exchange.

I more or less ignore everyone's posts and just scroll down focusing on stuff from Hive (Oliver Muldoon). This is what I gathered from his posts...  - They were supposed to release the business plan 12/15 but it's not quite ready yet. They would rather get it 100% correct than release it just to hit a deadline. This is what caused a lot of the drama as it goes against the ""always deliver on promise"" statement Hive is known for.  - The demo version of the product is still 100% on track for the 12/21 release.  - They suspect Q1 2018 is when they will go live  - No new exchanges yet, but it will eventually happen. Oliver re-iterated that hitbtc is fine for now. Personally I have bought some on hitbtc and livecoin. I like livecoin better but hitbtc has more volume and its easier to get it cheaper there.  Overall I'm happy with this coin. I'm not a huge investor in it, but that more or less boils down to my lack of money:) I have around 12k coins. I could get out now with 2-3x gains, but I'm staying in. I like that there are actually faces behind the coin and known developers which I think is important. I'm excited to see what comes out on the 21st. I think it has a lot of potential especially with the ERP.  Now I'm going to try and do some math which may or may not be right They stated in one of their blog posts:      So to me 700 Billion Euros is $822,444,000,000 USD. I'm assuming this is the amount of money tied up in invoices in a year? If we divide this by 365 it means $2,253,271,232 is tied up in invoices each day. With 375,000,000 coins it would mean each coin would have to be about $6 to compensate for this. Obviously these are rough numbers. I don't fully understand how the HVN token is used in all this. Perhaps the same token can be used and re-used several times a day to settle invoices. That would mean the price per coin could be lower. Then on the other hand not all 375 million coins are going to be available. Some will be stored away in investor's wallets so I suspect that will drive up the price. And perhaps the 700 billion Euros mentioned is just potential market they could pull in. To me it's not real clear if with the ERP deal if they can already expect that piece of the market or if that is just best case scenario that they could achieve if they work hard enough.",False

Unfortunatelly it is not positive. I'm quoting the post above me because it is very true statement. I'm waiting for my withdrawal from that scam crook hitbtc exchange for over two days at this moment.  Here are the details: Address: XXXXX1d22cCF134154d3e688b19B26039A76bXXXXX Transaction hash: 0xdaaffa5b4a618d3a89379e4c09aea534cc7b5ef925ef4fe17977823e43b13fbe Operation ID: 64d77b1f-0066-425e-9bb1-4a0553a9c435 Date Created (UTC): 06/12/2017, 14:09:32 Date Updated (UTC): 06/12/2017, 14:09:32  You can even see that they are unable to locate the transaction hash. At the main account it just shows ""You have a pending transaction""  I bought pretty decent amount of HVN tokens and now I'm really afraid if I will ever see them in my Trezor wallet. Hitbtc exchange doesn't response at all and there are hunderds of similar posts on their website at support section, on their facebook, twitter and also on the web in general.  The sad thing is they announce listing of new coins and right under that is 45 posts where are people claiming their withdrawals. And it is not just a ETH or ERC20 tokens, but also BTC atc.  Get a good and trusted exchange, that is mandatory. Otherwise you can throw your project into the recycle bin because no one should deposit any kind of money to that cripled hitbtc exchange if they don't want to lose their money, which means no one should buy your tokens in order not to lose money.  And if HVN tokens are only at crook hitbtc exchange, no one will buy them and your project is over. GET A BETTER EXCHANGE NOW!!! I'm really very pissed and angry.  Otherwise I like the project and everything about it, thats why I've invested couple of hundreds bucks into HVN tokens. Obviously apart of the exchange",False

I like seeing active developers who put their face behind their coin. To me that's the most important thing. Excited to see beta coming out in the next few weeks. Just trying to predict future prices. If it really is a 3 trillion dollar market, lets say hvn takes just 5% of that market. At any given day with the 375,000,000 coin supply the price per coin would need to be around $1.09.  ((3,000,000,000,000 * 0.05)/365)/375000000 = $1.09  However that assumes all the coins in circulation are being used. Really some of them will be off the market in MEW wallets. So I suspect the price could be much higher; even higher if they take over a larger percentage of the market.

HitBtc is a troll heaven , an exchange that can only do harm to a company's/coin's credibility. I am a HVN believer and investor , and it is frustrating to see such price manipulations on HitBTC.  The volume most times is low , the buy and sell orders are forming nothing but walls , forcing the small investors to either buy high or sell low.  Its the worst thing guys , the worst thing..  Yesterday it was a freak show , no one really cared about the news on that exhange. Everybody started dumping 20 minutes prior to any news getting released. So , anyone that states that "" the news were not worthy and thats why the coin lost 30% "" is either a liar , a fudster or a day trader and not a real investor.  Yesterdays news were AWESOME. But , many people cant and wont care about the long term sustainability of the company and simply follow the "" buy the rumor - sell the news "" rule of the speculators guide book.  Thats what it is guys , and it happens to all coins.  Short term profits and small time ""investors"" who seek to earn a buck or two and buy a lambo in a week.  It is trully a pitty.

PPT does have a working demo and has had it for awhile now.  PPT is already finished with their BETA testing and are finishing up on some last minute things before release of BETA to the public.  Can someone with knowledge of HIVE tell me why the 2018 expected value is only to be 1 USD?  Seriously!! PPT projected to hit $1000 around summer time and HIVE is in the same space as Populous.   Not sure how this is the best crypto of 2017 yet it will soon have a fully functional product but yet HOPEFULLY a dollar in valuation per coin in 2018.  I find that a bit strange.  I mean circulating supply plays a little bit of the reason but really it doesn't matter.  What matters is the market cap of the company.  See IOTA if you don't believe my previous statement.  And they have 2.8 billions tokens roughly.  Just find it a bit weird is all.  Don't forget etherdelta as well as an exchange.  Great place to buy coins...not sure why everyone hates on ED...i find it easy to use and it's decentralized vs the other exchanges.,False

Marketing isn’t something we’ve talked about much since the completion of our award-winning ICO. And, yes of course, we could certainly do more to attract attention to our revolutionary product. But it is important to understand that, without strong development also in place, the net result would be artificial hype, high peaks and even lower dips. Instead, we have been following up on the promises we have made to deliver, and have been focusing all our efforts on getting the Hive Project Platform up and running! And that’s a big reason why we consistently hit our targets and milestones. Every time this happens, we show the fruits of our efforts to our community and other world-class experts, cryptocurrency founders, executives and traders — take, for example, the unveiling of our PROOF OF CONCEPT in Las Vegas, which brought the crypto-community to its feet!   We are thrilled by all the support we have received and the trust we are given every single day. And all of our team are working flat out to ensure this faith is justified. Not only are we consistently talked about in the same breath as global industry leaders, we are also steadily consolidating our growing reputation through various articles, mentions and interviews in the media for the “old” economy — giving us visibility among small businesses in the region. A December to remember!  Despite having being relatively restrained until now with our marketing efforts for Hive Project, we will be looking to spread awareness and increase our coverage in the media in the days and weeks ahead. There are just a few days now remaining until we take the global stage at The Future of Money and Technology Summit on December 4, where the best and brightest visionaries in the financial and FinTech worlds will come together for a conference with global media coverage to discuss the future of cryptocurrencies.  While our CFO & Hive Project board member Ugur Yildirim discusses the future of Hive Project with industry leaders, sharing the stage with JP Morgan and Capital One, among others, the rest of us will be attracting further positive attention and global visibility by keeping FinTech & cryptocurrency founders, executives & traders up to date with all our latest progress and developments at the main exhibitor booth in the conference hall. AND STRONG ANNOUNCEMENTS WILL BE MADE THERE TO THE CRYPTO AND FINTECH MEDIA IN ATTENDANCE!  With some even more amazing and newsworthy content on its way, things are once again shaping up for us to be the centre of media attention this month. After winning at CoinAgenda in Barcelona and successfully completing our ICO, history looks set to repeat itself in terms of the column inches we get. Those recent successes attracted coverage from media outlets such as Nasdaq, Finance Magnates, Econotimes, The-Blockchain, and CoinSpectator, to name just a few, helping us to “level up” in terms of our progress as a FinTech brand.  “STRONG ANNOUNCEMENTS WILL BE MADE THERE TO THE CRYPTO AND FINTECH MEDIA IN ATTENDANCE!” As always, all the news you need to hear will be available first on our Hive Project Announcements channel. If you’re not a member there, you won’t be the first to hear about our updates. So, join up now and stay tuned for the truly festive season we have in store.  HVN X20  in dec!

As our first market, it is absolutely crucial that we establish powerful levels of general recognition and trust among SMEs in the region. And, as you can see from our progress to date, we have already made huge inroads. Now, however, it is time to step things up a notch.

In addition to helping build general awareness of Hive Project, Jure’s interview has been included as a key story in their mailing list — reaching over 20,000 small businesses in Slovenia! Those of our contributors who can understand Slovenian can read the interview with Jure HERE. However, for the majority who don’t understand the language, we have provided a translation into English below. Onwards and upwards!  Hive Project: a Revolutionary Solution for SMEs Around the World With cryptocurrencies and tokens now the buzzwords on everyone’s lips in the world of finance, the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are skyrocketing. And there has been a similar rise in the number of crypto companies on the market that issued tokens in exchange for funds raised during their Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).  Although there are several credible companies on the market with a focus on doing things the right way, there are also an increasing number of fraudsters that threaten to damage the whole industry. The recent widespread enthusiasm for all things crypto related has been a popular breeding ground for scammers and unscrupulous characters. They take advantage of people with next to no knowledge of crypto with promises of vast sums of money to be made. However, with either no product or a product with no value, these millions in raised funds do nothing to sustain the token’s long-term value. “Unfortunately, where there is money to be made, there will also be individuals looking to take advantage of people who have not done their due diligence,” explained Jure Soklic, CEO of Hive Project, a fintech company that will be launching an online factoring platform soon. The Hive Project Platform is based on blockchain technology, and awareness of its benefits are only just becoming known to the general public. These advantages include a continuously growing list of data records that are linked by a blockchain network. When doing that, you get new blocks and new block programme codes, which are secured cryptographically, checked by multiple users, and are dependent on the information contained in previous blocks in the chain.  Jure Soklic and I both agree that there is a pressing need to help the general public learn more about cryptocurrencies, the ICO fundraising process and blockchain technology in general, which serves as the basis for many of the products proposed. There is also a popular mistaken belief that tokens will always rise in price. It is crucial to remember that any investment in blockchain technology projects comes with risk. You could lose everything you invest, so a cautious and prudent approach is advised.  The Hive Project team is international in scope, comprising financial experts, platform developers, marketing and communications experts from all over the world. Although headquartered in Ljubljana, Slovenia, part of the development team are based abroad. “All key decisions are taken here,” Jure Soklic explained, “and that will continue to remain the case”. Hive Project’s ambitions and potential for growth have earned the trust of over 2,200 contributors, with just under USD 9 million raised in funding. Q: You won Best ICO of 2017 at CoinAgenda Global. How did you go about convincing the judging panel?  The judging panel, which comprised several global blockchain experts, were persuaded by the concept behind Hive Project and the proposed product, the platform itself. They took the view that the team had the right blend to fulfil potential for substantial growth. The critical factors, however, were the platform’s global nature and its ability to open up affordable invoice financing solutions to small businesses around the world. The judging panel took various factors into consideration. These included the strength of the team and the marketing strategy in place — we also delivered a live presentation, which was crucial. The spotlight fell, in particular, on our developers since technical expertise was considered a critical factor. In Barcelona we were up against several new blockchain projects, but our team’s international experience proved to be (and remains) a big advantage for us.  Q: Your platform is based on platform technology. What kind of problems does it solve? Hive Project will open up a new source of liquidity to small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) around the world. To be more precise, we will be changing the way they get access to liquidity. Using blockchain technology to automate the factoring process will give small companies entry to a market — and all the associated benefits — that has until now simply been too time consuming and costly, leaving a vast market unserved. The credit data we collect will give us the opportunity to offer credit scoring services on SMEs to invoice purchasers, which will be made available for them to buy so that they have all the information they need to assess their risk appetite. This will be launched prior to the launch of our peer-to-peer (P2P) lending phase.  What will the Hive Project Platform focus on? Our platform’s key assets will be its speed, process automatization and transparency. Since user-friendliness will be paramount, SMEs and liquidity investors will only need to carry out just a few simple steps to get up and running. As our Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates, the Hive Project Platform is the answer to the lengthy and complicated procedures we have become so accustomed to in the so-called “old” economy. When will your platform be available to the market?  Three months after our successful campaign, we presented our Proof of Concept at CoinAgenda Global in Las Vegas, and we are now working on the beta version of the Hive Project Platform. Although we are setting ourselves almost impossible deadlines, the team has hit every milestone promised. We will have presented the updated beta version of the platform by the end of the year, and we will launch the platform in early 2018. How many people are there in the team, where are your premises and where do you see yourself being located in a few years from now? The Hive Project team is international in scope, comprising financial experts, platform developers, and marketing and communications experts from all over the world. Full details of our team can be found here (insert link to team page). Although headquartered in Ljubljana, Slovenia, part of the development team are based abroad. However, all key decisions are taken here and that will continue to remain the case. You raised money through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). How much did you raise? We concluded our campaign on 14 August this year, raising almost USD 9 million in the process. This was a huge success and we fully understand that we now have a responsibility and duty to deliver on what we promised over the long term.  What is an ICO? “ICO” is an acronym for Initial Coin Offering. It is a way of raising of money, and is a similar concept to the more traditional IPO. In our ICO, we sold cryptocurrency tokens to contributors in exchange for funding. The tokens issued, which are called Hive Tokens (HVN), can be used by the contributors to trade on crypto exchanges all over the world. Many are predicting that cryptocurrencies will disappear — but that blockchain technology will stay.  Well, blockchain technology is already changing the world, in much the same way as the Internet revolutionised everything we do. However, in the early days of the world wide web, we had little idea what lay in store and so I would be hesitant to make any predictions now. And when it comes to cryptocurrencies, since we are talking about startups, the future is even more ambiguous. What is clear, however, is that the cryptocurrency issuers that deliver on their key objectives and products will survive. That’s why we are doing everything in our power to ensure that our platform is delivered as promised and that it will be used by small businesses around the world.  What does blockchain technology have in store for us over the next 10 years? Will it make life easier for people and businesses? Yes, both. But not only that — blockchain technology will be used by the public sector too. Take the health sector, for example. Have big companies already integrated blockchain technology into their day-to-day business? Can you, as a small company but with a very innovative idea, offer them something more? Some leading global companies, including banks, are already testing blockchain technology in their day-to-day processes. But progress doesn’t happen overnight. When it comes to innovation, even the biggest companies in the world need start-ups to help out — that is the fastest way to develop, test and rollout any high-quality product. Slovenia is one of the leading countries in this industry, and so we always see many familiar faces at the blockchain tech conferences we attend.  Does the general public understand what blockchain technology is and what the differences between cryptocurrencies are? It is true that the general public does not have enough knowledge about cryptocurrencies, and we support any efforts made, whether it be from newspaper articles, lecturers or round tables, to get people educated about blockchain technology and help spread awareness. There is not enough open discussion about the high risks involved with buying cryptocurrencies. As the old saying goes, all the glitters is not gold. The biggest financial institutions are investing in this new technology. It’s a hot topic all over the world, including Slovenia. Are there any legal or other obstacles to overcome? Do you enjoy the support of regulators? Thus far, we have not experienced any legal or regulatory issues, and we support any efforts made by legislators to regulate this new industry. Are we Slovenians really pioneers in the crypto-world?  Well, perhaps not quite pioneers — there are so many great projects from various countries all over the world. However, the media spotlight on some Slovenian companies has been particularly high. We hope that, despite Slovenia’s relative small size, we can show the world that we can come up with some big solutions.  More and more outspoken and successful investors from the financial world are issuing public warnings about the dangers of cryptocurrencies, with some even calling them pyramid schemes. When there aren’t enough people who want to buy bitcoin to push price up, everything will collapse. Why have we seen so many warnings like this in recent months? Where there is money, you will also find unscrupulous and dishonest people who want to take advantage of naive people or those who have not fully researched the industry. I would advise anyone looking to trade currencies to take all necessary precautions to ensure that their decisions have a solid basis and rationale behind them. Take care not to let greed influence a rational decision. Wise investors allocate only a very small part of their portfolio to crypto and disperse their investments widely to mitigate risk.  It looks like that the crypto industry attracts scammers who want to take advantage of people who are naive and lack knowledge about crypto. How big is this problem? It is the responsibility of law enforcement institutions to deal with scammers and other undesirable characters. And it is crucial that we all focus on our responsibilities — towards the media, other companies and the authorities. We would urge those looking to purchase tokens to take time to do their research. Thoroughly investigate the project, leave no stone left unturned and look into the people behind it. We have been moving at such a rapid pace in such a short time, and we’re all so busy, I don’t really have the time to scrutinise every project out there in detail. Almost all of my time is dedicated to Hive Project. Will bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency ever overtake fiat currency or at least become its equivalent?  That is a difficult question to answer because this decision is in the hands of the central banks, and the likelihood of this happening will vary from country to country. However, Christine Lagarde, executive director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) delivered a recent speech in which she said that cryptocurrencies will become a reality in the decades to come and will complement national currencies.",False

Well, it’s been almost 2 weeks now since I took over responsibility for Hive Project’s community management and I am delighted with what I have seen. With contributors and supporters from all over the world, and from all walks of life, it has been a valuable and intriguing experience getting to know you all. Thank you for all the offers of support and help I have received since taking on the position. Many of you have helped welcome new arrivals, assisted with general questions and boosted our efforts in raising awareness — I’m grateful for all of that. It’s also been great to hear from small business owners who are also token holders, and how keen you all are to start using the Hive Project Platform when it is launched. We have a real mix of good people in our community, and that’s what I like to see — regardless of your reasons for getting involved in Hive Project, I will do my very best to get you any info you need and help with any Hive Project related questions you may have.  Weekly overview So, we’ve had yet another week packed with great news here at Hive Project HQ. Starting the week the right way, our CTO, Dejan Jovanovic, gave some exciting insights into our product development progress (you can read the full in-depth interview HERE). As you will see, Dejan and his development team are dedicated to giving our users the ultimate user experience. But did we stop there? No. On Tuesday, we announced our partnership with Lendoit, which promises to be a real win-win-win for Hive Project, Lendoit and our many contributors (check out our Twitter announcement HERE). Then, continuing to push ahead, on Wednesday, our CEO published his review of Hive Project’s first three months and everything we have achieved so far. As you can see, it is clear that the solid foundations required to take Hive Project up to the next level are now in place, and we are well and truly here to stay. The future for Hive Project looks bright — both over the short and long term.  With our CEO making his statement on the progress made during our first quarter, Domen and Gal (our CMO & Platform Delivery Lead) took to the airwaves on the Neocash Radio podcast to discuss our ICO campaign, our development progress and the Hive Project Platform itself with the Neocash host, Pedro. Based in Manchester, New Hampshire, the Neocash Radio podcast is one of the best known crypto podcasts in the world, and we are looking forward to engaging with their knowledgeable and shrewd audience. The podcast will be up to listen to late this evening (around 00.00 hrs UTC), and we will post links on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Reddit, Bitcointalk and, of course, our official Telegram channel.  Ramping up our marketing efforts! With our development team buried away and 100% focused on getting the Hive Project Platform up and running, the rest of the team have been focused on marketing — we understand the importance of consolidating trust and, above all, visibility, among our key target audiences: small businesses and other future users of the platform, existing and future HVN token holders, and the crypto-world too. As you will have no doubt noticed, we are monitoring all of our key channels closely, giving all existing and potential contributors frequent and consistent updates and (very close to) real-time responses to enquiries. We will continue providing you with the reports and good news you need in the weeks ahead. As you know, Hive Project’s successes have already yielded some special treatment, and we have been allocated yet another booth at yet another prestigious international conference. This time we will be at The Future of Money & Technology Summit in San Francisco, the mecca of the fintech industry.  This will boost our overall presence and put us in the spotlight once again. This event is only two weeks away and promises to be just as exciting as CoinAgenda Global in Las Vegas, when we reached USD 1 million in 24-hour trading volume. One thing is absolutely certain. Our short and long-term futures are very bright indeed. As always, keep in touch with Hive Project on our TELEGRAM channel for the latest news and updates from our team.

Thanks for sharing so much quality info   Q: Speaking of the Proof of Concept, what lays ahead? What changes do you plan to introduce? The current version of the Proof of Concept is a Meteor application that users need to download to their computer and run to test. At this stage of development, it takes a user with some technical know-how to do that. However, in the next iteration of the Proof of Concept, which is scheduled to be released by the end of the year, that paradigm will be changed.  We’re already designing sitemaps, wireframes and user flows for the Hive Project platform and it is likely that we will provide that in the form of a mock-up application that allows our design & development teams to enter a rapid prototyping cycle. This Hive Project Platform application will become an integral component in the roadmap for both of those teams and will give the Hive Project community an insight into our day-to-day work. In order to demo both sides of the platform, users will be able to register and choose whether they would like to take on the role of invoice buyer or invoice seller. We expect some users will in fact use the platform in both roles, and so we need to give them the ability to test all the functionalities on both.  Q: What are the biggest technical challenges Hive Project has to master? The biggest challenge that Hive Project has to overcome is the performance of the public blockchain. The current delay on the public blockchain is at least 17 seconds, which is the time required to create a new block. This is not acceptable from a user perspective and this is one of the reasons why we are looking at technologies such as Tindermint or Hyperledger to tackle this.   Q: How many people are involved with Hive Project Platform development at this point & what are your plans for scaling? Currently we have a team of 5 resources as part of our delivery team, focusing on areas such as project management, UX designer, developers and QA. Currently I am planning to keep the team small and agile, but there is potential in the future to add more development resources for additional products and DAPPs, such as, for example, a mobile investors app.  Q: You spend most of your waking hours building the Hive Project Platform. If you had to single out its most important feature, what would it be? The first thing that comes to mind is that it needs to be an amazing user experience. It must be incredibly easy to engage with, not only for the SMEs seeking financing but also for the invoice buyers during the peer-to-peer lending phase. The Hive Project Team will deliver a high-tech product that is complemented by great design. And if the experience — from uploading the invoice to the Hive Project Platform to invoice settlement — is straightforward and runs smoothly, then the users of the platform are much more likely to return again and again.",False

Our strategy to get SMEs on board will be to integrate ERPs – this represents the pinnacle of our go-to market strategy – and this also addresses the problems associated with the network effect and adoptability. We will be able to get thousands of SMEs and invoices on the system in one go, putting your concerns about volume to rest almost immediately. Lenders and auditors will be able to use the data for audits, when making financing decisions and to improve the accuracy of their credit scoring processes. They will appreciate that the data is stored on blockchain and is therefore immutable and easy to access. The reason why ERPs are our entrance point is because they already have vast user pools with lots of data, are trusted, and it is also possible to integrate the platform with supply chain systems. This leads to further possibilities for automating the process.  As you will see, it makes more sense to go down this route rather than attempt to win customers that are already there for us. Once these deals are in place, SME owners will be able to get the liquidity they need through a simple click in their accounting program. And that is why we are working around the clock to create the system needed to achieve that. Our platform is in high demand among ERPs worldwide and they cannot wait for us to deliver on what we have promised. I hope that helps explain things",False

However, we believe that the future success of the platform is dependent on strong foundations being built. We have done that in a variety of ways.  We have been making tremendous efforts to get the word out there about Hive Project, and we're always looking to improve and communicate our message. Following on from our CEO, Jure's, appearance on the panel at the Finance cryptocurrency conference in Slovenia, one of our first markets in Q1 2018, we received widespread media coverage in the national press there. As we want to be seen primarily among SMEs and investors, we are channelling all our efforts in this direction — with interviews and articles in the regional business media. This has been critical to paving the way for our successful penetration of that market when we commence funding. As you may know, the team recently returned from CoinAgenda in Las Vegas too, where we had an exhibitor booth and unveiled our Proof of Concept (PoC) to rapt attendees – being there was important in terms of building our reputation as a global fintech brand. Our PoC is available on our GitHub to play with. We will also be attending The Future of Money & Technology Summit in San Francisco, the biggest stage in the Mecca of the fintech industry, in December. There we will have another exhibitor booth, and our CFO, Ugur, will be a panellist. With previous conferences attracting the attention of media giants such as USA TODAY, TechCrunch, MarketWatch, CoinDesk, Gigaom and WePay, we believe this will serve as a huge boost to our global brand recognition efforts. We also have a thriving Telegram channel, where questions are answered in real time and open discussions are held about all things Hive Project related.  We also had lots to discuss with our host Pedro from http://neocashradio.com in a recent interview, again generating awareness of how blockchain will disrupt the invoice financing industry. The podcast should be available tonight and will be posted as a bonus segment in special interviews with various leaders in finance and economics, technology, blockchain, cryptocurrency, encryption, FinTech, and more. It will also be made available on iTunes / Soundcloud / Stitcher / YouTube / Google Play & iHeartRadio  We believe that coin price appreciation will come with real volumes and real supply and demand. With ready capital to be deployed through our platform in the form of our HVNX fund in Q1/2018, we will attract ERPs and SMEs to get up and running straight away. And the benefits are reciprocal because we then gain the data we need to lift the Hive Project up to the next level. Our CFO has been hard at work getting that all in place. We're the Best ICO of 2017, have a solid product, solid team, hit our milestones, have our Proof of Concept publicly available to be checked out and tested ... we will leave you decide You can see the work we are doing. We are all expecting these efforts - focusing on the real substance of the business - to bear fruit. Please let me know if you have any other concerns.",False

We are already making big strides in this direction. Following on from our CEO, Jure's, appearance on the panel at the Finance cryptocurrency conference in Slovenia, one of our first markets in Q1 2018, we received widespread media coverage in the national press there. As we want to be seen primarily among SMEs and investors, we are channelling all our efforts in this direction — with interviews and articles in the regional business media. This has been critical to paving the way for our successful penetration of that market when we commence funding. As you may know, the team just returned from CoinAgenda in Las Vegas too, where we had an exhibitor booth and unveiled our PoC to attendees – being there was important in terms of building our reputation as a global fintech brand. We will also be attending The Future of Money & Technology Summit, the biggest stage in the Mecca of the fintech industry, in December. There we will have another exhibitor booth, and our CFO, Ugur, will be a panellist. With previous conferences attracting the attention of media giants such as USA TODAY, TechCrunch, MarketWatch, CoinDesk, Gigaom and WePay, we believe this will serve as a huge boost to our global brand recognition efforts. These are just some of the ways we are looking to 'get the word out there' but we are constantly working hard to increase awareness.",False

So, to explain how HVN tokens fit in with the Hive Project Platform, we will be financing smaller invoices with HVN, which gives us more circulation and a positive impact on the price. HVN will also be used as the 'fuel' in other currency transactions (approx. 1% of the invoice value), opening up another source of demand for HVN. Moreover, all the services on the platform, including company audits, credit scores, risk report services, etc., will be paid in the HVN token equivalent of the fiat price. The company’s profits will be used to create treasury shares through buybacks to support the HVN token supply on the market as the product is used more. It is reasonable to assume that increased usage of HVN and the decrease in the amount available will increase the price. If, for example, an audit report costs EUR 2,000, that would be paid for in the HVN equivalent. Let’s say one day that EUR 2,000 audit report is valued at only 1 HVN token, the number of tokens versus the price would be regulated by the company as a function of the total revenues of the platform. We are working on delivering a product where the tokens are to be used, and to then buy back treasury tokens as required, since this creates buy side interest; token holders can also be on the sell side or use the tokens on the platform directly for their needs. What's more, token holders who are also liquidity providers will be better informed because they will be able to purchase credit scoring reports and see special deals on the platform. Say, for example, if we were also to implement another layer in the future, with HVN perhaps being accepted as currency in ICOs, the insurance of claims, etc. – as the functionally of the token increases, it would become more valuable, desirable by exchanges and generate more volume. I hope that answers your question",False

The cornerstone of our success, this high level of performance is set to continue and they deserve an immense amount of credit for their efforts. And, as Dejan has explained to the contributors gathered here in Las Vegas over the past few days, we will be deploying the Hive Project PoC source code to our GitHub in the days ahead — giving our community a chance to check out our progress first hand. Richard Titus, a renowned executive, serial entrepreneur and one of the Wired 100 in 2010, explained in a personal conversation why he is proud to support the project: “I am delighted with Hive Project’s progress! Their PoC announcement demonstrates serious progress into a real business environment and I am convinced they will make a huge difference to global finance.” (Richard D. Titus)  Revealing our short-term plan Now that our Proof of Concept has been unveiled, it is clear that we are now backing up our promises with a real-life business contribution. This only underlines what we have been talking about over the last few months — that we are here to stay and our focus is firmly on the project!  We are also making another leap toward creating a blockchain based liquidity platform for SMEs worldwide by posting our PoC online — for SMEs and investors to try for themselves — creating a large database of all parties involved. This will expedite the progress of our business when our liquidity-providing platform is up and running. Our CTO and Co-Founder, Dejan Jovanovic, will explain more about this and all the details behind our Proof of Concept in the days ahead.  Some final thoughts …  The future is bright. And the evidence is there that we are working as hard as humanly possible to make our platform a reality. Another important milestone has been achieved on time — this is crucial because it proves once again that we are more than capable of keeping our promises. My amazing team and I will continue to do whatever it takes to deliver what everybody expects — a blockchain based platform that gives SMEs fast and low-cost liquidity.  https://medium.com/hiveproject-net/hive-project-premiere-presenting-our-proof-of-concept-ed58417aa3f",False

I bought additional HVN at 300 sat and it was cheap. Now the price is even cheaper, I saddly ran out of money to buy more. Damn. 😁  You should not wasted all your money in ICO, but be smart and save and buy now double amount of Hive.  You know that old saying. Who waits, awaits. Patience is needed in Cryptoverse.   Maybe in 3 months time Hive will be once cheaper as it is now and 1 BTC will buy you 800k Hive.   BitCoin is a beast!!! You never know when he will go crazy.  I never went in at ico, i bought on first dip on hitbtc and a little bit later and now. So I can say am lucky for now with the prices I got. But as the project is promising I would buy more if i had  a chance.  You should take a loan. There are plenty of banks.  Sadly Hive is my family so I had to waste my moniez in ICO   I knew I should not, but you know blood is not water.      Anyway I come here to read some news, but I guess is just a pump",False

With our development team working around the clock to ensure that our proof of concept is finished on time, the rest of the team has been busy nurturing Hive Project’s reputation as a recognized & trusted fintech brand, not only in the cryptocommunity but also in the business world as a whole.  Gaining visibility and respect regionally …    Our team members are continuing to underline their presence as leading names in the industry through increased media exposure (interviews & quotes in the business media), helping to consolidate the increased recognition and respect that Hive Project has already established in the SEE region’s business community.  On 18 October we will continue to develop brand awareness in the region by serving on the panel at a cryptocurrency conference hosted by Finance, Slovenia’s only daily business and financial newspaper. There we will share the stage with other respected fintech and blockchain brands.    … and on the global stage  Following yesterday’s announcement regarding us taking our place among other respected brands and world-class experts at CoinAgenda Global, we have more good news about our presence there. As the last winners of CoinAgenda, we have been allocated a free exhibitor booth at the conference hall, where we will be able to further attract positive attention and global visibility by keeping fintech & cryptocurrency founders, executives & traders up to date with all our latest progress and developments.  Following CoinAgenda in October, we will also be sitting on the panel at The Future of Money & Technology Summit in San Francisco on 4 December. This summit brings together the best and brightest visionaries in the business world, including startup entrepreneurs, developers, press, investors, writers and service and solution providers.  Carving a path as one of the leading new fintech companies, we believe that our participation at these events demonstrates that Hive Project is already a very serious proposition and that our ideas and views on the future of the industry are of great interest to its brightest minds. Taking part will also give us the continued impetus required to ensure Hive Project’s long-term success as the first port of call for small businesses around the world that cannot access the liquidity they need.  And, of course, our new and updated website will also help a great deal to improve our visibility and all-round presence.      It gives us great pleasure to give you a quick sneak preview of our new website. As mentioned, we are focusing on the product itself and addressing SMEs globally. In addition to updating the content, we have also focused on user friendliness and making what we do as simple to understand as possible. We hope you like it.  Our vision remains the same — to help SMEs worldwide manage their financials like a corporation by providing them a blockchain based liquidity platform.    Making it happen — awaiting Monday’s announcement!  In order to achieve our goal of becoming a global business and brand, it is vital to make some strong inroads into the international business world. And our major announcement on Monday will include details about the fantastic addition we are making to the Hive Project in the days ahead.  So, please keep in touch!

We are actually at a loss for words when it comes to describing how important this addition is to Hive Project, so we will just quote one of the reactions from a contributor on Telegram after the announcement was made:      “Strong leadership is key. Congrats!”  New employees  We have now hired an office manager to run the day-to-day administration duties of the Hive Project team and to book meetings & travel arrangements for conferences. Our communication & support department has also been given a boost, with 2 new employees and 1 intern joining the team.  Our recruitment efforts focused on finding candidates with great communication skills, but also the ability to cover multiple areas quickly should the need arise. We are happy to report that they are already up to speed, assisting in both support & communication roles. The motto of both communication & support teams remains the same:      “Whether it is news, updates or help, our aim is to get those to you faster.”  More content  You can see now first-hand how much content Hive Project Team is currently generating to give you a better & deeper insight into the daily work we do. We will work hard to maintain this pace & bring you more glimpses into life at Hive Project HQ. Hive Project in the news: “SMEs, pay attention. This blockchain platform can save your business!”  Our CEO, Jure Soklic, has been interviewed in today’s edition of Finance, Slovenia’s only daily business and financial newspaper. Here are a few quotes:  “We’re currently finalizing the beta version of the platform,” Soklic explained, “which will be unveiled to the public by the end of the month. The launch of the Hive Project platform, which will help SMEs get the liquidity they need, is on target for the first quarter of 2018.”  “SMEs are at a disadvantage when looking for funding because they cannot take advantage of the same financial instruments as big corporations,” Soklic explained. “However, the Hive Project Platform is a game changer because its full data automation offers a fast track to liquidity for SMEs. The benefits of our platform are its simplicity, speed and full transparency — something that wasn’t available to SMEs in the old economy.”  “We will do everything we can to keep our contributors happy.”  This interview was published as an introduction to Jure Soklic’s panel appearance at Finance’s cryptocurrency conference, which will be taking place on 18 October.      There we will continue to develop brand awareness in the region by sharing the stage with other respected names from the fintech and blockchain industries.  The conference is the prelude to further appearances at CoinAgenda Global in Las Vegas between 24–26 October as well as The Future of Money & Technology Summit in San Francisco on 4 December.",False

Thanks for cheap HVN's  last few days    It’s been another hard-working week for our team, and we are closing down on completing yet another set of milestones. As Gal wrote yesterday, we have now finalized distribution to our early marketing supporters (bounty campaign) and are giving 100% to achieve our goal — the creation of a blockchain based liquidity platform for SMEs!  As I write this, our UX and design leads are making the finishing touches to our new website — focusing on the product itself and addressing SMEs worldwide. We have updated the content, making it more accessible and understandable to business owners. And last, but not least, we are also working on aesthetics, taking a big step forward for the brand.   BECOMING INDUSTRY LEADERS!  Winning Best ICO of 2017 at CoinAgenda Barcelona gave us high levels of exposure and recognition in the cryptocommunity, and we aim to keep that intact.  As a market leader, our team members will be presenting Hive Project and discussing the future of the industry at a selection of the biggest domestic, regional and global conferences.   I can already announce that we will be on the panel at CoinAgenda GLOBAL in Las Vegas later this month, taking our place among other world-class experts and cryptocurrency founders/executives/traders. We believe that the respect, visibility and presence we have built in the community will work wonders for us all in the long run as Hive Project continues to grow as a global business and brand.  Further announcements will be made in the days and weeks ahead regarding other fintech conferences where Hive Project team members will be attending as panellists and/or presenters.   PRESENTING PROOF OF CONCEPT!  The priority for us now is to deliver a working proof of concept and I am glad to confirm that we are on target for its debut — on the global stage in front of community leaders, cryptocurrency investors and other fintech representatives!   AMAZING ANNOUNCEMENTS COMING SOON!  Seeing our hard-working team in action and what we are achieving on a daily basis, I am surer than ever that the Hive Project will be a resounding long-term success.  Domen, our CMO, will be making some statements later this week regarding our mission to become a global brand, which will precede our main announcement on Monday.

Everyone hopes for the 10x on day one and nowadays, smaller exchanges are killing coins. I can think of Oax, Tierion, Zrx, Hive and Monetha have all suffered from this. Some more than others but those were pretty big, relatively high profile ICOs.  The good news is that you didn't get in the ICO, which I didn't, you don't have to pay a monstrous premium. The good and bad news for ICO investors is that obviously the price point isn't there but the good news is that once people dump, whales re-accumulate and the whole price suppression game begins. Plus, the price drop after a big multiple can make coins go dormant. People are still pissed that paid $6 for EOS on day one. It is my hope that the currently great price will be followed by a steady rise commensurate with progress. Which reminds me- I need to go buy some of HVN because you never know when it will take off.

Becouse....   A glance at Hive’s future: What’s next? It’s been an exciting journey so far. But now the hard work really begins. Our goal remains clear: to harness the power of blockchain technology to disrupt the invoice financing industry. That is why we have spent the majority of our time offline — working hard to get Hive financing small businesses as soon as possible. We are currently occupied with producing a working proof of concept, moving the company to Switzerland, expanding the team and forming the strategic alliances that will ensure our long-term success.  Exchanges First, we are delighted to confirm that Hive (HVN) is currently listed on two exchanges: HitBTC (https://hitbtc.com/) and Livecoin (https://www.livecoin.net/), and we are proud to report that we have exceeded USD 1 million in a 24-hour period since listing. Since Hive is still in its infancy, we are very proud of these results. More details on the third exchange will be announced within one month.  Token distribution I would also like to comment on the unforeseeable errors that took place during the HVN token distribution process. I can assure you that we, the Hive team, have covered all of the small loss incurred with our funds. Thank you again to those community-minded contributors who returned their double payments. It is actions like this that make us proud to be part of this community. The good news is that the distribution process is now more or less complete. The remaining undistributed tokens are owned by contributors who are focused purely on the long-term and so have yet to provide us with their wallet address. This is why 39.5% of the total token supply remains undistributed. Of this 39.5%, the percentage of funds allocated to the Hive team is now approximately 20%. As previously stated, the founders will not sell our shares (16%) within the next 12 months. In the interests of transparency, these funds will also be transferred into a separate wallet and made available for the public to view.  Communication and cutting the Slack … As already announced, we will be switching communication channels to Telegram soon because Slack has been subjected to too many spam and phishing attempts. As far as the business side of things is concerned, we are currently revamping our website and will launch a better channel for our contributors and token holders to communicate with us. We should be live in 10 days so stay tuned for more updates…  Recruitment As you may have learned from Gal’s most recent update on Slack, we are now in the middle of a global recruitment process for additional new support team members. We understand that we need to do this in order to get our communication with you where it should be. Once we find the right candidates and training is completed, we will then be better positioned to respond to your enquiries quicker. We are also recruiting people in business development, finance and product development. In order to cater for this increase in headcount and the work that lies ahead, we will also be moving from our current premises to a new office that will be able to accommodate our extended team. We want to be clear — you, our community, are one of our top priorities and immensely important to us.  Beta platform We are currently working on the Hive blockchain working Proof of Concept (PoC), which we plan to present to you within the next 4–6 weeks. Through this beta platform, you will be able to get a better understanding of how the smart contract will work, and precisely how Hive and blockchain are set to revolutionise the invoice factoring and financing industries. Please check our white paper here  Milestones We have fielded some queries about where exactly we are in our road map, and can confirm that we are currently on track to meet all of our intended objectives. We do everything within our power to meet our contributors’ expectations. Now that HVN has been listed, we will be steadily working through our stated goals.  Now that you have a financial interest and have contributed to what we are doing, we understand you need to be kept in the loop. We also understand how important it is for your confidence levels that we stick to our stated milestones and show you that we can be trusted to keep our word about the progress we make. If a deadline is missed, however, please do not think the worst. Rest assured that there is always a very good reason for any delay, but that everything remains under control. Again, in the interests of transparency, we will communicate updates on our progress — including any possible delays — clearly and promptly. We understand that you want to know what is going on with the project. But we would like to reassure you that if we are quiet and not responding, it is genuinely because we are working extremely hard to generate the future value we are all waiting for.  Help us help you …  Now, just sit back and relax. As you can see, barring some minor delays, we have fulfilled our promises and are working 24/7 to generate us all the product we all deserve. Help us help you and spread the word about what we are doing here. Perhaps you are a small business owner or know someone who is struggling to find funding. Do they know about blockchain, smart contracts and what we’re doing here at Hive? If not, please let them know! As promised, we are fully on track to commence with funding in Q1 2018.  We are relying on you, our community, to work with us to help push Hive on to even greater heights.",False

And, yes, it’s a great feeling to be involved in something so special right from the very start.  To help raise awareness and understanding about why you should join us on our quest, we have put together this handy 5-point guide for why you should join us at Hive!  1. Be the first: Hive Project is the first platform to use block chain technology in the invoice financing process, providing SMEs a range of crypto-currency based financing options. We have a head start on everyone else. In a fast moving industry, that is crucial. Join us at Hive Project now and get to the front of the pack!  2. The smart money is on us: Yes, we want to improve SMEs access to liquidity. Yes, we believe that block chain is way to achieve this. And, yes, it will be very satisfying to see this revolution take place. However, our motives are not completely altruistic. There are also significant financial advantages. All contributors will receive Hive tokens (HVN), which will be tradable on the major exchanges and generate a return for their owners. Get your HVN tokens here!  3. Our team: With a wealth of advisory talent with experience in block chain and invoice financing, our strong and experienced team has a long track record of delivering on projects. We can be relied upon to get things done.  4. Help small businesses: Most of us have someone close to them who has been turned down for a small business loan. Probably for no good reason too. Well, now is our chance to help put that right. We give SMEs a previously undreamed range of financing options. Wouldn’t it be satisfying to have played a part in levelling the playing field?  5. Be part of history: The potential for block chain technology in invoice financing is huge. Hive Project is the first and best equipped platform to capitalise on the benefits offered. When you participate in the Hive ICO, not only will you become part of revolutionary platform that solves liquidity problems for SMEs, you will also be involved in a multi-trillion-dollar business with double-digit growth. With Hive Project´s end state being a market place with advance trading analytics for peer to peer lending, our international team of experts and advisers strongly believe, Hive will add value to all contributors. We are convinced that pre-Hive and post-Hive will become common parlance in the invoice financing industry in the years to come — it is a seismic move. Click here now to receive invitation to join Hive Project, the first crypto currency invoice financing platform to provide financial liquidity to small businesses by leveraging blockchain technology.",False

CoInspect provided a white box security audit and the first round of the audit was completed on 23 August 2017.

Quote from: hiveproject_net on June 10, 2017, 07:35:39 AM Quote from: termion on June 10, 2017, 01:57:04 AM https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1866936 Once more invoice platform? Populous - FIRST.  Hi termion,  I will treat your post as a question of the difference between Hive Project & Populous. If I understand correctly, Populous´s aim is to become invoice exchange platform, where you can buy & sell invoices.  However, Hive Project is aiming at something different: Hive Project uses invoice factoring to get the invoice entry into the system. We will first provide the initial credit score by evaluating publicly available historical data on the business. In the first stage of Hive Project platform, we will create a Hive fund that will itself lend to small businesses. That will also enable us to gather more data on the business  In the beginning, we expect the credit rating to be less accurate because we’ll have less data to work with. Therefore we will be lending smaller amounts with more commission to fine-tune the algorithm & historical data in order to be able to lend higher value with less commission expenses.  The next step will be to provide you with historical data & credit rating system to enable peer to peer lending like an exchange, but the end goal for us for Hive Project to become an ecosystem for credit scoring of the companies and 3rd party auditing. Populous aims to be the invoice exchange.  To kickstart our journey, we will have the Hive Project Fund buying invoices in crypto, however later on, it will be an ecosystem with data offered to the market.  Also, another note: as you are well aware, in the end everybody decides for themselves what ICO to invest in. We believe we have a strong team with good background in finance to be able to deliver on what we've promised. No matter what you decide to invest in - Hive Project, Populous, both or something completely unrelated - we wish you the best of luck.  Hive Project Team    Also, we'd like to point to some of the differences that we believe would make us a good project to contribute to:  a) we’re digitizing an existing business & part of Hive Project team has restructured a bank with its own factoring house after the 08-09 financial crash  b) we have HVNX, Hive Project Invoice Financing Fund start buying the invoices, simulating the buyer side of the market to avoid a chicken or egg problem of new marketplace. Populous doesn’t have that as far as we know.  c) our go-to-market strategy with ERP/invoice issuing software integration targets SME owners in an environment they know & use every day, vs. convincing them to join yet another marketplace/platform.  Kind regards,  Hive Project Team",False

I won't be making excuses - it was my f*ck-up   I hope you guys & girls can forgive us for it.  On to the long overdue answers to your questions.  Let me first answer all of you wondering about the bounties. a) As explained in our ICO bounties Medium post , bounties will be distributed post ICO. It will probably be at the same time as Hive Project's token distribution - so August 24th. b) For those who are asking about spreadsheets, we have repeatedly stated in this thread & all other communications that the spreadsheets will be internal-use only. We understand your worries, but primarily it was a decision done based on privacy of bounty participants & we will not change this decision until the end of ICO. If you're worried, please use the bounties@hive-project.net mail to check. c) You'll be contacted by Hive Project Team & will provide us with an address where you'd like your bounty HVN to go. HVN token is ERC20 token standard compatible, so any ETH address should be fine. d) ICO bounty campaign runs until the end of ICO, so until August 14th at 8PM UTC time.  I'll be answering specific questions below, so that I can quote all of you asking us something concrete.  Kind regards,  Hive Project Team",False

However, Hive Project is aiming at something different: Hive Project uses invoice factoring to get the invoice entry into the system. We will first provide the initial credit score by evaluating publicly available historical data on the business. In the first stage of Hive Project platform, we will create a Hive fund that will itself lend to small businesses. That will also enable us to gather more data on the business  In the beginning, we expect the credit rating to be less accurate because we’ll have less data to work with. Therefore we will be lending smaller amounts with more commission to fine-tune the algorithm & historical data in order to be able to lend higher value with less commission expenses.  The next step will be to provide you with historical data & credit rating system to enable peer to peer lending like an exchange, but the end goal for us for Hive Project to become an ecosystem for credit scoring of the companies and 3rd party auditing. Populous aims to be the invoice exchange.  To kickstart our journey, we will have the Hive Project Fund buying invoices in crypto, however later on, it will be an ecosystem with data offered to the market.  As far as the ""first mover"" advantage, we believe we have a very strong team, both in terms of financial & tech background. Also Hive Project Fund will offer an advantage as new platforms often face the ""chicken or egg problem"", where one side of the market is underrepresented. Hive Project Fund will facilitate the funding for SMEs, bringing the SMEs to the platform & making the credit scoring algorithm accurate enough for peer-to-peer stage.

In contrast, Hive Project platform enables owners of SMEs to sell their invoices to solve their liquidity problems. Let's say you have a business that sells a sports shoe materials to Nike. They order a lot, but you only get your money in 30/90/120 days. With Hive Project platform, Hive Project Fund buys your invoice for a little less then what Nike would pay you the next day. Then in 30/90/120 days, Nike pays Hive Project Fund the money they originally owed you. Your business has liquidity (to make payroll, buy new materials, outsource your new shoe design, etc) & grow faster without the fear of financial problems.  But we're not done yet. Hive Project Fund is only the first step of the project. We will feed all the financial data we get on the business to an algorithm, that will get more accurate at credit scoring businesses with every invoice. The second step is peer-to-peer lending. Essentially that means you'll use a HVN token to buy an invoice & financial data on businesses involved from Hive Project & then you'll be able to pay business X a discounted invoice rate & receive a full payment in 30/90/120 days.  Hive Project's end goal is to become the source of credit scoring & 3rd party audit data.  Please feel free to ask any further questions, we're here to help & hopefully, change the future of SME liquidity together.  Kind regards,  Hive Project Team",False

As the Hive Project Fund will take the data from publicly available sources & have no history of doing business with an SME, our credit scoring will be less accurate in the beginning. We have to provide the algorithm a lot of data (i.e. a lot of invoices) to supply accurate results to our users, interested in buying the invoices.  You can find the distribution of funds on our website, if you'd like to know more. Also feel free to ask more questions if there is any additional information you're interested in.

I'd also like to point out that Mr. Sperry's involvement with the project is he is the escrow, so he holds part of the cryptographic key needed to issue the funds to the Hive Project Team.  A name is everything we have & none of us have the intention of damaging it.  We've also checked the website links & realized there was an issue with linking to Tom's website. Sadly, as a founder, owner & lead developer of a web design agency, I can tell you these things happen sometimes. We should have been more careful in checking those links. When creating work for our clients, it's usually the clients that check, but when you make a website for yourself, sometimes these things get lost in the myriad of other things you have to do when preparing for the ICO.  Thanks for pointing out our issues. As you can see, we react immediately on issues of our community & hopefully it shows.  Kind regards,  Hive Project Team",False

We’re using an already existing infrastructure to create Hive Project platform that will help SMEs with their liquidity problems. Let’s say a business X has a customer, who will pay him for his services, but he will only receive the money for his work in 120 days. The SMEs would of course need his money immediately - for making payroll, buying materials, etc. Hive Project platform will  develop a fund, that will buy that invoice at a discounted rate & provide the SME with the money the next day, while waiting for the original customer to pay us the original amount in 120 days. Blockchain is an integral part of the platform needed for keeping reliable track record of invoices, which helps with automating process and prevents double selling of the invoices. Plus it will, in the future, also enable big data credit scoring.  HVN token’s value is therefore tied to the business we’re creating & is the means for payment for usage of some of the features of the Hive Project platform (in our case, you will need the HVN token to be able to buy an invoice from Hive Project platform in the peer-to-peer lending stage). To put it in very simple language, buying an invoice from business X at a discounted price now, so that their customer, business Y can pay you the full invoice amount at payment deadline - let’s say 120 days from now - will cost you X amount of HVN tokens, which you either own if you’re an investor or have to buy from someone who does at an exchange.

I don't see this as a issue, but rather as an asset.  He is an accomplished professional with a wide range of experience and a strong financial background.  I am sure if our team had any intention to deceive anyone, first we would not have a team of this size, many of whom have previously worked for Iconomi, Bitstamp and many other well known companies, and I am sure no one would accept this work if anything wasn't right here.

Hive Project Team has laid out a strong development schedule for the following 2 years, that you can check out on our website. It is a very strict set of deadlines & the funds for lending to SMEs will not be released to the Hive Project Team unless those deadlines are fully respected. That is guaranteed by our escrow & it is why we have one holder of the escrow key, who is not a team member, but a respected authority in the IT & VC community holding that key & keeping us accountable.  The reason we need the 2000 Bitcoin minimum is, that big part of the money will be used to start the Hive Project fund, that will start buying invoices & in the process, acquiring financial data on the SMEs themselves & feeding it to the algorithm, to be able to reach Hive Project’s end goal - become a 3rd party audit & credit score provider. The nice side effect is that the more SMEs we help reach liquidity, more accurate our credit scoring algorithm will be in terms of providing investors & token holders a good credit score for the peer-to-peer lending phase of the Hive Project platform.

If I understand correctly, Populous´s aim is to become invoice exchange platform, where you can buy & sell invoices.  However, Hive Project is aiming at something different: Hive Project uses invoice factoring to get the invoice entry into the system. We will first provide the initial credit score by evaluating publicly available historical data on the business. In the first stage of Hive Project platform, we will create a Hive fund that will itself lend to small businesses. That will also enable us to gather more data on the business  In the beginning, we expect the credit rating to be less accurate because we’ll have less data to work with. Therefore we will be lending smaller amounts with more commission to fine-tune the algorithm & historical data in order to be able to lend higher value with less commission expenses.  The next step will be to provide you with historical data & credit rating system to enable peer to peer lending like an exchange, but the end goal for us for Hive Project to become an ecosystem for credit scoring of the companies and 3rd party auditing. Populous aims to be the invoice exchange.  To kickstart our journey, we will have the Hive Project Fund buying invoices in crypto, however later on, it will be an ecosystem with data offered to the market.  Also, another note: as you are well aware, in the end everybody decides for themselves what ICO to invest in. We believe we have a strong team with good background in finance to be able to deliver on what we've promised. No matter what you decide to invest in - Hive Project, Populous, both or something completely unrelated - we wish you the best of luck.  Hive Project Team  ",False
