Mergers and acquisitions make up a global industry that is worth nearly $5000 Billions per year and over the past two years we’ve worked on developing a platform to disrupt it. The LEXIT solution means that M&A deals will be concluded up to four times faster, at about a quarter of the traditional costs not to mention much safer due to Blockchain technology we build it upon. . . . https://medium.com/@amirkaltak/the-future-of-how-you-will-sell-your-business-or-ipr-by-using-lexit-a9145099ce4d https://medium.com/@amirkaltak/the-future-of-how-you-will-sell-your-business-or-ipr-by-using-lexit-a9145099ce4d  Let us know any comments you may have, again, welcome.

If you watch the show Shark Tank, perhaps you have noticed it too: entrepreneurs walking away from good deals because they are simply too emotionally invested in their own ideas and companies.  Evaluating opportunities to exit, via M&A or otherwise, should be a part of every startup's strategy. You should be emotionally ready to sell your company when a reasonable deal comes along. That of course doesn't mean you have to do it right away. Waiting for another deal or pursuing additional funding on your own is always an option.  Startups can be bought for many reasons. Sometimes all it takes is a good PR team to help the startup go viral. Some reasons are a bit more opaque.  For instance, Salesforce, a cloud computing company, bought the Chicago-based Model Metrics because the former was looking for an office in the Midwest…  In addition to the reasons startups are bought, startup founders sell for many reasons, as well.  A startup's C-Level representatives might not wish to put in the “sweat equity” to grow their startup further. Doing so might entail hiring a big sales and marketing team and setting up the infrastructure. It might mean networking and setting up a global distribution channel.  On the other hand, Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and private equity are constantly looking for acquisitions. Not long ago, companies were not interested in purchasing software companies, but as technology has continued to eat the world, the cash-flow stream has become increasingly predictable.  But, M&A is an often expensive, intensive and time-consuming process. While specialists work for a fraction of a deal's size, there are also legal fees to pay. An M&A or an IPO could amount to millions of dollars worth of fees.  What if there was a technology that lowered the costs of the traditional M&A process?  Luckily, there is.  When combined, blockchain-based token economics and the modern platform-marketplace industry have the power to unite a critical mass of buyers and sellers. Such a pool ensures more reliable price discovery, and more efficient deal-making.  Blockchain's pseudonymous nature allows for privacy when Startups are looking to sell. This is particularly helpful in an industry where everyone knows what everyone else is doing, and secrets don't stay secrets for long.  Want to know more about the future of M&A on the blockchain?

I feel what you're saying and I agree... Partially. Amir use to be in the chats a lot interacting with members but everything has been so wild in the crypto-verse the team isn't super active in the chats, hence community managers updating you. They've got a couple really good partnerships lined up that will be super beneficial on the platform , too. I met the team at Polycon18 and they did a fantastic job presenting and networking, super down to earth people. If you DM any of them they do respond tho, they care and I believe they're working as proficient as ever now. It gets really upsetting seeing members ruthlessly targeting them in a negative manner because they've done a lot of dirt so far, just a minor setback.  I'm stoked for the AMA tomorrow so they can answer of a couple questions I had straight up as I'm also curious wtf is going on lol. I believe they'll pull thru with their word distributing the tokens soon. The sale is actually gonna be dope... Scoop more LXT for the low and not a stupid high minimum will be in effect.

Couple of valid points albeit for tokens they partnered with hmm selfkey and polymath. Bottom line transparency and communication has been piss poor at best. Long ass time went by of Admins saying tokens will be distributed in a few weeks. Not looking for quick money but also not looking for a 1/2 year tied up either. Private sale was supposed to be it no crowdsale then this kind of change of direction to a crowdsale sale touting strong demand and want to spread around the token is weak. Also it invalidates the initial pie chart for token distribution in which people make decisions on when investing.  Also a bit odd not a peep on telegram from any of the “” Lexit team.

One of the key ingredients to achieve this goal is the direct, massive matching of sellers with potential buyers; and when we say massive, we mean it. The degree of market-efficiency we strive to achieve is heavily reliant on the Law of Big Numbers: the larger the pool of buyers and sellers, the more reliable price discovery is, the faster good, Win-Win deals can be achieved.  For a Platform Marketplace like LEXIT this mainly means one thing: our success depends on the degree to which we succeed in creating sustainable network-dynamics. For this reason we regard our Global Partner Network as an extremely valuable asset and treat it accordingly.  LEXIT’s Global Partners (GPs) are highly connected players in the tech industry, such as VC funds, Technology Hubs, and Accelerators. LEXIT GPs utilize their vast networks and in-depth knowledge of the industry to onboard potential buyers and\or sellers of IP, technology, or entire companies to the LEXIT platform.  For every onboarded user that has successfully closed a deal on LEXIT, the responsible GP receives a 50% cut of LEXIT’s net commission concerning that deal. .  https://www.lexit.co/post/connections-are-everything-intoducing-lexits-global-partner-program  The LEXIT Team   LinkedIn: LEXIT Facebook: Facebook.com/LEXITco Twitter: @LEXITco Reddit: reddit.com/r/LEXITofficial Telegram: https://t.me/LEXITco BitcoinTalk: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2494585.0 YouTube: https://www.lexit.co/youtube Instagram: lexit.co  lexit.co/resources/whitepaper w w w . l e x i t . c o",False

LEXIT employs blockchain technology to level the playing field and to allow everyone to use the powerful growth engine of Mergers & Acquisitions.  The idea behind LEXIT was born out of necessity. A few years ago, the LEXIT founders, back then working together as the EnvyMe team, were ready to bring a fully developed social networking application to the market.  With more than 2000 downloads in less than two months on Appstore, things appeared to go exactly as planned. Except this one pesky thing - EnvyMe ran out of money. In an attempt to self-fund further expansion, Amir, Majia, and Deniss decided to sell another company in their possession and reinvest the profits in EnvyMe’s marketing campaign.  As true children of the Internet, the LEXIT team was convinced that in this day and age selling a company shouldn’t be more complicated than selling a car, house, or any other kind of property. After intense market research however, our co-founders were surprised to learn that things couldn’t be further from the truth. Despite prevalent network technologies and online marketplaces for anything one’s heart desires, the Mergers and Acquisitions sector seems to lag decades behind.  The EnvyMe team’s liquidation efforts eventually bore fruit, but the overwhelming majority of small- and medium-sized startups fail to utilize their existent technology. Of course, this is often the case due to lack of quality. Very often though, this is simply a symptom of an inefficient market, failing to match valuable assets with buyers that otherwise would be happy to pay for them.  It's not like that for everyone. On the other side of the spectrum however, we see a market dominated by giants of unbelievable proportions, such as Google, Facebook, Amazon and the like, growing even bigger in an untiring acquisition binge.  Google’s Alphabet, for example, acquires on average two companies per month. Its peers are not much different in this respect. So much so that the statement “M&A is the new R&D” has almost become the tech industry’s new battle cry.  This is very understandable. After all, this strategy makes a lot of sense. Economically speaking, it’s much more efficient to acquire knowledge from a seemingly limitless global market than to develop everything in-house. For the acquired companies this, of course, is also very reasonable. Developing new technology is a much more straightforward process if one doesn’t need to cope with the hustle of acquiring users and competing over market share.    Frankly, most entrepreneurs in the position to operate in this manner would probably do so. We would as well. The catch, however, is that M&A tends to be so costly and complicated that its benefits can be reaped only by players with pockets as deep as those of the Zuckerberg’s and Bezos’ of this world.  This dramatic offset between the tools that are available to the behemoths and the ones that are available to everyone else is highly troubling. As much as the tech giants M&A frenzy makes sense financially and strategically, we should not be comfortable with a situation in which the entire global market morphs into the private R&D department of a tiny oligopoly.    As it is the case in most situations of this kind, the remedy to this debacle will be found in creating alternatives and new modes of operation, based on cutting-edge technology.  This is why we founded LEXIT, and this is why we have designed it in a way that makes the powerful growth engine that is Mergers & Acquisitions accessible to all players on the market.  By allowing M&A processes to be concluded four times as fast, and at about a quarter of the traditional costs,  an efficient market for IP and patents is established for the first time. Our goal is to allow companies to trade assets as conveniently as one would buy or sell a car or real estate while empowering entrepreneurs to discover the true value of their assets on a vibrant and highly liquid marketplace without having to bear overpriced prepayments.  With such a service readily available, we hope to change the power relations prevalent on today’s markets and bring the gospel of disintermediation the blockchain promises to an ever increasing share of the world economy.

As part of the attempt, attackers disguised themselves as LEXIT representatives, going under user names such as “LEXIT_Support”. The attackers posted statements and messaged users directly, fraudulently urging community members to send them Ether in exchange for LXT.  All attacks have been taken care of and additional security measures have been installed.  Our security team is constantly on guard to prevent attacks and keep you safe on all LEXIT channels. However, since our community has been expanding considerably, and with the LEXIT project gaining media attention, the interest of malevolent actors has naturally risen as well.      In order to maximize your safety, please follow the guidelines below:  Future LEXIT token distribution events will be announced ahead of time, multiple times, and will be conducted via secured and audited distribution channels only. Under no circumstance will a LEXIT representative contact you via direct message and offer you to send assets to a cryptocurrency address in exchange for LXT. If you receive such a message, its sender has by definition malevolent intentions. Please note that LEXIT representatives on Telegram are marked as “admin”, “manager”, or “owner” as shown below https://www.lexit.co/post/beware-of-phishing-attempts.  Be suspicious of messages, direct or otherwise, coming from group members that are not identified as LEXIT representatives, especially if they pressure you to send money anywhere or distribute suspicious links. While visiting LEXIT-related links, distribution and communication channels, please make sure that you are on a secured LEXIT subdomain.  Do not send ETH, BTC, or any other cryptocurrency anywhere without making sure that you know who the recipient is. If in doubt, please consult the LEXIT web page at https://www.lexit.co/ for announcements, reach out to one of the official admins on Telegram, or contact us directly at contact@lexit.co   ‍  Thank you for your cooperation and warm regards,  Stay Safe!

This is a very justified question, especially in this day and age, where tokens seem to pop up anywhere like mushrooms after the rain. After all, LEXIT is a platform marketplace, not that different from P2P commerce veterans such as eBay or AirBnB, which managed to disrupt their respective industries heavily without invoking “blockchain magic”. Selling a company or licensing its assets, however, is a much different story than renting your guest room to strangers on the internet.    Involving batteries of corporate lawyers, investment bankers, financial advisors, and appraisers, selling a company or assets thereof entails complex processes and many stakeholders, all of which have to earn each other’s trust in an often long and painstaking process. It is this complexity that has until now prevented M&A to migrate to a platform economy format, and it is jumping this hurdle where LEXIT, our token, and the blockchain have a chance to shine.  Trust in an open, global market, The LEXIT marketplace accommodates for three categories of participants: Sellers, offering their companies, patents, or corporate assets; Buyers, browsing the marketplace to acquire exiting startups or buy their IP; and Service Providers such as appraisers, patent lawyers, and specialists, competing to provide buyers and sellers with due diligence services. These three parties engage on the LEXIT platform to cut capital intensive deals, while residing in separate jurisdictions, often without meeting in person.    Would it theoretically be possible to get all these players on one virtual field to exchange millions of dollars online without the help of blockchain technologies? Theoretically? Yes, probably. This would entail costly and slow fiat-escrow services, large legal- and auditing firms, and the physical exchange of hand-signed, notarized documents. Pretty much the way M&A works today.  (Read the full blog post https://www.lexit.co/post/why-lexit-needs-a-token-and-m-a-the-blockchain)  As the blockchain space matures and blockchain-fintech solutions become more institutionally accepted, we presume that LXT transactions will gradually displace all fiat transaction on LEXIT. This is why from the very beginning we will also allow and encourage our users to settle the lion’s share of their deals in LXT. This method of cryptographic value exchange has proven itself to be faster, more secure, and above all programmable - meaning that smart contracts can govern payment terms and conditions according to verifiable events mentioned in agreement clauses.  We firmly believe in the future of blockchain technologies in general and tokenization in particular, and we are glad to have found so many like-minded supporters sharing this view with us.
