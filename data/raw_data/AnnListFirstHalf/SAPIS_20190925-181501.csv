But of course, people which is not ashamed to trick, lie and betray is not ashamed even when everybody is laughing about them.   Im just interested in how so many criminal fools find each other. Everyone involved in this project has to be criminal. The programer of the website which updates the faked raised amounts, Mario Pretone, even him has to be criminal minded.

At this point I have nothing to add to that. My #10 would be maybe that they (Gini) want people to buy BTC and then promote Coinbase and not even GDAX. Come on, just 5 mins on Google and even she would have known it better. Sheer incompetence.  They just released an interview with Alfred Hasselbacher on their facebook page. I am 99.9% sure that is from back then when they had their launch. What was the most interesting to me was that Alfred said that his vision for the university is an individual learning experience. They want to recreate those historical pleaces where you should study then and this should help you with memorizing what you have learned. In which way is that individual when everybody can book the same ""experience""? To me that was just another sign that they have no idea at all. And on a personal note: Should I really trust someone who wants to pitch me something but can´t even take off his sunglasses?  Because I have been asked that a few times already I want to point something out:  This project in full is screaming scam as loud as possible. Until now we don´t know how much of it is a scam. There are many red flags but they are still on their wide spread roadmap and of course it will become interesting after the ICO. If you invest in this right now you will buy one Socratescoin for $1.11. If you don´t plan to spend it at the Nauka university your only options are hodling or selling it once it´s up for trade. The value of the socratescoins you own then depends a bit on the market itself but mostly on the university. I don´t want to question to fact if there will ever be a university but if the university will not be a big hit it is very unliky that the coin will gain some substantion value. A good example for this is the PiplCoin. According to the whitepaper it was sold for $1.00 during the ICO but when it was up for trading the actual value was $0.02, which went up to 11 cents then slowly declined and since Dec `17 it is around 2 cents again. Even if you would have sold your coins at the best moment  you would have still lost 90% of your investment due to promises that were never kept.",False

Based on an Ethereum blockchain open source platform, Socratescoin provides a transparent and secured distributed ledger data infrastructure. It is the currency of choice for Nauka World.  Nauka World is the virtual reality enabled global education platform together with a Science to Industry ecosystem. Nauka World provides the world's leading scientific education enabling a lifelong creation of deep learning and knowledge transference.  We are pleased to announce a rich platform of digital currency, scientific breakthrough, Virtual Reality education technologies and job creation capabilities for the next century of leadership.   THE COIN OF THE KNOWLEDGE INDUSTRY ▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂  Socratescoin has acquired patent and intellectual property rights of a unique portfolio of science originally developed by the International Space Station Russian Module - Nauka. These rights have subsequently been extended to include Nobel scientists, universities, institutions and private sector research labs around the world.  Scoratescoin has also acquired the rights for the associated scientific inventions to turn into the new technologies of tomorrow. One criterion of which science NAUKA accepts is does it solve a big enough problem for a large amount of people in order for it to be capable of becoming a $1Billion company?  Socratescoin will use a presale Token Sale to finance the introduction of its science portfolio as curriculum through Nauka University. Nauka World will house the global VR enabled Nauka University with campuses in sites of historical importance around the world. Nauka World will be a global community of faculty, students, campuses and curriculum. The students will be of all ages, cultures, locations, gender and a wide range of traditional educational qualifications. Nauka University will unite science, thought leadership around the world transforming science and commercialization through education.  Scoratescoin will facilitate investment and participation in an educational revolution that combines advanced science, the internet 3.0 capabilities and an exponentially changing world directly affecting what and how we learn. The transference of knowledge and intellectual property through sensory and educational immersion will be unlike anything currently known to mankind. The first novel describing virtual reality (VR), Orinoflow was written in the sixties by the Italia science fiction writer Lino Aldani. A little more than twenty-five years later, Neal Stephenson's science fiction novel Snow Crash presented the concept of a metaverse - a collective virtual shared space. The 3D internet provides the capability to experience an Avatar populated environment where coaching, teaching, socializing can interact with shopping, learning, entertainment and commerce. Currency transactions which are increasingly e-commerce transactions are facilitated through blockchain enabled cryptocurrencies. The collective maturation of the internet, virtual reality, blockchain and cryptocurrencies offer a unique opportunity to focus on education and science.  Socratescoin is designed to propel transformational science into the minds of the modern world.    NAUKA - YOU NOW, KNOW: PLATFORM BASIC IDEAS ▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂  We have selected a ready for market VR enabled platform which shares infrastructure designs, leverages their investment in technology. This provides for rapid implementation at reduced costs. While serious challenges have been overcome in the delivery of this infrastructure, we can now utilize this investment and the problems they solved to focus on our vision, today. We can deliver advanced educational content for a deep learning experience in a game changing fashion.  The Socratescoin enabled Nauka World can create and launch any type of VR education project without a significant capital investment and in a reduced time-to-market. While others are interested in gaming, online stores or social networks, to name a few examples, we are focusing our team of professionals and developers on science, world-changing content and the growth and engagement with a special group of like minded people. A community. Socratescoin and Nauka World have strategically leveraged an investment of 2.5 years and $5 million of another company's personal funds into VR technology research, the making of prototypes and getting feedback from businesses. We can now be capable of coming to market in the quickest and cheapest way possible. This will enable the Socratescoin powered Nauka World to show its capabilities to not only change how people learn but to change lives, in record time. With Socratescoin backed Nauka World learning as the platform of choice, there is no need to download any client or program; no need for expensive VR-gadgets and powerful computers - just your ordinary device and a browser of your choice.

For those who don´t know me, I am the one who made the post on reddit to which their CMO Virginia Salas Kastilio also know as Ginicanbreathe responded but failed to answer any questoins. I am in contact with friends who first wanted to invest in their project (for obvious reasons they don´t want to anymore) and a couple of people who have contacted me on reddit.  What they are doing here and there is basically psychology in sales for beginners. Don´t talk about what´s bad, better bring up something new. If there is a lack of proof for your facts try blame the opposing party that there is no proof for their accusations. Forward important questions to other people until the customer has forgotten what is acual question was. And so on.  There are major questions that are and probably will stay unanswered. Besides the fact that they fail to proof the existence of the $8M+ they still fail to provide an actually registered company and a legal address. Furthermore it was seen on social media around two weeks ago they they have bought multiple VR googles (most likely these where you have to put your phone in) to ""see what the future of learning looks like"". My wild guess is that they have used them to watch rollercoaster videos on YouTube because otherwise they would habe been able to show us at least an alpha of their university.  Authorities are currently looking into this and try to determine which country´s authrities are in charge to start furhter investigations since this project has no legal address. At this point it might be the only thing they have done right.",False

It seems they think, lets do easy money, our investors are stupid anyway so we dont have to write a convincingly whitepaper. The bitcointalk thread was launched after the ico started.

Their whole behavior reminds me on the pr of the mlm ponzishemes which i investigated a lot in the past (Onecoin, Habcoin, My Advertising Pays, Kairos, starad24 <- all colapses meanwhile). This brings me to Pirmin Troger. He claimes to be an Networkmarketing professional. Most of this mlm are ponzishemes. So i will do some research about him.

Throughout the last days, just by looking at the numbers, I became very certain than the raised amount must be based on a mathematical formula updated every day.  Furthermore a few of them have attened these ""how to become rich conferences"" in the last year where everybody afterwards sets up their own landingpage on their way of how to become rich pretty fast. Kinda like a MLM but a little different, I think. Manuel Batista was at one of these conferences in Costa Rica last year in September. I guess that´s where hes has made the first contacts to the people included in this scam but unfortunately I haven´t found any connections yet.",False

There are some footprints about Troger in the internet. Obviously he tried or tries to build different buisnesses. For example he has a youtube account where he loaded up videos which promote a sort of special screen protectors for mobile devices. He has 2 fb accounts one is probably related to the buisness with the screenprotectors. The uploaddate of the videos and the setup date of the account are more or less corresponding. Actually he seems to be from north of italy where a small german speaking minority is living. On the other hand i saw information that he tried to build a company 'cp21' in Austria. (https://firmenbuchauszug.at/Firmenbuchinformation/255DFF0CF89F1D) As shown in the web he was agent of the company lavavitave which sells controversal pills with a special stone for health. As i understand they use a mlm marketing concept. I would not evaluete it as a ponzisheme. Furthermore i can proof that Troger had or has at least connections to people involved in ponzisheme projects. His cp21 company is registratet to the following emailaddress: ea1@einkommensarchitekten.eu. I checked for a website and i found it. www.einkommensarchitekten.com. Einkommensarchitekten means architect for income or income builder or something like this. In my words they want to show how to generate money. On the website are just 2 people for now, but if we go back in time we see there were 5 in total. Also Troger was member. The ea1 in his emailaddress probably means einkommensarchitekten1. Perhaps he is one of the leaders of this group (nr1). The waybackmachine showes a snapshot of august 2016. https://web.archive.org/web/20160811065208/http://www.einkommensarchitekten.com:80/ Troger is on the right. The team claims to create a perfect life with financially freedom for their customers. On the website the admit to do networkmarketing. 'We know, that you know, that we have, what you need'. The sentence scares me. One of the teammembers was on a 'my advertising pays' conference in germany. https://www.xing.com/profile/Patrick_Profanter. Just a convinced involved person posts the event on his xing profile. My advervising pays was a meanwhile colapsed ponzisheme with a huge number of victims. In my opinion the guys try to recrute new affiliates to fill their own pockets. The choice of the words and terminology reminds me on typical ponzisheme publicity methods. 'We change your life, we make you rich... blablalba' To me its strange that Troger was involved 2016 in this einkommensarchitekten thing. 2017 he obviously tried to build a buisness with the screenprotector (maybe cp21 (cristall protector???) is related to it) and suddenly end of 2017 he is in the excecutive team of a project which claims to have already started back in 2000. Regarding this research, the costa rica conference assumtion made from Mrs. piggy is plausible in my opinion. I try to investigate the project. I admit that i cant 100% proof thats a scam but im pretty sure. I have to wait for the answear of the unesco for a clear proof. Or socratescoin proof me wrong with a disclose of the addresses with the raised funds. That will not gonna happen.",False

But both the screen protectors and the dietary pills show huge similarities to ""projects"" that Alfred Hasselbacher has been involved in. I have the influenza and can barely look at may screen for longer than five minutes. Maybe you can have a look of there is a connection between them. If I remember correctly Alfred Hasselbacher's name is also shown in connection with a company registered in Austria somewhat in 2016. Spandex or so.  And by the way. They just announced on Twitter that the website for Nauka World is finally up and running. It's a single page with a contact form...

From one froud to the next...  I got an answear of UNESCO.

There is actually an ico running which want to collect almoust 50M$ for educational projects. In my opinion its a scam. Can you conferm that or conferm that the partnership with the unesco is real? The projects name is socratescoin. Webpage: www.socratescoin.io. Thank you!  Kind regards  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Answear from unesco:  Dear Mr X,   I cannot confirm affiliation with UNESCO and recommend utmost cautious for these unregulated activities.

In this new whitepaper the guys didnt mention each scientist i told anymore. But they assingn still marie curie to biology / health /medicine. LOL.

First I have to clarify that my memory was a little mixed up. It was sydex.net which made me find Alfred Hasselbacher`s connection to the Turin Trading International GmbH registered in Wien, Austria. There is at least one more or less known person with that name in Austria but according to Linkedin there is also one in Slowakia. I´ve to look into that tomorrow.  Furthermore I have found by accident that Mauel Batista already registered domains like socratescoin.club on Nov. 02 2017. Which didn´t stop him from registering autofloweringcoin.com and erbacoin.com later that month. His list of more than 120 registered domains shows to me that he is deperate to make some quick money online...  I think we should start a wiki or something to gather all our information.  I will check back tomorrow with the authorities who are looking into this because like John said we can´t let the just move to the next project/scam again.",False
