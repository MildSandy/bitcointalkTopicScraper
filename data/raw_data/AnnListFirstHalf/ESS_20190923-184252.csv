Also, the team members are real... The problem with crypto investing is simple; there are too many people without experience in this field, therefore many people like to call things a scam too fast.  Just hold onto your tokens! Utility will be added. I've tried the app myself and it works great, just needs some minor improvements. When you bought these tokens, I hope you did it with a clear mind. There can be bumps along the road, but if the project is a success and adoption occurs, the value will increase. Just look at the feedback from community members in the telegram; most are really positive about the project and are actually using the product in various ways.  Instead of calling the project a scam, I highly recommend testing the app and give appropriate feedback etc... if you want your investment to moon, you can start by helping making the product a great one yourself (by being an unofficial ambassador).

The team contacted CMC several times and in the last days in specific we re-write to them more constantly. 2. Developing of mobile and desktop apps are in progress. Other currencies will be added to wallet. 3. The team can plan an Ama for the next month. 4. The team addressed this in the discussion on telegram, you can read that here for yourself. https://t.me/essentia_one/150783 5. A statement was issued explaining the delay and subsequent reasons for this, you can read that here - https://t.me/essentiaone/146 As for AmaZix moderators being different moderators. It is common-place for personnel to change within any company, so this is not a reason for concern that admins are different, the information and support provided will remain the same either way. 6. Market price is not controlled by the team as everybody understands, but thats not to say they dont care about the token, the project or anything else. The focus is on the development of the project and the team are moving towards the mainnet release, Its unfortunate when timelines are not fully attained, but security and quality are paramount, best take some extra time and ensure a quality release, rather than meet timelines and leave uncertainty around the release. The reality for supporters of projects in the crypto space is that, patience is also needed as delays can occur and with good reason. 7. As for bounty concerns, I believe there was a complaint sheet where bounty participants could voice their concerns about rewards for bounty tasks.  Thank you, i hope this helps!",False

No shilling here, just passing the information along. With regards to the circulating supply, not sure what you're trying to get at also, but as mentioned before, the circulating supply has been shared to CMC and followed up several times by the team. Nobody is accusing you of being paranoid, but at the same time the Essentia project is separate from AmaZix as a service provider so I'm not sure whether you're commenting on the project, or both, or are overall just unhappy with the state of your affairs.  With regards to the post you've linked, it seems like a separate case that has nothing to do with Essentia or even how AmaZix handles business but rather a separate HR case altogether from a contractor who wasn't renewed.  If you'd like to know more about that issue, there's more on that here: https://t.me/amazix/35114 and https://t.me/amazix/35061.  In any case, I do hope everything works out for you and if you have anything you'd like to contribute to the Essentia project, the thread is all yours.",False

If you are thinking about investing in this project, think twice, it could turn out to be a scam. Here are the red flags: 1. CMC isn't updated for 6 months, team says that it's problem on CMC side, but many projects that started later then Essentia, are already on CMC with all info intact. 2. Team insists that circulating supply is 614 359 618 tokens, but bloxy.info, coingecko.com and other show circulating supply as much as 909 767 005 tokens. 3. This project conducted ICO 6 months ago, but no tech has been created. They are still on an MvP stage same they had half a year ago. Mobile and desktop versions has been released, but they are just wallets which support bitcoin, ethereum and ERC-20, not more. Mainnet launch was planned on Q4 2018, yesterday they said everything's on track, but today postponed mainnet launch indefinitly, ""targeting Q1 2019"". 4. Problems with ICO smart contract, e-mail database leaked two times, smart contract modification after ICO, which allowed the team to buy lots of tokens from a smart contract for a couple hundred dollars. 5. Total lack of transperency, and after the mainnet postponed, all AmaZix telegram chat admins have been changed, banning people for asking questions about circulating supply issue. Here is a quote of a message from one who got banned:    Also answers on a questions at AMA on reddit were edited next day after AMA 6. Token performance is terrible, 40 times lower then ICO price ($4500 invested in ICO for running one masternode turned into $120), they blame ""market conditions"", but that's not true - some projects launched later then Essentia can enjoy token price increase and ETH fell only 4 times lower (it was pegged at $465 at ICO), so Essentia did -×10 to ETH itself.

See below for a more details list.  The possible ways to interact with the Essentia Network using ESS tokens are:  1. ESS token can be used to access and manage the industries most revered dApps and decentralized services within the Essentia framework.  2. Individual actions performed on the protocol will require a small payment of ESS. The token will grant users the ability to interact with Essentia in a variety of ways and to pay for various services.  3. ESS holders can utilize computing power to earn tokens through Masternodes.  4. ESS tokens form a critical component within the Essentia Framework. They incentivize active and positive participation, disincentivize bad behavior and create an equitable and transparent rewards system.  5. Additional use cases for ESS will be introduced including governance and reputation management.  6. The Essentia protocol brings interoperability on a scale that has never been achieved.

As the price of tokens in the open market (exchanges) is based on demand and supply which is determined by ESS traders.  As per project development, the team continues to make a steady progressive effort towards mainnet launch, iOS and Android application release in this Q4 of 2018.

After the mainnet release, the team will switch to Essentia. Regarding the tokens: in the first release, it’s a no for sure. But the team are discussing the possibility in the next releases. As fancybread recommended, you can read the AMA she linked to you to see the full Questions and Answers session to get lots of information and the full context of this conversation and information.  Don't fear: ESS have an extensive token utility on the Essentia Network:  1. ESS token can be used to access and manage the industries most revered dApps and decentralized services within the Essentia framework.  2. Individual actions performed on the protocol will require a small payment of ESS. The token will grant users the ability to interact with Essentia in a variety of ways and to pay for various services.  3. ESS holders can utilize computing power to earn tokens through Masternodes.  4. ESS tokens form a critical component within the Essentia Framework. They incentivize active and positive participation, disincentivize bad behavior and create an equitable and transparent rewards system.  5. Additional use cases for ESS will be introduced including governance and reputation management.  6. The Essentia protocol brings interoperability on a scale that has never been achieved.  For a more in-depth explanation of token utility, please check out the following article:  https://medium.com/essentia_one/heres-why-ess-tokens-have-among-the-strongest-utility-in-the-market-ddf5e9bd53e9",False

But many investors (as me) invested because of announce about partnership with Finland. And now you said that tokens will not be used here? But they sold tokens.

In order to shed light on where the Essentia token has been listed (so far), we’ve made a helpful list:  Bitfinex The first exchange we were listed on was Bitfinex — one of the most prominent exchanges in the blockchain space. Here you can get your ESS with the following pairs: ESS-BTC, ESS-ETH, and ESS-USD.  Ethfinex Next option for you to get your ESS tokens is Bitfinex. Here you can conveniently “trade ERC20 compatible tokens, with options for exchange and margin trading, as well as access to a peer-to-peer funding market.” Such pairs as ESS-BTC, ESS-ETH, and ESS-USD are available here.  BitForex Bitforex is a fast-growing crypto exchange where you can easily get ESS tokens for USDT.  IDEX IDEX is “the first Ethereum based decentralized smart contract exchange to support real-time trading and high transaction throughput.” And, as you already know, it is already integrated into the Essentia framework. If you’re a fan of this particular exchange you can always use it via our Demo!  Coinbene Another quick and easy way to get some ESS is to use Coinbene. This exchange is becoming increasingly popular and was among the first ones to list our token.  Bilaxy Essentia is now tradable on Bilaxy as well. Another exchange possessing a great popularity in Asia where you can trade ESS for ETH.  Hotbit Hotbit is a relatively new exchange which is becoming more and more popular. The only pair available there is ESS-BTC.  We’re planning on getting listed on even larger exchanges to make our ESS token more available to the broader cryptocommunity! Stay tuned for updates!

Which means, that it can work as the connector between various blockchains and projects. The user should be able to connect with his favourite decentralized applications with only few clicks. One secure seed would then store all of the important information and access to numerous applications. A significant focus is put on the security and convenience of the data stored within the Essentia platform. The tokens will be mined with the PoS algorithm using masternodes run by the users, who will then be rewarded with the tokens proportional to their stake and level of participation. The ESS token will be used as the primary payment option within the whole ecosystem connected to the Essentia. The team behind Essentia is undoubtedly a huge advantage of the project. It is very broad and consists of many experienced and skilful members, managers and developers. Project founders have been active in the cryptocurrencies scene for many years and have previously developed few successful projects. The technical part of the platform is being taken care of by almost 20 developers, programmers and designers, which shows that they will be able to deliver the technologies that they've promised. It's also worth noting that projects like Ethereum, Bitcoin, Gnosis, Status, EtherDelta and Flyp.Me or Mysterium have already been integrated with Essentia.",False

It has definitely been a busy 24 hours - with over 10,000 transactions from 1000 contributors in the first hour alone. In that massive inflow of contributions, we noticed that there were a significant proportion of transactions that failed. We immediately looked into the root cause of the high failure rate and discovered a small bug on line 193 of the smart contract that didn’t allow for most of the transactions to pass, resulting in, an initially high rate of failed transactions wherein the ETH was returned to the contributor.  Yesterday, we stood in solidarity with our community and stated our commitment to run an airdrop for contributors who had more than 10 failed transactions. Today, we want to take it one step further and add weight to our words. We will run an airdrop of ESS to all whitelisted addresses that will contribute to the Essentia crowdsale.  We’ve now come out with a new smart contract, currently deployed inside the member area, where now you can contribute normally - without having the limitation of sending less than half your balance each time. Please visit https://profile.essentia.one to get started!  Last but not least, we will temporarily re-open registration and KYC via https://profile.essentia.one.  We are absolutely humbled by our community's vote of confidence and their valued contributions during the TGE, in spite of the bug in the smart contract. Thank you all once again for your continued support and we can't wait to bring our technological revolution to the world, together.
