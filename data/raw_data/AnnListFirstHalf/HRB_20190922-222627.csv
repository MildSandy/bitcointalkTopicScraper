Over the past few days, and in concert with our legal team and advisors, we have soberly assessed the implications of the SEC’s report as well as our own compliance. We have determined, in short, that there is just too much uncertainty within our current model to forge ahead without some careful assessment and perhaps revision to Harbour.  For those who have contributed to our whitelist pre-ICO, please note that your contribution will be refunded to you in full after August 31st. We will provide instructions to you on how to do this. For those who are looking to participate in the public ICO that was to be held on August 1st, we look forward to your contribution at a later date.  The Harbour team remains committed as ever to building a fully autonomous, democratic, and community-governed system that supports the token ecosystem. Our decision to delay our token sale stems from the responsibility we feel to the community to ensure 100% compliance. We thank you for your understanding in this matter and hope your involvement continues. Stay tuned, as there are some exciting developments and announcements that we can’t wait to share with you all.  Updates coming soon!",False

(Sell/Buy)  There are several types of proposal. The currently defined proposal types are as follows:  1) ICO Contribution: This is one of the core proposal types. It is used to diversify into different ICOs. This proposal has ‘yes’ or ‘no’ options. When holders vote yes, they can pick what percentage of Harbour’s holdings they would like to contribute.  2) DAO Change: This is another core part of the project. This proposal type provides tokenholders with the ability to change aspects of the DAO. These proposals execute automatically, and work by changing configuration values on the DAO, such as dividend rates, proposal creation fees, etc.  3) Buy Proposal: This proposal allows tokenholders to vote on allocating holdings in an existing Token. This functionality will work automatically through various exchanges. Holders will be able to vote for Harbour to invest 2%, 4%, 8%, or 10% of its ETH in the Token.  4) Sell Proposal: This proposal allows tokenholders to vote on selling a token the DAO currently holds. It is planned that this also works automatically by using both decentralized and centralized exchanges. Holders will be able to vote to sell 10-100% of the asset, in 10% increments.  Proposal Creation Fee – In order to reduce spam proposals, there will be a fixed ETH fee associated with creating a proposal. If a proposal passes successfully, the creator will have the fee reimbursed. We believe this not only stops spammers from creating fake proposals, but also motivates tokenholders to make good proposals they think will pass.

This has as a consequence that execution of orders will determine a big part of the return on investment. Sloppy execution will (possibly) destroy (a big - part of) ROI. In empty markets (in case of volatility), or empty exchanges (for example after outage) this may cause massive losses (an example is the flash crash in ETH on GDax, although there have been several mini flash crashes/huge spikes caused by extremely sloppy execution on many exchanges in many products).  The automatic part is a beautiful concept. I am afraid Harbour might be waiting for an accident waiting to happen by automatic execution at an inconvenient moment or circumstance.
