Most of Agrello token buyers have already withdrawn their tokens and for them the platform is no longer relevant. Today we are still maintaining the platform for the very few token holders who despite our efforts have not yet withdrawn their tokens. Since the number of tokens held on the platform has become very small, we’ve decided to switch off the token sales platform to optimise our technology estate.  What does it mean to you?  If you have already withdrawn your tokens and they are stored in your wallet, then switching off the platform DOES NOT AFFECT YOU.

We searched for blockchain eco-system, which has same possibilities as Ethereum that we are currently using. We came to an understanding that NEM brings us the required functionality and therefor Agrello will implement their blockchain for selected future projects.  NEM fills our current requirements and gives us additional extended possibilities in comparison to Ethereum. Our main reasons for implementing NEM was the value of money and transaction speed. Ethereum transactions are not always the best choice, because of pricing and time of execution. At the end of the year, CryptoKitties (a game based on Ethereum) was a reason for sixfold increase in pending transactions on Ethereum. We increased transaction price, but it still took some time to be published. Transaction in NEM has fixed price and generally publishing them takes less time. NEM also supports not only hex-messages but also string message and encoded message.  Furthermore, now we are able to use different blockchain solutions and we can easily switch back for Ethereum or start to use another blockchain, this makes our system less dependent on a single blockchain solution. Our first project supported by NEM will be NordCoin. We have been working with their team for a while now and soon we will share their story with all of you.  We are going to participate in Chainges conference as a partner of NEM in Amsterdam. Hando Rand, CEO will present Agrello ID and signature solution after Kristof Van de Reck Interim President, NEM.io Foundation. With our presentation, we aim to tell a story about Agrello ID and show how our solution can improve the way we manage legal matters in a new and more efficient way using blockchain.",False

SelfKey also revolves around the personality, but doesn't seem to be restricted by ""only"" legal agreements.  It might seem that SelfKey approaches the individual at a much wider scene, however with that comes also much higher expectations. There are many downsides to such a broad approach, especially in a market that is still developping. Personally I find projects that are focused upon a single goal such that is realistic (rather than saving the world, making you rich, becoming a bank, handling all your virtual business, etc) have a better ROI because the roadmap isn't easily compromised as there are few sideways. There are exceptions to this of course, as an all-overlapping platform might still pose to be the next thing for users of the www. Time will tell.  It's interesting because I didn't know the last one. Gonna look into that later today, so don't pick at me if I'm wrong Feel free to correct me ofc.  Also, the all-overlapping thing for this already exists actually, and though there isn't a coin (so no profit), it is highly functional.  https://e-resident.gov.ee/  If the projects mentioned earlier interest you, don't forget to keep an eye out on Estonia, it's literally building part of itself on the blockchain.",False

Together with Blockhive the launch of ILP happened today, on the 26th of January. Blockhive made some changes before the launch. One of them excluded Japanese residents from participating in ILP for now. It is planned to raise 6.75 million euros. An additional round of funding might be considered in the future. For our technology solution, those are not influential changes.

This will allow us to expand our client base to new enterprise customers with higher levels of risk in their operations.”  Steven Sprague, Rivetz CEO, added –  “Agrello provides state of the art identity services that meet the needs of modern users. We are very pleased to collaborate with them to deliver a new token powered model for Identity and security, providing the safety and simplicity required by the market.”  Digital Identity is generally regarded as one of the most pressing problems of the internet based-economy today.

It has been just over a year since the Agrello vision began to solidify from the founding team’s intuition that the digital signature market is prone to be heavily disrupted by smart-contracting technology. However, while following the development of the blockchain industry since its early beginnings, it has been clear to us that digital identification and signatures are only the tip of the iceberg. Our true end-goal should be the creation of digital contracts that will forever change the way people interact with each other and with legal authorities. This is the vision we brought to the market during our token distribution event in June, and this is the promise that we plan to deliver in 2018. https://blog.agrello.org/2018-here-we-come-bc3f49a4f698",False

Agrello and blockhive OÜ have established Tokenote OÜ. It is a platform for businesses and government entities looking to finance their projects by using initial loan procurement or ILP.  Both companies have allocated their resources to the joint venture since December when they reached the agreement. In an ILP structure, Agrello provides its specialty in smart contract and KYC, while blockhive utilizes its expertise on the design of Future Loan Access Token, or FLAT.  ``We believe that ILP has the potential to become the standard for new borderless financing solution,’’ said Hikaru Kusaka, co-founder of blockhive who designed the FLAT structure. ``We have already received inquiries from potential clients who are looking to adopting our ILP structure, and we have started initial discussions on a number of ILPs.’’  ILP conforms with regulatory frameworks, and since ILP is in the form of loans, it is considered to be debt and not subject to tax.  ``There is a lot of innovative ideas around the world, but the most important element of their success is having the capital to make ideas into reality,’’ said Hando Rand, chief executive officer and co-founder of Agrello. ``With ILP, we want to provide a reasonable and logical financing model, which allows the world population decide, what projects do we really need.‘‘  https://blog.blockhive.ee/agrello-and-blockhive-to-form-a-joint-venture-for-their-fundraising-platform-1b71bed4dada",False

I am 1/3rd of my buy price. really struggling with agrello  The issue is too many different mentalities are at play currently in the crypto market. It seems one day it's about crypto hype as a whole, the next day it's traditional investment fundamentals, the next it's a guaranteed get rich scheme where you invest in an ICO, triple, sell, buy back low....   I too put some into the ICO (not huge, not painless though with price drop) but it seems DLT came right about the time of the shift from the 'guaranteed' ICO wins.... I'm not kidding there were like 2 or 3 months there where it seemed like you couldn't lose, and I remember it was all these wins on even random projects that made me go ""damn, Agrello sounds legit, and if dumb projects go 8x after launch this is a sure thing""  I still believe it's a long term good hold and NEVER sell anyway at lower than you pay...if you just hold, even if the project is doomed, there will invariably come a day where it has a massive surge as a death gurgle. With the millions in tokens, people aren't going to just watch their money burn. But if they go a year or so and see no more movement no more fundamentals, they'll pump another million or few into the project, seemingly out of nowhere. The noobs will see this and think their prayers have been answered, they'll start buying thinking the moon launch has finally come. Then the whale sells his originals now at some possibly small profit, and makes huge profits off the low-buys.  I'm a believer in Agrello, but I'm also keeping an eye on it's price, ready to act if I see a random (without any news from team) skyrocket in price.",False

Without being able to prove your identity and verify your partners, digital signatures are meaningless, and smart agreements could never be legally binding. Being as important as this subject is for all of Agrello’s aspirations, digital ID verification is one of the first issues we started working on.  As part of this effort, Agrello has recently partnered up with a highly regarded tech-startup to develop a lightning fast and rock-solid identification/KYC engine for the Agrello solution.  Those of you who had to submit KYC in the past, on exchanges or during the Agrello token sale event, know what a long and nerve wrecking process this can be. With the solution in development, KYC can be submitted and approved in seconds, without you having to leave your seat or take awkward, pixelized snapshots of yourself holding a passport. Once tests are completed and partnership terms finalized, further details as well as the name of our tech partner will be released.  On the other hand, the AMA is going to be held next Friday, October 20th. In order to know which are the topics our community is more interested to discuss about, we have opened this Google Form (https://goo.gl/forms/1Cz7oXAH4Y5yVQqt2). Please use it to tell us which questions you would like to see answered there. The details about time and channel will be announced at the beginning of next week.  Last but not least, as it was mentioned in last weeks update, we also want to take this opportunity to introduce our new team member - Ken Maavere. Ken is a sales specialist, with an established background in B2B and B2C sale operations, and has recently joined our Sales & Marketing department as Chief Customer Officer. He will start speaking in the community on behalf of Hando and is preparing also our business and marketing plans for the next year. Welcome on board, Ken.  That’s it for today. Join us next week for an AMA session, where we will address community questions and share further updates. Enjoy your weekend, The Agrello Team.",False

How the team operate has to change. Please get your shit together.  - MJ having to deal with ""trolls"" and FUDers is no excuse. There will ALWAYS be this issue, but his attitude is basically giving the middle finger to anyone raising legit concern or doesn't like how the team do things. Too lazy to answer questions because it already has answer few times... just 100 message or so above and expect people to read/scroll up. There will be many more doubters/FUDers from this event, and many more trolls because people resent that they sold at a lost. It will get worse. - Juan MD: If he can be on telegram practically all day, he can be on Slack simultaneously. There is desktop app for both, and yes, computer can run multi app/programs. Not everybody likes Telegram because it requires giving out their phone number. - Hando: Please take note from other lead developers like Jordan Earls of QTUM or many CEO. Nobody is asking you to be on social media all day. But do throw a bone for your investors every once in a while to keep them interested, or to attract more people for a stronger community. Working weekend or late? Selfie then #WorkingLate. Having conference, or flying somewhere for business meeting? Selfie and twitter it so. Learn to TEASE like OmiseGo. It take no longer than 1 minute. Crypto people love transparency and getting to know behind the scene! -How many people are even on this current team, and how many more do you plan to hire?  If you want Agrello to be big/successful, don't expect it from just a ""working product"". Crypto is all about speculation. Alex Norta may be a genius, but not everybody is pleasant to work with. Alex is no longer with QTUM(?) for a reason, and now he left Agrello for another. The way he did this was somewhat unprofessional. Please do explain your side of the story. Start a war and defend your project if you must.  Agrello can be a hidden gem in a pile of trash/shitcoins, or it can be a corn kernel in a big piece of shit. Your move and if you can get it together.  Sorry for the long post, but I try to give constructive feedback and not just criticize. I want to give you guys the benefit of the doubt and see from a different perspective, but its hard because the team have not been transparent.

No it's not. Huge sell walls on Ether Delta. Before investing, you must ask your self why its price is much lower from ICO for such a long time.  Here are why:  - Incompetent. Continously step on their deadlines without explaining. - How ironic it is when a revolution smart contract company have to manually send token to a single investor, many people did not receive their tokens for weeks due to this. - Suck communication. Leave the angry crowd with nearly no responses, while Slack is full of scammers, they even paste scam content directly to channel. - Reddit Mods sencored two ways dicussion, leave only shill posts, which are old and poor quality reposts by moonboys and newbies. - Fudders and shillers are everywhere in Agrello's conner, making an endless war. The community is the most toxic I've ever been through. They fix it simply by cleaning it. - The ideas of the project sounds great and very promising, but there is no way the devs can fullfill its tasks. They are very incompetent, unexperient and irresponsible. Most investors dumped their coins, leaving bag hodlers trying to shill on every conners to lure newbies to share their fate.

I read that Delta was being added on EtherDelta, so I though I'd have a look, since you can sometimes do good business there. I knew that Delta was trading around 0.0018 ETH according to coinmarketcap. So I opened DEL/ETH and saw that someone was selling 1500 tokens for 1.5 ETH, which is at a price of 0.0010 ETH/DEL, almost half the price. I though someone must've made a mistake, so I immediately bought everything before someone else would, thinking I've made a profitable trade. Only to discover that the Delta token is DLT, not DEL. DEL is apparently a failed project, called Delphi, so these coins are virtually worthless. They're organizing a refund but only to people who acquired the tokens before the 7th of September.  However, If I can make such a stupid but rather obvious mistake, someone else can too. So I put the 1500 DEL up for sale again at 0.0017 ETH/DEL. 5 minutes later they were sold for 2.55 ETH,making me a healthy profit of 1.05 ETH.

Attela and LEXTAL are among the most prominent legal firms in Estonia and the Baltic region, and starting next year, they will incorporate the Agrello solution.  As soon as the Agrello platform phases out of alpha, Attela and LEXTAL will begin to utilize it to formalize contractual relations with their clients. Going forward, the two companies will use Agrello’s services to streamline their professional operations, reduce costs and save their clients time and money.  Marek Herm, partner at Attela, commented on the newly formed partnership, stating:      “We are proud to be at the forefront of this exciting new LegalTech development. Agrello’s solution is a refreshing innovation, and we plan to use it to widen our client base and increase efficiency.”  Marge Männiko, managing partner at LEXTAL, said:      “ We have been following the recent developments at Agrello and are intrigued by their technology. We believe that this solution could take the legal industry into a new era, and we are glad to be among its early adopters”  Following Agrello’s recently announced partnership with electronics manufacturer InCap, the collaboration with Attela and LEXTAL constitutes our third industrial-scale joint venture. Many smaller potential clients and partners have already reached out to us.  As soon as these deals are finalized and ironed out we will of course share the details with you ASAP. We also have big news in store from Asia, so stay tuned here, subscribe to our newsletter and join us on Telegram.

The token scale, scheduled to go until August, has a 10,000 bitcoin limit. According to inside sources, the project might already be more than one-third of the way to reaching its goal.  “DELTA tokens will be required to employ the Agrello platform and to perform various actions in the system, such as the deployment of new agreements or the usage of blockchain and contract repository resources,” wrote the project in its blog.  Two days ahead of the opening, the team held an AMA in which for over two hours the team discussed the implications of blockchain for the legal industry. CCN was there in order to catch some of the most compelling parts of the talk ahead of the token sale, which was covered by Hacked late last week.  “The idea behind Agrello is to take the tedious work away from users, and let users and organizations collaborate in a peer-to-peer fashion, and allow them to focus on more decision making and creative work,” said Agrello Chief Scientist Alex Norta in the AMA. “And really all the repetitive, annoying work is offloaded to the smart contract and agents…Value and information transfer logistics can very quickly explode in terms of cost and time needed. So, if you lock that off into a smart contract, you are definitely saving a lot.”",False

It's on the blog and not anywhere prominent.  Where I kept reading about it is in their emails but if you weren't on the email list then I can see how that would be frustrating to go through the steps first and then find out.   Regardless that doesn't make it a scam.  There are attorneys involved in the project so they're likely being overly cautious with their local regulations.  For instance KYC documentation is required for all US securities sales as a money laundering prevention measure. ,False

Agrello is simply a platform for building legally binding smart-contracts, using AI without having any prior legal skills or knowledge of coding. The Agrello token is called Delta Δ and it is being offered with Tier 1 at 0.0001Ƀ, Tier 2 at 0.00011Ƀ, Tier 3 is set at 0.00012Ƀ, and Tier 4 is set at 0.00013Ƀ.  One of the key factors that hint at the potential success of Agrello, is its application across a wide range of industries. For instance, Agrello recently inked a partnership deal with Finnish manufacturing giant INCAP, to provide smart agreement prototyping for INCAP's labor management process.

Maybe it will help to think of it this way:  The ink from two people comes together on a single piece of paper, that becomes called a 'contract'. They write in their own local language, and the language of their laws, guided by a legal professional.  The Agrello smart contract is similar to the modern version of this paper and ink system. It automates the language and guidance parts as much as possible.  In this way, the final construction takes place locally, while the underlying system, and some master templates, are distributed digitally anywhere in the world, maintained by an incentivized database of professionally created templates.  So only the first time is difficult, and then gets easier as network effects begin to grow.  With the words ""blockchain"" and ""smart contracts"" being among the hottest in tech, and politicians being what they are, they will be clamoring to get the credit for bringing this tech to their countries economies - this is already starting to happen.  There is plenty of low hanging fruit to get the wheels moving - simple contracts mediated by the trust that blockchain brings.  The parties involved are motivated to use these because they will save money and time with the higher automation.  With everyone involved motivated to do this, it will get done.  It's not much different from how we used to require signatures to transfer any money from your account (a contract), but when the technology came around like ATMs and internet banking, soon that tradition ended, and we accepted other, digital forms of ID, signatures, and terms - even without the paper!",False

Agrello is a blockchain-agnostic smart contract system. The founders contend it creates a simpler, better functioning smart contract than other such platforms by putting the contract in ‘plain English’.  “We use blockchain to create smart contracts that actually act as contracts,” Agrello CEO and co-founder Hando Rand says. “They are signed obligations to be performed in line with the contract execution data registered in the blockchain, and transferable by the blockchain for evidence. This minimizes the amount of trust needed.”  Agrello Chief Scientist Alex Norta, with over fifteen years experience investigating academically what would ultimately come to be called ‘smart contracts’, explains further.  “We have many domains in our society, ever more complex, where the need for information and value transfer logistics is important,” Mr. Norta elucidates. “So, currently, that involves many people, and lots of bureaucracy. It’s slow, takes time, and there is lots of paperwork involved with such legacy systems. It is now feasible to automate this, and do so in a well-distributed manner with the blockchain, which serves as a trust-machine in the middle.”  Agrello, whose white paper is forthcoming, believes the combination of AI and blockchain is the solution to such complex problems. “By bringing in agents on top of smart contracts, you achieve information and value transfer logistic automation and currency,” says Mr. Norta. “And the system can take into consideration forthcoming holiday systems to predict bottlenecks and on and on.”  If you have several parties working towards a particular goal, they coordinate with each other by exchanging information. “And this involves not only information, but payment transactions or transactions that transfer, say, smart key access,” Mr. Norta comments. “So, you can access an apartment or building in a process intermediated by blockchain technology.”  This can become a very time consuming endeavor, according to Mr. Norta. “Especially, if you have to determine how you receive and send the right type of information, at the right time, from the right source, and to the right destination,” he says. “Today, there are office workers who do that.” According to advocates of the technology inspired by bitcoin, this can be automated thanks to blockchain.  “If a hospital wants to have a full, singular operational solution for all of its processes, with services, software, updates, training installation and upgrades,” Mr. Norta describes, “you obviously have enormous amounts of information involved. As well as many people from different organizations. In this scenario, you have to bring heaps of information together for a governing contract. And in the end? It’s a PDF.” Mr. Norta finds something more to be desired to account for such complex relationships.  This contract then gets signed, enforced and, in Mr. Norta’s thought-experiment hospital, the system is set up.  “The service contract will last for many many years, but then once this contract is running after the setup, you constantly have to check the deadline for the next upgrade,” Mr. Norta elaborates. “‘When is the next deadline for the next check? Do we have the right people in place?’” But, the responsibilities in overseeing such a system don’t end there.  “There is also life-cycle management,” Mr. Norta adds. “When you bring people or agents together, they collaborate. There is some notion of mutual trust involved in this collaboration. As collaboration unfolds, if some violation happens, this life-cycle management must have systems in place to manage the relationships.  The questions that come up, according to Mr. Norta, are: “What happens to malevolent agents? How is such an agent treated? Is it eliminated and replaced?”  The implications are far-reaching, from e-healthcare to e-governance. “We have many complex, highly distributed systems and spend a great deal of energy as a society on information and value transfer,” says Mr. Norta. “It’s costly, time-consuming and we can automate that now.”  This is what Agrello plans to do by adding AI and agent technology on top of smart contacts. “The smart contracts themselves are not all that in-and-of themselves aware,” elucidates Mr. Norta. “Until you bring agents into the pictures to enhance the performance of value transfer logistics.”  Agrello is aiming for that with four use-cases: employment, long term residential real estate rent, commercial real estate and loan agreements.  “We are working on setting up and running a complex computing system for municipalities, as well as the process of setting up a contract involving multiple parties and terminating it,” says Mr. Norta. “Today, this is still paper-based, time-consuming and expensive. But, we can cut the costs.”",False

Agrello will open soon up more information including the whitepaper about what is the science behind Agrello.  Briefly explaining, for the first time are virtual AI agents capable of understanding contracts which are built up based on legal text (mainly obligations and rights of the parties) Agrello contracts give security for the parties by not keeping contract information open to the public. Agrello contracts are built to make the work of lawyers and businesses much more efficient information logistics and gradually embrace more automation as other industries like IoT and FinTech improves.  We want to enable the simplest way for lawyers to step into the world of smart contracts as the project is developed with experienced legal professionals in addition to blockchain tech and IT experts.
