Message from the Exec team Strategic postponement of ICO - Details below  2017 saw SPARC gain significant traction and interest as we have developed strategic collaborations and partnerships with key stakeholders and investors. The SPARC team has grown to include a CFO, new experienced advisers, and more excited engineers.  Due to significant Canadian interest in SPARC, we are in a strong financial position. Given this opportunity, we have the chance to distribute tokens more strategically to the benefit of all participants.  2018 is forecasted to be the year of growth in decentralized applications. SPARC's technology is designed to facilitate this growth by providing a complimentary and cost-effective distributed application layer to other more-expensive distributed asset layers.  In 2018 We will:  Collect large regional users & suppliers of compute power and work with them to migrate to our technology. Leverage larger projects to create common SDKs for individuals and smaller researchers. Release the Distributed Compute Protocol© & grow the network before public ICO Help to grow a local university's distributed application incubator. Distribute token grants to strategic users of compute power. Our Next Development Steps:  SPARC is collaborating with an S&P/TSX 60 compute supplier in a closed beta-test. They will be computing an astronomy project for a large group of Canadian researchers. A complimentary astronomy SDK is being created in parallel for release to other project groups. Public beta-test of SPARC to begin in coming weeks. Launch of MVP shortly after. Our Next Funding Steps:  Mid-December 2017, Doyle Capital Management, NYC, invested a significant amount of pre-seed funding into SPARC’s economy. Upon the successful outcome of SPARC’s pilot project, SPARC will hold a private seed round led by Doyle Capital Management. Launch large-scale marketing campaign through an established Canadian firm, announcing successful pilot projects and strategic partnerships. Launch of public ICO summer 2018, date to be announced.",False

The main reason is a very rational desire to create as safe and stable a market as possible. There have indeed been abuses and fraud as well as outrageous security lapses on the part of companies in this space. This tarnishes the reputations of the legitimate and important companies (such as SPARC and its competitors) taking root right now who are utilizing this transformative financial mechanism.  We at SPARC believe that more regulation and scrutiny will strengthen the overall opportunity that this community represents and welcome it.

Sorry, I am having trouble understanding your question, but I will try to answer.  The project is created and being run by a single company. Kings Distributed Systems owns and operates all the proprietary code etc.  There are other projects who we are interfacing with, such as BOINC, but they are not directly affiliated with us. We are however getting involved with their open source development, and have access to some individuals from BOINC who would like to support our growth. Although they are very interested in being in the cryptocurrency space, because they are american non-profits who get grants from government foundations they are restricted from doing so.  This is where we come in! They are happy to have us market their network using our own crypto coin.  While our Alpha will be interfacing with BOINC, we plan to launch our own peer-network as soon as possible, as this will allow us to begin marketing to commercial projects. The plan is to have our proprietary network released in Q1 2018.  I hope that answers your questions. Please if you would like, you can ask for more clarification.   Our Presale begins in less then 24 hours! Tomorrow July 27th at 11AM EST (New York time) we will be launching the sale capped at 1000 ETH.

Much of this funding comes from governments in one way or another.  These computers are very expensive and constantly need to be updated with new hardware, and we are looking to replace this process. As we grow we will be bidding for these government and university grants, so they may contract us to be their supercomputer supply.  As you may know demand exceeds supply! There is a constant line for these computers at universities, and this even after it has been carefully distributed. There are many researchers who would like to do a lot more, but simply cannot get access to the supercomputer time at their university.  If there is one thing all scientists have in common, it is that they want more computer power. Our distributed network is more cost-efficient then running hardware centers and that is where our advantage comes. We are the cheaper, and more powerful solution.  We are looking at both of these segments, picking up the central contracts themselves, and also the excess demand.  You can find more information on how this demand comes on the technology page of our website: http://kingsds.network/technology.html  Have a look at the usecase example to see how more supply is creating more demand.",False

It is true, we are very similar to these coins, and we are proud to be so! We think Golem is a valuable token and we will be happy to collaborate with them in the future.  We believe Supercomputer coins are the most valuable tokens out there. They are tied to computer resources which makes them strong assets.  In doing our market research we've reached out to a number of organizations and found the demand for supercomputers is endless, and ever growing with new AI around the corner. There is a lot of revenue in this vast industry, and this will require many networks to handle the load as we target different sections of the market.  While SONM and Golem are targeting commercial applications, we are focused on Educational and Research institutions.  As well, Golem is a Polish company, and SONM is from Russia. While I'm sure they will do well in Europe, we are a Canadian company and will have advantage over them in the North American market.     Isn't your $5 Million USD minimum cap to high?  Part of what makes a token successful his hitting their critical mass. It order to protect your purchase, and our company, we have set a minimum that will achieve this critical mass. We feel we may have trouble living up to the standards of the cryptocommunity below this amount. Compared to similar projects we think we will get past this barrier easily, but we have set it there for you so that you can be sure of your purchase.     Similar projects have failed to deliver so far, what makes SPARC different?  Our team is what sets us apart! We have been working together already for many years. We have another successful company which is still growing! (QuetzalPOS.com). While we cannot speak as to the reasons that other projects are behind schedule, what separates us is that we are comfortable with our teammates. We know each others skills, assets, and development speeds so we can effectively plan for the future.     We need more information!?  At KingsDS we believe in minimalism, so our website, like our code, contains only the information that is necessary, no buzzwords or bullshit! The majority of the information about the project is contained in the whitepaper, and we would recommend to each of you to download it and read it through. It is direct to the point, and not too difficult to read. It is important that you understand the tokens you are purchasing before you put in your hard earned money! Please if you have any questions ask them in this forum and we will respond promptly.

There will be many networks required to handle the load, even we expect to see more arrive in the future.  What makes us different?  We are targeting the North American market, whereas Golem, Iex.ce and SONM are all in Europe. We don't consider Elastic to be a competitor. After watching their project and github, we believe they do not have the budget or developers to compete, but we wish them all the best!  You may ask, how does a global network target a geographical market?  Although anyone around the world can connect and use our network for projects, the majority of this space is covered by Universities and Research Institutions. These institutions require a more hands on approach to marketing, and it will be necessary for us to approach them directly and help them migrate work onto our network. Golem (Polish), SONM (Russian) and Iex.ce (French) are focused more on private commercial applications however we expect they will eventually realize this mistake and focus their marketing to European Research Institutions, leaving North American Universities and Researchers to a closer team. That team is us!  What they may not realize is that Research is the underpinning of the supercomputer world. Where private businesses are volatile in their computing needs, Research allows us to provide a steady supply of work to our miners. We will be building this steady base through careful approach before layering a more volatile commercial market on top.  We are based in Kingston Ontario which is home to both the Royal Canadian Military College and Queens University, the oldest in Canada. We have many friends at these institutions and are in the process of connecting with them, and their supercomputing departments.",False
