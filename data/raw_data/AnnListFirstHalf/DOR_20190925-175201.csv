Well, Dorado team is confident that it will, and here are the reasons why:  1. Passionate, experienced and motivated team  Our team does not only believe in the long-term vision and success of Dorado but are also taking action to prove their commitment. We are locking our tokens for 3 years (crowd-sale tokens will not be locked). During this period we won’t be able to sell or buy DOR tokens, which means we will be highly motivated to work hard and build a long-lasting profitable business. Considering a profusion of an ICO pump & dump schemes, we believe locking our tokens is the right way to go.  2. Exchanges  At the moment, DOR is already guaranteed to be listed in one of the major top 15 exchange (and more to come). However, due to legal reasons, we can only announce the confirmed exchange list after the ICO is closed.  3. An already working MVP  Dorado is built upon an already successful business, which generated more than 4+ million orders and experienced a 6227% growth in the past 3 years. We can only go up from that, employing our accumulated know-how and the funds raised in the ICO.  4. Partnerships and acquisitions  We’re actively working to build partnerships and acquire major delivery players in different markets so we can start generating revenue from day one. You have probably already heard about our partnership with the major CEE/Northern European e-commerce player Pigu Group and Lympo.io, a health and wellness ecosystem. Next week, we will be announcing the news about our latest acquisition in Poland so watch this space — there are many exciting partnerships to come!  5. Backed up by VC investors  VC investors are known for their pickiness and long due diligence process. Some of Europe’s most well-known and trusted Venture Capital firms have invested in us: Goldfish Fund and Chernovetskyi Group. Our investors come from a wide variety of backgrounds, but one common theme is their record of handpicking successful companies. Having their support and knowledge on board ensures the successful development of our platform.  6. DOR is a visionaries’ token  7% of net sales will be paid out to DOR holders every quarter. Because the demand for DOR is driven by the growth of the platform, the bigger Dorado grows, the more token holders will benefit. This is a visionaries’ token meant for the long-term. The longer you can hold, the greater potential value distribution you will get.",False

The DORADO company is incorporated here Firma   Food Forward Group GmbH Adresse   Baarerstrasse 10 PLZ/Ort/Kt   6302 Zug ZG SIC   7372, 7374 Rechtsform   GmbH Gründungsdatum   28. Dezember 2017 Kapital   Fr. 20000.  They posted alot of fake news regarding the growth, and big brands company like MC Donalds (check your email with the newsletter if you were registed). (McDonalds joins 7400+ restaurants on our MVP)  All the claims made on the site like the 6227% growth is of a diferent company called foodoutgroup which we dont belive it (is it fiscal revenue? or the profits? soon we will find out, we are conducting an investigation regarding that also). Foodoutgroup.lt/lv its a company with 2/5 reviews, the application is not working,do to low ratings the reviews and inability to deliver, they got the facebook/google reviews are disabled completely. The 6227% growth it`s imposible, we own a company with 300k real likes in Facebook and we didnt get that growth not to mention the ratings. 4.5/5  The logo is a clear copy of Dominos Pizza. https://www.dominos.gr/  The DORADO price vs the ICO price went down brutally almost 80% after 2 days of listing. They are mentioning that investors were selling the tokens. Nobody buys the token at 0.07$ and then sell it at 0.01$. They said during the ICO the tokens will be burned, well guess what Nobody burned those tokens. Nothing in this project happened only promises so people can bring the money in. When the coin was listed on HITBTC, there was no announcement only after 4 hours, some trades were made during that 4 hours without notifying.  The BTC Volume its about 45BTC/Day with 1.5BTC Buying Orders, it's imposibile to do that. That volume existed for the last 7 days from listing. The price was manipulated badly, it`s imposibile to get that kind of volume without a trade BOT. Also at that volume the price would raise 7 times.  Any post that you put on the telegram against this DORADO project disappears. Enter the channel on the telegram to see the status of the project, 9445 persons complaining.  There is a big issue regarding the circulation tokens vs the max supply. When u ask them for burned tokens u will receive the following answer: ""Soon we will announce"" , ""The team tokens are locked"". Since the tokens were never burned, they are probably using it for price manipulation.  They basiclly filled there pockets with the peoples money and didnt invest the money in the coin. Your money is in their pockets.  You drag the price down easly and buy more at 100 satoshi and double/triple your money easly at 200/300 satoshi? Keep the price down and buying very very slow a very large quantity, or probablly your friends? You dont need team tokens thats why they always give answers about team tokens. So you can mentaly think only on the team tokens. And when u raise the price, raise it from the peoples money? After you bought probablly 50 millions of dors?  The tokens were never burned so they can buy them for a very low price.. if in circulation are 300 mil how can you buy 50 millions if they are owned by people?  Nobody can sell their tokens since they bought it on 0.07$, u can buy on 0.01 and sell it on 0.02 easly.  And you wanna know what they will tell you after they pump your money in? Look we invested your money in the coin, after they bought millions on low price.  Be sure to check out this link: https://steemit.com/dorado/@iekos/dorado-ico-feels-dodgy-scam-and-here-s-why  If you invested also a large quanitity of money,then get the best lawyer company from your country. Most of lawyers work on commision and you dont need to pay anything up front. The company that loose will pay everything.  My lawyers are conducting investigation regarding: Moneylaundring, Price Manipulation,Fake news.  My lawyers will contact Hitbtc (HIT Solution Ltd) regarding some answers, since both are incorporated companies.  You should wake up since they are incorporated company!",False

Foodout is already operating in 5 countries, with +50M in sales, 1M active users, +4M orders and 6227% growth in 3 years. You can find more information in our whitepaper. https://www.dorado.tech/docs/Dorado-White-Paper.pdf  We have many different positive and negative ratings, but it do not influence our expansion and profit growth.   Our logo was made by designers team, which we communicated with and made sure it looks original and fits our business.  That's normal for the price to drop after hitting exchange. You can look at DOR either as a longer term investment (the more it grows the bigger the value of coin) or part of developing project which would bring you the convenient technological benefits in the future.  As we promised in our whitepaper, tokens will be burned, expected date is this week.  HitBTC did not provide us the exact listing time, so announcement was a little late. We heard about listing at the same time you guys did.  We do have complaints in our community but we also have a lot of good comments. That's completely normal.  Let's not forget that team tokens are locked for 3 years so there is no way we could manipulate or sell our tokens  Unburned tokens are not in circulation, you can see that they are not moved in etherscan. https://etherscan.io/token/0x906b3f8b7845840188eab53c3f5ad348a787752f#balances   Best wishes, Dorado Team",False

It’s the oldest and largest non-profit Bitcoin advocacy organization that was established in 2012 with the mission to provide co-ordination & raise awareness of the benefits, uses & technology requirements of Bitcoin.  The initial idea to join the Bitcoin Foundation arose from the need to promote the significant changes that blockchain technology can bring to the global community. Currently, an incredible inequality exists in certain areas of the world where access to financial services is limited.

First of all, UberEats does everything in its power to squeeze every bit out of already-impoverished drivers using older vehicles because they can't afford something newer (usually the reason why they can only do delivery instead of taxi'ing passengers around).  There is HUGE turnover rate of drivers, which translates into longer delivery times as they get used to their new jobs, all the while, vet drivers are on their last legs driving as they get desperate to find a job that can actually pay them something decent.. and this translates into stolen food from the restaurants that was meant to go to the customer.  This happens a lot, because I did that too.   I also used to hear restaurant managers/owners complain constantly of the awful drivers and huge fees charged by Uber.  How will this project fix this?  The priority of these companies should be to pay drivers decently instead of taking advantage of the supply and demand of anyone who is willing to do anything for a dollar.  You need to keep those all-star drivers around to give the best service possible while keeping both customer and restaurant happy.  Drivers build relationships both ways and you want to project through them that the company is paying them decently. ",False

You have a profit calculator on the main page, and in the FAQ you state that you're in contact with exchanges. Then also in the FAQ you say that the token is a utility token and not a security. This rings the alarm bells for someone who's doing many ICOs, because that's contrary to SEC rulings. If the SEC was involved, this would clearly be a security.

Like we say in our whitepaper our currently 3 pillars in the business are 1) clients 2) couriers 3) businesses. In order for us to grow and become a global company, we need to be fair to the couriers, as well as  other parties, as they are currently the face of the company. On top of these pillars we are additionally building innovations like robots, drones and ai chatbots. Ubereats can slide past doing it in some countries, because of lack of competition. But their current strategy is short-term. We are different from ubereats, in a way that we can deliver anything customer wants in less than hour. We though to ourselves, delivering hot food is harder than delivering pharmacy, perfume, electronics or any other local good, so why not expand our market and deliver anything customer wants.
