In this time, our founders have met with literally hundreds of industry professionals and experts who have helped us deeply understand the potential of our project, and allowed us to truly consider the best path to realize our vision. Based on all of this experience and our projects for the future, we have decided to delay the start of token sale until Q3 2018.    We understand that this may come as a shock to our supporters, considering that we just took down the $250,000 grand prize at iCoin Summit, but this step was not taken lightly. We truly believe that in order to reach our full potential we need to really drive-home the benefits of our platform. To do this, we have agreements to provide KYC services to several ICOs, allowing us to prove the utility of our service and demonstrate our revenue generating model.  We would like to thank everybody for their support thus far and want to offer an additional 5% SFN bonus to all who have whitelisted by the 31st of May.

We are not in talks with any banks right now, but this is certainly something we would like to see. We believe our platform can integrate with almost any sector, banking included.  Quote from: g8stTDas on April 12, 2018, 06:19:15 PM How much will it take an average-sized store to use your solution annually? Or will the buyers themselves pay for the services?  Integration into our platform is likely to be cheap, as you just need to integrate with our API. As for the cost of using our solution, we charge a small commission on transactions completed through Safein, the exact amount you will be charged per year is related to the volume of transactions you complete, and the amount of SFN you hold in your merchant account. Please see our whitepaper for more details;  https://www.safein.com/summary/EN/EN_whitepaper_safein.pdf?version=12.6  Please note that there will be an update to the whitepaper within the next few days. So it may be best to check it then.  Quote from: Veecker on April 12, 2018, 10:23:07 PM Are u planning to hold a private sale for private investors? Or will all the tokens be distributed publicly?  This will be considered depending on how the market fares around the ICO.",False

Quote from: dort on March 25, 2018, 06:28:26 PM Usually the site receives consent to the use of user’s data during registration, but your platform eliminates the need for registration. Don't you think that's a contradiction?  When registering for a website users will always be informed what kind of data is required by the website and it will be fully up to them whether to provide that information and continue with registration or not.

Regarding data safety within Safein, we have top tier security advisors which will contribute with their knowledge from different fields. Feel free to check their credentials on our website.  Quote from: rdizza on March 25, 2018, 11:05:04 PM Hello. How do you plan to optimize the collection of users’ information? I want to register 1 time, and so I don't have to add anything to the form.  There will be multiple layers for providing information as each website requires different data. Feel free to read more about it in the whitepaper!  Quote from: shara on March 26, 2018, 12:27:41 AM As far as I know, the solutions similar to yours have already been created in the past but they didn’t become popular. In your opinion, what’s the reason?  This could be due to multiple reasons - it is worth mentioning that we do not see direct competition in the market and each project does something differently. We do not focus on what others are doing. Safein clearly sees a problem in the market and is capable of solving it.  Quote from: woodcoin on March 26, 2018, 12:30:03 AM Safein will completely exclude the possibility of bots and other fake accounts.

Have you conducted an analysis allowing to estimate them?  Yes. Firstly we don't promote our tokens as an investment vehicle, but due to our unique token model where merchants by their commission not by spending, but by holding the token, supply of SFN tokens will go down significantly and due to our token benefits, price should go up by multiples compared to the ICO price.  Quote from: Veecker on March 22, 2018, 10:10:38 PM Good afternoon. Is your team already working on the project or will all the activities be carried out after the end of the ICO?  Our team has and is already working on the project. We already have a MVP out that you can try out.  Other than that, please check our roadmap!  Quote from: gazman on March 22, 2018, 11:38:03 PM Why did you decide to get the license in EU? Island states issue them much faster, and the check takes less time.  We are talking about EMI licence here which is needed to operate any wallet or payments business within the EU.  Quote from: national751 on March 23, 2018, 09:49:44 AM Good afternoon. How many tokens will be put on sale?  322.500.000 tokens will be put up for sale (pre-ICO and ICO).",False
