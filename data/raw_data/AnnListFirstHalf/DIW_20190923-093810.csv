Firstly, If you were an active member of the group, you would see that it was being bombarded with indecent content. So, it's good some bad users were blocked. Most of the users blocked were copies from other groups and I can prove that I was contacted by 90% of the users, asking for cryptos, before they got banned. So good riddance to them.  Secondly, I for one have been a member for just under a year in DIW's telegram group, most questions were answered by the team or advisors, perhaps you were not around to see the answers being copy pasted over and over again. I personally would grow tired if i saw the same question and answered being spammed for months.  Thirdly, you say If the team is not a scam why dont they list on CMC and what is there to hide?  Well, again if you were aware of the situation, you would notice that they made just over 1mil during ICO and those funds would probably go towards the development of project, instead of throw it all on marketing or CMC (which FYI, is expensive to register to). Why waste money on marketing if you haven't got something to sell or show atleast?  Finally, the group was recently opened and news should be coming in.

I wanted to express myself because I, along side others in this community, have waited long for things to happen - not saying actions have not been taken and executed, but certain things have delayed and postponed DIW Tokens roadmap and caused what we might call a ripple in the pond. So I will stop beating around the bush and get to my point...  Questions have arose ever since DIW Tokens ICO ended and we hit the exchanges, questions like, Why is the token price so low? Perhaps you are one of those early investors (just like me) who spent many ETH to participate in this ICO and now you cannot see any profit...So why has this happened?  There are many aspects as to what drove the price to this position, and created this uncertainty and I believe you should spare some time to read the reasons and my analysis below.  1. Facts are facts, Bitcoin and Ethereum are the leading coins in the market, so it's as clear as daylight to know that when the market is bearish and the main coins like BTC and ETH go down, then everything will tumble down with them and hit rock bottom. This is the same for ALL coins especially for ICOs that are trying to come up into the crypto space and become part of the ""larger pond"" - the market.  2. Another point that has come to mind is, when the market is in the ""bloody"" state that it is now, then people tend to worry, panic and be weary of how to invest or trade. For example, panic sellers not many but a few have made bid orders below a certain degree which basically means that with the small volume of Ethereum that currently exists, then the outcome would be the low price that we all see now. Truth be said, this is not a realistic price because there is a small volume in trading.  3. A sub-question that has popped up as i was analyzing all the likely reasons to our current condition is, the DIW team has not fully delivered and executed some important things, in effect causing uncertainty and doubt within the community. One important issue is the Token Distribution! Many members of the community including myself, continuously mentioned that we did not want the bounty tokens distributed prior to hitting the exchanges. So when we actually hit the exchanges, there were no buyers and the reason being is that the bounty had not been distributed yet. Waiting for the bounty to be distributed and waiting for things to settle down before making any buy orders would of been the wiser choice.  4. Burning of Tokens! We expected that the team would burn the tokens after bounty distribution, and i believe that the price has been effected due to this too. The circulating supply has not been put down in writing or announced anywhere so this has created uncertainty, confusion and we the community need to see these numbers.  5. Something that is on my mind but noticeable by other members of the community is the 2 exchanges that we have been listed to. Latoken and IDex are not popular when it comes to ICOs, they have some volumes but they don't have high volumes so this has effected the attitude of members too. The fact that the DIW team collected under 2000ETH throughout the ICO has made it difficult for them to enter into a better exchange with higher volume but I for one has seen ICOs join smaller exchanges in the beginning and then join much larger exchanges later. So i believe that this has also played some role in the whole price.  So these are the reasons i feel have affected the price of DIW Token, and i hope everyone see this and takes note to what i mentioned because it was spoken with all honesty.  Finally i believe that after what was mentioned above, we need to consider these things and I for one will continue to support the team as i've been doing so far.",False

Our system will have three aspects that our competitors cannot offer: 1) No single access from a single organisation. Meaning that a single person or organisation cannot access your data or have secret agreements with other organisations to share such information 2) Our second advantage is that our vault is built not just for passwords, but an access point to a different modules, like the Health Care, Global Directory, etc. 3) All of our members' valuable data will be stored on the blockchain so no one will actually have the data. Everyone will have just a tiny, unusable piece of them. They will only re-construct once you login via a highly secure access point.

DIWtoken.Com Crowdfunding: the Solution to Data Breach & Crypto Currency Spending       No Aspect of human life, including business and government affairs, can escape the effect of exchanging digital data. Data breaches pose a continuous direct threat to the stability and security of our global system.  Global Reaction  Everyday people are concerned. Multiple hacks have distributed millions of individuals’ sensitive personal data. Industry professionals are also becoming increasingly weary regarding the effect these data breaches may have on their businesses. Governments also face data breach issues. The FBI recently warned that ‘advanced persistent threat’ cyber attackers are increasingly targeting sensitive information.  A Valid Concern  Based on recent data, staggering 60 data records per second have been continually stolen since 2013!  This trend will get worse as time passes by unless fundamental changes take place.  Utilising Crypto Currency  In a period of just 12 months, the total market cap of all crypto currencies has seen an increase of 1700%.  However, there is a catch: Crypto currency is solely used within the crypto community and not in everyday life. It is evident that there is a major need for crypto currency to be widely accepted by the global retail sales leader – e-commerce.  The DIW Solution  DIW plans to bridge and solve both aforementioned issues with the introduction of its global, blockchain-based, decentralised network complete with its own ecosystem and currency.  To gain access into the network, members will be provided with a Secure Vault, where they will be able to store their entire ‘Digital Life’ including documents such as identities, passports, KYC & KYS, financial, contracts, health records as well as login details.  Organizations as well as individuals around the globe, will be able to join in and exchange their services in the form of a Global Directory. The network will ensure that their identity is validated and their details accurate.
