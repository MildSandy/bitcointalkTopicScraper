From now until the end of the public sale on December 15th, get 1 PRTS2 Token airdropped to your wallet for every PRTS investment you make. This means that if you purchase 10,000 PRTS Tokens, you will get the same amount of PRTS2 Tokens airdropped to your wallet. Existing investors will also get PRTS2 Tokens for every PRTS Token purchased.

With the proposed multi-manager platform Protos Fund intends to connect holders of large amounts of capital with leading strategy developers. This platform will provide crypto traders with the tools they need to build, test and run quant trading strategies.
