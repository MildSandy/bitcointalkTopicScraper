And the creation of AIS is impossible without ranking users. Today in the Internet the main rate is made on the amount of information, and because of the high competition, the amount of information on the Internet is increasing exponentially. As a result, the increase in the amount of information leads to an increasing decrease in the quality of information. The accuracy and reliability of information is getting worse every year. And according to the author, the crisis of information is not yet, but has already come. Wikipedia is a good resource but has 2 serious problems: 1. There is no limit to the number of characters, therefore, it is used only by analysts and future scientists. And simple users, which 95%, need another AIS, its simplicity and brevity reminiscent of instagram. 2. The information in English Wikipedia and national Wikipedia is very different. This is already a confirmation that Wikipedia is not sufficiently protected from erroneous information.  The next problem with the Internet is that the information does not unfold, 95% of the authors give a one-word answer to the question, it is not touching that under different conditions of different readers, the answer to the same question will be different, even if the person who asked the question is 100% satisfied with this answer. As a result, readers who ask the same question, but have different conditions, they believe that they also fit this answer, but in fact under their individual conditions, the answer must be different. Summing up, the author believes that the repository of accurate information on the Internet currently does not exist.  In the Internet, the rating information is enhanced by regular users, and sometimes by cheating program. Ordinary users are not a competent resource in assessing the accuracy and veracity of information, a program and does not set such a goal, this leads to the fact that on the contrary false information has a higher rating than true.  And the shorter the answer, the more inaccuracies and untruths it contains. The problem is most pronounced in short texts of less than 1000 characters. short texts require a high level of competition. According to statistics, 50% of users do not read the text more than 1000 characters to the end. In the future, the number of readable characters will be further reduced, this will lead to an even lower quality of information.  Decision Now, when it became available a ranking of users, the company can begin to create AIS. And here it is very important that the user asked his question (because you can not feed the fed). First of all, there must be a need for the information provided. It is obvious to the author that AIS should be based on the question (need).  The author believes that for the effective work of AIS users should be divided into classes, and between classes create competition, in this case we get double control over who asks the question and over who answers the question. The author offers 3 classes of users: user, expert, critical. Weight in any of the three classes to be earned, initially each weight is zero. In this case, one person can not earn weight in all 3 classes. Otherwise, he will be able to ask himself questions and answer them. This is already spam, and for the effective development of the service you need a real need for the question. The author offers the service to organize the authorization, so that the first authorization, the user has chosen which class he belongs to. And at the stage of authorization to consider the mechanism of protection, which will make it impossible to participate in different classes at the same time. But it is necessary to provide for the possibility of growth and change of class, because with age a person becomes smarter. In this case, the user will save only Nebulas Rank (NR), and a career in a new profession will have to start from scratch, after all, in life it is always so, experience in a new profession is acquired from scratch, but a high level of intelligence contributes to a faster experience.  ""spirit"" is a person who has not earned weight. ""user"" is the person who asked a lot of quality questions and his questions further have additional weight. For its contribution, ""user"" should not receive a reward in the form of tokens, it is enough that its weight will grow. Otherwise, it would lead to spam, and the goal is to acquire quality, and as we found out earlier, the quantity has a negative impact on the quality of the information. ""expert"" is a person who has created many quality answers and his answers further have additional weight. For its contribution, ""expert"" should receive a reward system tokens, this is an indisputable fact, without material motivation, the quality of experts, and as a result, the quality of the information itself will be extremely low. ""critic"" is a man who challenged a lot of responses and criticism then has an additional weight. There is no need to allocate additional tokens for criticism contribution, as a result of his successful work, not only the weight of the expert Advisor should be transferred to him, but also tokens as a critic of the expert should be taken away. In regard to maturity of work the tokens of an expert remain pledged to the system, and are charged to the expert at the moment when his work from the preliminary section goes to the main one. Or they go to criticism.  Without a General Charter, neither the expert nor the critic will understand what is required of them, therefore, it is necessary to force familiarization with the rules of remuneration, otherwise we would again get quantity instead of quality. Instructions for the expert and critic. - Expand the answer so that it satisfies not only the person who asked the question, but other readers, the input conditions are different. That is, the answer should exclude the possibility of several interpretations. But since 1000 characters in most cases it is impossible to fit a detailed answer, in this case, the expert should create several question forks. To do this, we need the function "" Create a variant for other interpretations"" If the critic finds that the answer that is not deployed does not have enough forks created, then he has the right to challenge and annul this answer. The creation forks under other conditions is considered as one work.  ""Feedback"" - a critic should have a tool that will point the expert to an error.  ""Coauthorship"" - If the work is generally good, but has inaccuracies, it is important to keep it. You need an additional marker, which will be marked as a whole good work, but corrected by a critic. In this case, the critic becomes a co-author, This work is placed on the wall of both authors and marked with a coauthorship marker, I do not see any point in further complicating the function and marking which of them was the author in this work, and who critic. A coauthorship token is enough.  ""expert blog"" is a wall where you can see all the works of the expert Advisor under the filters (only successful ones) The wall is necessary for the effective work of the critic, since the authors if they make a certain kind of mistake, then this error will be repeated systematically.  The service must be multilingual, that is, it is connected to the translation of the text, this will give a significant saving of tokens, which will result in a higher reward and will lead to a higher quality of information.  Priorities: removal-to remove work critic must have more weight than expert, (the reward and the weight goes criticism) editing-to edit and return the work, the critic must weigh at least 50% of the expert's weight. (the reward and the weight is divided equally) return - With a weight of 25-50% critic can mark and return to work. (the critic gets an extra weight of 25% and 25% tokens) If the weight is less than 25%, the critic can not take part in the criticism of this author.  ""mature"" - full maturity comes at the age of 28 days, after that, critics no longer have access to this work ""half-ripe"" - Partial maturity comes in 14 days, after that, all the actions of critics are possible in full, but the reward they receive only half of the given algorithm. The remaining part is not spent by the author.  ""expert archive"" - only the author has access to the section. All deleted work, you need to move to the archive, still it is the property of the author.  Process description. Preliminary section "" question to expert"" Description: - The user asks the experts a question (limit of 100 characters). - Selects tags from the proposed standard options. - Experts with the help of filters choose their questions. It is necessary to arrange that questions are automatically sent to the expert Advisor on the settings and topics that he chose. If he has enabled this feature. - The expert gives an answer to the user's question (limit of 1000 characters). You can of course make 2000 characters in instsgram to facilitate the work of experts, But this first lowers competition among experts, secondly, the service where you have to spend 10 minutes to read each article, It will become obsolete in 5 years, and in 5 years even the knowledge base will not have time to gather, In General, he will die before his maturity. - Other experts give their answers to the same question. - At this stage, it is important to connect an additional mechanism, which will prohibit the placement of similar text. The mechanism should check the new texts against those in the main AIS section, that is, with texts that have reached maturity, for which a reward has been paid. If the text matches more than 50%, the work should be blocked. This is perhaps the most important service mechanism, it will protect AIS database from spam. Otherwise, the attacker will be able to get each time a new reward for copies of existing works! It is very important not to make such a mistake! - All answers are sent to the user who asked the question. - The user is forced to select the finger up or finger down, until it makes a selection, access to the AIS and pre-partition will be closed for it. That's significant. This is the only effective way to assign weight to the work. But only for those works, which he opened. It will be incorrect and undesirable for the service to force the user to evaluate the works that he has ignored. Importantly: The user should see the weight of the expert Advisor in the title of the work, otherwise, the advantage will not be those experts who ensure the quality of information, on the contrary, those who answer many questions very quickly and provide quantity. Let me remind you that the key to success is that the number should be ignored and priority should be given to authors with high rank and weight. - After user evaluation, the answer goes to the main section""AIS"". From the moment of transition of work in AIS, the countdown of maturity begins, and only here the critic will have access to the work. - Answers ignored by the user are returned to the experts. Answers that got a finger down, just go to the AIS section, On here is with them criticism will be dealt with, it is impossible to decide the fate of the work on the basis of the assessment of one person. Critics, since they are also users, will have to set the weight of the work, with a finger up or down. If maturity occurs, and the work will remain with a negative weight, of course she has to go back to the author. Work with a negative weight in the AIS is not the place. Importantly: After maturity, users can also evaluate the work, but can not change its status. These estimates are necessary for developers at the first stage. If a lot of low-quality work falls into the AIS, here you need to edit the algorithm of competition expert and criticism. After fully debugging the competition mechanism, developers should disable the ability to control AIS.  The tonnage of the quality of information (TQI) & user weight (UW)  To assess the weight of the user is offered the formula: userUW= Nebulas Rank (NR)*number of Mature jobs in the main AIS section expertUW= Nebulas Rank (NR)*number of Mature jobs in the main AIS section criticUW= Nebulas Rank (NR)*number of Mature works included in the main AIS section marked with the marker "" Coauthorship"" That is, we do not encourage criticism to remove the work, and encourage him to co-author with an expert, although if its weight is high enough, you might just want to delete works. Since the expert Advisor is controlled by user and critical, and criticism is not controlled by anyone, it is important to criticize the harsh working conditions and to make higher demands on it. This formula of weight gain criticism gives the system control over the quality of its work, and prevent the misuse of its status from critics.  To assess the job weight offer formula: TQI=userUW+expertUW*UR  UR (user rating) - calculated by the formula: UR= from the sum of NR of all fingers up (NR1+NR2+NR3+NRx, ) subtract the sum of NR of all fingers down ( NR1+NR2+NRx) ( UR - attached after the occurrence of a maturity of work in the formula is not considered )  The author assumes that the payment which is capable to become an incentive for the expert 1 AIS token for each answer. There is no need to conduct ICO and set the starting price of the token, over time, employees themselves will appreciate their work and with increasing competition among employees, and as the knowledge base accumulates, it will become increasingly difficult to mine tokens, this will increase their value and capitalization in the future. This fact is enough for the most intelligent and far-sighted people to start filling the knowledge base even then, when the value of the token is still zero. Especially in such an important matter for humanity there are enthusiasts. I believe that the nebulas campaign team should develop AIS on their own. After all, this is a very important part of the ecosystem, thanks to which the cost of the Nebulas project as a whole will grow much faster. And the team already has enough interest in development, additional stimulation is not necessary for developers. Moreover, the author himself described 90% of the algorithm of the service.  Career ladder ( The main tool of motivation to work ) The author analyzed the behavior of the cryptocurrency market, and therefore has full confidence in the following information: The bottom of the cryptocurrency market will come around 2019.01.07 The next bottom will come about 2023.01.01 and it will be the last significant bottom, After that, the adoption of cryptocurrencies in the world will come and the scenario of price fluctuations for more stable but moderate growth will change. The author tried to use these data in the preparation of the service career ladder. The author also believes that this motivation is enough to complete the main volume of AIS writing in 5 years. Schedule of changes in the cost of work: 1 AIS-from 2020.01.01 0.8 AIS-from 2021.01.01 0.6 AIS-from 2022.01.01 0.4 AIS-from 2023.01.01 0.2 AIS-from 2024.01.01 0.1 AIS-from 2025.01.01 Next-0.1 AIS. The essence is the same as bitcoin, but with faster catalysis.   Result The service will allow experienced people to adequately monetize their intelligence. Nebulus will receive and store accurate information, designed for 95% of Internet users. The world will become much better if lies disappear and the truth accessible and clear to any person will come to its place. Even a person with a very low level of intelligence who does not like to read, will be able to gradually improve!  The author is willing to sell the copyright on this idea for 100 AIS, (about 1 AIS=$1) subject to acceptance of the proposed Career ladder. And guarantees that no one else will get free tokens except the author of the idea.  varan.ru@gmail.com Citation of the text without reference to the author is prohibited A. A. Artemov, 2018.12.07.

Value-can not come from an empty place, it appears in a new place, due to the fact that in the old place it decreases. No need to take my word for it, just try to realize it at your leisure by examples from life. Example: today in the world 100 trillion.$ money (value of all money in the world = 100 000 000 000$) a total of 14 zeros. Of these, the value of tokens 100 000 000 000; (total 11 zeros, only three zeros should be added to them to compare) Statistics show that the value of tokens increases 20 times in 4 years. (10 years is sufficient for the production of conclusions volume of statistics) If you have already completed the 6th grade in mathematics, then you can calculate yourself, after how many years the value of tokens and old money will be equal. By then, it's easy to understand. , those who kept money in dollars (and not in gold, real estate or shares of enterprises), will be exactly 2 times poorer, as tokens have already taken half the value of the dollar. This will be expressed in inflation, but since everything in the world is estimated in dollars, then no one will notice, as the custodians of these dollars became 2 times poorer, and those who managed to hop on the crypto train in 20-400 times richer. Actually it was the answer to the most popular question "" and not a pyramid?"" Now, whose side are you on?  But the government should not worry, because the more values citizens have, the more they are ready to invest in the economy of their native country, it is only important that the country behaves as a native, and not as a stranger, then the value will not flow abroad. The value is affected by the cost of money (to a lesser extent) trust and liquidity (to a greater extent) Here it should be noted that the cost of for example bitcoin is always approximately equal to its value, and as a consequence, the value. Most of the remaining tokens are valuable mainly due to liquidity and are less backed up by cost. Below you will find out that the value of gold also depends heavily on the cost of its production. (This difference from other tokens gives bitcoin the full right to wear the crown of ""digital gold"", and it will be difficult to move this standard in the next 8 years.) To fill the currency with value, there is no need to provide it with an equivalent amount of non-ferrous metal. Dollar with his printing press is not switched off it has long been proved.  Gold-it can fall in price, but not depreciate! Do not expect that bitcoin will replace or depreciate gold. Not only because of the ever-growing cost of its production, but primarily because of the inability to destroy, not subject to corrosion. (all other any kind of money including bitcoin could theoretically be broken) The beauty of gold and jewelry is not at all, it is not an eternal question of chicken and eggs, in the case of gold, it is obvious that it is worn only because it is expensive (and not it has become expensive due to the fact that it glitters)  Fiat money-Yes there is nothing to say, since they are cheaper, everyone will try to get rid of them, and then you yourself remember if you were born in the 20th century.  About inflation - inflation is bad when you do not expect it and are not ready for it, or if it concerns the world currency, (the means of settlement between States will disappear) And if inflation is planned to lay in the algorithm and it will be expected and predictable, that this process is very easy to manage. (children from school will know that a lot of money is bad, that as soon as there was money they need to spend or invest, ) And such a currency ""planned cheaper"" may well become a national currency such as Russia or any other country. This is what I previously described as a method to completely abolish the ""tax"" system in favor of ""emission"".  Citation of the text without reference to the author is prohibited  A. A.

What have perhaps in the next life and sleep, while there is the inspiration we need KALYAKAT. (Specifically used the untranslatable Russian word, to manual understand Russians and a bit slow and without moreover slow, but already rich unlike us Chinese) I'm kidding.  the theme of the RANKING and Nebulus  This is a very complex paradigm to understand, roughly how to show a smartphone in the 19th century. Start learning with simple things, with bitcoin for example. peer to peer (all equal) -this is when the data is not someone one stored such as a classic Internet site, and all at the same time. Theoretically, any user can direct the power of your computer to maintain the network, theoretically, the user receives a reward for maintaining the network, but in practice it has long been the work of large corporations. The network itself does not work, but only due to the fact that we give it our power. The program code is open-it means that anyone can dig into the device and determine that there is no fraud. And anyone can see how it works.  Conclusion the token will become worthless when the majority wants to devalue it. While most want it to grow - it grows. Tokens are not stored in a Bank but in a file on your computer. But do not forget that the file can be stolen and choose a password.  On the Internet, read what is blockchain, Then read what smart contracts are Then it will be easier for you to understand what ranking is.  A Nebulas invented can say ranking. What does it do? Each person, device, project, organization, Bank will have its own rank. The system is so complex that it takes everything into account. Impossible, to cheat, to bribe otherwise fraudulently to cheat your rank, even for huge money. If you're a thief everyone knows that you are a thief, if clean and cool - that all roads are open and good to you! Now shit will be easy to distinguish from negova. All the information on the network will be true. All contracts will be executed All obligations, too. You will no longer show on the left banner. Do not offer the wrong product Will not offer an unnecessary vacancy. Will not get newsletters and offer loan, if you are no longer needed. Can't cheat. The network will be all about you and your needs to know and please you in every way. And at the same time, no one from the outside can not from the network about how to withdraw, or to read them. They're heavily encrypted.  Now you can create your own little Paradise on earth with your hands, BUT remember, none of you will not make it, and pay you can't. Because it's your own ecosystem. On the contrary he's the Nebulus is willing to pay you for this work.  Citation of the text without reference to the author is prohibited  A. A. Artemov, 2018.12.04. All rights reserved",False

Explain. No one but you and your comrades in the bunker, nothing is sold out and will not run. This is the default behavior of the market. What will happen at the beginning of January, is called ""bottom"", and such a miracle happens only once in 4 years. Therefore, an experienced investor is now doing two things:  1. transition from bitcoin to altcoin. Why would he? While bitcoin was cheaper, it was profitable for him to own it, after all, it is a reliable means to store savings. it loses in value about twice as slow as altcoin. After the bottom end, altcoin will go up approximately two faster than bitcoin. And it is profitable for him to change bitcoin to altcoin right now. It's standard procedure. In December 2021, he will change back altcoin to bitcon. It will again be more profitable for him to store bitcoin than altcoin. Such a simple procedure brings him for 4 years 3000-4000% profit, instead of 2000% running in cold storage bitcon. And you see in this only his escape from bitcoin.  2. short-sell. The investor whose exchange Bitfinex BTC lies 250, to lend on the stock exchange on 6 December 2018 750 BTC, with its 250 BTC remains the key. On the same day, he changes these 1000 BTC at the rate of 3900$ to 3.9 m$ Now he has 3.9 m$at his disposal. Exactly a month later, January 6, 2019, he changes the 3,9 m$ at the rate of $ 3,400 to 1,147 BTC. It returns to the exchange 750 BTC + interest for a loan of 10 BTC. 1147-750-10=387. 387-250=137 BTC The profit of this investor for 1 month was 137 BTC, or 55%. And if your friends in the bunker will sell their bitcoins now, his monthly profit can be up to 100%. And you again saw in this only his flight from bitcoin. It is clear, because on the exchange rate chart it looks exactly like a big sale.  Citation of the text without reference to the author is prohibited  A. A. Artemov, 2018.12.07.

This assessment has received continuous attention from institutions, media, and the blockchain industry.  Yesterday, the official MIIT website announced the assessment list for the first time, which was also the first time Nebulas appeared on the official website of a state organization.  After the release of the assessment list, the CCID technical assessment head, Professor Songtao Pu, said publicly that Nebulas smart contract is rather mature, and will contribute a lot to the growth of decentralized smart contracts. His words represent affirmation of Nebulas’ work from professionals and experts.    As a supreme public blockchain project nationwide, Nebulas has attracted wide attention. After the release of the assessment index, some state media, for example People’s Daily in China, have tweeted the news.  Rather than the rankings, Nebulas pays more attention to its ecosystem growth. Thanks to the Nebulas Incentive Program (NIP) Season 1, the number of DApps on the Nebulas mainnet is now more than four times that of Ethereum, and Nebulas has become a popular public blockchain project worldwide. Nebulas supports JavaScript to write smart contract, which helps a lot of users to have an easy start in exploring the blockchain world. In the future, Nebulas will maintain its original aspiration and continue providing a sound environment for developers.  https://medium.com/nebulasio/nebulas-featured-on-chinas-official-state-website-92f2b81f196c",False

Not only is the incentive program huge, it also has a low entry barrier! So, if you ever wanted to make a DApp, either simple or complex, take advantage of this program!  So, why develop on Nebulas?  Nebulas supports Javascript for Smart Contract development - making the entry level easy for all developers. The Nebulas consensus algorithm is designed to award quality DApps with block rewards and transaction fees. Nebulas supports over 2000 transactions per second (so, it can handle more than a simple kitty game). In the first week of the incentive program, over 800 DApps were submitted by developers - which shows how easy it is to integrate with the Nebulas blockchain. Nebulas is designed, from the ground up, for DApp Developers! Whether you are a web, game or application developer, this program is for you!  Why Did Nebulas Create this Program?  Nebulas believes that the most important users on a blockchain are the developers and end-users. Hardware miners should not be the sole benefactors of block minting rewards. With this in mind, Nebulas is introducing a new blockchain ecosystem that is built for DApps with quality applications. Utilizing a new consensus algorithm, expensive Proof-of-Work or illogical Proof-of-Stake are no longer required.  By deploying a DApp on Nebulas, end-users and developers will receive rewards in multiple ways. For more information, click here.  Rewards: Weekly Distributed Rewards 10,000 NAS - 1st Place ($70,000) 5,000 NAS - 2nd Place ($35,000) 3,000 NAS - 3rd Place ($21,000) 300 NAS - 20 Winners ($2,100 Each) 100 NAS - Unlimited Winners ($700.00 Each) * Monthly Distributed Rewards 20,000 NAS - 1 Winner ($140,000)  All submitted DApps are eligible to win up to 2 Monthly Prizes.

In order to further improve the performance of the mainnet and enrich the ecosystem’s technical tools, technical materials, and promotional resources and build a benign community ecosystem, the Nebulas team has officially launched the “Nebulas Bounty Rewards Program.”  The Bounty Program is divided into two categories: “ assignments rewards” and “long-term rewards.” The specific details are described as follows:  Nebulas Assignments Rewards  The Nebulas team will continuously publish new bounty assignments based on community needs, including tasks like tool development, system optimization, and tutorial/documentation content production. Community members can claim these assignments and complete them according to their listed specifications. Submitted assignments be subjected audited prior to distributing the corresponding NAS rewards.  Currently open to apply for tasks include building the following products: optimized Nebulas block explorer, cross-platform desktop wallet, hardware wallet, Go-Nebulas Windows support, multi-language SDK (Python, PHP, Java, Swift, Object-C, Go, Node, Ruby, .Net), smart contract debugging tools, smart contract static code (Lint) checker, online Nebulas online learning course production.  How to apply:  1. Select the bounty assignment of interest and fill out the application form. 2. After confirming the application, we will publicize the ongoing project on the official website developer page. You must report your progress and project completion on time to maintain transparency with the community and synchronize the release of the product accordingly.  3. Completed assignments will receive the corresponding NAS subject subject to an audit. If an assignment does not pass the audit, we will first communicate the situation clearly to the bounty participant, and reopen the bounty assignment for other developers to apply for.  Let us know if you have an idea for a bounty or some project you would like to complete that is not listed in in our Bounty Assignments. We’ll review your ideas and, after confirmation, add them to the list.  Long-Term Rewards  In order to achieve the sustainable development of Nebulas ecosystem, we have set up long-term reward assignments for four categories: security, engineering, algorithm optimization, and technology Evangelism.  The long term reward is effective for a long time. Participants are welcomed to join in the long-term construction of Nebulas ecosystem at any time, and to make full play of their interests and expertise. We will give corresponding Nas rewards based on the quality of your work.  1. Security  The Nebulas consensus algorithm Proof-of-Devotion (PoD) has been theorized via a formal proof. We always welcome the community to find bugs in our ecosystem, including bugs in our mainnet, testnet, nebPay, Web wallet, neb.js, wiki documents and so on. We will offer different amounts of rewards depending on the danger level of the bugs. The specific categories are as follows: •High-risk bugs, for example, bugs that threaten users’ asset security; •Medium-risk bugs, for example, bugs that leads to node crash; •Small bugs, for example, bugs with security risks.  Note: The above bugs are technical bugs. Typos, and other non-technical bugs are not included.  2. Engineering  Participate in development testing. Help improve the performance of the Nebulas main chain. Rewards are settled according to the test results.  3. Algorithm optimization  The community is welcome to work on our algorithm optimization. Rewards are settled according to actual results.  4. Technology Evangelism  At present, there are only Chinese and English languages in the technical documentation of Nebulas. Developers fluent in other languages are welcome to join the ranks of technology evangelists. Rewards will be distributed according to the number of words.  Participation method:  You can contact us directly bounty@nebulas.io, you can also communicate through Slack, various developer forums and other enthusiasts, Nebulas developers. If more than one person finds the same bug, the order of the received emails will prevail.  We welcome people with lofty ideals to participate in the reward activities of the Nebulas.

Thanks to the active participation of our developer community!  These dapps, no matter how excellent they are designed, need the support of users. So we are launching a new promotion to encourage usage for Nebulas dapps. Starting today, Nebulas will give free NAS to those who are signing up to the Nebulas ecosystem for the first time. With this, any new Nebulas user can easily use Nebulas dapps and games without paying any of their own NAS.  Requirements to receive free NAS:  1 Sign up to Nebulas on our official website (You will get free NAS regardless of whether you sign up with official invitation code).  (incentive.nebulas.io/cn/signup.html)  2 Verify your email.  3 Fill in the correct Nebulas mainnet address. If you don’t fill this in you won’t be able to receive free NAS.  Meet the above requirements and automatically get NAS! (Note: We are sending the Nebulas mainnet coins, not NAS ERC20 tokens.)  How we’re doing this — A look under the hood  This delivery of free NAS comes courtesy of Atlas Protocol (ATP) technology. ATP is the first incubation project of Nebulabs. The project can deliver accurate digital currency and achieve higher conversion rates. Here, ATP will verify airdrops more effective, accurate, and delivered to the correct address.  Follow-up application recommendations and other precision promotion Oh! New games are gradually escalating, so stay tuned.  Hurry up and invite your friends to join to join the Nebulas ecosystem, and win a chance to become a Super Contributor. The top 20 accounts who invite the most people to Nebulas each week will share a 10,000 NAS reward and be able to vote on the best dapps submitted in each week and month of the Nebulas Incentive Program.

Click on the link below to get to the DApp submission page. Alternatively, you can click on “Submit a DApp” link at the end of this page.  https://incentive.nebulas.io/signup.html  After the registration is completed, you just need to submit a valid DApp that meets our qualifying standards and you’ll win 100 NAS.

Nebulas features NR (Nebulas Rank), which helps users efficiently identify and utilize information of value among the ever-increasing amount of data on the blockchain; NF (Nebulas Force), which drives the smooth upgrade and self-evolution of the system. Facing the opportunity and challenge as above, we aim to create a self-evolving blockchain system based on value incentive.  https://nebulas.io/assets/images/new-nebulas-world-en.png Nebulas World  More specifically, our targets are: Defining Rank Value We believe that world of blockchains needs a standard of value to measure the value of blockchains’ underlying data so as to explore information’s higher dimension, which serves to discover and uncover more value of blockchains.  Building Positive Feedback for Community Ecosystem We believe that to build a prosperous decentralized application ecosystem with a developer-friendly positive feedback mechanism is the most fundamental premise. Only this kind of application ecosystems can empower the blockchain system with stronger vitality.  Achieving Self-evolution We believe that a blockchain system endowed with self-evolution mechanism can evolve automatically. With a little external intervention, the system will provide faster computing, more powerful systems and better user experiences.  Nebulas Rank (NR) Nebulas Rank (NR) is the measure of value in the world of blockchains, which can be used to measure the importance of various blockchain users, smart contracts, DApps.  https://nebulas.io/assets/images/nr-en.jpg Nebulas Rank (NR)  In Nebulas, we measure value regarding: Liquidity Finance essentially is the social activities which optimize social resources via capital liquidity and promote economic development. Blockchains establish a value network in which the financial assets can flow. Daily volume of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are most familiar to us, already exceeds $1 billion. From these data, we can see that the more transaction volume and transaction scale, the higher liquidity. In turn, higher liquidity will increase the quantity of transaction and enhance the value. That will further strengthen financial assets’ value, creating a complete positive feedback mechanism. Therefore liquidity, i.e. transaction frequency and scale, is the first dimension that NR measures.  Propagation Social platforms like WeChat and Facebook have almost 3 billion active users per month. Social platforms’ rapid user growth is a result of the reflection of existing social network and stronger viral growth. In particular, viral transmission, i.e. speed, scope, depth of information transmission and linkage, is the key index to monitor social network’s quality and user growth. In blockchain world, we can see the same pattern. Powerful viral propagation indicates scope and depth of asset liquidity, which can promote the blockchain world’s asset quality and asset scale. Thus, viral transmission, i.e. scope and depth of asset liquidity, is the second dimension that NR measures.  Interoperability At Internet’s early stage, there are only basic websites and private information. Now, information on different platforms can be forwarded on the network, and isolated data silos are gradually being broken. This trend is the process of identifying higher dimensional information. In our point of view, the world of blockchains shall follow a similar pattern, but its speed will be faster. The information on users’ assets, smart contracts, and DApps will become richer, and the interaction of higher dimensional information shall be more frequent, thus better interoperability shall become more and more important. Therefore, NR’s third measure dimension is interoperability.  Based on above-stated dimensions, we start to construct Nebulas’ NR system by drawing from richer data, building a better model, digging up more diversified value dimensions, and establishing a measure of value in blockchain world.  Proof-of-Devotion (PoD) Based on Nebulas’ NR system, we shall adopt PoD (Proof-of-Devotion) consensus algorithm. PoD gives an “influential” user of Nebulas Blockchain an opportunity to become a bookkeeper and receive Nebulas’ block rewards and transaction fee as revenues, which will encourage them to contribute to Nebulas’ stability and security continuously.  Developer Incentive Protocol (DIP) In Nebulas, we propose the concept of DIP (Developer Incentive Protocol) for developers of smart contracts and DApps. DIP’s core concept: in pre-specified blocks’ interval, for those developers whose smart contracts and DApps deploy online in the most recent interval with NR value higher than a specified threshold, DIP shall reward them corresponding developer incentives (NAS token), and these incentives shall be recorded on blocks by bookkeepers. With DIP’s positive incentive mechanism, more and more developers get incentives to create valuable smart contracts and DApps, which helps to build a positive feedback ecosystem for the developers’ community.  Nebulas Force (NF) A series of basic protocols such as NR, PoD, DIP shall become a part of blockchain data. With the growth of data on Nebulas, these basic protocols will upgrade, and this will avoid fracture between developers and community as well as the “fork”. We call this fundamental capability of blockchain “Nebulas Force” (NF). As Nebulas community grows, NF and basic protocols’ update ability shall be open to the community. According to users’ NR weight and community voting mechanism, the community determines Nebulas’ evolution direction and its update objectives. With the help of NF’s core technology and its openness, Nebulas will have ever-growing evolving potential and infinite evolving possibilities endlessly.  https://nebulas.io/assets/images/nf-en.jpg Nebulas Force (NF)  - - - - -  LEARN MORE Read the full Non-technical White Paper (English) Read the Technical White Paper (English) Watch the Blockchain Search Engine DEMO (video)  OFFICIAL website: nebulas.io | blog | linkedIn | Github  CONTACT contact@nebulas.io  COMMUNITY Twitter: @nebulasio | slack: nebulasio.slack.com",False
