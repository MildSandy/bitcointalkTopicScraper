Bill Shihara, the co-founder and CEO of Bittrex, is joining Unikrn’s board of advisors. Bittrex is one of world’s largest and best exchanges, and another startup from Seattle. Having his insight along with our existing managers and advisors is a game-changer for our future, but it should come as no surprise that Bill is interested in joining our movement.  Well before launching UnikoinGold, Unikrn was laying foundations to allow us to be a global leader in the future of esports and blockchain. We had already created use cases, product, customers and blueprints for future development.  As I’ve said many times, for Unikrn to realize its potential requires an immense amount of forward work. Both Blockchain and esports are cutting-edge fields that regularly see more change in a month than most industries face in years.  With the recent Supreme Court ruling – and the confusion that followed regarding how to classify esports – esports betting and government recognition of esports needs a leader like Unikrn to help shine a light on the space.  It means everything that we are prepared, that we are scanning the horizon, that we are building for the future, and that we are working fully within existing regulations. We’re ahead of the game, and we have the technology to build a stable foundation where other companies can’t even walk.  And very soon we’ll be launching a separate joint venture that will have leviathan implications in the crypto world as a whole, increasing usage for cryptocurrencies and ease of trading for Blockchain assets as a whole. I’m proud that we are spotting and solving existing problems in the Blockchain economy not only for the good of UnikoinGold, but for the advancement of Blockchain technologies across the board.  Unikrn’s goal when launching UnikoinGold was to create a singular gaming experience based around the security and simplicity of a utility token. Bill’s contributions from Unikrn’s board of advisors is perfectly timed alongside the final stretches of development for additional cryptocurrency-powered gaming and esports applications, including crypto esports betting in Europe.  Bill will provide incomparable insight and direction for increasing UKG adoption and security, and he provides the insight of one of the world’s most qualified crypto leaders as more applications, exchanges and groups are brought into the UKG network,.  Unikrn has even more ambitious aspirations ahead, including a potential future listing on a security-approved exchange (among other upcoming non-UKG crypto partnerships).  We are still working on our content, our platform, our tournaments, our esports team ownership, our partnerships within the NBA2K League, and our live events among other endeavors. Stop by The Park in Las Vegas tomorrow to get a taste of how we’re bringing esports and gaming into new arenas.  Every single day we get closer. Today’s horizon is tomorrow’s stomping ground. That Bill is joining our journey should tell you everything you need to know about how serious we are, and how seriously you should take us.  Source",False

Almost immediately, our community of users ran into an issue that plagues every altcoin on the market: access.  More people wanted UKG than could get it, and going through the hurdles of acquiring Bitcoin, finding an exchange, transferring the BTC to that exchange, trading for UKG, and then coming to Unikrn is just a broken experience on so many levels.  On top of this we hurried to get UKG onto as many legitimate exchanges as possible, but because there are so many questionable operations in crypto, we knew we had to do our research. During the fall of 2017, it became substantially more difficult to vet exchanges because of the unheard of amount of volume and scams in the space.  This leads me to conclude that the crypto market is in desperate need of three things to become mainstream;  Governments need to support innovation in the blockchain space while applying regulation that protects consumers. Banks need to embrace blockchain and make it easy to bank with crypto. Blockchain companies need tools to make it easier for their customers to use their platforms.  I’ve wanted to help change these broken aspects of the ecosystem for a long time now, and today we’re taking a huge step toward solving some of blockchain’s biggest challenges. We’re working to put cryptocurrency into the spotlight in a way never before seen while radically improving the user experience for companies like Unikrn.  Today, I am in Malta. I am here because it is one of the most forward-thinking countries in the world particularly when it comes to cryptocurrency and fintech. There’s a reason that Unikrn worked over a year to establish roots in Malta, and now companies like Binance, OKex, Bitbay, and a host of other companies in this field are shipping operations here.  Say Hi to Palladium  I’m joining the board of — and Unikrn is helping power — one of the most ambitious blockchain companies in the world. It’s called Palladium. You’re probably wondering if this is just another “historic” cryptocurrency project with no teeth (I’m sure you hear about those every day). I would say other projects are guppies, while this is a shark.  Palladium will become the first regulated unified platform for fiat banking and cryptocurrency exchange, meaning users will be able to make cryptocurrency payments for their bills, buy crypto from their checking account, or swap crypto assets without needing multiple wallets and accounts, all from a single platform. Palladium Exchange, powered by Bittrex, will be the first regulated exchange to allow both security and utility tokens to be transacted.  The project is regulated by a European directive prospectus which is already approved, the first ever, and nothing like this exists in the world.  Palladium will further make history by holding the world’s first-ever initial convertible coin offering (ICCO) which will give our investors an actual convertible warrant for actual partial ownership of the company, creating direct investor participation.  It’s designed to effect sweeping change in crypto and fintech by allowing users to buy, sell, trade, and save in any currency — crypto or fiat — within a fully legal and regulatory compliant framework.  In a new joint venture with Bittrex, Palladium and Bittrex are building a brand-new exchange — we are in the middle of acquiring our banking license while creating a network that will allow the two to interact and communicate within modern regulation.  There’s a reason Unikrn was tapped for this project: we created the idea alongside some veterans of insurance, finance and investment. This will help create liquidity in all legitimate crypto markets, from Bitcoin to UnikoinGold to small utility tokens created for niche markets with legitimate teams behind them.  Bittrex CEO Bill Shihara, who recently joined our board of advisors, is here in Malta with me, along with Kiran Raj, Bittrex Chief Strategy Officer, and Unikrn co-founder Karl Flores, Unikrn CTO Daniel Rudolph. We’re also joined by the incredible Palladium leadership team including their CEO Prof. Paolo Catalfamo. We are announcing Palladium today at the Malta Stock Exchange with the Prime Minister of Malta, Dr. Joseph Muscat, the Parliamentary Secretary for Financial Services, Digital Economy and Innovation, Mr. Silvio Schembri, the CEO of the Malta Financial Services Authority, Mr. Joseph Cuschieri, and many more.  So What does this mean for Unikrn?  While this is a major move for the industry as a whole, I can understand why our customers and investors would ask what is the benefit to Unikrn.  Firstly, it means we’re working on solutions to enhance the blockchain ecosystem, which will be good for UnikoinGold users. That’s especially important to think about given that we’re rolling out crypto betting soon. We want to give our users the ability to swipe a credit card and buy UKG from our site, just make it easy. This is the kind of tech we will work to enable for every good operator in the space.  Secondly, Unikrn is a significant owner of this potentially world-changing venture. We created vital new technologies for the UKG sale, we have patent-pending crypto-related tech in our stables for UKG, and we plan to license some of that to Palladium.  Thirdly, it means we’re working side-by-side with leaders in crypto and blockchain, the Malta government, Bittrex, and others who are defining the world. We get this seat in history because we are defining the world, too, and our entire community is there with us.  Thank you for supporting us on our journey! Go Palladium and Go Unikrn!",False

Then they realised they would have somehow show that the ICO investors weren't being scammed to get Mark Cuban is hard earned so the spiderweb was woven even tighter and now their is an ICCO! And when the ICCO investors want their money back they'll do an ICCCO? If you actually read the whitepaper for Palladium you will see""We just need to BUY a bank somewhere (maybe Malta) and we need European Bank to regulate it all"".  Well, i don't know if these guys know anything about EU regulations and how long it takes and that it takes ALL 27 countries to agree to regulating crypto coins before they allow any potential bank to allow for regulated transactions but this can potentially take years. EU governments, such as Spain, have said there is no way their central banks would regulate crypto coins and many would veto this from happening as part of a centralise EU fiscal policy. Even the main board-members on the ECB executive committee have publicly distanced themselves from wanting to regulate. For sure this will end in a mess and i assume the founders will have some LLC route out for bankruptcy leaving all ICO and ICCO holders with dust.",False

Just having Maltese regulation - which hasn't even happened and is still in the consultation stage - is focused on gaming to start with and as a member of the ECB framework for banking Malta will still have to adhere to ECB regulation of crypto-currencies (please go ahead and deny it and i will point you to your OWN white-paper that states Palladium MUST receive ECB approval). Then lets just google ECB and crypto in the last month - completely independent of me and you will see and anyone can independently get that awareness of the ECB policy towards crypto. Perhaps you can tell me that you can predict the future and tell me when the ECB will create a regulatory financial license for crypto? No you can't and neither can Palladium so asking people for money with such a HUGE exposure on the legal framework is irresponsible and the ECB will see this dimly, i believe. Regular banks don't do an IPO BEFORE they get a license to trade! That's insane.  I mean lets look at Unikrn Gold.

Sports gambling is a wildly lucrative industry, even without previous legality in states across the nation. According to Statista, the global gross gambling yield amounts to more than $400 billion every year. The online gambling market was worth more than $40 billion in the US by 2016. And esports gambling in particular is a growing portion of those bets, with a $325 million yield in 2016 that's projected to grow to $1.4 billion by 2020.  Today's 6-3 decision to eliminate the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) for violation of the 10th Amendment, which states that the federal government cannot enforce laws that would compel states to carry out federal dictates, has been a battle long brewing.  “The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make,” Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote for the majority. “Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each state is free to act on its own.”  Needless to say, the gambling industry is ecstatic at the news as some states have been preparing for legal sports betting for some time now.  ""11 states have introduced sports betting legislation. Four states have already legalized sports betting,"" leading gambling lawyer Jeff Ifrah told Unikrn News. ""There are more on the way. And now this — New Jersey has started accepting sports betting operator license applications. This isn't only happening because states want more tax revenue, it's also because happening there is customer demand for it and because sports leagues want to improve fan engagement.""  Ifrah is bullish on the effect this will have on esports and esports leagues, and especially for esportsbooks, such as Unikrn, that are in a position to engage immediately:     While the Supreme Court didn't mentioned esports specifically in their ruling, esports has been authorized for betting by Sportsbook before. Should individual states recognize traditional sports betting, the leap to esports is only a matter of time.  ""When Karl and I started Unikrn in 2014 we made a decision to go down the path of regulated esports betting because we believe the future of this space is massive,"" says Unikrn CEO and founder Rahul Sood. ""We fully expected the federal laws to change — and for the past few years we have built a technical moat around Unikrn. We are light-years ahead of the competition and we will enable esports betting across the US in the future!""  And thanks to the United States Supreme Court ruling today, that future could very well be tomorrow.",False

Today’s PASPA news cannot be overstated. If you missed it, esports and sports betting is no longer illegal by federal law, but instead left up to individual states.  When we started Unikrn, it was to build a fan-driven sports betting platform exclusively for esports fans. At the time, and still today, most major esports betting options came from nonendemic sports and horse racing operators who were reaching into esports without understanding the culture.  We wanted to fix that and give esports and gaming fans a truly custom experience built around their wants, needs and culture.  Since then, we’ve expanded to be a full esports culture stop, for gamers, esports fans, professionals and, yes, bettors. No matter who you are, no matter where in the world you are, if you’re a gamer or esports fan, we offer something for you.  I’m often asked why we didn’t build a fantasy model to get our real-money betting into the United States, Instead, we focused over three years staking a claim in esports betting that didn’t rely on a strange regulatory loophole. We believe in regulation, KYC, and creating a safe and legal betting experience. Our goal is not to collect money at all costs, our goal is to offer a standalone product that is worth trusting and using.  To us, that meant ignoring Daily Fantasy models, and other loopholes. We would rather focus on building the best experience possible for regions where we would be regulated. Plus, we were confident that the US market would open to regulated sports betting soon.  So we planned for the long-term, knowing that the federal government would eventually overturn the archaic law preventing responsible, regulated esports betting.  Moreover, we applaud the decision: by letting states regulate and offer sports betting, the US government is letting betting experiences become better-regulated and undermining illicit, offshore and black market operations that endanger their users. In esports, legal betting will undermine the betting pools that power skin-betting, illicit betting activity that reprehensibly sucks in minors and at-risk bettors with no regulation or know-your-customer (KYC) practices.  Undermining those pools is a major part of reducing access for at-risk populations such as minors. We hope that all 50 states will follow in New Jersey’s footsteps and legalize sports betting, bringing a safer betting environment to their citizens.  Legalizing and regulating betting, in short, makes people safer. It gives fans more tools to have fun and ensures big operators are behaving morally.  While others are working to catch up to our lead, we’ll be implementing our blockchain, patent-pending technologies and years of R&D to move on deploying real-money betting across the world. Now we expect that rollout to soon include plans for offering products in the United States.  Our platform has been evolving faster than ever before. UnikoinGold was already the first crypto on the Las Vegas strip, used as prizes in gaming tournaments at the MGM Grand. We are ready to move forward here and around the world to continue to bring an unmatched esports experience.  That means betting. That means news. That means rewarding gamers for playing and bringing them stats on their games.  As always, we are looking at the arc of history and not the tangent. We are confident in Unikrn’s future across the board, and today’s Supreme Court decision just proves we are on the right track.  Check out what Mark Cuban had to say today on this!

Here are some high level things coming very soon;  Unikrn will have live skill betting on video games in most markets soon, with crypto. This is huge, I cannot share details - but it will start in the month of April.  Unikrn is still working with the Malta Gaming Authority to launch spectator betting in Europe, our tech is all ready - there are a number of things we need to work through but we are on track to release something in the near future.  Unikrn is working on some very exciting partnerships — man this is just the beginning, hope to have an announcement in the next week or so.  Last but not least, Maingear -a Unikrn company - is announcing a crowd fund equity round next week! Anyone can participate, it's priced very aggressively - no VCs man - this is going to be awesome, and a great opportunity to get on the ground floor of an incredibly established global brand.  So... Hang in there! We're working hard, hiring lots of new people — we're growing up, Unikrn is becoming a monster — and this shit takes time. One other thing I'd like to mention, no matter what in down times the market will always follow Bitcoin. No matter how hard we work, the price fluctuations do NOT affect our business. Speculators will continue to speculate, there's not much we can do there. We are only here to build a great platform for our customers and fans - and we are doing just that.

The platform will be powered by UnikoinGold, owned by Unikrn and operated by the same genius team that gave CME the meteoric rise it’s seen to date. Unikrn’s users know CME as the innovators that brought esports and gaming its first regular crypto prizepools for tournaments and ladders. Since last year, CME has been offering regular CS:GO competitions with UKG payouts.  CME will continue its operations as a matchmaking platform which enables both casual & skill-based competitive gaming across tournaments, ladders, leagues and direct challenges with friends. Once integrated into the Unikrn platform, CME will extend the utility of UKG with buy-in tournaments to start as soon as this May and other skill-based, blockchain-powered challenges coming in the near future.  In addition to currently live CS:GO, Dota 2 events will be added shortly, with the following features immediately available in the US and EU:  Fully automated 128 tick CSGO servers: Best quality servers, games are started and completed automatically with detailed stats pages and game results. Quickplay Matchmaking (1v1, 2v2): Automatically find other players, loosely based on skill. No anti-cheat required. Competitive Matchmaking (1v1, 2v2, 5v5): Automatically find other players based on their skill level. Earn and improve skill-based rank with anti-cheat requirements to protect every game. Open Lobbies (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, 5v5): Setup private or public custom lobbies and invite friends. This is particularly popular with Twitch Streamers. CME is the easiest place for streamers to setup viewer games quickly! Direct Challenge: Challenge anyone on the platform by sending them a custom direct challenge. Fully automated tournaments (for up to 1024 teams) & ladders: Join several daily tournaments to win Unikrn, CME and partner prizes. Raffle System: Earn raffle tickets by completing missions. Bronze, Silver, Gold tickets are used to enter daily, weekly and monthly giveaways ranging in value from €5–500, including sponsored prizes by partners. More: Detailed and customizable player stats pages/profiles, missions system, achievements, match stats with demo file downloads, match ticker, Twitch integration, friends list, chat, map veto/voting, and more are already live on the site.  This acquisition will also lead to the integration of the Unikrn Wallet into CME’s functionality so users will be able to enter tournaments, make trades and use UKG on the CME platform with cutting-edge technology, always-instant process time and no transaction fees.  Since the tournaments will be integrated with UKG’s native platform, fans will be able to donate their earned UKG, contribute Jackpot winnings or convert skins to UKG to help increase prizepools for community tournaments.  By merging, we are in essence creating the ultimate community, skill-based and crowdfunding platform for esports tournaments. An all-in-one platform to engage, challenge, match and reward gamers of any level.  The synergy also means Connekt users who earn UKG just for playing and winning ranked CS:GO, League of Legends or Dota 2 games will be able to use those earned tokens to enter tournaments, skill-based challenges and anything else CME offers.  Skill based betting is available with prize pools seeded by Unikrn and 50% of entry fees and donated UKG expanding the prizes further. Player just need to sign up and play hard to take home big prizes daily. Soon this will be expanded to direct head-to-head challenges; bet on yourself against any player on the robust CME platform.     This puts Unikrn on the precipice of another historic breakthrough for blockchain utility in esports and gaming. Unikrn was the first to create blockchain-powered gaming Jackpots, the first to allow users to earn by playing games, the first to power crypto prizepools in community challenges and the first to offer a skin-for-cryptocurrency exchange.  Rahul Sood, Unikrn's CEO, said   ""CME’s platform is beyond its competition, and with their technology and Unikrn’s userbase, endemic reach, brand partnerships and existing product lines — as well as UnikoinGold, the largest token in esports and gaming history — users are about to see a digital casual-competitive landscape well beyond anything to date conceived.""

It’s unlike anything else out there. While UKG is just its infancy, it’s already unparalleled in bringing esports and crypto together with real world applications, and real users.  Think about it. There’s no other esports and gaming decentralized token that you can earn by gaming, swapping for in game items, use them jackpots that enhance your gaming experience, and safely & legally bet (using UKS for now) on all the major esports matches in the world.  It’s absurd how much you can do with UKG for how young it is, and the reason is that we were prepared with years of use case, full development staff, an established company and product, and a realistic roadmap before we even announced our token sale.  Now we’re seeing major partners in this space take notice. Last week, I was excited to share that GUNNAR Optiks will be in partnership with Unikrn, accepting UKG as payment and giving their customers access to exclusive perks, such as bonus UKG for purchases.  This week, we’re excited to say we’re going one step further with our Maingear partnership. Maingear is known in the world of luxury machines as the creators of the world’s best gaming PCs and laptops and has earned numerous awards (think thousands), including the editor’s choice award by PC Mag, Best Gaming Desktop at CES 2018, and other accolades from Inc.5000, Popular Science, Intel, Nvidia, AMD, and more industry leaders. In fact, Maingear used to compete with my first born VoodooPC before we were acquired by HP.  And, yes, as of today Maingear will integrate Unikrn Wallet so they can accept UKG in exchange for any of their computers, which average in price around $3,000 sometimes sell for as much as $30,000. On top of this Maingear is releasing a co-branded Unikrn + Maingear series of mining computers known as Maingear ACM (Advanced Crypto Miner). These things aren’t just crazy looking, they will outperform any other miner on the market. — It mines Ethereum and every other minable coin. There will be an app that will allow users to acquire UKG as well, with details forthcoming. All of this will generate more users for Unikrn.  With this move, Maingear is creating an experience for their users that their competitors cannot deal with. That’s one more mega partner in the bag for Unikrn and UnikoinGold. That’s one more use case drawing users to our platform and becoming exposed to the best esports and gaming experiences in the world.  In other Unikrn news, we’re sorry to say our team, BIG, was eliminated in the penultimate stage of the ELEAGUE Boston Major, but our entire company has complete faith in them to reset and recover. When they earned legend status at the prior major last year, they were underdogs and they had an almost unprecedented run against the odds.  As a betting company, we understand that sometimes the odds aren’t everything. BIG will be back.  For the rest of the major, we have a content team on site and a live analysis broadcast happening from our Berlin studio featuring SPUNJ, natu and James Banks, some of the best in the business. It’s amazing that this crew isn’t in ELEAGUE’s official broadcasts, but we’re happy to bring fans an easygoing broadcast option Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  There’s always more happening here at Unikrn. We have our first ever MGM Grand Event coming up on Saturday. We have new features in development. Our Dash Radio program launches next week.  Our team is literally working 24/7 to reinvent esports, gaming and crypto. Welcome to the new future, thanks for stopping in. I can’t even imagine the excitement when we launch our live betting, oh man — I can’t wait.

We announced something similar with Maingear Computers as well.  Since then many companies have been asking if they could jump on board the Unikrn Wallet train, and while we’re supportive we want to make sure they are credible gaming and esports organizations before we’ll approve and promote them. After we approve them we want to make things somewhat simple for integration.  So to make things easier, our CTO and his team of unicorn’s created a WooCommerce plugin for Unikrn Wallet.

Yes, another company can use the token in their platform also. Below is taken straight from whitepaper.  UnikoinGold is designed as a decentralized ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. Its use within the Platform will have certain limitations depending on whether users are located in jurisdictions in which Unikrn is licensed to offer a full suite of betting services (Full Service Jurisdictions) or in jurisdictions where Unikrn will offer a more limited set of betting services (Limited Jurisdictions). In Full Service Jurisdictions, we intend for UnikoinGold to be used for the exchange and interchange of a virtual point-based reward system for the purpose of legal and licensed betting on esports matches, tournaments and other engagement around gaming, including jackpots. As designed, UnikoinGold would also be used as a rewards and incentive token for esports participants, players and teams through tipping. It would also be an entry to a new version of the existing Unikrn spectator betting platform, and it is intended to become the token used on a new skill-based betting platform. Our goal is for UnikoinGold to power the most immersive live-betting platform for esports. In Limited Jurisdictions, UnikoinGold can still be used to purchase jackpot tickets involving esports and for accessing exclusive rooms. It won’t, however, be usable for gaming-related uses that require licenses.",False

The answer is always the same: If we haven’t announced something, it’s because it’s not ready to announce. We take our responsibility of transparency to the community seriously.  It’s why we have a public contract. It’s why I have this blog. And now it’s why we’ve started the first bit of content from our new Las Vegas Studio, our UKG Cryptocast, a regular conversation between the people of Unikrn and the crypto community.  https://i.imgur.com/TRROuJo.png   Expect us to have regular, candid conversations about the crypto space and our role in it, with regular discussions about our product development and how it impacts UnikoinGold’s use cases, users and future. We’ll soon introduce video, and interview some of the interesting personalities who flow through Las Vegas during the year.  This episode, we largely discussed our MGM Grand deal and the upcoming tournaments slated there, some of our recent exchange developments and some general talking crypto shop. We plan to release much more crypto-related content, especially as UnikoinGold continues to convert large amounts of esports and gaming fans into crypto enthusiasts. We will also continue the production of esports content, our studio in Las Vegas will focus on interviews with some of the hottest names in esports.   Technical Update  Part of our transparency is also ensuring the community knows what is happening with the platform itself. Recently, the UnikoinGold team cycled the deposit address for UKG due to technical security requirements in the build.  The new address will be texted out to affected users, a policy we will continue for users whose addresses change in the future. You can always check your deposit address on https://unikoingold.com/wallet/deposit/. You should always, always, always check before depositing!  Check that addresses and information are from official channels, that they are up-to-date and that they are trustworthy. Ask for clarification if you need it from support@unikoingold.com or on our Discord channel, and only trust information from official sources.  This is true not only for UKG, but for any crypto token, currency or asset. Also, always write down and safely store your packing key as it cannot be recovered if lost.  When UKG is lost, in reduces the amount in our economy, which we do not want. Nobody wins when UKG is permanently locked out of circulation, and we are taking all reasonable steps to make the Unikrn Wallet as well as UKG liquidity as safe and accessible as it possibly can be.  Unikrn Las Vegas CES Update  Last night we hosted our first party at the Unikrn offices in Las Vegas with our partner company Maingear. We were excited to expose some tech-savvy journalists and industry leaders to a deeper familiarity with esports and UnikoinGold. It seems like everyone wants to partner with us in our competitive gaming area. We also welcomed some big names in sports, esports, crypto, and the casino business. It was cool seeing Floyd Mayweather attend!  https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*-AIkx0DvU3vb5Z0ExPn_1w.jpeg   Team BIG  We’re also very excited for our CS:GO team, BIG, to be attending one of the biggest esports events of the year as a defending legend. We know they’ll make us proud, and we know they have big plans for the future. Be sure to cheer them on, pick up their stickers if you’re a fan and stay tuned for more opportunities to win gear to support them!  BIG is the biggest team in Germany, and we’re looking forward to our European rollout this year so fans can also show their enthusiasm with real-money bets!

Starting soon, GUNNAR will become the first official Unikrn Wallet partner.

You will be able to buy GUNNAR products directly with UKG. If you buy GUNNAR products, you’ll earn a UKG kickback when you sign up for Connekt. GUNNAR products will be earnable via Unikrn’s jackpots, which users can enter for free after earning UKG just for playing games they love.  GUNNAR are the elite providers of eyewear for gamers. They offer eagle-eye sight with high resolution, panoramic viewing capabilities that will keep you at the forefront of gaming. Enjoy long-term durability and dimensional stability thanks to engineering-grade injection polymers.  Soon you can see for yourself, courtesy of UnikoinGold.

The audience for UnikoinGold is getting much bigger very soon.  From its inception, UKG has been a monster project, as we seek to reinvent the way gamers are able to exchange, engage and earn from playing, watching, and betting on their favorite games. Last week, we announced UKG’s first partner, GUNNAR Optiks, is accepting UKG as a means of exchange for all GUNNAR products, and they won’t be the only ones.  Today we’re pushing out in a totally new way: the airwaves.  If you don’t know Dash Radio, you’re in for a treat. Think satellite radio, available anywhere, anytime, for free, no commercials, with personally curated experiences by the leading experts. For example, they’ve run channels by leading musicians such as Snoop Dogg, Lil Wayne and B-Real of Cypress Hill (among others).  Dash Radio is DJ Skee’s personal baby and it’s gaining significant momentum. So who does Dash Radio look to as their experts to create a curated experience for crypto and esports? Unikrn.  Starting at the end of this month Unikrn will be bringing you Unikrn Radio, a channel on the Dash Radio network, which will be dedicated to Crypto and Esports. This is a continuation of our much-requested conversation series hosted by myself and Kingsley Edwards.  For a taste of what that content will look like, go no further than the Unikrn YouTube, where a few pilot episodes were dropped in preparation for this deal. The response we’ve received from our community has been overwhelming: everybody wants more. So we’re making more.  The difference is that now we’re instantly opening the gates for you to share with your friends, listen in your car, on your phone, on your tablet, in your kitchen, to seemingly every device known to man. Seriously, I’ll include a list at the end of this blog and you’ll probably find your microwave on there at some point. Dash Radio is huge, and we’re anticipating a much larger audience of Unikrn Radio listeners.  And we’re also bringing our expertise and completely unique content to the MILLIONS of listeners already using Dash Radio. DJ Skee, told us that many of their existing user base has been clamoring for a show like this. They’ve been asking for it, and Unikrn is the only company in the world with the unique mix of insight, success, existing product and endemic overlap to be able to bring it.  This means great crypto content — as well as esports, gaming and startup content — across the board, and a whole lot of new and interested people getting exposed to UnikoinGold. It’s a major win/win, and we’re especially excited about how this is allowing us to cast a wider net and engage a whole new audience of interested users who otherwise may not have become interested in UnikoinGold for months or more into our steady growth.  I believe everybody in gaming would hear about UKG sooner or later, but with the content on Dash Radio, a whole lot more people are going into the sooner category.  For you, the fans already in our corner, there’s even more reasons to listen: we will be joined by special guests and experts in crypto and esports, and we’ll offer Q&A sessions for members of Unikrn’s growing Discord community.  Unikrn’s Dash Radio listeners will also become eligible for UnikoinGold and other giveaways, exclusive first-access to news and a ton of content for enthusiasts of crypto and esports.  To start, it’ll just be honing and continuing the show we piloted earlier this month. As we expand, we have a ton of ideas to help bring our audience the best coverage possible by tapping our extensive staff. I’ll also bring on a CEO from one of the world’s largest exchanges to talk about his impressive journey; it’s a crazy story.  We have top-of-the-line experts — we’re talking hired-by-publishers as analysts because they’re so good — on the world’s best esports, we have some of the most technically sophisticated crypto staff on the planet, we have a company chock-full of leading voices on gaming, business, betting and blockchain.  This is not just a beginning, but it is just the beginning for a new media future here at Unikrn.  PS Here’s that list I promised you:  Dash Radio brings distribution options to every corner of the listening market across a litany of devices and vehicles. The list of eligible devices include: Amazon Alexa, iOS, Android and Amazon Fire mobile devices, Apple TV, Chromecast, Amazon Fire Stick, Pluto TV, Apple Carplay, Android Auto, AT&T Drive, MirrorLink, aftermarket products from Pioneer, Bosch, Clarion, Harman and cars from most of the world’s major manufacturers such as GM, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Acura, Chrysler, Honda, Maserati, Mazda, Porsche, Scion, Subaru, Hyundai, Kia, Buick, Jaguar, Land Rover and more.",False

UnikoinGold now available widely across Asia via OKex!  https://i.imgur.com/iuximgj.png  UnikoinGold on OKEX The end of the year is typically a slow period in esports. RLCS, LCS, OWL are pre-season while CS:GO and Dota 2 are preparing for upcoming January majors. Something I take pride in about our company: when the games slow down, we speed up.  While the world is taking time looking back at last year, we’re taking time to behalf of the year to come. Just last week we were officially added to Bittrex, one of the world’s top exchanges. Today, I’m happy to announce that our fans in Asia will be getting a similar treatment with UKG’s addition to OKex, one of the biggest exchanges in Asia.  I’ve said it for months, but it is always worth repeating: this process has become more difficult as pump-and-dump cryptocurrency and scam ICOs flooded the market last year. The good news is people are getting much smarter, and the industry is getting more mature. Credible exchanges are starting to self regulate and will only bring on tokens with real customers and usage.  Unikrn fans are always looking for new ways to acquire and earn UnikoinGold so it’s our duty to make sure we work with exchanges that have safe and secure experiences. We need to vet, and be vetted. We need to reach consensus on capacity, and give exchanges time to prepare for volume and security.  The UnikoinGold team is working tirelessly, putting this together over nights, mornings, weekends and holidays since the token sale. I personally want to thank them all for that effort to make sure almost anybody who wants access to the UnikoinGold platform is able to do so.  You can’t build a great company overnight. Time is part of the process, and the fact that we’re taking the time to build Unikrn diligently is, to us, a badge of honor.  Of course, we are an esports company and we created UnikoinGold to be an esports and gaming token. In the last month, we’ve also announced landscape-altering partnerships with MGM Resorts and Playwire Media. We’re working on gamification and a European rollout, real-time betting, skill-based betting and tons more.  Just this week, we’ve announced a throng of HUGE jackpots that you can enter to win with UnikoinGold: Lioncast gear, signed mousepads, noblechairs’ ICON, Hoerluch’s Earphones, plus big-ticket in-game skins for your favorite games. Throughout the end of December, fans were earning double UKG for playing League of Legends, CS:GO and Dota 2, and now it’s time to use those bounties to win big.  And our CS:GO team, BIG, is preparing to defend their legends status at the ELEAGUE Boston Major, which we are all dying to watch in our offices (except our content teams, who will be right there, bringing fans the best original coverage of Boston in the world).  In short, as always, there’s a lot going on at Unikrn. It’s going to be a grand 2018.  Tell your friends in China they can play with the Unikrn platform by earning and redeeming both UnikoinGold and UnikoinSilver today!  Happy New Year to you all!  Original Medium Post link",False

Earlier this week, Unikrn announced our listing on Bittrex. Today, UnikoinGold is forging forward with an UPbit listing. UPbit is the largest exchange in South Korea, among the top four exchanges in the world, and works with Bittrex and Kakaotalk.  UPbit has the potential for direct links to traditional banking systems in Korea, and will help create additional liquidity and ease-of-use for our users and enthusiasts. They also have some of the best compliance and security systems, making them a perfect exchange for Unikrn customers to acquire UKG.  Esports in South Korea is beyond huge. The South Korean esports market is arguably the birthplace of what we’d consider modern esports, and it is the sixth largest gaming market in the world with 25.6 million players in 2017. League of Legends is particularly huge, as is Starcraft, and esports athletes have long been treated with the same reverence as traditional celebrities.  A large portion of our traffic is from Korea, so Korean access to UnikoinGold, UnikoinSilver, and the Unikrn platform is a priority. Our fans are global, and so we must be global as well.  Our quest for strong, proper, well-vetted exchanges is not over, but our focus will continue to be our users and product. UnikoinGold is about to become the fuel behind the largest revolution in gaming and esports since the impact of gaming PCs began pulling casual gamers out of living rooms and into stadiums.  That said, exchanges are not Unikrn’s focus: our focus is, and always has been, our users and the platform they love.  With UKG’s progress into exchanges, we’re continuing our focus on our platform. The only tokens we distribute now are not for purchase, but for earning. Our focus is a strong product. We’ll continue to improve utility and features and let our users suggest new ideas for UKG.  There was a short period after our sale where users wanted UnikoinGold and had trouble getting it. That is past, and it was caused by careful research and due diligence by responsible exchanges working with us, an established company.  This week, UnikoinGold has done more than aggressively expanded access in Asia with its opening on OKex and UPbit. Our listing on CoinHub was delayed due to volume implementation issues, but it has now gone through, and we opened the new year with Bittrex.  Access and liquidity are demonstrable, and as our platform and usership grows, so will partners’ interest in accessing this too-long ignored demographic. Non endemic brands such as BMW, Nestle, FedEx, Burger King are all examples of companies that began pushing their way into esports and gaming over the last year.  We’re the face of video game tournaments at MGM Grand in Las Vegas. We’re the heart of the most popular CS:GO team in Germany. UnikoinGold is now becoming the hands of esports and gaming in the crypto world, and we’ve made throughlines across Asia, in Europe and North America with some of the world’s largest exchanges.  We launched UKG with platform functionality, and the Unikrn team is working hard to bring you more ways to engage with esports and the world of gaming. Look forward to expansions in both our betting and non-betting experiences, partnerships and a continually improved platform.  In short, UnikoinGold is poised to be the single most central decentralized token in this shift to esports and gaming culture.  Details on our first January MGM tournament will be coming out soon, with public events coming in February. In addition, our CS:GO team BIG is preparing to face down their return to the majors, so wish them luck. Our New Year’s celebrations are coming to a close as well, so don’t miss your chance to win awesome prizes from Hoerluchs, BIG, Lioncast, noblechairs,in-game skins and currently over 500 UKG across over a dozen bonus pools.  I’ve said Happy New Year too many times to say it again, so I’ll just say: look out, UnikoinGold is coming. We’ll be at CES with Maingear, one of our partner companies — we’re hosting a private “Gaming After Dark” event at the Unikrn House in Las Vegas that week. If you feel you need to meet with us at CES, find me on Twitter and let me know why — space is limited, but if I can make it happen, I most certainly will",False

Naturally, with the token’s release, Unikrn was eager to have UnikoinGold available for customers to purchase on Bittrex, the fastest and most secure digital currency trading platform in the world.  UnikoinGold will continue to rollout widespread gaming, esports and betting applications, which will use the internal Unikrn Wallet to allow fast, secure, high-frequency exchanges without GAS. UnikoinGold is no longer available to purchase from Unikrn, rather users will now be able to do so on Bittrex with unparalleled security and functionality.  “Unikrn works within a highly regulated industry, so we take security and reliability at a high premium” said Rahul Sood, CEO Unikrn. “Putting our token on an exchange like Bittrex is a privilege, and we want to send our users to platforms we — and they — can trust. We’ve often been asked which exchanges will offer our token, and the answer we always wanted to give was Bittrex.”  “We see Bittrex as a crucial incubator for the growth of the blockchain’s best technology and business models” said Bill Shihara, CEO of Bittrex. “Unikrn definitely fits that bill: they’re a pre-established, venture-backed business at the heart to two of the world’s fastest-growing spaces: esports and crypto-currency.”  ABOUT UNIKRN Established in 2014, Unikrn is leading the world of bookmaking for esports and video games. In the interim years, Unikrn has established itself as an endemic esports brand and become woven into the fabric of this rapidly growing community. Their contributions and assets include team ownership, tournament series, multiple original content platforms, sponsored community creators and a works with casinos to bring in modern gaming audiences. The company’s close relationships with gambling powerhouses such as Tabcorp, Australia’s largest betting company, have positioned them as the definitive bridge between the new world of competitive gaming and the old world of sports bookmakers and casinos.  In 2015, Unikrn raised $10M in venture finance from Mark Cuban, Shari Redstone, Elisabeth Murdoch, Ashton Kutcher, Guy O’Seary, Tabcorp, Indicator Ventures and Hyperspeed Ventures. Unikrn’s lead investor is well-know for early investment into Snapchat, and the partners have similar track records with a variety of Silicon Valley successes, including Twitter and Instagram. UnikoinGold closed its crowdsale in October, 2017 after reaching over 112,000 ETH in sales. UnikoinGold and its Crypto platfrom are run by Unikrn’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Unikrn Bermuda Ltd.  ABOUT BITTREX Built and operated in the United States, Bittrex is the next generation crypto trading platform created by security professionals with more than 50 years of combined security and development experience to the trading community from companies including Microsoft, Amazon, Qualys and BlackBerry.

Currently that means you will have to participate in jackpots and win one with a bonus pool to gain UKG, but in the future other services will become available to you that will enable you to gain withdrawable UKG another way.

We took an existing use case with unparalleled depth and scale and designed a crypto expansion to match.  The esports and crypto communities reacted with a historic enthusiasm and confidence in our vision. With over 112,000 ETH collected we are ready to take Unikrn to the next level.  The UnikoinGold platform is like a Formula 1 engine while our competitors are making model Ts. But an engine is only as useful as the machine it powers.  Last week, we continued building that machine, launching an interactive jackpot system that allows our users to win in game items and other digital goods. We also created an app that allows our users to earn a small amount of UKG daily. We built the system to encourage users to turn over their tokens on the platform, and purchase additional tokens.  Users can also trade in their skins for UKG, and we’ll recycle those skins via our jackpot platform. In the past two days, we fine-tuned the jackpot system so that users will get even more UKG from bonus pools with more aggressive pricing for tickets.  As more of the community experiences Unikrn and engages with these (and more) one-of-a-kind experiences, we know UnikoinGold will generate more interest, users and turnover.  We’re also continuing our UKG CS:GO tournaments with ChallengeMe.GG. Before we even delivered tokens, we began those tournaments and we announced our real-money betting Malta license.  We’re committed to bringing in more titles, live betting, skill-based betting, a PVP platform, live stats and readouts for over 4500 esports matches, continued expansion of our rapidly growing custom content with UKG tie-ins, and a European rollout for which we’ve already secured the first part of our license.  That’s the plan. That’s always been the plan. UnikoinGold is unlike anything that came before it, and we’ve already blueprinted the rollout — and as we all know, no real transformation happens overnight.  Even while we forge new ground, we’re also aware that a Formula 1 racecar needs a course, and we are making great progress in vetting and partnering with exchanges to give our customers a safe space to purchase tokens easily and securely. The listing process is a complex one — and it’s much harder than it was in June of 2017. With that said, if getting listed is our biggest short term challenge then we’re in good shape. If any of you reading this feels like making introductions to move things along please feel free to do so! I can be reached at rs at unikrn.com.  Finding an exchange where our customers can safely and easily buy UnikoinGold to participate on our platform is our #1 priority at the moment. We all believe in this company and these products, and with patience you’ll continue to see the results of our continued hard work!  Oh by the way, we are working on updating CoinMarketCap as well. The total number of UKG in circulation is ~130 million, and we’ll continue to do quarterly updates on this as part of our internal audits. We are providing all the wallet addresses and details shortly. Please feel free to share this around",False

Users will be discovering and implementing new ways to utilize open ledgers with smart contracts into the foreseeable future. But there’s a dark side to potential: the dangers of emerging technologies. Security and functionality come to Unikrn at the highest premium, which is why we developed technology to avoid these dangers.  In this case, kittens.  You may have noticed that transactions on the blockchain have crawled this week. The reason, it turns out, is the success of Crypto Kitties — equal parts crypto, pokemon and meme cats — has made the project grow from 4 to 14% of total blockchain network traffic in just a few days. It's actually a beautiful thing, as a life long gamer I love their vision. These guys are making money and making blockchain fun by creating, moving, and breeding digital kittens, it’s really neat.  However, the impact is there simply isn’t enough space in the mined blocks to validate all the pending transactions, so every Ethereum transaction for nearly every ERC20-based project slows down, and GAS is expensive. Except at Unikrn.  That’s because we took the time to think about our token’s core principles and potential uses before we ever launched a sale:  UKG needs to be exchanged in low-latency, high-frequency transactions 24-7, for esports and gaming applications The UKG platform needs to be stable for future betting applications UKG needs to be secure when used on our platform, making our users less susceptible to phishing or hacking attempts The applications we build have to be fun, designed specifically for our users. The UnikoinGold development team saw Crypto Kitties — or a project like it — coming. If the blockchain is susceptible to open development, eventually a high-volume overnight success is going to smash transaction speeds, potentially increase GAS and destabilize the ecosystem we need.  So we built the Unikrn Wallet. If you’ve used UnikoinGold to enter one of our jackpots or if you’ve earned it by playing Dota 2, League of Legends or CS:GO on Connekt, you’ll have noticed that our platform didn’t slow a millisecond while the blockchain came screeching to a crawl under the strain of moving kittens across the world..  That’s because our Wallet allows our users to transact on our platform without needing verification from the wider blockchain. It’s only when users transfer in or out to the public blockchain that they become subject to GAS and kitten blockages again (as the blockchain works to verify the exchange).  I’ve spoken widely about the dangers of bubble ICOs attached to no real-world product, preying on the market with encouragements of investment. Crypto Kitties just exposes how bad some of these ICO’s are structured. In fact, most ICO projects really have no idea how to deal with this backpressure of transactions on the blockchain short of waiting for Ethereum to hard fork.  UnikoinGold was developed as a utility token, with immediate application launches. As we expand applications, create liquidity and grow our platform, other tokens in our space will still be struggling with product and application, especially as they continue to be caught unaware by the kittens of the future.  Crypto Kitties’ impact on the blockchain is just another example of how UKG was designed with foresight in which we did not want to limit ourselves or our customers. We can switch to whatever tech we want whenever there is a good fit. The Crypto Kitties team have created an amazingly cool product that will make the [Suspicious link removed]munity and economy better as a whole. Being prepared for all potential scenarios doesn’t hurt anyone. Our focus is and will remain on platform, customer, experience and security, UKG is being built with use in mind.  That means looking at potential obstacles in the future, not just focusing on the here and now. That means building a platform that will give our users something to enjoy. We’re about creating, not bloviating, and that’s what made us the biggest token sale in esports and gaming history.  That’s what will make us the decentralized token, with a strong support platform, for esports and gaming’s future. Just remember, we’ve been here for 3 years now, we’ve grown to be the strongest brand in global esports betting, we have plenty of work ahead of us!",False

We’ve also heard the voices of fans asking us to reopen direct selling to make buying UKG easy; we cannot do this.  But we have been working with exchanges around the world to give esports, gaming and crypto enthusiasts an opportunity to easily buy UKG from reputable outlets. This process has taken an immense amount of work: it’s harder to get listed on a major exchange than it once was. That’s okay, though, we’re working hard to make UnikoinGold widely available to our customers who reside in hundreds of countries worldwide.  I promise you this work is months in the making, and we will get there. In the meantime we want to create some more opportunities for our customers to easily acquire UKG.  Today, I’m happy to bring two more exchanges into our folds: CoinHub and Braveno. Each brings uniquely valuable traits to the UKG ecosystem that we know will benefit our users, now and in the future.  CoinHub will allow our users to purchase UKG directly with FIAT currency, which is a direct response to our community asking for easier ways to exchange the token. In addition to USD, Euros and SGD, CoinHub will still allow crypto exchanges for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Although CoinHub is new, they’re building a quality regulated platform which works well for our business. CoinHub is available to users in the Middle East and Europe. CoinHub will come online with UnikoinGold within the next 24 hours.  Braveno is an exchange built for companies and developers and should help potential platform partners utilize the Unikrn platform more easily by creating UKG liquidity. This will become increasingly important as our platform continues to grow in functions, experiences and users. Braveno should come online sometime later this week.  In a landscape where overnight fixes and seemingly instantaneous expansions appear to be the norm, there are users who purchased UnikoinGold to use on Unikrn, and these users experiences are our top priority.  I promise that we will not lose sight of the long-term goals that were themselves the fuel that gave UnikoinGold the largest token sale in esports and gaming history. We have consistently encouraged users who were interested in buying UnikoinGold to buy our token to use it on our platform. We will continue to build features that make UKG fun and engaging. The addition of these exchanges will facilitate transactions our community needs to engage with our platform and potential partners need to join us.  The fact is, we’re a business with active token applications, we are continuing to improve token uses, and we are working on building a network of highly respectable exchanges. Blockchain wasn’t built overnight. It takes immense effort to create “sudden” success.  We’ve been doing that work and we are continuing to do that work. In the meantime, we will continue to expand our platform piece by piece to give our users more use cases with a long-term view of how UnikoinGold will become the decentralized token of esports and gaming instead of a instant bubble that served “investors” over users.  To thank our loyal esports and gaming audience for helping power our success in 2017, we have a series of holiday giveaways, jackpots and extra UKG earnings from our platform planned throughout December. You will absolutely want more details.   UnikoinGold’s foundation is strong, but I’m most excited about what we’ll be building on and announcing about that foundation for the end of this year and throughout 2018.

This is a deal years in the making with major implications for gaming and the world of traditional brick-and-mortar tourism.  Las Vegas is one of America’s most-visited cities, and the MGM Grand was arguably the world’s first destination hotel, an idea that revolutionized travel and entertainment a few decades ago. We’re re-disrupting those industries by bringing esports tournaments and UnikoinGold into the casino world, where we’ll unearth a new demographic for MGM and a similarly new experience for the Esports generation...  -Please click the link above to read more!-",False

MGM will not be monopolizing Unikrn's offerings or UnikoinGold in any way. They are incorporating it in their already existing gaming-oriented Bar and brought on Unikrn to do so. Unikrn's expertise and additional offering will expand what MGM already had in place and considers it yet another great avenue to introduce people to esports, Unikrn and UnikoinGold.  Thanks for heads up! Might have to bring them on as a package deal to all that will be engaging with the skill-based wagers, spray it before they teabag/squat down on their opponent and take their UKS/UKG. But in seriousness, we serve different markets and you are the first one to bring this product up. We doubt this will be a problem.

So the wallet you used to send Ether during the tokensale, will have been credited with the UnikoinGold tokens.  Make sure your wallet interface supports UnikoinGold natively or supports adding custom tokens. Here is the information you will need to add UnikoinGold as a custom token:  Token Contract Address: 0x24692791bc444c5cd0b81e3cbcaba4b04acd1f3b Token Symbol: UKG Decimals: 18",False

Our expanding partnership with Playwire is another step toward Unikrn becoming the premier outlet for everything esports and gaming. Playwire Media will exclusively represent Unikrn's esports media, bringing a level of expert knowledge to advertising, branding and US event sponsorship often lacking in the vibrant, but fairly young, esports industry.  ""With this union, reaching an esports audience is becoming easier than ever before, especially with the rollout of UnikoinGold helping to break down international barriers of entry,"" our CEO, Rahul Sood, said. ""There’s no longer an excuse for brands to ignore this rapidly growing and enormously influential demographic.""  We expect Playwire to build on our foundation endemic to the esports and gaming world as well as our success fusing traditional brands and products with modernized experiences for the esports generation, such as our recently announced partnership to bring tournaments into the MGM Grand Las Vegas. Although this is our second major partnership announcement this week, don't be fooled;  Unikrn has a track record for fusing traditional brands and products with gaming experiences to appeal to a modern generation of gamers and esports fans. Playwire Media will build on this groundwork to bring in more experiences, funding and participation.  “Through our relationship with Unikrn, we will be offering brands unique access to a millennial demographic that has tremendous value and purchasing power,” said Jayson Dubin, CEO, Playwire Media. “Our collaboration gives our brand partners the ability to reach their audiences through an avenue that’s ever-evolving with no signs of slowing down.”  Many NBA teams have taken the plunge to start their own esports teams under the new NBA 2K League. Unikrn will bring regular NBA 2K Tournaments to venues for March Madness, and will work with Playwire Media to expose brands to partnership opportunities with the Dallas Mavericks and other teams.",False

Trying to rectify this now by adding more monitoring on these type of forums, however the main activity is on Discord, Reddit, Facebook DMs, Support mail and Twitter DMs. It also seems the information on the website (FAQ and Whitepaper) is enough for a lot of people. Since this project is focused on gamers first, crypto enthusiasts second this thread was a little later than we wanted. Though it seems these two groups overlap quite a bit which is awesome as a prospect and to further the engagement to these demographics.  I will be looking more into the replies to this thread and try to respond as often as I can and include members of the Unikrn team when necessary.  Quote from: rjefferson on October 10, 2017, 02:12:54 AM How many tokens are being sold?  200.000.000 UKG are up for sale.

Thnaks for your answers  and sorry for my english   1. Company is seperate so I do not know whether they will be sharing this kind of information. Previous requests have been denied. Though they are looking into which numbers they can publicly braodcast regarding usage and activity on the platform. Rahul named some numbers in one AMA Livestream. I'll timestamp some highlights regarding that:  Livestream link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE8wbkp_ct4  31:55 - Q11 - How are you going to ensure stability of the token? Here he goes into the traditional investments and Unikrn being a frugal company with lots of runway left. 51:45 - Q20 - How big is Unikrn’s user base overall? 58:49 - Q24 - Are you looking to build bigger and better tournaments in the future?  The team is focused on growth and expanding into various markets. Cryptocurrency is a big enabler for many of the features and services they are looking to offer worldwide. Some recent big developments regarding their expansion to various markets:  Macau http://agbrief.com/news/unikrn-talks-macau-gaming-operators Asia and Europe http://macaubusinessdaily.com/Business/Taking-tokens-Asia On Unikrn in Europe by an esports site https://esportsobserver.com/unikrn-esports-eu-betting/ GlobeNewswire / NASDAQ /https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/10/09/1142935/0/en/Unikrn-Brings-Live-Immersive-Esports-Betting-to-Europe-with-RBP-Joint-Venture-and-Malta-License.html Also goes into some of the numbers of Unikrn's EU partner.  2. UnikoinGold's FAQ mentions it as following:  Will UnikoinGold be listed on exchanges and if so which ones?  Our team is focused on building a product and platform. Our major puchasers who participated in the presale are helping to connect UKG to exchanges. Listings will occur after November 5th.  Quote from: gutshot5820 on October 08, 2017, 03:04:34 AM So, I'm interested. I put a couple of ETH in, but what I'm thinking is: what's the long term plan? I know they're working on getting fiat betting in the US, but will they actually become the universal token in esports?  Longterm vision is indeed to become the go-to token for esports. No doubt about that. The team has the vision, is expanding overall services and features to heighten the experience for gamers and fans around their favourite esports titles. They are also looking at expanding the overall token utility with potential additional service providers, partnerships and more services to offer. If you have any suggestions, be sure to hop in on the discord and share your thoughts. Any and all feedback, criticisms and ideas are always welcome to help improve the platform and token's utility. Also see the links I placed in response to the previous question, quite some expansion and scaling in the works.  The creation of this token will allow them to service gamers and fans globally. Which is what they are focusing on now. (See also how they approach limited and full jurisdictions in the Whitepaper.) Legal and compliance is very important for this project.  Short additions or mentions: - Looking at licensing out the tech to other licensed operators to expand the overall reach of services to esports fans. - They have various deep ties in the esports scene. Ranging from team ownership to running tournaments. They are looking to expand their own activity but also to work with existing providers and organizers to broaden the overall use and application of the token. - Building various ways and services in which they can help casinos with esports and to facilitate experiences for their customers. Events and machines or areas to engage with esports in casinos or to have casinos run various events to specifically cater to esports fans.

Personally I very much agree. With exchanges delisting or not listing certain tokens, with government agencies looking to crack down or investigate. Not all projects are safe, despite their 'decentralized' nature.  UnikoinGold's tokensale was set up with one of the best firms in the US to tackle cryptocurrency-related regulation and legislation for compliance. Unikrn are working with regulators in two fields (cryptocurrency and online gambling) and will stay on top of their compliance at all times!

We're an esports company, established in 2014.   The Unikoin project started two years ago as we created it to build community in new markets, test new products, and improved the efficacy of our sportsbook.  We have a number of new decentralized applications coming for our community including the ability to earn tokens for playing games on our servers.  We also have our own tournament platform which will be centered around UnikoinGold.  Lots happening no doubt, and sorry we haven't been here sooner - we've been focused on building a company and creating our new platform for UnikoinGold.  We're migrating the old Unikoin userbase and product to UnikoinGold and UnikoinSilver.

I am one of the mods on the Discord channel, to verify feel free to check out the Discord and hit me up!  Unikrn is really trying to attract everyone with the emphasis on this token being used on the platform and with future platform partners. This is a utility token, to earn more by wagering on your own skill in multiplayer games with skill based applications and/or (if allowed in your jurisdiction) chance based applications where you can bet on your favorite Esports competitions! Just to name a few of the benefits.  I would say it is attracting a lot of people and attention already with over 90,000 ETH raised in it's token sale, over 30,000 of that being raised by general token sale participants.   Unikrn is aiming to be THE E-sports betting platform and they have already raised more than all of their other E-sports related crypto token seller... COMBINED.  Not to toot their horn ... but forget that... toot toot! Find out more at https://UnikoinGold.com",False
