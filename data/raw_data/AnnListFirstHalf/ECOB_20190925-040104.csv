We will be focusing on this for the time being and once they are all set up we will focus on more projects in the near future.

So the CC/Carbon offset market definitely has a lot of potential and this project constitutes a large part of the voluntary market.  The high level of professionalism of this project in general should weed out the worries concerning the negative aspects of the voluntary CC trading/carbon offset market. Also the fact that this project uses NEM means that this project has a huge advantage vis-a-vis other projects in the voluntary market since it assures to a large extent its legimitacy since all transactions and doings are written in the blockchain. This also should take away at least some worries concerning the negative aspects of the voluntary CC trading market.  On the other hand, Ecobit operates on the voluntary CC trading market, which is small in comparison to the compulsory market. I believe the entire market in 2014 was worth about 275 million Ecobit would have to get recognition from an organisation like Gold Standard in order to succesfully be able to compete on this market, which I think shouldn't be too hard considering the scale, quality and UN REDD+ endorsement of this project. Still then according to Ecobit their annual revenue they get is like 5-15 M USD a year, not bad, but not huge either. Still I am not sure how this is calculated. On their website they claim 800 M ton of Carbon over 30 years and according to reports the forecast price for carbon is about 15 to 50 USD in the near future, which would put the potential revenue way above 5 to 15M USD a year, but perhaps those forecasts involve the regulated markets. It's too vague for me to really comprehend, and I feel like this is the main issue with this ICO. It's vague on multiple levels. Like they already assured a deal for the next 30 years with Carbon offset/CC trading, however then why is this still listed on the ICO roadmap as though it requires 5k bitcoins to yet be implemented? It's vague because there is no central CEO, a public figure if you will, who explains all and can bear responsibility. It's also vague because the value of the project already is capped at almost 300 Million USD, with 8888888888 tokens of 3k satoshi, which I believe is a huge mistake. In its current format the ICO to me looks like this; an easy way to gain as much extra profits from this CC trading/offset deal as possible which imo is very sad because the business model involving Ecobits DOES have a lot of potential. Due to the professionalism and the scale of the project, the potential to create a billion dollar eco-tourism industry, the ecobits high-tech monetary system etc. it would be a very attractive investment imo if the team decided to keep 15-20 percent as premine and let the market decide the price with the ICO. If that were the case, personally I'd consider everything up till 30M ICO a very good opportunity to make gains in the future. This project demands trust that it's worthy of an almost 300 M USD market cap based on a deal in a relative small market, a good plan with a good team, but that's not in accordance with crypto dynamics. First you prove you are worthy of a higher market cap by delivering, consolidating fundamentals etc. before you rise in rank, that's the game and how it should be. The term ""organic growth"" should give an extra dimension to this project in order for me to be considered an attractive investment.  So in short; if team decides to provide the necessary clearity regarding the points just mentioned adjusts their ICO business model and let the free markets do their thing I think it's a good investment. In its current format it comes across as too vague and greed imo. There seems to be a trade-off between short term short-sighted greed and long term good standing reputation and realising potential in the long run. I am afraid in its current format the price would drop a lot once the tokens hit the free markets, thereby it will be hard to regain trust, if at all.  This is just my personal opinion, everybody should do his/her own research ofcourse.  ",False

No worries, as the whole vision and concept might too overwhelming initially, but gradually with some Q&A session, things will be clearer.  However I feel like you would do all of us potential investors a huge favor if you could clarify till what extent the tokens that are not being sold during the ICO and are held by the team will be a part of the market capitalization, how will they be used?  Any EcoBit not sold will be held by the team and divided for each segment, like Long Term Investment,  Short Term Investment, Acquisition, Sales &  Marketing, Research & Development , Projects & etc. The percentage is not yet determined, but we will decide once ICO is over.  We will practice announcement like Public Listed Company (PLC) do, if we want to “sell or buy” any of the EcoBit in advance notice, if the total amount of EcoBit involved more than 5% of the total issued EcoBit. We are not into pump and dump, and price variation is very important to us, we wish to achieved slow and steady increment in term of participants and price, on long term basis.   Also, all these projects sound great, have you thought about creating an eco-tourism industry also, will Ecobit tokens be used in such a context or nation wide, or perhaps both? it seems to me that there is a lot economic potential regarding the establishing of a viable eco-tourism industry in the region, or perhaps nation wide.  Yes, the EcoBit Hotel & Eco Tourism is supposed to address this specific project. We shall do it locally within Phase 2 (first one year) via used- container concept (but it won’t looks like container from the outside) , and then nationwide. We will integrate our EcoBit Blockchain Card to track and use for the benefit too and for POS system too.    If the business model aligns with the greatness that this project intends to radiate and mainstream investors get involved, then I think this project has a lot of potential to flourish into the billions over time, mainly because this is a market with a lot of potential and demand in the future.  This is our idea  in the first place and after our ICO ends, we can start show casting our projects to potential participants. The idea is to create a platform for mainstream and international people to participate and enjoy the benefit. Once we achieved Phase 2, we would like to interested parties to join us in Phase 3, where we can duplicate the whole idea to another country.  The only thing that can thwart a great future is individual and short term greed/profit at the expense of a great future, which happens quite a lot actually, so I really hope you guys will clarify a lot concerning the risk/reward ratio for investors.  Please understand  the age range of our team members are from 30 to 60 years, and not some young kids who has never manage big projects and millions of dollars. We trust in 2 years’ time, people will be asking this question “Which coin listed in coinmarketcap is backed by real projects like EcoBit?”  Will there be a common spirit driving this project along holistically or will implementation be fragmented? for investors it's important also to know there is a great vision behind the project that goes beyond the big picture, a specific vision applicable to this project.  The vision for EcoBit is focus on green, sustainable and renewable projects and healthy lifestyle, so that the member’s can enjoy the constant benefits from their projects on long-term basis.  For that I think it's important for Mr Tang to let his voice be heard and be able to explain exactly how it's all supposed to come together.  The team and Mr Tang will be doing a FB Live session. The schedule will be posted shortly.   There is potential of the project and then there is the business model, till what extent these line up determines till what extent this project can be considered a good investment. You guys did a great job so far explaining/expressing the former, now it's also time to focus on the latter.  If any projects milestone are met, the Aquaponics and Spirulina Farm will be up and running within 3 months’ time. For those risk adverse, this might be a good time to join the EcoBit Family as it will be listed on few exchanges and “first blood has passed (If any)”.",False

More about additionality.  Lack of Fairness Critics have also raised concerns over equality and fairness based on the argument that carbon offsetting enables developed nations to perpetuate unsustainable lifestyles by funding carbon projects in developing countries. Some argue that these projects rarely lead to benefits for the host community, and have gone so far as to call the offset market a form of carbon colonialism.  Lack of Transparency The voluntary offset market in particular has been criticized for its lack of transparency, quality assurance and third-party standards.     http://www.france24.com/en/20160503-france-trial-multi-billion-carbon-emissions-trading-fraud-opens-paris   http://www.rbs.co.uk/corporate/banking/g6/online/common-scams/investment-fraud/carbon-credit-fraud.ashx   https://www.avivainvestors.com/en-gb/adviser/site-information/carbon-credit-scams.html  https://wattsupwiththat.com/2016/09/20/carbon-credit-climate-scam-the-fraud-prosecutions-begin/  http://www.redd-monitor.org/2016/09/02/why-is-vcs-so-reluctant-to-help-stamp-out-carbon-credit-scams/",False

You may be offered carbon credit certificates, voluntary emission reductions (VERs), certified emission reductions (CERs) or an opportunity to invest directly in a ’green‘ scheme or project that generates carbon credits as a return on investment.  Carbon credits and VERs certificates are often labelled as ’certified‘, but this certification is voluntary and involves a wide range of bodies and different quality standards that are not recognised by any UK compensation scheme.  The caller may claim carbon credits are ‘the new big thing’ in commodity trading, industries now have to off-set their emissions, the government is focusing on green developments or that it is a growing market.",False

One should always do due diligence (seems often unheard-of in the crypto world). - The EcoBit team is not going to close their ICO in 10 days - there is an extended ICO period. - I think the next 60 days (or 57 days, to be precise) is where tough questions should be asked by others (and answers shared by the EcoBit team).

EcoBit is blockchain digital crypto token/coin which is decentralised and 100% transparent.  WHAT IS ECO-CAPITAL/GREEN-CAPITAL? Eco-capital - also known as green capital - is a representation of “nature’s economic value”, a term used for natural living things; natural resources such as forests, water and air; and all natural assets such as the cap and trade system, and carbon trading (putting a price on carbon emission into the atmosphere).

Note: Not all projects will take place. This depends on the total funds raised in the ICO.  WHY DOES ECOBIT(ECO) HAVE A HUGE POTENTIAL?
