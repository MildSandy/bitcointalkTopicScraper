We admittedly were not aware of the aforementioned site.  Ethbooks is different as it targets a certain niche: crypto-info-seekers. So the ebooks that will be published on EthBooks will have something to do with cryptocurrencies.  There are so many people out there seeking credible and reliable information on this new and booming phenomenal of cryptos, but very little is available currently.  We aim to fill that gap by allowing authors to publish their work on our platform under different topics related to cryptocurrencies for free. On the other end crypto-info thirsty buyers will be able to search, review and purchase the ebooks that interest them.  In a nutshell, EthBooks will be a one-stop ebook store for all matters crypto. The cryptocurrency rush has just began and EthBooks is best placed to grow along.",False
