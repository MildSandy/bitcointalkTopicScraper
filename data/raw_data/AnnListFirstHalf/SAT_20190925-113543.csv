Yes, we are alive.  No, we are not abandoning bitcointalk.  You're right in that we've been active in other communication channels and not as much here - and we apologize for the silence.  We've been quite preoccupied with the other aspects of our ICO.  Attempting to capitalize on the recent Facebook scandal without a plan would've been a misstep and a misapplication of our resources.  We could still potentially use it to our advantage, but there are other matters that take priority at this time.  Right now, the devs have been largely focused on tackling bugs and the issue of monetization. As well as economics for the token.  Meanwhile us members of the marketing team have been busy applying to many different exchanges that are big and small. It's been a very rewarding learning process because we're getting to know the industry more, as well as many of the different standards across the industry when it comes to listing a token.  We've been making many small changes to the site, such as the news portal and web application.  The web application is actually still available. Here is the link to the page: https://sphere.social/hello/  Token distribution will take priority for the time being since we're doing it manually, one by one.  So we ask that if you're a supporter of our project, please remember to enable custom tokens on your ERC20 wallet. Many of our users actually haven't added their address yet.  We are pleased to say that we are making some progress on getting on a larger exchange as opposed to a smaller one.  The market has changed, there is no denying that.  But it hasn't and will not hinder us from moving forward and continuing development. Markets change, and so will we.  Right now, giving back to our supporters is our number one priority.  For April, we are focused on fostering growth and substantive development for our network.  That is why in the very near future, we plan on announcing a closed beta for a new feature that will become available sometime later this month for the app.  The ICO will end April 9th as planned. Afterwards we will shift our marketing strategy.",False

If you invested in a project, you already stated you believe in it and you trust it to return a good revenue on investment.",False

And Sphere is actually a great name which is important and will give this platform an edge over other decentralized Facebook's coming out.  What I need to know before investing is:  1) Is Sphere actually (going to be) decentralized? Is the entire software going to be hosted on Ethereum (or a blockchain) or is it just the token hosted on Ethereum while the software is run on a central server? 2) Since a successful Social Network will require a lot of transactions per second, how will it scale if it's successful? What happens if Ethereum is unable to scale quickly enough in the future? 3) How is the governing of Sphere going to be decentralized? Will there by a constitution? Will there be voting? Who will get to vote? Or will Sphere the company still control it in the future thereby it won't truly be decentralized?  From what I understand about Steemit:  1) It is actually entirely on a blockchain. 2) The governing is decentralized and the founder has moved on/lost control. 3) It can scale.  If we are just replacing one centralized Facebook with another centralized Facebook that happens to pay users in crypto currency, it's still a big advantage/improvement over Facebook.  However, I would think a truly decentralized Facebook like Steemit that no one controls would outcompete Sphere over time. Thus I'd rather save my ICO money for that if/when it comes out. A big problem however, is that there really are a limited number of GOOD NAMES for social networks. Sphere happens to be a great name. It could pose a threat to Facebook if done right and truly decentralized.",False

Had to look really hard for good topics or blogs. The reward system or steem power has rendered a group of people so powerful that the contents in the eco system has become monopolised. Bitcointalk, on the other hand, is a better goose in terms of functionality. That the admins are proactive in removing spammers is laudable but yes the interface looks dated. Now, I have explored several community/forum cms with great functions and UIs. But they are not as powerful as simplemachine cms this forum is based on and the load on the server with so many users will be enormous. This dated look here is because the admins have deliberately made the choice of prioritizing performance over aesthetics.

Good point that some readers might think I was referring to a developed product, not an ICO. I updated my post accordingly to clarify that my review is about the Sphere ICO, not about a Sphere developed and released final product.  Quote You utter the words ""for profit"" as if they were some sort of crime.  I was not implying that. My point is that ""usually"" a corporation first priority is to hoard money. Not serve the users and protect their privacy. Compare to other ICO which are owned by not-for profit organization.  My point is that open source software are more secure. Because the code is available publicly. So it can not be review by the public. And open source software is usually focused on people-servant, instead of money-servant. Related video for users and buyers, about why not-for profit open source software is better for you at https://youtu.be/ZPPikY3uLIQ  How about we agree that we have different priority? Feel free to have your own priority. To each their own.   Quote Open-source has its place, and it's certainly fun for those working on it, but there are benefits to not being open-source as well- namely fast, organized decision-making, and being able to pay the experts we need to make the code work, rather than just hoping someone will come along with the expertise needed.  I founded a corporation 23 years ago. Since then we where able to achieve all of these benefits with open source software. Have you previously successfully tried a business model based on fully open source software? Again how about we agree that we have different interest about the type of software and their respective future? Please do feel really free to not use open source. To each their own.

Which is at https://sphere.social  Summary: Token. Weak ethic. NOT decentralized.  The good:  • Token can be exchange for services within Sphere Social (SS). In the unlikely event that it’s successful. I do not trust and will not invest in SS though.  The bad:  • Sphere Social (SS) is NOT really fully decentralized. They try to fool you into believing that they are decentralized. To do so they use the popular word “decentralized” all over their whitepaper. In fact SS is mostly CENTRALIZED. They claim that they are decentralized because they offer reward tokens. Which they call Social Activity Tokens (SAT). Tokens are not to confuse with a full decentralized Social Network. Sorry but those are two different things. Read on for other red flags. In other words, SS are misleading and deceiving you. This shows they have a weak ethic. When most users figure this out the value of their token will crash and users will leave. To the benefit of really decentralized Social Network. Such as https://DiasporaFoundation.org or https://Minds.com   • NOT distributed. And NOT federated. Read more about the definition of distributed and federated networks at:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_social_network  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_(information_technology)  • Sphere tried to mislead you and deceive you into beleiving that blockchain and distributed storage are the same thing. Extract from Sphere whitepaper v1.7.4 on page 19: “a decentralized social media platform that stores multimedia and other data on a secured blockchain rather than on traditional servers.” Source at https://sphere.social/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Sphere_Whitepaper_v1.7.4.pdf  Their claim is unethical because by definition a “blockchain” is a cryptographically secured ledger that can be permissionless and decentralized. A blockchain is NOT to confuse with a distributed storage of social multimedia and other data. In Sphere's claim above, notice that they tried to mislead you and deceive you into believing that ""blockchain"" and ""distributed storage"" are the same thing. They are not.  The above is one of the many unethical claims in the Sphere whitepaper. Did you spot the other unethical claims?  An ethical claim would be: “Sphere stores multimedia and other data on a secured decentralized storage rather than on traditional secured centralized storage. And store its SAT tokens in on a secured blockchain.” Assuming that those are their real intentions.  Maybe the Sphere founders are not familiar with the most widely recognized definition of blockchain? For investors, buyers, and users interested to not getting scam by unethical abuse of words such as “blockchain”, “decentralized”, “cryptocurrency”, “token”, a good start is to educate yourself. For example Corbett Report did an informative video about the nuances in the jargon. Very good to watch. They are good and bad crypto currencies. Educate yourself to not get scam by the bad ones. Video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkhUn7nh33Q  • Potentially NOT secure. Because the code is not available publicly. So it can not be review by the public. In other words, there is a risk of abuse. The software code is NOT open source. So weak security. And high risk of abuse by people with immature behaviors. Compare to https://DiasporaFoundation.org or https://Minds.com code which are open source and can be review by all.  • Owned by the for-profit corporation Sphere Network LTD. Which was recently created on 13 September 2017. With correspondence address at Otonomos (Uk) Ltd, 1 Fore Street, London, United Kingdom, EC2Y 9DT.  According to legal records, this for-profit corporation is controlled by only two people. They are Mr Andrew Khong and Mr Tuong Pham. 25 to 50% each. Both are residents of the USA. Source at https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10961486  SS advertised that you are 100% in control of your content. That's false. As stated above, only two people have full controls of all your SS content, including censorship. Others have limited and partial decision-making control over your content.  This means that SS is primarily Money-Servant. Not People-Servant. In other words, Sphere is not owned by a not-for-profit community. Usually a corporation first priority is to hoard money. Not serve you and protect your privacy.  • Bad choice of name. Because there is already a Sphere Social network. That's gonna create confusion. The other network was founded in 2008 http://www.the-sphere.com  Wiki page at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sphere_(social_network)  • Their primary front-end website at https://sphere.social seems to be partly powered by Wordpress. As you know SS back-end software is NOT open source. But SS use the open source project Wordpress for their primary front-end website. And do NOT give credit to the Wordpress community. SS's behaviors are awkward and self-centered.  • Not friendly with United States and Singapore citizens. If you try to register they greet you with a email asking you to confirm that you’re not a citizen from those countries. Source at https://www.minds.com/media/803754670359556096 So the two owners of SS are citizens of USA, but they do not welcome other citizens of USA to use SS. That is really suspicious.  • Weak ethic. Because they tried to fool their user into believing that they are decentralized. This is false. They are primarily centralized.   How to not get scam?  A good start is to educate yourself. For example Corbett Report did an informative video about the nuances in the jargon. Such as blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and decentralize. Very good to watch. They are good and bad crypto currencies. Educate yourself to not get scam by the bad ones. Video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkhUn7nh33Q   I wrote my review as a volunteer.

Sphere is not yet decentralized.  We are not trying to fool anyone about that.  We don't ""claim we are decentralized because we offer a reward token""- that doesn't even make any sense.    We have a plan to put our social network- which is only in beta right now, so people can try it out and get used to the interface- on the blockchain and make it decentralized.  To do that, we need money.  To raise the money, we have created the Social Activity Token (SAT), a new form of digital currency designed to be used within Sphere – to connect people online for advertising, finding, sharing, buying, selling, and trading products and services.     You write the words ""for profit"" as if they were some sort of crime.  Maybe someday this world will be a socialist paradise where all our governments are handing out that sweet universal income.  Alas, until that day we all still have to make a buck and feed our families,  and Sphere Social wants to share the profit with our users. We  will use the proceeds of the ICO to decentralize, improve, and add features to Sphere Social.   Hopefully, SAT will increase in value due to the features we add, since they will include ways to use the token. This would benefit both the company and the token holders.   Read our whitepaper- we will give users the choice of whether or not to sell their personal data and which parts to sell- and if they do sell it, they get a portion of any profit we make on it.  Open-source has its place, and it's certainly fun for those working on it, but there are benefits to not being open-source as well- namely fast, organized decision-making, and being able to pay the experts we need to make the code work, rather than just hoping someone will come along with the expertise needed.

If it is not divisible it will not grow in value. Why??? Because it must not grow in value!!! Why???  Sphere social and it's market where people will be able to trade the gods using SAT tokens is a modern idea, therefore it has to and it will (if successful) compete with Facebook and Amazon one day which monthly turnover exceeds hundreds of millions of USD.  People on Amazon are able to buy/sell things for as little as 5 or even 1 USD or even less.  If sphere social and its market will be successful at the beginning, we may expect significant grow in value of the SAT token, but at the end if SAT token is not divisible or it is not divisible to enough ""minisats"", it will be disaster for the sphere social market (it will implode under its own success) because if 1 SAT token will be worth 5 USD for example, people will not be able to trade the gods below that amount.  There is tens of thousands of items on Amazon below 5 USD and less and this is BIG BIG share of Amazon turnover.  Preferably 1 SAT should be divisible to at least 10K ""minisats"", so one day when 1 SAT HOPEFULLY AND THEORETICALLY will be worth 1000 USD, the price of SAT token will not affect the market because 1 SAT =1000 USD divided by 10K minisats = 0.10 cent which will be the smallest amount tradeable on the market.  So, Iam asking again.  Is SAT token divisible or not??? If yes, then to how many ""minisats"" it is divisible???  One more question. I am unable to buy SAT tokens using credit card anymore. Can you explain to us what happened???   PS. don't laugh at 1 SAT= 1000 USD There is one billion SAT tokens but remember that unsold tokens will be burned.

Quote from: Yasemin on December 19, 2017, 07:54:12 AM    That is actually an interesting question. On almost every social media, you can report unacceptable content, like racist content. How will that work when the social media is decentralized??  There you have it, report button for criminal or unauthorized content. It could be put on a vote, wether to remove content or not. Say 1000 random and active platform users will get an invite to vote on some content. When first 100 have voted, and 75% says remove content then it will be taken down. The rest dont have to vote.

There’s been a lot of talk about dividends on the thread.  We’d like to thank you for bringing this to our attention, because our marketing team actually used the wrong word.  “Dividends” is not in our white paper, but it was on our website.  This was a serious error on our part and that word has been removed and replaced with “rewards”.   We apologize deeply for the confusion.  As for the questions about how SAT will be utilized on our platform for profit, we have plans to have users spend SAT as a currency within our network. We will incentivize the use of SAT in many ways, including the marketplace to trade tokens for goods or services, paying users micro-transactions for ad clicks, and various types of social connections.  Users will also have the choice of remaining anonymous or getting paid by making decisions about what personal information and browsing data to sell.  Several other incentives are still being planned and developed and will be announced to the public at a later date.    I'd like to further clarify our plans to incentivize SAT so that it will increase in worth:  1. Social transactions - Make use of SAT to send money to another user. 2. We plan to integrate a Marketplace. - Users can simply create products or advertise services that their friends can see and purchase using SAT 3. Sphere Ad Platform - Users can easily advertise their products by displaying targeted ad pieces in the news feed. Users will have to pay for the advertising space. The platform will feature per-click and per -impression functions and cost will be deducted automatically from the seller's wallet. 4. Users will be getting paid if they allow a portion or all of their of their data to sold. ",False

We will incentivize the use of SAT in many ways, including the marketplace to trade tokens for goods or services, paying users micro-transactions for ad clicks, and various types of social connections.  Users will also have the choice of remaining anonymous or getting paid by making decisions about what personal information and browsing data to sell.

Any smart investor will ask that. Steemit seems rather successful and given what your whitepaper says, it appears that this is very similar to Steemit but only differing in about 2-3 areas.  1) Using the ethereum chain to launch the platform 2) Having more liquidity in earned tokens with a debit card 3) Having a mobile application ready (even though ios is in beta) for use.  I see the last point being your biggest advantage over that network but the other two don't seem as differentiating. And that might not be enough of a difference to be regarded as something different. Steemit is already rolling so what's gonna make other people use this instead of Steemit (at least from what you can control) when trying to break away from Facebook or the likes?  Assuming you aren't a scam dev team, I know you don't want to be regarded as a clone, yet that will happen once someone familiar with crypto reads the whitepaper.

Your data is sold by them, many times without your permission, knowledge, or consent.  Don't you think you should be entitled to better privacy protection?  Don't you think you should be entitled to a portion of the riches made from your data?  We do! And we believe it's finally time to stand up to these companies and take back the Internet!  THE SOLUTION  Sphere was built on the idea that privacy, company transparency, and data security should be the fundamental building block of every social platform. We believe that the millions those corporations are making from your data doesn't belong to them, it belongs to you.  We are creating a decentralized social network, separate from those corporations, that allows exactly that. You have a say, you get compensated, and above all you take back the power with every connection and every interaction.
