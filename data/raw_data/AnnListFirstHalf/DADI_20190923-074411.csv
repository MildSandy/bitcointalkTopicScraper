We‚Äôve been flat out so far in 2019, with a huge level of development and highly significant progress in terms of strategic positioning and planning for the evolution and expansion of our roadmaps.  Year to date commits? 3,126 üí•  As a company we‚Äôre heading toward our sixth birthday: we‚Äôre 5 years, 10 months and 24 days old. We‚Äôre the granddaddy of the cryptosphere üòÇ  We are in the midst of a brand refresh ‚Äì the fourth iteration, designed to better harness our market positioning and to support our growth for the long term. The team is working to a deadline of early-mid July for launch, along with an updated site focused on network-level services (on which you can find out more here: [https://dadi.cloud/en/knowledge/network/network-level-services/](https://dadi.cloud/en/knowledge/network/network-level-services/)).  The community will be brought across plans ahead of launch.  Network stats    Our mainnet continues to grow, both in terms of capacity and in terms of production load. The network is comprised of members of the Founding Node programme and a series of non-earning masternodes managed by the core team.  As we start to move beyond this in the coming months we expect to see significant growth in network capacity, which in turn will support increasing customer usage.    Earnings    Earnings in April returned 42% against the Founding Node proof of stake and May is expected to be even higher as more traffic has come onto the network, even when considering the number of nodes sharing in earnings will have grown.    Earning reports and payouts for May will happen in the first week of June.  We expect to have earnings and payouts fully automated and running daily by the end of July. Hopefully sooner.  We‚Äôve been engaged with HMRC here in the UK about the VAT treatment of tokens within a decentralised context. We‚Äôre working to be able to give clarity in relation to the tax position of network transactions for contributors to the network. Whilst we have a pretty clear view on this front, it is important that we seek confirmation from the relevant authorities on the application of any recent guidance and existing regulatory regimes. Once we have this we‚Äôll share the details of the position. In the fullness of time our intention is to be able to provide specific guidance on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis (as we‚Äôve discussed here before).  Development report    The network engineering team have been preparing for a major upgrade to mainnet, bringing a little over a month‚Äôs worth of development work to live.  The my.dadi.cloud stack has been containerised for local development, which has enabled us to start working on integrating it with the new network changes, as well as to start work on an automated tested for the stack. This includes a network ready build of Publish, which is currently in testing.  A new service for network telemetry was completed, written in Go and deployed successfully to test.network. It will be moved to mainnet - edge.network - once testing completes. Testing has already raised a few issues which we are working hard to patch ahead of planned release to mainnet in the next fortnight. The update provides a greater level of data insight into activity on nodes, which is central to the next release of the network explorer.  The network data synchronisation layer has progressed nicely, and we are now able to detect devices coming online and going offline in any datacenter in the world. This is the next stage of the multi-DC work, the data from which will be stored under my.dadi.cloud. You can read about multi datacenter world here: https://dadi.cloud/en/knowledge/network/scaling-the-edge/  Progress towards the cracking of secure ACL for self-onboarding has been very strong, with a proof of concept revealed internally last week. Efforts to determine how best to integrate this in to the testnet are ongoing.  The team have also been working on integrating Vault into Consul ACL. This is a big update to the platform that will take a number of weeks to bear fruit.  An auto SSL certificate generation service was scoped, built and released: Gateways now create free SSL certificates using Lets Encrypt for all apps deployed to the network. This means that any domain that you configure against your apps in my.dadi.cloud will automatically run under SSL in the network. This is BOTH for the subdomains the network generates for you, and also for your own domains mapped in to the network. We‚Äôll be writing about this in more detail soon.  A remote update system for Stargate was completed, which allows for configuration files to be updated automatically. The update included the addition of remote control of the BGP system, which is now deployed as a container in the application - enhancing security and hugely improving efficiency.  Finally the team completed a Consul replicate deployment - a big step in getting the network explorer to persist service data.    We moved a step closer to the release of API 5.0, which includes a tonne of changes.  We also completed development on a Golang wrapper for API. Documentation is being written and once done we will be releasing it as an Open Source package.    CDN version 3.6.9 was released. This brings animated gif support to the platform. Release notes and source code: https://github.com/dadi/cdn/releases/tag/v3.6.0    We‚Äôre around 95% through a conversion of Publish to React. The approach here is designed to better align our interfaces to one of the webs most active communities. It also opens up a lot of new functionality for our interfaces.  Customer stories    Tiipr    We‚Äôve been working with mobile startup Tiipr. They are developing a tipping application that guarantees that tips go to their intended recipient, and that makes payments to staff in real time. It‚Äôs a super smart and pretty revolutionary concept for the service industry. And the app itself is looking quite brilliant.  We are supporting them in development: the app is being built using our technology stack, and it will be running in the network using storage (including database use), caching and compute services.  A pre-launch site is live and running in the network. You can see it here: https://tiipr.com  Tiipr‚Äôs roadmap is pretty aggressive, and should see the first build of their consumer app live this summer. As soon as it is out there, we‚Äôll let you know.  We‚Äôve also been given permission to share details about the build and its performance within the network. We‚Äôll be writing about this as we go.  Ecohustler    Ecohustler launched a new version of their site on our stack at https://ecohustler.com  The site went from concept to live in five weeks, providing a great example of what‚Äôs possible in the stack.  They are also going to be launching an app which will be API and Store, both running in the network. We expect to have the details of this fleshed out in early June.  PPA    The PPA‚Äôs site is being moved to our stack. This kicked off four weeks ago and is due to complete next week. The site is a port from SiteCore, with a design and functionality refresh included. This is another great example of how quickly you can move using our technology, and as with Tiipr and Ecohustler, it will be running in the network and we‚Äôll be reporting back on performance over time.  (We also launched a voting site for the PPA Festival, also built on our tech: [https://ppacoveroftheyear.co.uk/ ‚Äì get your vote in now! [Closing date 07th June])  New business & outreach    We have around 40 active deals in our new business pipeline with a combined value of over 6 million USD.  We met with fifteen new prospects in May. These ranged from startups looking for technology to get their products online quickly, to established businesses in streaming media, to data companies looking for storage capacity for their AI training data.  The team took to the stage at the PPA festival in Tobacco Dock in East London, talking on a variety of themes including blockchain, AI and headless content management technology.  Paul spoke along with Eduardo as well as our advisor Rob Belgrave from Wirehive (https://www.wirehive.com), and all of the sessions were very well received.    Staffing    We are currently hiring for three key roles: a senior engineer for our web services; a senior engineer to join the networking team; and a seasoned sales director. If you know anyone that would fit the bill, please point them in our direction.  James is stepping down as our CTO. He will remain attached to the business as a senior technical advisor. Arthur is being promoted to the role after four years with the company, two of which have been as the technical lead for the network. He‚Äôs the perfect fit as we move our key services to live and begin to scale out the platform.  The Foundation    Our charitable foundation has been busy compiling research, and has also been working with the charity commission here in the UK to help them understand blockchain and its application to the charitable sector.  The Foundation team will be at Rightscon (http://rightscon.org) in Tunis in just over a week. If you're going to be there and fancy a chat, please hit them up for a meeting.  They are also developing a series of training sessions for human rights organisations. If you would like to volunteer to help them deliver the pilot series, please reach out to Jennifer - the CEO of the DADI Foundation - directly on: jennifer@dadi.foundation  They will need half a day of your time. You can be based anywhere in the world, and you‚Äôll earn a warm sense of well-being knowing that you‚Äôre helping to make the world a better place üôè  You can read more about the foundation here: https://dadi.foundation  Ask us anything    The core team remains active across all of our community channels (links below for reference), and we operate on the basis of as full a level of transparency as possible. So if you‚Äôve got a question, please just ask. If you don‚Äôt get a reply right away, our community moderators will add it to their backlog for the next AMA session.  On which, you can read the transcript of our last AMA here: https://dadi.cloud/en/knowledge/network/ama-recap-may-03rd-2019/  Our next AMA will take place on Friday the 07th of June.

Topics ranged from minimum hardware specifications for running a DADI Node, to outreach and market positioning, through to our view on the SEC outlaying the criteria for classifying certain tokens as securities. As ever the questions delved in to a deep level of detail, and gave us a great opportunity to engage with our brilliant community.  Here's a transcript:  Question 1: How can DADI be cheaper than a data center?  DADI CDN pricing is c.60% less than like-for-like in AWS (a benchmark for DADI CDN prepared in hand with an existing customer). How, is pretty simple. We have next to no capex and the costs involved for individuals running nodes are comparatively very low.  Question 2: Would a lot of slow devices compromise the speed of the network? Is there AI in place to ensure this won‚Äôt be the case?  Faster machines will dequeue at the highest rate possible based on their network capacity. The network will also provision limits based on the perceived machine performance, to restrict low resource and low latency machines from taking on more requests then they can handle.  To begin with we‚Äôll be using some comprehensive machine learning metrics‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe expect to introduce A.I. as the network matures.  Question 3: How is it possible for a Raspberry Pi to be more efficient than big data center?  We are planning to run the network on more than one Raspberry Pi! üò¨  A single Pi 3 can handle around 40 concurrent requests in our decentralized stack. That‚Äôs a lot given it‚Äôs footprint and energy consumption. And of course, we‚Äôve only used the Pi to illustrate platform efficiencies: most of the Node-level power in the network will be far greater than this.  Obviously, a single Pi isn‚Äôt more powerful than a data centre (unless that DC only has a single Pi in it of course!), but a network of tens of thousands of connected devices in our architecture will provide far greater performance than traditional operations can achieve. It‚Äôs better for the environment too.  Companies that host in their own DCs today do so because until now there hasn‚Äôt really been an alternative.  Question 4: What are the revenue targets for first 12 months after mainnet launch?  We‚Äôre not in a position to be able to answer this today as it‚Äôs commercially sensitive information. Sorry!  Question 5: What has changed in strategy since the previous AMA? What PR & marketing actions have been completed?  Our strategy remains exactly as defined in our roadmap‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand pleasingly we remain on track. In terms of PR, we continue to work with our contracted partners on a mix of articles and interviews for mainstream and crypto media‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälinks will be shared as they go out.  Existing marketing has been maintained and will continue to be stepped up in coming months (we can‚Äôt go into too much detail as it is commercially sensitive, but you will keep seeing the results). We also ‚Äònewsjacked‚Äô Microsoft‚Äôs press last week regarding their submarine datacentre experiments: https://twitter.com/dadi/status/1004330375697625088  Question 6: Will you have a similar approach to Digital Ocean with one-click install environments? This is very appealing for devs that want to spend minimal time with devops‚Ä¶  DADI‚Äôs dapps can be thought of as SaaS from the point of view of deployment. We‚Äôre working to make the process as simple as possible, and this will continue as we get to the development of the marketplace, which will enable one-click deployment for a blog, an e-commence site, etc.  Question 7: What about privacy concerns with client data on random decentralized computers? Could nodes still theoretically have some ‚Äòbits‚Äô of the data monitored via side channels such as VM or the host‚Äôs operating system?  The deployed containers run in secure hardware enclaves which effectively ensures security when running trusted code on an untrusted machine.  Question 8: What are the implications of the INDX partnership for the DADI network?  They are working with our marketplace: an open container that is designed to run third party software. Specifically, we are working together to explore the potential for running their masternode setup within the DADI network. They are currently running in AWS.  And in terms of benefits, competitive price points for them, platform use and revenue for us.  Question 9: With staking for nodes set relatively high (in my opinion), how can you keep up with demand for resources? Is it likely the limits will go down quite fast if you see adoption?  Staking requirements will be reviewed regularly and adjusted to meet capacity requirements. In time this will become an automatic review, handled at Stargate level. Capacity is driven customer demand, which means more revenue, which means greater capacity can be added to the network.  Question 10: What‚Äôs the greatest challenge to meaningful adoption of DADI?  Exposure. When people (businesses, agencies, individual devs) use our tech, they love it. The greatest channel then is getting it in front of enough people. The strategy here is pretty complex involving marketing, PR, direct sales, partner programs, events and more besides‚Ä¶  Question 11: Do enterprise customers have any trust issues with a decentralized network?  This is all about the sales approach. To a traditional business we are selling on a service by service basis‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääour go to market in the first instance is with DADI CDN. This is a traditional sell with three main sharp edges:  Scale of network/performance Feature set Price  Talking about decentralization in this context is actually just a distraction. It‚Äôs part of the narrative, but decentralization in itself is not a benefit, rather it enables the benefits. And we sell the benefits.  So, any trust issues that may exist are mitigated by this approach. However, it‚Äôs worth noting that none of our existing customers have voiced concern. On the contrary, they are excited by the potential of the technology and are talking to us about how they can leverage it.  Question 12: What happens to ROI when the token value decreases?  The return on POS requirements in the Masternode system document were modelled with the token price at a specific point in time. Bearing in mind that pricing in the platform for services is benchmarked in USDT, when the token value drops (and we haven‚Äôt adjusted the POS requirement), the return on investment increases accordingly. Right now for example, that figure for a DADI Host looks like 15‚Äì20%+ ‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll provide a calculator for this soon.  Question 13: After reading the speech by SEC Director William Hinman outlaying the criteria for classifying certain tokens as securities, I find it fairly reasonable that DADI would be classified as a security. What is your take on this? If DADI were to be classified as one, will DADI seek to become a regulated security under US law, or will it withdraw from the US market?  1. Our Crowdsale was completed in January under the jurisdiction of the UK and the entity into which all funds were raised is a not-for-profit asset locked vehicle whose objects are to use funds to deliver on the DADI network plans. At the time of the Crowdsale the results of the Howey Test were made available on our Crowdsale site. At the time of the DADI Crowdsale the DADI testnet was operational with web services already in use by customers. There is currently no enterprise selling the DADI tokens: this was concluded as part of the Crowdsale.  2. The purpose of the DADI token is to buy and sell services through a decentralised network governed by a DAO. It is important to note that whilst the tokens were widely sold, to c8,000 purchasers, this represents a small proportion of the DADI community that we are actively looking to contribute to the DADI network (a key objective of the Crowdsale and the hence limit on tokens that could be purchased by an individual buyer). Furthermore, as stated within Crowdsale and other communications expected return for DADI token holders is from participation in the DADI network, whilst the listing of DADI on exchanges is an integral part of providing liquidity and ensuring the availability of tokens for buying and selling of services through the DADI network.  3. As detailed in our Tokenomics paper we want (and expect) holders of DADI to be active contributors to the network providing computational power. Our decentralised network is created by token holders providing a proof of stake and initially we will be rewarding contributors based on availability of capacity whist demand for the services develops. Our ambition is for all token holders to contribute to a decentralised network of tens of thousands of nodes. This decentralised network is a reality today and new products are being launched right now to generate a demand for the network with DADI.  To the very specific question raised for question 13 (paraphrased as ‚Äúgiven the latest communication from the SEC (William Hinman), will DADI seek to be a regulated security or withdraw from the US market‚Äù):  Given DADI‚Äôs purpose, structure and the current status of the DADI network and specifically in light of current guidance, we do not see DADI as requiring regulatory approval nor do we anticipate it becoming a security in the future.  As we roll out the DADI network, DADI and its advisers, will continue to review and cooperate with regulatory authorities as appropriate and necessary to ensure the acceptance and use of DADI tokens. We believe there is an important role for businesses to play in protecting the crypto community (incl. token purchasers) and addressing fraud‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis is key for innovative technologies to be adopted and deliver on the enormous value potential they hold.  We see the recent announcement by the SEC as positive and a progressive step in supporting the adoption of Blockchain and crypto currencies.  Question 14: What‚Äôs the best practice for making a DADI gateway redundant hardware-wise? Will DADI software have any clustering capabilities or do we have to get creative with VM redundancy etc?  You can build as many Gateways as you like as long as each is provisioned the minimum proof of stake. The network handles load-balancing and resilience, but for the individual Gateway, the higher stake represents a greater requirement for stability in the hardware.  We anticipate some downtime, and factor that in throughout the payout mechanics, so rather than aiming for 100% uptime, it‚Äôs best to aim for scheduled maintenance windows. We‚Äôll be looking into introducing a maintenance channel to reduce penalties for scheduled downtime. We‚Äôll be getting into more detail on how to handle downtime and maintenance soon.  Question 15: I have more than 10k DADI in my MEW, after mainnet will I get a percentage every month if I keep it there? If so, how much?  You‚Äôll need to stake your tokens through running a node in order to generate revenue.  Question 16: When the mainnet is operational will the team participate more in conferences/talks and will that participation be more widely communicated/shared (video) with the community?  We‚Äôre already pretty active in this space, but yes, efforts will be stepped up as we move forward, particularly as we take DADI CDN to market.  Question 17: How does DADI team see price compression affecting revenues and how do they maintain margins that are attractive to node holders and the team in the face of this possibility/eventuality?  The price of the Token will not affect the returns as services are pegged to $USDT and benchmarked with competitors. Price compression in terms of the Services such as CDN or other Web Services will impact revenues, but the return will be managed through the proof of stake.  Our model provides for a wide range of open source web services to be sold through the network, so there is the opportunity for margin protection based on a mix of services. Furthermore, a strong channel strategy will target customer partnerships where there is price resilience due to a long term commitment to DADI, based on fundamentals such as lower total cost of ownership, community participation and greener internet initiatives.  Question 18: What is the minimum server configuration to satisfy your requirements for Gateway? Recently, I came across the new Xeon-D, specifically 4 core D-2123IT. Despite having its base freq. set to 2.2Ghz, it does specify all core boost of 2.7Ghz. Is that sufficient for you (spec says: ‚Äú1x quad-core+ @ 2.5GHz+‚Äú)?  2.5GHZ+ is the advised base frequency for a single core. This is down to basic throughput requirements, where regardless of the number of cores, the threaded processes of the Gateway application need a consistently fast clock speed. If the over-clocked boost satisfies the peer review benchmarking requirements, then there won‚Äôt be an issue. We‚Äôll be providing some build examples and details on the profiler in due course.  We‚Äôre looking into running the Pi‚Äôs with full disk encryption ahead of the release of ARM/Broadcoms TrustZone. We‚Äôre closely following the development of secure enclaves on all of the major chipset manufacturers.  Question 19: It is very hard to scale and create the redundant infrastructure when you are distributed (not centralized). There are other issues such as security routing IP space and many other technology challenges. How are you going to address these issues?  The big point of difference between DADI and AWS in relation to redundancy is that an AWS sysadmin must provision redundancy on a per-application basis. That‚Äôs a huge amount of wasted resource.  Take the example of a website that targets a UK audience. The hosting stack is likely to be almost entirely redundant, with always-on hardware sitting idle. The DADI Network appropriates idle hardware, across every connected device, thus creating a single pool of devices and more accessible scalable redundancy at a much lower financial footprint.  The idle payout mechanism encourages cloud contributors to commit resource even when it isn‚Äôt required for active services, another of many considered measures to maximise on spare computational capacity.  As an aside, during the crowdsale we were heavily targeted, and because of the restrictions placed on us by AWS, we were unable to scale to a comfortable number of instances.  Question 20: As a partner will Wirehive provide any discounted masternode hosting services for DADI investors?  We‚Äôre in discussion with them about this and should have an update in the next week or so.  Question 21: Regarding the Agorai partnership‚Ä¶ can you give some further insights on how this will work?  DADI is developing a marketplace proposition‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa containerised service for approved partners that enables the running of third party software within the DADI network.  Agorai are working with us to deploy their technology in to the marketplace. They are also likely to use DADI API and Store for key components in their setup.  Question 22: What is the big advantage of DADI over traditional hosting providers?  We are heading into an era of massive data centre growth as demand is huge and more capacity is needed. There are real concerns over the green impact of data centres and renewable energy alone not the answer. DADI makes use of the massive unused capacity that exists in homes and businesses‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa far greener proposition that anything that has come before it.  DADI‚Äôs decentralised Cloud offers the opportunity for increased performance due to dispersion and locality of nodes. DADI‚Äôs dapps enable the development of products and services far faster than what‚Äôs achievable in traditional platforms:  ‚ÄúProducts built with DADI are delivered in days and weeks, not weeks and months.‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäMatt Hobbs, CTO Bauer  Finally, there‚Äôs an opportunity to re-distribute value to communities increasingly reliant on the Cloud for services and experiences. Yes, there is a significant value proposition based on reductions in price, but overall, it‚Äôs less about a price war and more about wealth re-distribution.  -  The next DADI AMA will be held on Friday 29th June @ 2pm UTC on Reddit, Telegram and Discord.",True

Adam K Dean: Stargates are intended for high-connectivity environments: think data centers and high bandwidth office environments, and are designed to be single, powerful machines rather than a cluster of smaller, less powerful machines.  Arthur Mingard: Worth noting that the Stargate application utilises all CPU cores, so in terms of machine performance it‚Äôs as efficient as possible.  Question 2: In the deep dive it says ‚Äòup to 20%‚Äô for gateway and ‚Äò5-10%‚Äô for hosts. Payout is based on platform usage, right? So does this mean that hosts earn 5% minimum? And if so does this mean gateways could earn less than 5% if there is very little usage?  Arthur Mingard: Gateways will never earn less than Hosts because there are multiple Hosts to a single Gateway. There could be anything up to 250 Hosts -possibly more - connected to a single Gateway, meaning that the Gateway will be taking a percentage from 250x more than a single Host.  Question 3: If the node fails, is there a way to recover the staked tokens?  Joseph Denne: Staked tokens are stored in the originating contract for the token, and the Nodes themselves are linked to an account within the network, accessed via dadi.cloud. This means that a failed host will never lead to a loss of tokens.  Question 4: How do I know my network is fast enough?  Arthur Mingard: The Host deployment process will run a number of availability benchmarking tests to give an accurate performance analysis prior to network on-boarding. This will indicate, amongst other things, the number of concurrent requests the network believes the Host can achieve, as well as an indication on payout, pegged to performance and demand, and with a view on suggested improvements.  Network performance will continue to be monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure that the DADI Network can adjust to fluctuations in network conditions.  Question 5: Will programs on a Host be able to escape and get access to the local network/Internet, or does all the Host node traffic only go through a Gateway?  Adam K Dean: Applications will run inside secure containers with restricted capabilities and with no access to an external network. Traffic between the Host service and the applications run over a private network. All of this will run inside a virtual machine running a hardened version of Alpine Linux (with Grsecurity).  The applications that are running inside these distributed containers will be DADI Webservices only, and will only allow inbound requests from the Host application. The Host application only makes requests that are queued in Gateway. All deployed builds of the DADI Webservices will be subject to security testing as part of the build process.  Question 6: Staking and increasing customers will certainly drive up the price of tokens. Does this mean that DADI will begin charging more, in turn, in USD to reflect the increasing cost of DADI tokens?  Joseph Denne: No. DADI‚Äôs services will be priced to remain competitive in market benchmarked in major currencies.  Question 7: Can DADI Host really run on a Raspberry Pi?  Adam K Dean: Yes. In fact the proof-of-concept network was hosted entirely on Model 2 and 3 RPi‚Äôs. If you take a look at the specs of the low to medium tier AWS, Azure and Google Cloud hardware, they‚Äôre very comparable, low powered machines.  Question 8: When did you have the idea for the DADI Foundation?  Joseph Denne: The Foundation was established in January this year, and has been in startup mode ever since. It has its own board and its own CEO. While it benefits from the network and was setup by the founders of DADI, it is independent, with its own articles and governance. You can find our more here: https://dadi.foundation/  Paul Regan: And I should add that I‚Äôm with the CEO as I type attending the Blockchain for Social Impact conference in Washington DC.  Question 9: Would websites for other crypto projects be a good target audience for early network adopters?  Joseph Denne: We are in discussion with a number of projects and obviously love talking to anyone interested in our platform. We‚Äôre also looking at how we can directly engage the broader crypto community through the offering of free usage tiers for example.  Paul Regan: If anyone reading is interested in talking about this, DM me.  Follow up: This is great news. Are you able to comment are these large size crypto projects? Midsize? By marketcap?  Joseph Denne: I can‚Äôt comment yet, but as soon as we can, we will.  Question 10: Will there be a network/bandwidth/storage capacity measurement and monitoring tool released along with DADI staking details? Or would we rely on third party tools for these?  Adam K Dean: We are working to build measurement and metrics in to our interfaces. In this first instance this will be via DADI CLI and also via dadi.cloud. In time we will be releasing graphical interfaces for MacOS, Windows and other platforms as well. Unfortunately, due to the security requirements, DADI services will be running inside of a secure virtual machine (a blackbox if you like), which will restrict you from performing your own measurements.  Question 11: What does ‚Äòpeak usage‚Äô mean?  Arthur Mingard: In respect to the network peak usage, this is the peak potential throughput based on the number of active hosted DADI webservice deployments and their respective request limits.  Question 12: Any plans to make use of embedded/dedicated GPU power in the future?  Joseph Denne: The use case for GPUs in DADI are tied predominately to our AI tools. The short answer then is yes, but this is some time out.  Question 13: Is there a mechanism to register early interest in running gateways in specific geographical locations?  Joseph Denne: There will be, yes. We need a strong geographic spread, and will be on-boarding to aid this. Sign up on site to express your interest: https://dadi.cloud/en/join (And don‚Äôt forget to us which country and city you‚Äôre in!)  Question 14: How do you monitor network performance. Do you have any local/global reference point for latency/packet drop?  Adam K Dean: Stargates monitor the performance of Gateways, and Gateways monitor the performance of Hosts. This way, node performance is always representative of its actual performance within the network. Metrics such as latency, uplink speed, etc, are continuously gathered by the parent node.  Question 15: Can I run DADI in a VPS?  Adam K Dean: While running within VPS will not give you the same performance as running on bare metal, it will still be possible, yes.  Question 16: When can I run a node?  Joseph Denne: Our mainnet goes live next month. The first contributed nodes will be going live in July.  Question 17: Payouts are monthly, so I wonder how they are calculated and paid out?  Arthur Mingard: The share of the payout is calculated as a percentage of the total throughput, but also includes proof of availability weighting. So if one Host‚Äôs hardware is more valuable to the network than another, or the Host has a higher uptime, the payout will be balanced in their favour.  Question 18: I would like to setup a Gateway. Can I put two servers in different places to have redundancy? Then if one is offline, the other one will work as a backup Gateway?  Adam K Dean: No. Two machines cannot operate as a single network node. The network itself guarantees redundancy of applications through the distribution of application containers to multiple gateways and hosts.  Question 19: In the tokenomics doc you say that the staking requirement will change depending on market demands. What do you mean by this?  Joseph Denne: As consumer demand for the technology increases, the size of the network will need to increase. To support growth in capacity the requirement of POS will be reduced. The token value is the second factor that will be monitored and factored in to POS requirements.  Question 20: You have a trusted by section on your site. Do you plan to have a partnered with section as well?  Joseph Denne: Yes we will. And regarding exchanges, see: https://dadi.cloud/en/token  Question 21: Is 20TB per month transfer fine for Gateway nodes?  Adam K Dean: While utilising 100% of a 250 Mbit/s uplink would require 75.6 TB of traffic ‚Äì  250 Mbit = 31.25 MB 31.25 60 = 1875 MB = 1.875 GB /minute 1.875 60 = 112.5 GB /hour 112.5 24 = 2700 GB = 2.7 TB /day 2.7 28 = 75.6 TB /month  In reality, it is unlikely that a Gateway node would utilise 100% of the available bandwidth 100% of the time. If the line was 25% utilised 100% of the time that would give you ~19 TB of traffic over a 28 day month. So, in summary, 20 TB should be fine, yes.  Question 22: Dadi has no direct competitor at the moment. What are the plans for when competition arises from new projects or if big established companies enter as well? Are there any barriers to entry? Do you foresee any of the big companies as possible competitors in the near future?  Joseph Denne: We‚Äôve been working on our tech for just shy of five years, and the web services themselves have been in production at scale for most of these. So yes, there are barriers to entry. I think it will difficult for existing clouds to move to a decentralized setup as they are publicly listed companies. Moving to a democratised footing would fundamentally undermine their businesses proposition in market. The barrier for them isn‚Äôt about technology so much as it‚Äôs about business models.  Offering support for the blockchain is something that most are already doing, but this is a pretty cynical move. If you think about it, we have a bunch of decentralized projects in market today that are majority running on centralized services, returning profits for those highly traditional businesses.  DADI is the only viable network offering an alternative to this.  Question 23: What are the criteria for selecting who can run a Stargate or a Gateway?  Arthur Mingard: Onboarding will start with a FCFS application. Initially, we‚Äôll be taking on Stargates and Gateways based on demand, and for Gateways this process will become automated. Hardware will undergo a number of availability benchmarking tests before whitelisting is complete.  Question 24: How does the Fiat on-ramp work?  Joseph Denne: Individuals and businesses can pay for DADI services using fiat if they want to.  This does not change the fact that our services are paid for in DADI. It simply means that there will be a small real-time exchange in place on dadi.cloud, removing the barrier to entry that a purely crypto based payments solution would pose. It‚Äôs no different in concept to a business heading to OKEx, buying tokens and then paying in $DADI, other than it is faster and that it provides the experience that the majority of our potential consumer base expects at this point in time.  Of course you will be able to buy our services in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Nano and many other currencies besides.  Question 25: Are the apps made on the DADI Network anti-filtering? For example, if i create chat messenger on DADI tech can the government filter this?  Joseph Denne: Decentralized apps are much harder for governments and other parties to filter, as they run from no set location. In this manner DADI works to help to support net neutrality.  It is important to state that we will be working with local jurisdictions to ensure that the platform remains compliant. Exactly what this looks like is a question for our legal team, and will shake out in the fullness of time. We can work with you to answer jurisdiction specific questions as they arise however. Reach out to an admin directly.  Question 26: When participating as a Host, Gateway or Stargate you estimate revenue in % of stake from the POS. Is this the only revenue or do you also get compensated depending on how well your node serves the network? An awesome host machine doing heavy lifting must earn more than a weaker machine?  Arthur Mingard: The participation payout mechanism takes network availability, connection latency and throughput limits, uptime and a number of other KPI‚Äôs so there is a considerably higher potential yield for a machine that appears to be technically greater in overall capacity. There are continuous tests, including peer review, to make sure each Host‚Äôs availability is consistent.  Question 27: Can you give us an in-depth update on your marketing efforts, are they now well and truly underway?  Joseph Denne: We‚Äôre spending pretty heavily on marketing and awareness. At the moment this is targeted largely outside of the crypto space, but this will start to shift in the coming weeks as we move to network on- boarding. I should note that network going live is the first real/legitimate marketing opportunity that we‚Äôve had after the Crowdsale, as to promote to these communities before now would have been simply to promote token value (which is not something that we can do).  We‚Äôve retained a blockchain marketing agency in recognition of the need to readdress this segment of our potential audience for example. We have a bunch of new videos in the works which will shake up our video content. Whether or not we maintain a channel is a good question that I‚Äôll give some time to next week.  Question 28: Is there any evidence DADI web services will be faster than others such as AWS or Azure?  Joseph Denne: Plenty! You can benchmark for yourself by downloading the source of CDN today and taking it for a spin or by checking out some of the sites already on our tech.  Question 29: Will you be able to switch Host hardware in the event of failure, or would you have to wait until the stake is returned after (up to) 30 days?  Adam K Dean: Yes, this will be fine. Hosts have a minimum requirement of 20% uptime. If a Host goes offline, let‚Äôs say due to a hardware failure, once you‚Äôve fixed it and turned it back on, it‚Äôll reconnect to the network and resume its duties.",True

Compared to for example Azure?  I wouldn‚Äôt say there are restrictions. we‚Äôll provide mechanisms that will make the deployment of a service to thousands of hosts across the network as simple as (or simpler than) what it‚Äôs like to deploy a site to Azure at the moment. the fact that the network is decentralised may seem daunting from a devops perspective, but we‚Äôll create the tooling to abstract all that complexity from the end user  Talking more broadly, we will be releasing our web services one by one - starting with DADI CDN.  This is a conscious decision to enable us to get to mainnet launch faster than would otherwise be possible, and to provide clarity of purpose as we go to market.  Question two: When was the first time you had the idea to create DADI (the fog-computing part)?  My business partner Chris and I first discussed the potential for doing something a little different in February 2016, which was when the concept for a decentralized stack was born. Before this our web services had always been intended ot be launched as a ""traditional"" cloud.  The key thinking in the first instance was about how we could get content as close to the end user as possible. We've run cloud setups for clients for years, and one common thread has been the difficulty in providing the best possible experience in terms of load time and responsiveness to audiences around the world. You can do a lot with an AWS, but their reach remains pretty limited. So the thought was ""what would happen if we could put a node in every local loop of every ISP in the world?""  Of course this would only possible through the cooperation of 10's of thousands of individuals, and how do you go about organising that sort of community? Trust has to be handled within the network. So the blockchain is linchpin of the idea. It enables trust between strangers, and brings proof of stake, trust metrics, payment audits, and proof of availability to the table as well - enabling a marketplace that can exist on it's own, without a single central controller.  Question three: Will DADI have any tools to help migrate corporate websites running on legacy IIS example IIS 6?  In short, yes. we‚Äôve been building tools that can help with this.  There are multiple aspects to a migration from an existing platform to the DADI suite of web services.  The main one is migrating the data into DADI API, which depends a lot on what type of data store the existing project uses. we built a series of tools to automate migration of data from various systems, so changes are we can provide you the tooling to ease the process.  Then there‚Äôs the template layer, which again depends on what the existing technology looks like. because DADI Web supports virtually any template engine, it may well already support your language of choice, meaning that changes required are minimal.  * if it doesn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs pretty simple to build support for it  Question four: In order to reach mainstream adoption, the token must be easily available for consumers. What will be your approach on this?  There are a couple of approaches to this.  1. Exchange strategy. It's important that tokens are easily accessible and part of this is ensuring enough coverage with exchanges. We were quick out of the gate on this front, but there's more to be done.  To this end we have a VP of exchange relations retained. However we cannot put timeframes or names to this side of things.  2. Ease of accessing services. It is essential for business customers to be able to purchase services in  ways that they are already used to. This means traditional payments in fiat (e.g. Visa/Mastercard).  We will be providing this via a relationship with a payments provider and a mico-exchange that is being built in to our website.  Question five: Will the nodes need to be on a fixed ip?  The Stargate and Gateway nodes will be, however the beauty of the method we employ for Host > Gateway interactions means that not only do the Hosts not need a fixed IP, but multiple Hosts can operate behind a single IP address.  Question six: Are there plans to organise meet-ups worldwide and get people to know about DADI?  Yes ‚Äì we are planning to attend many of the upcoming blockchain events (much as we did with Consensus last week in New York), both to have a visible presence and to arrange to meet partners and community members. For example we'll be at Unchain, DeveloperWeek New York, London Blockchain Summit, Blockchain Summit Singapore and Blockchain Live.  We are also working on making every other AMA a physical meet up at locations around the world.  Question seven: Why do we still need computing resources based on DLT, since there is already IPFS, bigchaindb etc? How will DADI compete with these?  It‚Äôs difficult to compare. IPFS is a protocol (which we‚Äôll actually use in some of our products), bigchaindb is a DB storage engine. DADI is a whole suite of web services or, if you like, a set of moduar pieces that allow you to assemble websites and applications as complex as you like.  Building the various pieces as well as the network they run on is quite a powerful combination, and that‚Äôs what sets us apart from any existing proposition.  To your point, your examples are part of the solution, not a solution in and of itself.  Question eight: What will node payouts be?  Node payouts will vary by node type, with Stargates earning more than Gateways, which in turn more than Hosts.  There's a balance to be struck between the on-boarding of nodes and the on-boarding of customers. Overreach on the one hand and payouts will be diminished. Overreach on the other and we may not be able to meet capacity requirements.  To manage this we will be controlling rollout in the first instance - opening the gates to node contributors slowly at first and speeding up over time. Customers will be on-boarded directly as well, with online signup not due until the end of Q4.  Specifics relating to expected return on POS will be announced in early June.  Question nine: What made you choose NSQ as apposed to RabbitNQ or some of the other well established messaging queues?  There were a whole host (excuse the pun) of performance factors that we evaluated during the benchmark phase, prior to selecting NSQ as the primary candidate for the messaging queue.  The network applications are built with Golang, and the fact that NSQ was one of the initial reasons it made the shortlist. RabbitNQ relies on the Erlang runtime, so another moving part outside of the core codebase language.  It also persists data when there are no connected hosts, which allows us to take the core monitoring services offline without losing valuable logs.  The topology is, by design, horizontally scalable and will cluster and scale much better than RabbitMQ. So far, it‚Äôs been exceptionally performant, and the results of our benchmarking are promising.  Question ten: Do we know if setting up nodes will require high-end rigs? Or will regular VPS machines suffice?  DADI Host runs extremely well on low-power machines, and is specifically designed to do so. We're targeting support for a wide array of devices, including mobile phones and laptops.  Gateway and Stargates require exponentially more power, as they handle far more in the network than individual Hosts.  So in answer to your question, yes, regular VPSs will be able to be used to contribute to the network.  Question eleven: Can you use DADI web services for more than just websites?  One of the key strengths of our web services is that they separate functionality in discrete, modular pieces, that communicate with each other in a technology-agnostic way. in practice, this means you can create a piece of content once and then serve it to any medium you can think of, be it a website, a native mobile application, a smart TV app, etc.  You can read more about the potential of this approach at https://medium.com/dadi/dadi-and-api-first-development-189b37bed704  It's worth noting that by using the network you are by definition decentralising your product. This + our integration with various chains makes DADI the perfect platform for dapps.  Question twelve: What made you choose to stop using Zookeeper in favour of Consul before the mainnet launch?  Zookeeper scales really well for a lot of rather large operations, including Rackspace, Yahoo and eBay. Adam K Dean, one of our network engineers wrote an article about the switch which he‚Äôll be publishing soon, possibly tomorrow.  To give you an abridged answer, it‚Äôs all about write speed. Zookeeper is fantastic for heavy reads across multiple nodes, but when it comes to write, it starts to exhibit some potentially blocking latency issues.  As we introduced a finite state machine into network applications, there was a sharp increase in the demand for writes. By switching to Consul, we have better control over device discovery, as well as a more granular set of states for the network apps.  Question thirteen: What will be the necessary steps for someone who wants to run a host? Do you think that my mother, who finds it very hard to use Facebook, will be able to set and run a host?  We're working to make this as simple as possible and to this end have been developing interfaces to lead contributors through the process. We'll share some of this work next week.  Question fourteen: What is the difference between DADI and HeroNode?  HeroNode is a development solution for DAapps, with a focus on file storage in support of the decentralised applications.  Like HeroNode, the DADI Network will handle storage, but a key point of difference is that the DADI network provides not only a network to run web services, but the web services themselves, which have been in production for ~4 years. We‚Äôve been building a suite of discrete web services that allow developers to build performant, flexible and scalable websites and applications and get them to production at incredible speeds. The modularity offered by our microservices stack lends itself perfectly to a decentralised setup.  In plain terms: whilst other companies are building generic decentralised networks in the same way that computer vendors create generic hardware, we create a decentralised network and a suite of microservices that work in symbiosis, in the same way that Apple is able to produce both their hardware and software together.  Question fifteen: Are you able to share names of a few strategic customers who plan to immediately transfer over to the new distributed cloud services once the mainnet is live? Are most current customers planning to migrate?  I can't name names yet, but I can tell you that we have commitments from the majority of our existing customers, as well as some new business lined up for the rest of the year.  Question sixteen: How will you prevent DDOS attacks?  Network scale is a big part of the answer here. But we're also working with partners to build scrubbing centers into the backbone of the network, which will go a long way to protecting us from DDOS attacks.  Question seventeen: What are some new use cases your team is exploring for the near future?  Much more detail to come on this when our new website launches, but in the meantime highlights include content management and publishing platforms, content manipulation and distribution (CDN), developing mobile and tablet apps, paid subscription services, customer relationship management (CRM), content personalisation and machine learning. Oh and cheaper cloud services! To name a few...   Question eighteen: What‚Äôs new in CDN 3.0 and what makes it network-ready?  CDN is the first product to lauch on the DADI network, so for the 3.0 release we focused our efforts on making sure it‚Äôs optimised for a decentralised setup. There‚Äôs a lot happening in the new version, but the main points are  1) support for multiple domains with individual config/workspace directories, which allows a single instance to serve multiple projects and therefore optimising computational resources of nodes  2) changes to the authentication layer to support the decentralisation of issuing bearer tokens  we also throw in some significant performance improvements, using feedback from the extensive tests we‚Äôve been doing with our testnet. we‚Äôre releasing an article alongside the product release next week with full details.  Question nineteen:  What are your plans for marketing?  We have traffic driving campaigns for all major channels lined up (and gearing up), along with a PR campaign (we appointed a global PR firm two weeks ago) and an events schedule. We'll publish an update to the marketing plan shared during the Crowdsale in the next few weeks for reference.  Question twenty: Will anyone be able to block the IP addresses of the DADI network?  At any given time there will be a lot of Gateways in the network. The IP addresses would prove very difficult to track, as we expect to see Gateway nodes joining and leaving the network regularly.  It is true that governments have the power to block at DNS level, which would affect individually hosted sites, but the nature of the network makes it incredibly difficult to target the network infrastructure.  Question 21: What do you feel is going to be the biggest challenge for DADI going forward?  We're very happy with the technology, and have overcome all of the major hurdles that a step change like this represents. As such our largest hurdle is awareness: how do we drive network use?  Happily we have a bunch of strong answers to this, most of which will be being put into effect between now and the end of the year.  Question 22: When can we contribute to the network?  We'll be publishing a schedule for this towards the end of May. So watch this space!  Question 23: How is mainnet development going? Is the release date finalised?  Very well. We'll be live in Beta at the end of June.  Question 24: How big is the testnet?  We have around 20 nodes in the testnet at the moment, spread around the world, and have tested with hundreds of thousands of virtual nodes.  Question 25: Do you have plans to implement a real-time, low ping (as hosts are all around the world)? Let's say for games?  The focus on geographic matching of webservice consumers to service hosts mean that whilst traditional cloud hosting offers a fairly high number of hops, albeit on a fast line, the DADI network pairs for the shortest hop distance.  In short, when you access a website, it could be hosted by your neighbour.  Question 26: You are giving a payout per hosts. Depending on the app deployed on the host, cpu & memory & bandwidth requirements per hosts will vary a lot. Are we able to set a host rich of bandwidth and low on cpu? Do you allow customisations like that and do you have plans to reward more for more intensive hosts?  The network is aware of the capacity available and the capacity committed at node level. This information is used to inform node selection per-request, as well as to structure payouts on the basis on contribution.  Question 27: Regarding the new website... what is your approach to getting listed as high as possible in relevant Google rankings?  There's a lot of smoke and mirrors out there in relation to SEO.  Our approach is fairly simple: produce strong, well worded content about relevant topics and back it up with well structured HTML. In addition to this, where we are not yet ranking, we will employ adwords to ensure exposure at the top of search results.  Question 28: Can I replace my Dropbox subscription with DADI soon?  DADI Store will move to Beta in the next month or so, and will be released to the network in the next few quarters. So yes.  Question 29: Is the new website going to be hosted on the DADI network?  Yes. Yes it is.",True

Why? Traditional product design is channel and device centric. But users inhabit a multi-channel, multi-device world.    Channel and/or device centric product design results in duplicated effort and wasted engineering work. API-first development is focused on removing this technical debt through the separation of the data backend and the data consuming frontend.  API-first development is the idea that whenever you are developing a piece of shared functionality for your organization it should be exposed as a RESTful HTTP(S) API to all of your other developers. Rather than creating a library or module that needs to be added to all code bases requiring the functionality, developers can consume all the necessary functionality through the API. Having developers consume all functionality through an API enforces separation of concerns and hides internal complexity.  COPE stands for Create Once, Publish Everywhere. It is about reducing editorial overhead by freeing content for use in multiple different contexts. Simply put, COPE separates data from design, making your content reusable and future-proof for new devices or platforms.  Taking an API-first development approach enables COPE and brings several additional benefits:  *Separation of concerns *Scalability *Reduction of language barriers *Developer liberation and specialization *Openness and future consumer availability *Modularity  https://medium.com/dadi/dadi-and-api-first-development-189b37bed704",True

Users will be asked to confirm the ERC-20 compatible wallet that they would like to use for their tokens. This must be a wallet that the user controls the private key for, not an exchange wallet! Once submitted, this information cannot be changed. Failure to provide a valid wallet address will result in loss of tokens. (We have a list of recommended wallets that you can use here.)  As an extra layer of security, a confirmation code will be sent to the email address registered to the user account. This code must be entered in the box provided on the website to confirm the withdrawal request. Once that has been done, we will begin the token distribution.  The distribution of purchased tokens will be processed within 24 hours of request confirmation. Referral tokens will be processed in a separate transaction which may take up to five days.  https://medium.com/@daditech/token-distribution-c87c9fed76f0",True

Please allow me to explain further.  The Presale begins 22.01.18 12:00 UTC.

Please see our response below.  > 1. Do they really have the tech chops to challenge the likes of Amazon & Microsoft?  Do we have the resources to replicate like for like what Amazon, Microsoft, Google, are offering today? No, of course we don‚Äôt. They have invested many millions of dollars and many years into their centralized infrastructure and I think very few - if any - organizations would have the resources to challenge this in a traditional setting.  Do we have the resources, skills and vision to disrupt the traditional market with a revolutionary new architecture ‚Äì one that scales with existing hardware and doesn‚Äôt require incredible capital expenditure? We definitely believe so.  What we‚Äôre building is not intended to be a ‚Äúmeaty platform‚Äù, quite the opposite. We‚Äôre focusing on functional simplicity that scales. It‚Äôs a common myth that the better a system is, the more complex it must be. The more complex a system, the more problems you will have. The more complex a system is, the harder it will be to use and to maintain and to extend.  We have 12 engineers on our team (and we‚Äôre hiring more!). Between us we‚Äôve worked for many big companies, across a diverse range of projects. Our combined experience and skillset bridges the majority of the required disciplines a project like this demands.  It‚Äôs also worth noting that we‚Äôre not pitching to VCs and we‚Äôre not planning an exit. We‚Äôre engaging with our community and embarking on this project together with them. Some of the team have worked together before, it‚Äôs true, and in fact all three of the founders have worked together before (and successfully exited their previous businesses). This is something we‚Äôre proud of: we have a great team and this is nothing to be shy about.  > 2. How come the numbers don‚Äôt add up?  In our business overview we set out that our directly addressable market ‚Äì PaaS and SaaS ‚Äì should exceed $100bn by 2020, and we provided a couple of scenarios to illustrate the potential for Miners through participation in the network. These are not financial projections or targets.  On the question of growth, it‚Äôs worth noting that for the past four years we have been focused on research & development, not on growing the business.  > 3. Why have they underestimated scaling?  This isn‚Äôt really right. If you assume that the only devices that will connect to and power the network are mobile, then yes, higher data rates are critical, but this is not the case. The network will be comprised of a diverse range of devices with a diverse range of connections. The concept of edge computing is to reduce the geographical as well as the topological distance between devices. The concept of Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical devices and embedded tech that connect and exchange data. These are two different concepts, though of course having better mobile networks will be a huge positive for everyone.  > 4. Why aren‚Äôt they showing us their crown jewels?  Simply because pricing for the network has not been locked in yet. We have examples from real-world use of the web services, which have been supplied. Pricing with existing businesses is Enterprise and custom per engagement. Pricing for the network will be released as we get nearer to launch.  > 5. Where‚Äôs the true crypto devotion?  We don‚Äôt really see how a wallet be beneficial to us at this stage. Our plans on this front focus on the provision of a bundled interface for purchasing web services. A wallet on its own contributes nothing to the ecosystem. Rather we‚Äôve spent our time focused on the network itself, which is currently live as a testnet, and in production testing with a key customer.  > 6. Why ask for $29 million when $1 million will apparently do?  1m is enough for us to get the network live _at some point_. As covered elsewhere, to meet the breadth of ambition, depth of service, and pace of delivery in our roadmap (https://dadi.cloud/en/roadmap), we need to raise significantly more than that. The network is a big idea, and it needs the resources to match.  We‚Äôre engaging with our community and embarking on this project together with them. We believe in a decentralized and democratic internet owned & controlled by everyone, not just a select few. This is why we‚Äôre running the Crowdsale rather than pursuing traditional VC funding.  > 7. 300 years of combined networking and they can only find ONE advisor?  We obviously have the experience on the team to deliver a working testnet and the core set of web services for the platform (as both of these have been delivered ). Looking to the future, of course we don't have all of the answers in house ‚Äì we will be hiring to increase capacity and to fill the gaps. We also have some good advisors around us (more on that soon), and are working with the industry to roll out a backbone to ensure network stability from the get go.  (As a side note, the advisor we have announced is not one of our suppliers, and he doesn‚Äôt have a master node.)",True

We also build web service products as well which allow rapid development of websites, web apps, and more. If you take a look at our GitHub you'll see we've been active for over four years.   I checked the github/whitepapers. For someone claiming to be decentralized AWS, there is really no meat in the repos. Is it just JS lipstick / glue codes ? Seems to me like you just combine many off the shelf product (Zookeeper, docker, miekg-dns, mongo) and selling them. No mention of replication, partitioning, fault tolerance, monitoring, consensus, conflict resolution, CAP tradeoff. It makes sense for a web agency, it doesn't make sense for 'decentralized AWS in blockchain'  You've checked the GitHub which currently has our web service products open sourced. You've read our whitepaper, which should give you a good overview of what we're trying to build and the general way in which we're going to go about it, but remember, the project is in active development. It isn't static. We're looking into all aspects of the network design, and we will from time to time write articles on some of the technical aspects and challenges faced and our solutions. I'm sorry if the whitepaper doesn't have enough meat on it for you, I understand, I often want to just read a tonne of technical documentation. Feed my bytecode, man! Alas, it's a whitepaper, a supposedly concise document. Also, it's worth noting that we're not a ""web agency"". For example, my background is in distributed computing.   There is no need for decentralize in your design. CMS is inherently centralized. DADI design is also centralized (centralized docker, centralized configuration / master nodes). Technically, it's bad engineering choice to make it decentralized. You make all business / political reasons for decentralizing (lower cost, censhorship), but none technically. Do you really think Virgin wants their content hosted on some random Mozambique nodes with volatile latency and flapping links?  I'm sure that if Virgin had a request from a potential customer in Mozambique then that is exactly where they'd want their content hosted.  Speak to an Australian to learn more.  TLDR: edge computing is only one of many reasons for dispersed application distribution.   The technical whitepaper is being deliberately obtuse  And yet it lacks meat. Isn't that a contradiction?   See original Satoshi paper, Colin (raiblock), Amazon's Dynamo papers. Clean, concise, elegant. By comparison yours generously throwing jargons, skipping details so common users cannot understand, while at the same time, technical users cannot refute.  I think the whitepaper has a fair balance between technical information and non-technical information. Unfortunately, not everyone has the same experience. But as I said, we'll be publishing articles on technical concepts through the development of the project which should hopefully feed your hunger, as it would mine. TLDR: For a shorter summary, take a look at our site.   Questionable coin-to-revenue relationship  Pay coin per DNS request? really? you know DNS is UDP right? Have you done any market research to really clarify the incentives?  Putting aside the fact that this isn't even part of our whitepaper, hasn't ever been stated, and is complete fiction, doesn't route53 charge per query? TLDR: we don't do this.  I hope this satisfies your need for a response.",True

Since it's been apparent that lots of companies are now heading into the blockchain space all of a sudden seeking a quick buck for themselves (founders) and their partners. It's time for us all to be even more skeptical and critical of the numerous token sales.",True

During our time at Airlock we also developed Symphony CMS, which had an active community of c.20k contributors.  We setup DADI some time after the sale of Airlock, in 2013. DADI has been a technology company since day #1, and we've been consistently iterating ever since. Our original web service was data focused and we've built out from there. There are currently some 200 brands using the platform.  This represents the natural evolution of that success.  The products that we have in production today are our core web services. These are running in a containerized setup within traditonal cloud platforms in the main, but it's important to note that we also have a working prototype for the distributed network live, which is powering the content layer for one of our current customers.  I get where you're coming from with the skeptical line of questioning, and we take the same view about 99% of the crowdfunding events out there. But that's not what we‚Äôre about.  We're being completely transparent about what the funds we are raising will be used for. Furthermore the decision to make our technology available through the decentralized web makes perfect sense: currently web services are provided by a handful of massive tech companies who control everything ‚Äì the market, data, technology availability etc. And their platforms are hugely complicated and very difficult to scale.  We're creating an open model that bypasses these companies and puts power back into the hands of the end users, and surely that can only be a good thing.",True

It's not entirely like SiaCoin, though there are some similarities. SiaCoin is more of a decentralized S3, focusing on secure distributed storage. What we're building is a decentralized cloud computing network, tailored specifically to web services. We have a number of web services already built and being used in production on some pretty big sites, see https://dadi.cloud/en/#services for more information on them.  I think there are a number of reasons you should invest in our project, but it really depends on what the project means to you. As an engineer, I love the idea of turning our global device pool from it's current dormant state into a living and breathing network powering all the services around us. I think it's mad that we have so many devices all over the world, doing next to nothing, and yet still we stockpile servers in datacentres and use them to host our services.  As an investor though, that might not be why you want to invest, instead you might be looking to see if a project is a legitimate organisation or company (check ‚Äì https://dadi.cloud/en/due-diligence), has a decent whitepaper that properly explains the technology behind the idea (check ‚Äì http://dadi.link/iW), has an established team with relevant experience (check ‚Äì https://dadi.cloud/en/team), has a realistic roadmap (check ‚Äì https://dadi.cloud/en/roadmap), and perhaps even a track record of successful product delivery (check ‚Äì https://dadi.tech/en).
