Atomic swaps, or atomic cross-chain trading, is the exchange of one cryptocurrency for another cryptocurrency, without the need to trust a third-party.  A relatively new technology, atomic cross-chain trading aims to revolutionize the way in which users transact with each other. For example, let‚Äôs say Alice owns 1 Qtum but would like 1 Guppy instead. She‚Äôll have to make an exchange, right? Well, with atomic swap, if Bob owned 1 Guppy but wanted 1 Qtum instead, he and Alice would be able to simply make a trade!  And in order to create trust and prevent all sorts of problems like one-way trades (Alice accepting Bob‚Äôs 1 Guppy but then failing to send over her 1 Qtum), atomic swap utilizes what is known as hash time-locked contracts (HTLCs)‚Ää‚Äî‚Äägenius really.  What‚Äôs this useful for? Over the last few years we‚Äôve seen a large number of decentralized exchanges (DEX). The main purpose of these exchanges was to exclude the third party from the trading (p2p trading without a broker), a purpose that wasn‚Äôt really achieved mainly because of the inability to quickly execute trades outside of the blockchain it was built upon.  The recent blockchain hype has led to a surge in currency prices. The overall market for cryptographic currencies this week surpassed $700 billion. Such an increase in market cap is always accompanied by the high volatility of the currencies, and such volatility requires traders to be able to execute cross-chain transactions immediately, which is not fully possible on DEX today.Those limitations have resulted in very poor adoption and limited trading volume on DEX platforms.  Atomic swaps are the future P2P exchanges field The main advantage of the atomic swap in the P2P exchanges field is that from now on, traders in DEX can trade coins from other chains and actually ‚Äúlock‚Äù the price of a currency traded on another network immediately, thereby being less exposed to the risk of coin volatility, making them a real P2P exchange. By providing P2P exchanges to users and traders, liquidity is guaranteed and never relies upon a central exchange . We remove the middleman and begin exchanging P2P, decentralized, just as it should be with cryptocurrencies.  The last few months have been very exciting for atomic swap and its impact on the blockchain community. Companies like Komodo, Litecoin, Vertcoin and Decred have all successfully implemented atomic swaps, and many of us can say that Charlie Lee‚Äôs announcement of the Litecoin/Bitcoin atomic swap is one of the most important developments in the cryptocurrency world.  Matchpool has developed the implementation of GenericSwap, which will be the first contract to offer an exchange of Qtum, Ethereum and ERC20-based tokens across Ethereum and Qtum chains. This is a a groundbreaking step on the way to P2P exchange and this step may lead to another huge win if we can influence other companies to make an effort and develop open source solutions for the community.  Now for some Technicalities. Atomic swaps involve each party paying into a contract transaction, one contract for each blockchain. The contracts contain an output that is spendable by either party, but the rules required for redemption are different for each party involved.  Hash time-locked contracts (HTLC) Hash time-locked contracts (HTLC) ensure that the atomic swap process is completely trustworthy by ensuring both parties fulfill the requirements of the trade.  HTLCs require the recipient to acknowledge receiving the payment ahead of a predefined deadline by generating cryptographic proof of payment. By failing to do so, the recipient risks losing the right to claim the payment and the sender is entitled to receive back the funds.  To implement a HTLC on a transaction to occur between two different blockchains, it is necessary for both blockchains to share the same cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-256.  Now, let‚Äôs go back to Alice and Bob Alice owns 1 Qtum and she just heard about Matchpool and Guppy so she wants to sell her 1 Qtum in exchange for 1 Guppy. We also have Bob who owns 1 Guppy and wants 1 Qtum instead.  https://blog.matchpool.com/matchpool-adds-atomic-swap-to-its-arsenal-6b5e06128b2c",False

New Chat & iOS app in development  Matchpool launches version 2.2 of the alpha on the Ethereum mainnet, with new and improved ‚ÄòDiscussion‚Äô renamed as ‚ÄòChat‚Äô + Matchpool iOS app in development, first look at the new design.  What you need to know about $GUP and how it can be used inside the Matchpool app: Up until now, Matchpool has been running on the Ropsten network, one of Ethereum‚Äôs testnets. All transactions of ‚ÄòXGUP‚Äô have been used to test how the $GUP utility tokens would be transacted before using real $GUP inside our app and moving on to the Ethereum main-network.  Starting today, ‚ÄòXGUP‚Äô is being replaced with $GUP on the mainnet.  What can I do with $GUP? Using MetaMask, you can load up your $GUP wallet and use $GUP to create or join a community on Matchpool. Set an entrance fee in $GUP for your own pool, or choose to pay $GUP to enter someone else‚Äôs pool.  PPM (Pay-per-match) and other use cases for the token will be implemented in the upcoming releases of our app. The pool owner, of course, can still completely keep his pool free of charge if he decides to.  You will need some ETH to transact Guppies, as most of you already know. A handy tool that allows you to calculate transaction costs and estimate an optimal gas price for your transaction is ETH Gas Station.  https://blog.matchpool.com/matchpool-is-now-on-the-mainnet-new-chat-ios-app-in-development-37eeb1cc7478",False

Comparing it to ICOs like GNO that got massive exposure and pumped the valuation to ridiculous levels, Matchpool went unnoticed. It might be due to a poor communication strategy from the Matchpool team.  Who has read the whole Matchpool whitepaper ? Well I did and I find it absolutely brilliant and with extraordinary potential! If executed well, Matchpool could take a meaningful marketshare of the dating industry but also of the social media industry.  This is a typical exemple of a very big asymmetric payoff. An asymmetric payoff (also called an asymmetric return) is the set of possible results of an investment strategy where the upside potential is greater than the downside risk. If Matchpool team fails to deliver, the value will go to 0. One can evaluate the probability of that. If Matchpool succeeds to deliver, the vision is so brilliant and the concept has such gigantic potential. The online dating industry alone is worth 2.5 billion USD in the USA alone, but matchpool will greatly extend the scope of application of the platform beyond dating with its very smart, flexible and incentivised pool concept that is unique on the online social media space. If Matchpool would take even a few percents of the online dating scene worldwide (not even talking about the social media space), the valuation of its marketcap would certainly reach 100 million USD very quickly, but speculation on the cryptographic token and growth in users would probably push that valuation way higher. Of course in case of great success and everyone starting to use the service for social matching purposes, then we are looking into a marketcap in the billions.  Matchpool does not deliver = you lose 100% Matchpool delivers and succeeds moderately = you make say 1000% (10x) Matchpool delivers and succeeds very significantly = you make say 10.000%  Exemple of probabilities estimation : Failure : 50% x 0 Moderate success : 40% x 1000 Major success : 10% 10000 Expected return : 1400% or x14 times the investment.  I think giving a 50% chance of failure to the team is very pessimistic and prudent. I hope the odds are lower.  So even if the probability of complete failure from the team would be higher than 50%, I would still consider this investment as being very attractive for my medium and long term investment profile. I am investing more and will hold GUP solidly until we reach 100K satoshis. At that point I will sell a portion of my GUPs.  Good luck to the team and all investors. Read the whitepaper and bring in constructive criticism.",False

Lets keep those wheels rolling, after an amazing start we want everybody in crypto atmosphere and outside of it to be familiar with Matchpool. If we want to get some serious attention that will raise the project market cap to the moon we will need a massive increase of trading volume. So instead of asking us every five minuted when are we going to join Poloniex, lets combine our forces together and create the needed pressure for this to happen. This could be achieved easily within two steps:              1. Ask Poloniex to list GUP using its Coin Request form here: https://www.poloniex.com/coinRequest              2. Keep asking about GUP listing in Poloniex exchange trollbox  Don't be apathetic and inactive saying to yourself ""Others will do it"", unless we all do this together it could easily be long before GUP will be listed there so do it now!",False

Basically a group dedicated for referring users to a pool to get paid. There could be a referral link, linking to the pool, which would be shortened to hand out over social media and your friends. There could be a maximum amount of users within one pool, which would be profitable for all those referring users and those recently joining. This would work by: Once the maximum of positions within a pool have been filled, the first say 100 of people who first referred the group out of the maximum of 750, get upgraded to a new pool with better features and payouts, and this then repeats, when the group has been filled to 750. The rotation and upgrade process would benefit the 750th member since he wouldn't get paid without a changeover, nor would it be profitable for anyone joining from like 740+ onward.

If you're still confused regarding the accusations on this project, with all the information provided over the course of whats happened, then I don't think investing is for you.  To the matchpool community:  Simply do not feed the trolls (which means do not quote their big red words) simply report their post and move on. We're in 2017 now, not 2013.",False

The alpha release of Matchpool is live at app.matchpool.com! Experience the alpha now and participate in our 'Uppy your Guppy' competition!      Introducing Matchpool   Matchpool is the first community and incentive driven social network built on Ethereum. Guppy tokens (GUP) are the currency used inside the platform and can be exchanged by Matchpool members. With GUP, members can be paid for matchmaking people together, can gain access or subscribe to pay-walled groups (pools), and can purchase content created by other users on the platform.  The Matchpool platform is built over user generated Pools of individuals. These Pools can be visualised as a cross between Slack channels and Meetup groups, invite-only groups owned and run by devoted users who can also act as matchmakers. Upon joining the platform, each user will be asked to provide a number of describing factors. This data is encrypted, and will be used for the user profile and for the purpose of offering the user with preferable custom pools.  By using our Matchlock feature, which keeps a 50:50 ratio between X and Y, every Pool in the platform remains attractive. If a certain number of X users enters the pool, then the matchlock will stop more X from entering until the same number of Y‚Äôs arrive. These Matchlock rules can also be parametrized to any use case where any arbitrary market polarity is required. Also there is no restriction for the X and Y side of the matchlock to be opposites in order to serve any community whatsoever. It is up to the Pool's founder to configure the matchlock parameters according to the kind of community they wish to create.    Matchpool App (Alpha release)    Matchpool will bring you a front-end interface, which will allow users to search for favorable pools in different areas, matched with different interests. Users can search various factors to see if something fits. In the on-boarding process, they will also be shown a list of pools in their area, which fits their particular demographics and interests.     The system of Matchpool & the Guppies      Matchpool users will divide into two categories‚Äì Joiners & Hosts. Joiners who wishes to enter a pool of their choice, will have to pay the pool's requisite entry fee, which will be defined at the creation of that Pool by the Pool's Host. In addition to this one-time registration fee, a monthly membership fee will be paid to the Pool. All payments will be held in an Ether based smart contract and will be processed using Matchpool's network own token Guppies (GUP). While in the Pool, nature will take its course and all members would be able to interact publicly on private channels in a way resembling Slack's interface. On the other side, users can also play the role of Hosts and Matchmakers. The host will be the one who opens a custom Pool and gets dividends from its revenues. Matchmakers or Helpers as they are defined in the system can propose matches between two other joiners who they believe would be good partners. Those two joiners are then notified and in case they both accept, the event is added to their public notebook, and the Matchmaker get rewarded. Both the Host of the pool and its matchmakers are entitled for shares of the Pools subscription and monthly fees, paid with Guppy (GUP).
