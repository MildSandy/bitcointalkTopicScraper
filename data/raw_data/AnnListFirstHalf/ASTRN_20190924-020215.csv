To supercharge the supply of clean energy demands of communities and businesses around the world, our Blockchain Powered Platform, will enable ASSETRON Token holders the opportunity to co-invest into green energy projects and receive revenue based on the proportion of the investment.  Essentially the key mission is to bridge the gap between energy consumers who will greatly benefit from a renewable energy setup, but can not afford to do so upfront, and socially conscious investors, who understand the benefits of investing into renewable energy, but don’t have an easy avenue to do so.  Assetron Energy will not only utilise the funds gained from the Token Sale to develop their platform, but also in what is believed to be a first in the cryptocurrency history, use part of the funds to commission a 1MW Solar Plant in Australia, setting a new precedent for the potential of cryptocurrency. This will be the life spark of Assetron Energy — the consistent income the plant will generate will ensure that we continue to have funding for as long as 25–30 years, giving the longevity to the company long past the end of the ICO.[/center]   SOFT CAP REACHED - OVER 200,000 USD Raised  Be part of a ICO that will make renewable energy affordable to everyone  Buy ASTRN Tokens now! https://assetron.energy   Latest Press Release: https://medium.com/assetron/press-release-16-10-2017-5218e2f4b9d0  Roadmap  WE ARE In Week 2 - $0.034 USD (Final week Token price will be set at $0.04)   WHAT ARE ASSETRON(ASTRN) TOKENS ASSETRON (ASTRN) Tokens will be the primary currency used on the Assetron Energy Investments Platform, which will be utilised by users to co-invest into various renewable energy projects and receive revenue from those projects in ASTRN Tokens.
