Anyway, these little countries are bringing out some heavy hitters, and one of the latest and greatest is the Debitum Network.  A recent study by the World Economic Forum rated this trio as three of the seven leading innovators in the field, joining such major nations as Sweden and the United Kingdom itself. Though there are merely around six million people in the region, it‚Äôs already become known for fintech luminaries like Bondora, Mintos, and TransferGo.  Now, with blockchain an increasingly large part of the proceedings in fintech, the three are turning their attention to development therein. With the current operations used in the Debitum Network, it actually becomes possible to assess a loan application immediately. That means, for those qualified, funds can be disbursed much more rapidly and those who qualify can put them to work promptly.  Martin Liberts, co-founder of the Debitum Network, noted ‚ÄúThe finance world has acknowledged that blockchain technology is here to stay, and this is evident with major European banks such as BBVA, Credit Suisse, and SEB using it. As way of improving transparency amongst alternative finance providers, transparency-boosting KYC/AML procedures have been put in-place to maintain the popularity of alternative finance amongst SMEs. With banks gradually turning to decentralized technologies, it is important for alternative finance providers to adopt blockchain in order remain relevant to SME owners.‚Äù  It just goes to prove, in the end, that a good idea really can come from anywhere. While most likely didn‚Äôt expect the Baltics to produce top-notch fintech, they did, and on several occasions. So many occasions, in fact, that they‚Äôre now one of the leading sources of innovation in Europe. The Debitum Network is just the latest such effort, and it‚Äôs going to deliver plenty of impact on its own.  As the Debitum Network improves loan processing and contributes to the growth of fintech and mobile payments, it‚Äôs a safe bet that the Baltics are already working to produce more advances. It will be interesting to see what they come up with to top Debitum.",False

Firstly, thank you all for active participation. We saw several good discussions and a few not so good, yes - I‚Äôm talking about the few flamers out - we are watching you   Honestly, we do understand your frustrations since the price of DEB token is yet to start climbing and the updates from us have been few. So here is what you might have missed last week.            BlockShow Europe, Berlin.  Martins, Gabriele, Mantas (our new CMO) has participated in the conference and brought several good ideas home. There is a company that is tokenizing gold, essentially enabling physical gold to be used on the blockchain. We are brainstorming around this to see if we could use actual physical gold for investments on Debitum Network. Another ICO project with which we started partnership negotiations, if successful, should enable a feature on Debitum Network to invest not only in fiat but crypto, while the borrower still receives fiat. We will keep you posted. We got to meet Sonja and Milos from CoinTelegraph Serbia team; these guys are much fun :beers: After the conference, we already hosted Christian from FinTechNews in Vilnius, Lithuania on the next day. So our industry connections are growing!  We also received KTU trust score, well half of it. It‚Äôs the part that analyses and provides the initial score for new registrations on Debitum Network. It looks good, we thought of a few minor tweaks and questions and submitted for revision.   Our CFO, Petras,  has done a great job securing us a business runway in a manageable way for the next 3-4 years. We asked him to share his strategies with everyone. This also gave us ideas how to partner up with StartUps and ICOs and how to make the platform highly useful for their financial asset management activities. We hope to get these features available in Abra 1.0 when we launch in September.  On the development side, we deployed a security infrastructure layer last week (automatic cluster deployments on AWS infrastructure with monitoring tools), and this week developers will stress test it. Moreover, the platform itself has received a facelift with several new design screens and functionality for industries. We'll show later this week.",False

What did you do with those tokens? Did u burn them? U never mentioned anything about. You for sure did not reach your had cap all of a sudden one night earlier before stopping the sale.

Global Credit Gap   Small businesses around the world are forced to work in difficult environments, and severely lack access to credit. The current credit gap is estimated to be an astonishing $2 trillion. According to World Bank's data, approximately 70% of all Micro and Small to Medium sized businesses in emerging markets lack access to credit.   Essentially, the current system's broken. It‚Äôs controlled by the Central Banks, highly constrained and strictly over-regulated. Through regulation, local financial institutions are actually instructed to block SME‚Äôs from receiving funds from International or individual investors, making it tough to realize their true business potential.   The cost of trust provision between lenders and borrowers is also too high. Businesses struggle for reasonably accessible financing due to the lack of effective international marketplaces, and transparent pledge security registries.   Debitum Network is designed to unite borrowers and those who help them apply: investors (lenders), risk assessors, document validators, insurers, etc. Companies or individual professionals who work in the alternative finance space can connect-in to the network for free and immediately begin facilitating cross-border deals.  Debitum Network is built as a hybrid platform   All actions are processed through the Ethereum Blockchain, making Debitum Network a secure and incorruptible infrastructure. It‚Äôs made up of an Ethereum-based family of smart contracts, facilitated by one internal means of payment. Transactions run through Fiat currencies, ensuring businesses can actually use the service easily in their locality, and from day one.  Utility of Debitum Token  Utility of Debitum tokens will be multifold. We have analyzed various possible token models, applied the findings to Debitum Network use cases and accordingly designed Debitum token to run two key roles within the ecosystem:  Value exchange role to build and nurture Debitum Network economy: Debitum tokens will be spent by borrowers and investors to buy services on the ecosystem with an ability to set the price for the services acquired in accordance with the quantity and quality of services received. Debitum token will allow all ecosystem users to earn value and to spend it on valuable services in a measured way.  Toll role Debitum tokens will be used as a security to guarantee a counterparty‚Äôs delivery of service.  Moreover, tokens will also be used to run Trust Arbitrage smart contracts that will indicate trust levels of counterparties within the ecosystem. This way tokens will ensure credibility of Debitum Network.

Debitum Network solution is solving credit gap of SMEs. Also core team's experience comes from financing SMEs. So the answer would be yes - this funding is for SMEs.

As decentralized financing process should cut some overhead cost, we predict that rates should lower compared to other financing possibilities",False
