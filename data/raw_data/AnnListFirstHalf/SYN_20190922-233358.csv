As a crypto evangelist I wrote about it in my blogs: https://www.reddit.com/r/icocrypto/comments/7m1ken/syn_tokens_the_reward_for_information_you_create/ and https://medium.com/@kuzkotnn/syn-tokens-the-reward-for-information-you-create-unintentionally-and-systematically-754e90029a18 I want to emphasize that this is my personal opinion and I do not have anything in common with the bounty campaign.,False
