In a capped sale, there is a chance that some buyers will not get to the sale in time and be excluded. In an uncapped sale, the buyers have no idea what the total valuation will be and thus have no guarantee of what percentage of the total tokens they will be buying. The interactive crowdsale protocol aims to solve both of these issues by allowing the market to decide the valuation through a series of bids that everyone is allowed to participate in. This is accomplished by having participants submit what is called a personal valuation cap, in addition to the regular ETH payment for tokens."" - https://medium.com/modular-network/building-the-interactive-token-sale-1545514bf108  We have published our thoughts on the Interactive Coin Offering in our own Medium article: https://medium.com/tvtwocom/what-icos-should-look-like-in-2018-a96eda686a9b  You will just need MetaMask and our website to participate.

For the start, we offer all the variety that you can find on YouTube as their license allows us to show uploaded videos on the Big Screen. May it be clips from small creators, 3-5 minute recaps of Premiere League games or 10-minute sneak peeks of Blu-ray releases from their respective content owners.  If content creators are looking to earn tokens with their videos, they can decide to upload the clips on the TV-TWO platform. We are especially targeting Vimeo creators right now, as they have a lot of really skilled professionals on their site. The goal is to win exclusive content partners for TV-TWO.",False
