Yesterday, the CND token was listed on Ethfinex and Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchanges. These are two additional exchanges on which the CND token can now be traded against ETH, BTC and USD.  Providing a convenient way to buy CND tokens is an important part of the Cindicator ecosystem economy. CND is the only way to access Cindicator’s analytical products, thus we want to emphasise once again that it’s a utility token, not a speculative investment. Interested hedge funds, private equity funds, traders, and analysts who did not buy tokens during the token sale can now easily and securely purchase the required number of CND tokens to access products in the Hybrid Intelligence ecosystem.  We’ve making consistent progress with our roadmap. In May we launched the Symbiotic Network, an alliance of like-minded teams and tokenised organisations working on real problems. Most recently, we completed the first trading contest, validating Hybrid Intelligence as an effective tool for asset management.  Recently we also opened pre-orders for Token Sale Review, our latest analytical product. Token Sale Review is an exclusive analytical product that will use Hybrid Intelligence to identify token sales that are the most promising in the long run. A stop list tracks scams and projects with excessive risks. As of today, access to this product is strictly limited, accessible by application only. Later on it will be accessible exclusively through CND tokens, just like our other products.  We want to thank our colleagues and our partners at Bitfinex and Ethfinex for their perfection and high level of professionalism they put into developing their exchanges. Founded in 2012, Bitfinex was one of the first professional platforms for cryptocurrency trading. Since then, it has solidified their spot as the go-to platform for digital asset traders and institutions. Ethfinex, a spinoff of Bitfinex, uses Bitfinex’s trading engine to create the most highly liquid and advanced trading platform for ERC20 tokens.  Our work and communication with the exchanges will continue, ensuring easy and secure access to the CND utility tokens. Additionally, we plan to work closely with the exchanges to create and distribute algorithmic and analytical products of the Hybrid Intelligence ecosystem. https://medium.com/cindicator/cnd-listed-on-bitfinex-and-ethfinex-86b906f2a75e",False

Most retailers and consumer businesses already have their own tokens — loyalty points and bonuses. The history of loyalty programmes could be traced back to 18th century when shop owners gave customers copper tokens that could be used to buy goods later. Today loyalty management is a huge business, but it’s inefficient since most loyalty points are never used, failing to bring customers back. SLP Network solves this by enabling a free exchange for bonus points and creating targeted, personalised loyalty programmes.  While rewards points might seem trivial for each individual consumer, it’s actually a big business. The value of the total global rewards market is more than $320 billion, projected to grow to $500 billion by 2019, according to City Retail Services. Startups and blue-chip companies alike use loyalty programmes to stimulate repeat purchases and generate recurring revenue. SLP Network solves real problems in the industry through tokenizing a strong product validated by real users — that’s why they are a great partner for Cindicator and the Symbiotic Network.",False

Cindicator’s Hybrid Intelligence combines collective forecasts from over 105,000+ analysts, 5,000+ traders and AI. Over a period of eight weeks, an experiment was conducted where 45 traders executed 1,170 trades based on Cindicator’s Hybrid Intelligence Indicators. On average, the traders generated a return of 21.53% in BTC or 21.54% in USD in eight weeks. The traders outperformed the HOLD 10 Private Index Fund, the common crypto benchmark, which was up 12.97% in USD over the same period. Together, the 45 traders achieved a cumulative return of 16.26% over the period, or a 166% annualised return in Bitcoin, i.e. 2.66x. Within six months of the launch of Cindicator’s analytical product, the experiment validated Hybrid Intelligence as a profitable tool for trading and investing in the highly volatile crypto markets. Contest rules  From 19 March until 13 May, 45 traders and investment professionals competed in a contest that invited them to test different strategies using Hybrid Intelligence indicators. The group of 45 traders was selected from over 5,000 of Cindicator’s token holders who use the analytical products on a daily basis. All traders started new accounts on the same crypto exchange.

We must perform experiments in decision-making not only online, but also in physical and real life environments.  That’s why we support Blue Frontiers — the leader of the seasteading movement, creating permanent settlements on floating structures. I believe seasteads have the potential to become the physical space for both social and economic experiments that will pave the way to the new economy. Let me introduce one of the first participants of the Symbiotic Network. https://medium.com/cindicator/hybrid-intelligence-and-seasteads-cindicator-partners-with-blue-frontiers-33e46cd5f80a",False

The creators of the best content (articles or videos) about our forecasting platform or our analytical products will win valuable prizes. We’ll pick the top pieces, then our community will vote to select the winners in each category. You can find more about this in our Medium post.  Our CTO and co-founder Yuri Lobyntsev has met Nassim Taleb, the author of Antifragile! We consider him the intellectual inspirer of Cindicator. Yuri had a chance to speak with Mr. Taleb briefly and explain what Cindicator is. Mr. Taleb said that a platform for decentralised decision-making based on cryptocurrencies is a great example of antifragility. Here is another insight from Nassim Taleb: “Good traders don’t need just your money. Cause just money is not fun.”  Mike Brusov, our CEO and co-founder, is in Silicon Valley. On Sunday, he spoke at Stanford University. Today, Mike and our CMO Ksenia Semenova are at the Global Blockchain Forum in Santa Clara. If you haven’t chance to meet them, come to Alchemist Money Summit (April 17 - April 19, Mountain View). Mike was invited as a speaker by Jeff Pulver, an entrepreneur and internet pioneer. Also, there will be Ned Scott from Steemit, Slava Rubin from Indiegogo, and John Burbank from Passport Capital, a hedge fund with $4bn AUM. Use our special code: CND25 to get 25% discount.  Yesterday, we’ve also paid out the prizes to our top analysts in March. In total, we’ve paid 27.93744427 ETH. Congratulations to everyone who’ve made it to the top 20%! If you didn’t get enough points to qualify for a share of the prize, don’t worry. The April competition has just started, and you have plenty of time to climb up the ranking.",False

Cindicator’s in-house PR & Marketing Department  We’d like to introduce to you our brand new PR & Marketing Department. With so many ambitious goals in mind we realised it was necessary to build a solid but flexible structure to help us implement our global marketing and business development strategy for 2018.  As ambassadors for a new type of decentralised organisation, we believe that an organisation can only be beneficial for everyone if its work is transparent. This is why Cindicator will always share its developments and discoveries, inspiring people to give insightful feedback, and we encourage you to use our ideas if you find them useful.  The concept of this structure is that PR & marketing form the foundations, ensuring quality and successful long-term business development. The PR & Marketing Department creates content that resonates with the public: our current and future users. It promotes organic growth and, very importantly, word-of-mouth communication. Through the carefully tailored messages we send using social media and vocalise during meetups and conferences, we also share our expertise and knowledge, building confidence in the ecosystem. It stimulates the market and in turn brings new customers, new partnerships, and new products. It provides the fuel our ecosystem runs on.  But a well thought out structure would be lifeless and useless without people to inhabit it, so we hired the best specialists we could find, with hard skills in digital marketing, fintech PR, SMM, performance marketing, growth hacking, and global business development. The department now consists of nine team members and three part-time members.  https://medium.com/@Cindicator/yay-cindicators-in-house-pr-marketing-department-5d1e4852dc38",False

What we actually did was create a whole new structure within Cindicator, and we want to share it with you. Cindicator is always open to the community.

You can find more detailed information about the new department and its working groups on our blog.  Next week is going to be HOT in Austin, TX. We are headed to SXSW (South by Southwest)! Founded in 1987, SXSW is best known for its conference and festivals, and these days it is buzzing with blockchain and fintech events.

Cryptometer bot’s interface became simpler after the recent update. Now to add or remove new pair you just need to select base and quoted asset of the pair via checkbox. The same approach works for the exchanges, price alerts and cheapest asset. We’ve also reworked the structure of menu to make it more convenient. More intriguing update is coming soon!  Starting with the January ratings we are increasing both prize funds by 25% — from $6,000 to $7,500 in the traditional markets challenge and from 1 BTC to 1.25 BTC in the crypto markets challenge. This decision was determined by the increased number of analysts with a positive balance in the final January ratings.     January’s reward system update includes not only extra 25% of prize fund but also the access to various plans of Cindicator bot. Now we grant the access to Cindicator’s analytical products for top-60 analysts from first 3 echelons of the rating. Be at the top to get a unique opportunity as a reward!",False

At the moment I think this chance is at 0%. I don't trust USDT for one moment, but the last audit showed that they actually had all USD in the bank. I think those USD might not be accessible for some time, and therefore any significant drop from the rate USD/USDT will be bought by someone who eventually believes that the USD will be able to withdrawn.  Also I have this weird thought that the US government is buying the USDT, or has someone buying USDT for them, because who else is buying them as long as it remains unclear what is happening under to roof of Tether/Bitfinex? Who else has the funds to do that without having to worry about losing capital?    It can also be much simpler. As soon as the price drops >1%, traders use that to swap between coins instead of using ETH and BTC, or temporarily hide in USDT until there's a moment to buy. It's an efficient way to prevent your total funds losing value if you anticipate a further decline. Just hope that USDT doesn't go to 0.00 while having your hands on this. Because this is either worth a dollar or it is worth nothing at all, there's no intermediate.  And still no 2018 audit of the Tether accounts is to be seen. US government remains silent as well. Silence from an authority usually means they are working on the case, and no information can be made public, as it might compromise the legal case they are building. Except for this message then...

Because though the price is high, you don't lose that deposit, and you might even get a profit from CND going up while holding the tokens. Assuming the price won't drop 200% overnight.

What is usually paid for a trading robot and sorts alike, an expensive one?  It costs about 1500 USD for beginner access to the bot, and 196000 USD for expert access. That is with the current rate of 0.28 USD (Binance). Let's say big traders will go for the expert bot if they decide on using Cindicator. If the token price goes up by 10% that means almost 20000 USD increase in price of the expert bot. If CND goes to 0.60 USD, double the price from now, then expert access becomes +/- 4000000 USD. And so on.  How does the bot perform compared to similar bots, and to human brokers?  If the learning capacity of the A.I. is really what it is intended to be, an artificial form of intelligence, then the price can eventually go really high. But I would expect that to go gradually and directly related to the success ratio of the bot.

If you base the access price on the USD/EUR/YEN, then a rise of the token price will have an inverse effect on the Cindicator bot access price. This would benefit token holders by the relative price reduction of beginner, medium and expert access. This would in effect contribute to the A.I. by providing more input/users. Improvement of the A.I. should have a positive effect on the bot's predictions, and so access to this becomes more in demand. Etc.  Is a win-win?

For the most exclusive Hybrid Intelligence products, we are planning to implement a pricing system based on auction and competition for access. This system will allow traders and funds to compete between themselves for the right to gain access to products. Auctions and competitions will be used to provide access to those products which can be accessed by one or several market participants only. The advantage of competitive access to our ecosystem is that the Token holders interested in the products, on the one hand, can determine the price themselves, which will also have a positive influence on the creation of the dynamic motivation fund for the system’s analysts, and on the other hand will contribute to the development of the adjacent sections of the ecosystem (for instance, the most accurate analysts from the top echelon, who provide the greatest contribution to the ecosystem, will be granted priority access to exclusive trading signals).",False

First of all, I would advise you to come in Cindicator Telegram group and read all Medium posts they made lately.  You have also the possibility to participate more in Cindicator growth joining the Discord community.  The community is working closely with the team, so take your time to subcribe if you have some ideas or remarks that could help Cindicator   Links : https://t.me/cindicator_chat for everyday chat with community, admins and team https://t.me/cindicator_news Announcements, mediums posts ...  For discord link, you can ask admins in Cindicator Chat. We will soon participate in the marketing campaign sprints (with Trello). For your informations, the roadmap for 2018 will be released soon (in December). Personnally I can't wait to know what is the next step    From my point of view, I hold Cindicator since the beginning and I never stopped believing in the project even though we had recently a ""major"" dump on Binance. Recently, I saw people complaining that they lost money since the ICO because ETH, BTC and others crypto currencies that have made a good progression so far.  You can earn money just using Cindicator products. Either you are a forecaster and you can be rewarded if you have a positive balance or either you can use CND you bought to use the products. I am at expert level and have also the arb bot and I can tell you, it's amazing. Example : During a 5 hours sleep, I got almost 60 notifications from the arb bot for arbitrage opportunities with a threshold of 7%  !!!!  Of course, you will not get as much value being in beginner mode than being in trader mode because value come with a price. But it can give you a idea of Cindicator signals performance.  Cindicator is cheap right now. Do you all realize that now, with approximately 20k$ you can get all products Cindicator developed ? and besides that grow all your investments very fast. Cindicator token price rise on the market is nothing compared to the money you can earn with the products.  Day by day, people will realize this, it will create hype around Cindicator ecosphere, new forecasters, new investors, and new products coming month by month. Look at crypto currencies that have actual product you can use, you will understand how good is Cindicator, for a young token. Speculation is good in cryptos, but for long term growth, people will always stick to projects with good fondations and real products.     Have a good afternoon and I hope I will see you soon in Cindicator discord or telegram if you are not already there.  Cheers, Alexis  P.S : Cindicator volume is about 10M$ (1/3 of the market cap).

This is surely an error. Coinmarket cap has it up 38% which sounds more accurate.

Not good as this coin has a lot of potential and this should be a great opportunity to get it noticed positively so more people research and buy it.

I see CND as an effort to try to break into the outside world.

We continue this practice by sharing the current progress on our roadmap with you here.  https://medium.com/@Cindicator/our-progress-on-the-roadmap-since-the-token-sale-4ad67cf360cf  ML Team Progress  In recent years, the assembly models, i.e., the development of more precise predictors based on weaker models, have become more and more successful. Therefore, this approach lies at the foundation of our pipeline. Our pipeline is a complex assembly of dynamic links and dependencies, based on various clustering algorithms, Bayesian regression models, and the time-series analyses. There are two classical approaches: using super-forecasters and the wisdom of the crowd. Based on our experience, the best results come from combining them. As of today, we work only with the information we receive from our users, and for this reason we can affect the amount of information (the entropy) in our system. We are able to predict errors in users’ financial forecasts and their behavior in various situations.  We have already implemented the MVP of our machine learning pipeline, allowing the processing of inbound data and the daily learning of our models, backtests, and optimisations. Our pipeline is already more accurate on average than the individual votes of our best forecasters.  Currently, we are testing our infrastructure on various financial assets. In the future we are planning to widen and improve our models, to make our system more open to various types of information from financial markets, to conduct various kinds of experiments and research. We are also planning to launch an open technological sprint for our active community participants with the required skills.",False

Noone is saying that the problem is them not listing the coin 1 month after ICO. It's a short period, it's perfectly understandable. I'm fine waiting for 3 months, if the team shows intentions of listing the coin, and kindly asks us to wait.  The problem is the team's behaviour and communication. Their behavior is unprofessional, immature and unacceptable. As an investor, I want to know the market value of my holdings, and also want my investment to be liquid at any time. Listing CND token wouldn't make me dump it, I would actually have more incentive to hold it then, but I need to know that it's liquid and in case of emergency, I can sell it.  What they are doing is banning everyone who asks about exchange, therefore crippling their community (they probably loose like 50 members per day). I am starting to believe they never wanted to list this coin in first place, but if they announced that before the ICO, they wouldn't raise any money. If this is to be believed, investors would be forced to hold worthless tokens, or spend them in Cindicator app, which means Cindicator would get free funding through ICO + that money back as a revenue from selling their product.  They even have the balls to say ""you're not an investor, you are just a token holder"". Even though I do understand that holding CND tokens brings me no equity, if I put $3k of my own money in your project, I'll call myself whatever I want.  This is all reflecting onto CND price, so a project that had a potential to be one of the best projects in 2017, is trading 20% under ICO price (no, it has nothing to do with the fact that market is bearish atm).  This is just my 2 Satoshi's, they will delete this post anyway in matter of hours, as they do on it on every channel whenever you post an argumented criticism about their behavior.",False

I was quite sure that this was the ico of the month.  Unfortunately my confidence about this project is now completely disrupted. After joining their telegram group I became a strange feeling when I read about their censorship policy regarding exchanges. For discussing about exchanges they decided to ban and they finally banned me after joking   I asked them ""when lambo?"", so I was banned and I'm not able anymore to access their group.  It's a shame to treat your investors like this. Discussing about exchanges is completely legit, people put their hard-earned money in their project, so they have the right to ask what they want. The next big problem of them was to avoid listing their coin on any exchanges. They wanted to list it after creating some substantial value, but you can't forbid people to trade in a decentralised world. And why did they have their ico if they don't want to let the coin be traded? I can't unterstand that. Furthermore, they completely crashed their token's value with this stupid action. I'm long enough in this crypto world to know, what kills a coin: low trading value and long lasted undervalued trading. Even if they are listed on a big exchange, they lost one big advantage: that there were just around 4000 token holders.  No company can allow it, to treat its customers like shit and especially not their investors. Cindicator did it with their arrogant and rude way of banning/insulting people. After that, they come and explain theirselves. That's the way of scaring people/investors of.  I'm quite disappointed how this actually good and hard working company make fun of its investors and fans. If you won't stop this behavior, you will fall flat on their face.",False

Our financial analysts are an essential part of Cindicator Hybrid Intelligence. It is they who provide “the wisdom of the crowd”, which is later processed with our machine learning models and turned into accurate forecasts. It is impossible to overestimate how valuable our analysts are, and they have our sincere gratitude. In this post we want to explain the great benefits of becoming a forecaster. 1. Training A good education is indisputably one of the most important and valuable things we can receive in our life, and practice is an essential part of the education process. We cannot learn a new skill without exercising it first. Cindicator cannot offer you classes on corporate finance or trading, but you can train yourself, using our app. Every day you will receive a number of questions on all relevant events in both traditional financial assets and crypto assets, along with links to all the information needed to make a forecast. You can track your progress and see where you were wrong, which is the first step to improving your expertise. The app is easy, convenient, and absolutely free to use. It is already available on Android and iOS platforms, and we plan to launch a web platform in early December. 2. Rewards Cindicator provides our analysts with an opportunity to monetize their skills and knowledge in a relaxed way. We send monthly rewards to the most accurate analysts — those with top ratings. Our ratings are nulled each month, so newcomers have the same chances of getting to the top as our veterans. There is a complete meritocracy –- the accuracy of your answers is all that matters. We are steadily increasing our monthly reward pool. It was $1,500 and 0.4 BTC in August 2017; in October, two months later, it is $2,000 and 0.6 BTC. We have already paid more than $60,000 in total since the launch of the crowd forecasting app. And we are constantly working on improving the motivational system to further express our gratitude to our analysts. In addition to financial compensation, we are also happy to provide our precise analysts with official certificates of their expertise. Such certificates are valued in the financial world, and we know of at least one case where it helped its owner to receive a job offer from a serious Wall Street company. 3. Community We are very proud of our supporters: data scientists, engineers, financial experts and researchers form a unique community. Joining Cindicator as an analyst gives one access to this international network of professionals and provides an opportunity to talk to people barely reachable in ordinary circumstances. It also provides an opportunity to share the experience with like-minded people and to learn from the best. In Cindicator we consider our community as a part of our core team. Therefore, we aim to interact closely with our community members; to work with them through the various community programs we are constantly developing. 4. Cindicator Imagine millions of analysts whose efforts are enhanced by artificial intelligence. Hybrid Intelligence has every chance of bringing the revolution to contemporary analytics –- not only in finance, politics, and sports,but in all areas where the forecasting of future events is necessary. By joining our analytics ranks now, you can become part of this success.  https://techburst.io/become-an-analyst-for-cindicator-50bf8c998c7b",False

We want to express our position once again: Cindicator takes the safety of our partners (token holders) very seriously, thus we require that buying and selling of CND token are secure as much as it is possible. We have a number of technical requirements for the exchanges that are interested in listing the CND. If these requirements are not completely fulfilled, we cannot give our permission for listing. We also do not tolerate the situations when the exchanges that try to list our token it for trading without our consent. We remind you that CND is not an instrument for speculation - it is an indispensable part of the Cindicator tech ecosystem, it’s essential infrastructure element.  Furthermore, we ourselves initiate the discussions with these exchanges that meet our high-security standards. It is important for Cindicator to give an opportunity for those that couldn't participate in the Token Sale to buy tokens so that they can access our products in the future. However, we can not and will not make any announcements before things are 100% settled. Please follow our official channels - the information will be there when we are ready.

I will also put my message here because I would desperately like to be involved into Cindicator project as user and investor. I decided I won't give up, even if I didn't get into tier 3 yet, I will try everything to get into tier 3 or 4.  I tried your mobile app and I love it! I already made some predictions (like Tesla price for example) and shared it with my friends. I am looking forward to be involved in the project actively in future and I also have some ideas.  Unfortunately I didn't get into tier 3 and I registered weeks ago. I guess the reason why I didn't get into tier is because I answered your question honestly and I didn't lie, I wrote that I just want to invest. But after I downloaded your app and read your website carefully I realized how interesting is your product and that I really want to use it actively and spread the word.  To me this is one of the best project this year. I have been always fascinated about AI. I can imagine all that help from your community working together with AI hybrid network system, this could be really something big. I am not fascinated about the project just as investor but also because of technology and all the opportunities.  I would like to be actively involved in the project in different ways: 1. I already started using your app and I will continue using it as I really like it. I will also publish my predictions on Facebook and help promoting your app and the project. I hope I can also earn some tokens if my forecast data is good enough. 2. I will use your app to get some help with my investment decisions. 3. I would also like to be involved as tester of your app. I like your app, but I miss some functionality and there are also some errors: -Inside Statistics I receive quite often error ""Error occured, could not load statistics"". -I miss option to see future forecasts of best users. Right now I can see only statistics for past. But it would make sense that if some user has very good rate, I could see what forecast he has for future because I want to invest for future, past is already missed opportunity.  I hope I will get chance to not just use your app but also to be involved as investor. Please give me chance to invest $2000-$5000. My e-mail was sent to you by private message.

I cherish your frugality, yet as an investor I can't help but wonder how are you planning on maintaining the growth and operation of your platform in the future?  Aren't there any numbers one could look at to make sure that the forecaster awards run smoothly? Especially since you are refusing to disclose your potential revenue sources.  2. I think you might have misinterpreted my question: I get that your tokens run on a blockchain, as do I get that analysing different blockchains is a major selling point of your platform. What actually interests me is what does your project use the blockchain technology for (other than to sell tokens)? What info do you store on the blockchain, other than transaction history of your tokens? How is a non-blockchain business that deals in forecasting for fiat different from you essentially?  3. I wasn't asking what currency you would charge them with  . In the past you claimed that previously your clients didn't want to employ your services without exclusive rights to the platform. How does pitching the same platform, but with CND tokens instead of fiat as payment change their minds?  4. >why you think so? > Cindicator_WhitePaper_en.pdf (thanks for the link!  ) > 3.2.2 CND token distribution... 20% - for the Cindicator company (+vesting).  > we will adjust them to boost demand - by what means exactly?  5. The cryptocurrency market is indeed volatile - not the least due to the fickle nature of whitepapers out there, that allow copmanies to essentially regard investor's cash as charitable contributions     6. I am quite familiar with who is performing the token sale, thank you. The actual question was: how is the operating company officially affiliated with the company performing the token sale? Do they have the same owners/directors? Is the token issuer in any way liable for the actual performance of the product? Is the operating company liable for the actions of the token issuer? If market volatility from p.5 takes place, who is accountable for changing the rules?  See you at Stage 4! ",False

Having done a little bit of browsing I couldn't really find any clear info on how you run your operational costs: I'm assuming that you have offices to rent, servers to upkeep and wages to pay (and money-counting machines for all that sweet ICO dosh xoxo) - how much does it all cost on a monthly basis anyway? Nor did I manage to see any sources of operational revenue - I just don't quite understand what and to whom you are going to sell (apart from the tokens in the initial offering). Also I don't think I quite get the part about your predictors remuneration - what and how are they getting paid? how many are getting paid?   2. What exactly do you need blockchain technology for? Wouldn't it all be easier to run normally without adding a new layer of tech? What part of the project is actually connected to the blockchain - what sort of info is stored on it, who runs the nodes, what is the blockchain consensus mechanism?   3. How are you going to sell your products to institutional investors? Didn't the reject your early offers? How did the introduction of CND tokens make it more appealing to them, especially once the forecaster fees kick in?  4. To my understanding, Cindicator wants to play a major role in both the CND token exchange as well as being a major CND holder. Key CND project entities also rely on CND for remuneration - this certainly lends pressure for the CND token to go upwards, yet the customers might not feel like it's a good thing. How is the CND market going to find a stable equilibrium?  5. Your Russian WP has a pretty weird clause on p. 13 where it says that you reserve the right to change any and all clauses of the present agreement... Is that a typo? As an investor, I would be bummed about changes to the tokens I bought after already having bought them.   6. I believe it was mentioned somewhere that you set up a company in Gibraltar for the actual fundraising part. How is the Cindicator project related to the Gibraltar company: are you in any way officially affiliated? Are the project's key figures in any way affiliated with the company? How are the the token funds declared in their legal space and to what tax authorities does the Gibraltar company report to?  Very excited to be a part of this!",False

I showed you the top of the top: Buffet, an Index of the most exclusive HF.  Then is Madoff, anyone used to need at least 1 million USD to can participate there, but he promesed returns of 20%-30%. A good HF gives around 7-10% in the best scenario. That's a very very poor alpha.  With Cindicator you are telling can achieve that 30-40%, and maybe is possible, but you need all the forecasters, the good and the bad ones. But the app punishes more the mistakes that reward the correct answers. That can give you in the short term a good alpha, but is a formula for disaster in the long term: why, because having more confidence takes more risks, your beta goes very wide and in a correction or black swan you lost everything.  The good traders have anual returns of 5% but their risk are so low that their are really boring.  Do you know how really a trader make money? Losing their clients money, living just from the fee: as you can see in the pension partners chart, lower is the alpha greater is the utility of the hedge fund.",False

What makes you think that it is a guessing machine? Did you download our app?  This is how it works: 1. Cindicator creates questions in the mobile app. 2. Forecasters make their prediction on the daily basis, answering a number of specific questions about price levels of different financial assets, macroeconomic indexes, and events significantly influencing the market.     3. Right after the question closed (deadline), the artificial intelligence system synthesizes accurate forecasts using machine learning algorithms based on the accumulated statistics predicted by forecasters.  Machine learning models dynamically calculate various weights for each forecaster, identify stable systematics in their errors and calculate corrections for the errors, eliminate noise, and generate final predictions and trading signals.  So where is the fancy guessing machine?",False

Examples: Create a forecast of the minimum and maximum price levels of Bitcoin for the upcoming seven days. Will the Tesla stock price surge to $345 during the market hours on Friday? Will the U.S. unemployment rate be greater than or equal to 4.5%, according to the June 2 report? Will Bancor collect more than $100M during the first week of ICO?  Then it’s the artificial intelligence algorithm’s turn: it aggregates the forecasters’ predictions into a single one, determining which action should be taken and with what parameters.

Buyback seems to me to be articulated confidence by the Management Team in there service offering and there plan to execute their strategic objectives. It also offers some control over liquidity of the Asset Back Instrument.

Interestingly, the winner’s result would have been +1.48% (25% p.a.), which is almost half less than the return provided by hybrid intelligence.”  I have read that Cindicator’s principle business is in and around the offering of hybrid intelligence for the investment, banking and finance sectors and not around the trade of investments, asset backed instruments etc. Is there a strong argument for vertically integrating a group of standard products as a ‘white label’ product (ie forecasting for USD/RUB exchange rate, Brent oil, gold and silver) and offering a packaged up instrument (white label) rather than just access to a group of API’s?  Perhaps this is the Cindicator strategy? Are you able to offer some insight into the strategy of value adding to what appears, prima facie, to be valuable predictive information services?

Becoming Cindicator forecaster is a great way to capitalize your knowledge and trading skills - without risking your money. You can also earn money if you are on the top of our montly rating.  Actually, your goal is to make your forecasts on events that you can see in app.  Forst, you choose questions from the list and answer them. You got points for right answers and lose points for wrong answers. There are “probabilistic” and “price-related” questions.  “Probabilistic” questions asks you to choose a probability of an outcome of particular event on a scale from 0% (certainly won’t happen) to 100% (certainly would happen). The exact significance of the probability you choose will determine the amount of points you win or lose. Example of the question: “Will Tesla report earnings per share (EPS) above current Wall Street Consensus of $-1.81?”  “Price-related questions” requires you to set price for a financial instrument manually. Example of questions: “In your opinion, what will be the maximum price of Apple stock on Wednesday, August 2 at the first day after its Q3 results announced?”  Number of points you get from your forecasts set your place in the rating. Currently, top 30 forecasters share the prize money fund each month. There is also a regular crypto challenge: top 10 forecaster share BTC prize fund. We don’t charge you anything for being a forecaster, neither do we fine you for wrong predictions. The only thing you invest is your knowledge and skills (and maybe a few megabytes of storage on your smartphone).  Finally, we strongly encourage you to analyze the data necessary for a correct forecast. All related graphs and information might be accessed from “helpful links” key under the question.",False

Also, you can’t compare crypto markets with traditional markets. Totally different risks, volatility, liquidity.  In addition to that, it was a pilot project with Moscow Exchange. We had never asked about those financial instruments before, most forecasters hadn’t been using our app before (totally new users for our ML models). Therefore, the result of this pilot proved the efficiency of the Hybrid Intelligence ecosystem even with a non-trained (on the computer learning models used by us) sample of forecasters.  Regarding your second question, thank you for gentle comment. We know about that issue and know how to solve it. It is described with details in our WP (section 3.1.2 and 4.6). Thanks again!",False

If you read our WP, you would have noticed that our company has been working since 2015. Our application and website designed like this since April 2016. We already have several completed products (for instance, you can check our app - available for iOs and Android).  Regarding Santiment and CoinDash. Once again, here is a short summary of Cindicator’s history. •    From June to November 2016, the team worked on the creation of the first set of machine learning models, further improvement of the collective intelligence system (currently, there are over 8,000 forecasters on the platform), and creation and forward testing of various trading strategies on the stock and foreign exchange markets. •    In January 2017, an API for trading signals was launched, enabling the launch of test integrations with 11 hedge funds and three banks in the following four months.  If you don't want to read our WP, check the app, please: 1. Our app has been using this concept since December 2015. 2. You will find out that there is a completely different idea. Cindicator enhances human intelligence (predictions from many analysts) with AI for best financial forecasts. When it comes to crowd forecasting, it is more like Estimize than Santiment or CoinDash.  So it is hard to say that we copy someone.",False

It corresponds to profitability of 47% per annum."" is a piece of shit. 2.81% profitability in half a month could be achieved if you play on the growth of bitcoin. what are the guarantees that the robot will show the same profitability during the upcomming period? How can he predict and avoid market failures, thus not loosing my money? Or even according to the basic logic rules, if everyone or even a big part of investors (we talk about RU zone, right?) start using your software, the stategy will not be unique therefore the promised profitability will be eliminated.",False
