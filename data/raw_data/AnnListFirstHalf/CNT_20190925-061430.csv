Solution: Blockchains can completely eliminate types of fraud such as chargeback fraud and card-not-present fraud and reduce the impact of other types. •  Improve the efficiency of the current processing system Problem: In last year, almost 40% of all transaction attempts were fraud*. Solution: Eliminating card-not-present fraud will reduce the instances of attempted fraud in transactions. •  Reduce operational expenses for fraud management Problem: In last year, a typical e-commerce spent nearly 5% of their revenue or nearly 25% of OpEX to Fraud Management*. Solution: Eliminating card-not-present fraud and chargeback fraud will reduce the cost of Fraud management. •  Remove confidence issues Problem: As soon as there is no chargeback by design, transferring money to someone you can’t trust can make you feel apprehensive. Solution: All deals are processed by smart contracts, so fair refunds are still an option. •  Reduce the CAPEX for blockchain integration Problem: A blockchain and smart contracts developing integration needs a lot of funds and efforts Solution: A set of secure smart contracts and blockchain integration modules will be developed and ready to use via external APIs.",False
