A lot of people who might not be able to get a loan can now with LALA Lends. The people who really deserve it.  I am wondering though, in the video it is said that Ravinder Kumar's bussiness was visited and within 1 week he received the money that he needed.  Does every applicant need to be visited personally to get a loan approved? I guess the LALA team needs a lot of people on the payroll in different places to be able to check applicants and make sure everything moves smoothly and fair. How does LALA have the budget for this? At a certain point the ICO funds would run out I would think?",False

Each time you change your keepass data, simply upload it to the vault. The vault is a secure area of sync that is not shared publically(harder to hack), also Sync uses a second layer encryption of all the uploaded files. Regarding the rootkit, download malwarebyte, select ""custom scan"" and select rootkit scan. Many years back, I was infected, my antivirus (AVG at the time) detected nothing, until I do a rookit scan.  VPN are good but again, it only encrypt point A to point B so it is only good if you want to keep a certain level of confidentiality, but at the same time, it is a bit of a joke because when you open a VPN account, you give you bank details/identity, so if you do something nasty or download something bad(illegal), they can also trace you back to the VPN service provider's ip(server log), I forgot to say that the VPN provider also keeps your ip address details when accessing their servers, so it is not top of the top  lol.

Lala should conform with these standards in order to protect the interests of its users and customers specially they are rendering financial services to the public. I believe they are thinking already of these standards before they conduct ICO, to be honest i think kyc is not that important as long as there is no regulation in ICO that lala is operating, blockchain is very secured.  nope, they were right, lala should know their customer's details as the money laundering is very prolific in these kind of service, think of it as an escape route for illegal traders, lala will just become a washing machine without those standard.",False

There are no changes to the ICO dates which is scheduled from 5th January to 5th February. We are extending these pre-ICO dates just by 10 days to coincide with real product launches in Malaysia and India (and implement some basic feedback and features). Also, we are the first Wallet and platform which will have real product, real users across multiple jurisdictions and will be releasing a Proof of Concept (PoC) remittance product on hyper ledger blockchain. There is another PoC around peer to peer lending that will also be released between pre-ICO and ICO dates. For more robust security integration, PoC on two products, real Wallet launch in two countries, implementation of feedbacks from various partners and advisors, we decided to just revise the Pre-ICO dates from 25th November to 15th December.

Humaniq, Stellar Lumens have ambitions for the unbanked. Think along the lines of financial difficulties migrants have, not just asylum seekers and refugees. The premise of Lala World is banking the unbanked. Perhaps the largest project I can think of in this space would be OmiseGo. There's also Everex. Both excellent projects.  What I like about Lala World (from what I've read so far) is the inclusion of micro lending (enormous potential for SME's), biometric verification and a debit card-ewallet tie in to name a few.  I think of the problems Metal Pay is looking to solve with industries like licensed cannabis vendors. With the amount of disparaged minorities across multiple social strata and industries, I can definitely see that there is space for multiple projects. Competition is always healthy, however with Generation 3 blockchain looking at interoperability/hyperconnectivity it will be awesome to see how LaLa World seeks to leverage off network effects. Really exciting stuff that is trying to solve such a massive economic, social and cultural issue.  Anyway, I'm from the ICON community and am looking forward to hearing about LaLa Worlds' presentation in the coming days.",False
