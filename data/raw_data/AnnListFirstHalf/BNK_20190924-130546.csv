Honestly you are a waste of space that contradicts yourself over and over. It is like you have split personality disorder or something. My opinion of you tho from the way that you have acted here is that you sir are indeed the scammer and are up to something. You have a motive here and it is not a good one. You don’t give a shit about actual scams or people losing money. You only care about yourself and your sinister motives. Anyone who will read the past 20 pages would notice this.  I know that you will call me shill or whatever and that I am an alternate account or something. You will point out that I have only commented on this thread therefore I am a scammer. But let me tell you something, I have only invested in this project and it is my only concern in the crypto world. I don’t know much about the crypto world and don’t have the time to spend learning all things crypto. I have work, kid, wife and life to balance so free time is limited for me nowadays. So of course this is the only thing I will comment on or ask questions about as this is my investment and my money. So if that doesn’t make sense to you then you are an idiot!  I do not believe for a second that you have invested in this at all so you don’t know everything about Bankera. You just spread misinformation that you have picked up somewhere and not even verified said information. You are acting like a parasite and a bully on this thread. If we were in the same room there is no way that you would speak to people the way you have on here because you know there would be consequences for that. Maybe try treating people with respect and actually try and have a conversation with the people here it would be beneficial to everyone. Just spamming the same shit is not constructive at all mate.  I don’t think that you will read this or respond in anyway that would amount to a discussion but I hope that I am wrong. Anyway that is my thoughts and opinions.",False

Who the fuck will use scammy exchange with very high rates and $ 3200 24 Hour volume.  https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/bankera   Quote from: nutildah on September 14, 2019, 03:31:10 PM Let's talk for a minute about those sweet, sweet Ethereum payments that keep rolling in.  Current price of BNK: 0.00000842 ETH Last payment to BNK holders per BNK: 0.0000000020643354407299 ETH  Amount of payments to equal 1 BNK at current price: 4,078 Amount of payments to equal 1 BNK at ICO price: 64,935  That means you'll be waiting over a thousand years to make back the price you spent on each BNK you bought at ICO.  You should really be asking Bankera what the hell they did with your money.  Spectrocoin, the flagship product of the Bankera family, is kind of a joke. It has an extremely shitty reputation. If I had invested in this POS there's no way I would be defending it at this point. Maybe after a 50% loss... Maybe even 60%... But 92%? This thing is as good as dead and they only reason they didn't pull an exit scam is because they knew it would result in too much unwanted legal action against them. It's better to pull off a slow burn and keep the illusion of a business going for as long as possible.  They are OK with waiting thousands years to get back their investments. All that paid shills are not investors, they are just hired shitposters, that will shill for any scam that is paying out.",False

I mean in my country banks are planning to charge you a penalty interest for having funds on your savings account. So we have a interest of 1,33% p.a. + the chance of a potential token price increase. One must consider the current WR with the current price. In the past we had a way higher net transactional revenue than today, we had a higher token price and a smaller token supply. One must consider all of this factors. The token supply is not going to change anytime soon, the price can go even lower (increasing the interest for every new bought token) or higher and the WR can go up (to levels like in the past through the new loans products or the revival of the cards) or could go lower (whereas the WR is pretty constant at the current levels for almost 1 year).",False

We do know that Bankera releases a blog entry almost every week detailing their income. Last week they said they generated a 18,641.92 EUR ""net transactional revenue,"" a figure which has been falling since the introduction of their weekly disbursements in Sept 2017.  In 2 years they have so far paid back about 1/100th of the total amount of funds they raised since the ICO, which means that in order for the average investor to break even, at this rate they will have to remain operational for another 198 years!  Here's where I think the scam lies, though I have no proof of it other than the lack of transparency in Spectrocoin's trading volumes: I strongly believe Bankera is just slowly repaying BNK holders money they collected during the ICO. How much money could it have possibly cost to set up their operations and provide liquidity for them, at most? Not 110 million euros, that's for sure. Maybe 10 million, max.  So what happened to all the extra money? Where could it have possibly gone? Doesn't that concern any of the BNK holders?  All they have really accomplished is changing $111.5 million+ in hard, raised funds into a $17 million market cap. (CMC mkt cap is wrong). They are, as a liberal estimation, making $300k a year. So that's still 56 and a half YEARS of revenue to be made before their profits equal their market cap.  Basically, even though this token has fallen 92% since ICO, its still incredibly overvalued.     Can you post a screenshot of the PM here, just for fun?",False

I remember long time ago  i was searching for Spectrocoin office. This one: UAB Spectro Finance Vilniaus g. 31 Vilnius LT-01402 Lithuania And guess what? It does not exists. I asked some people in that building, but they never heard about spectrocoin. And the telephone +44 20 3769 5474  is fake too.  Great news. Fake addresses, fake promises... The word FAKE is very closely associated with bankera.   Yes the number for sure is fake, I dialled it to test.  Another thing, the address they gave for the UK is a mailing address - they do not have an office there: Kemp House, 160 City Road, London EC1V 2NX  It costs around 100 EURO a year to get permission to use that address as a company mailing address and that address is shared by many companies: https://yourvirtualofficelondon.co.uk/  According to this link there are over 1000 companies that have used the same address as a ""mailing address"" but have never actually existed there, it just looks nice to put on websites and company documents to fool people in to thinking they are a big company with an office in London, UK: http://www.ukaddressbook.uk/a/kemp-house-152-160-city-road-london-ec1v-2nx  Thankfully the Spectrocoin/Bankera drama is falling apart as they are now being scrutinised more and more     I asked many times to post a video from bankera's office taken by simple mobile phone, but of course my request was rejected by bankera scammers.",False

Just because most of the exchanges fake their volumes does not mean Bankera should get a pat-on-the-back for displaying (perceived) honest information.

Secondly, we have distinct solutions to leverage the risk of one program being shut down or so, so we would be able to offer the service anyhow. 4. Linked cards are provided by another third party and the limitation is due to their policies, this does not have impact for issued cards constrains (well, I will not lie, SC cards will be for EEA first, but that's why we are building our own infrastructure with Pervesk etc to outgrow these limitations). 5.

Remember that during the ICO was offered only part of the total bankera. The other part it was planed to be sold in a second time and not under a certain price (if remember right was 0.1 euro). While I see at coinmarketcap.com that the circulating supply is almost the same with the total supply. How is possible that? Are sold all the tokens and are all in the market?  Thanks!,False

Happy to see Bankera community participating in providing legit counterarguments to the FUD'ers. Good job everyone!! Moderators if you do care about doing the right thing and reading what people are talking about, check all the links provided and remove that banner that obviously is based on nonsense!!  This was your first post, on August 7th. BNK is down 28% since then. The main problem with you and your buddies is you all started commenting at the same time, all talking about how fantastic Bankera was. A number of you felt it necessary to abuse the trust system in order to (attempt to) cast doubt on your critics, which was a really lame move. It made Bankera even more suspect. After just a little bit of investigation it was easy to find dozens of complaints about Bankera and Spectrocoin. It was apparently a huge money grab which has resulted in nothing substantial being created, several promises broken, and an 87% reduction in token price (or more) since ICO.  You are free to continue to hold out hope that something may develop from it somewhere down the line, just as we are free to warn people about the risks of getting involved. This was a shitty investment 3 weeks ago, its a shitty investment today, it will remain a shitty investment into the foreseeable future.  Have a fantastic day.",False

Bankera appear to now have several products but this is pointless if you don't bother marketing to attract any customers.   God only knows what's going on at the top in this inept company.  Literally by far the worst 'investment' I ever made.  If this had been a regulated investment I'd have petitioned for the directors to be removed long ago.

I would have thought that the logical conclusion would be for the price to rise as there will be live revenue generating products and services, which in Bankera's case results in a 20% dividend from the net profits being shared among the token holders, ergo, the more they generate the more profit and therefore the larger my weekly return and more value added to the holding of the token.

The loans are already here and operating so time will allow us to build slowly and in a steady way the income thanks to WR  I honestly believe it will be prossible to hit some +50% or even double the actual WR in a blink of am eye if Cards are released.  Regarding expectations at the long run? Well I won't be so greedy like our friend Diviner in the Chat.Bankera.com used to say (0.25 €/ BNK as WR) but I see it possible to hit 60€/01M BNK per week if everything goes ok, now of course there are a lot of bad surprises  and things can fastly get twisted .. but I would not lie if I say I have the steong sensation that the worst is behind us (We had the worst year and a very bad luck with the Cards getting suspended by Visa, then the issue with Allied and after the regulation fines...etc) So yes, I think this year could be our first stair to climb to the first stage of the token.  Bankera has proven it is a Diesel train, it fires and start very slowly does not make a huge move but it is a train that goes ahead ...no matter what the regulation does, no matter what bearish Market we see, no matter even what anobsessed Fudder can do...

You don't spend hundreds of thousands of Euros (possibly millions) and considerable resources developing a product only to give up on it as soon as it's launched.  I run my own software business and I consider this an absolute disgrace and an insult to people who've invested.  I bet they've barely scraped a revenue of 1000 Euros in fees since the exchange was launched.  Laughable.  Sorry to be blunt but if I were a director in charge of this then I'd fully expect to be sacked.  I guess when a business has a huge level of funding and no accountability to investors then they can just sit back and relax.  As I said there's plenty they could do to kick start the exchange for example by adding their own liquidity that follows prices on competing exchanges.  Few day's development and done.  The user base will start growing without them lifting a finger again.  God only knows why they haven't done this.  And the fact that the circulation supply of BNK STILL hasn't been fixed on CMC is now so far beyond a joke now that I'm struggling to come up with words to describe the situation.  18 months of substantial free advertising lost for the project for what should be a 5 minute change.  Quite unbelievable.  I'm not holding my breath that the direction of this inept company will change.  For this they need a big wake-up call and some changes at the top.,False

Why invest in something that has such a terrible reputation? No matter how you dice it, there have been hundreds of individual complaints about SpectroCoin stealing user coins strewn across the internet... Dozens here, on Reddit, in blogs, review sites, Medium articles, etc. Here's just a few from http://bittrust.org/spectrocoin/:  Quote I wanted to participate in the Bankera ICO (which I now think is a scam), but thankfully due to Spectrocoin's absolutely pathetically slow and dysfunctional service, I am of the opinion that it is all a SCAM! After 2 months of waiting for them to respond to my queries, I am convinced that they are not legit. Their inefficiency saved me from wasting my money on something worthless. Bottom line: Stay far away!  Quote Too bad the reviews cannot go below one star, because they do not deserve even one star. Acquired some XEM (December 5, 2017) put them in my Sepctrocoin wallet, or so I thought. The coins were never received and it is impossible to get support from this company, not through requests for assistance, issuing tickets or calling them. Their addresses are fake, or at least show no existence of the company (check with Google streetview..). Ms Raminta promises help and then disappears from the face of the earth. IT IS A COMPLETE SCAM. They just take your money.  Quote Spectrocoin scam company rejecting withdrawals and KYC They target users with medium and large wallets, afterwards they restrict your account with KYC, that is impossible to pass. Used verification documents can be 100% valid and accepted by any other crypto wallet, but not them. You can will be asked to upload same documents again and again. STAY AWAY FROM SPECTROCOIN SCAM!  Quote I really can not stand seeing people suffer from these scammers. Spectrocoin is fraud. I did business with them last year. After the initial fee, they encourage me to invest more. At some point I tried to access my account, only to find out that I was suspended after I paid € 87,000. I tried very hard to address them, and I received no answer from them for weeks. As God wants, I met an old friend who was also the victim of cryptocurrency fraud, but by another broker. At that time he had his money back and he referred me to Swift Recovery EU (swiftrecovery.eu). I would like to believe that I am the luckiest person to live because I have been able to recover my € 87,000  Quote Well after reading some earlier dated reviews I still sent DASH to spectrocoin. After it not arriving in my wallet they have lead me to believe they have to do a manual transaction to process it and could take a week..so everything everyone is saying is completely true  Their coin looks like its on the road to nothingness.

Don't forget, Spectrocoin were genuine pioneers at a time when there were very few alternatives.  Back then other cryptos were sprouting like mushrooms and the dominance of Bitcoin seemed genuinely under threat. Real thieves and scammers were launching countless ICOs and forks. Regulators were getting ready to strike. Those were worrying times, maybe BTC itself could fail, and then what?  The obvious (to me at least) solution was to invest in a project that was a hedge against BTC failure. If people were foolish enough to decide that having a Swiss Bank in their pocket was a bad idea, or governments decided to think that for them, then a forward looking crypto-friendly bank such as Bankera might succeed. I might not like the situation but I was happy to take my cut of Weekly Revenue from them.  Of course Bitcoin didn't fail and the diversification into Bankera hasn't so far been a money maker, to put it mildly... But I didn't come here to shill for BNK, I came because I've had a lifelong hatred of thugs and bullies, and the lies and patently false accusations from people like mosprognoz, gorbal et al have to be refuted. All that's necessary for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing, and all that.  I'll check out some of the other scam accusations you've posted, but that's for another post.",False

They have already also done a not negligeable work in the wallet as per the last shared picture of the wallet, so I guess they have dedicated their ressources to the Wallet rather than the exchange.  I know we can desagree a lot about the exchange and how things went with but at this stage I think they will not change their mind about their priorities.  So hopefully we will see Cards coming back (As per their last update in official chat, these cards are being printed both for Bankera and Spectrocoin) I think exchange will be updated every time ""they have time and resources for it"" these are my opinions...",False

Trading volume is catastrophically low, 33 000 usd and that numbers are coming from IDEX, that is a scammy exchange with fake volumes. That means that the real volume is about 15 000. If you have BNK tokens worth even 2 000 USD you will wait more than a week or maybe more to sell them. https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bankera/ For any crypto trader it is clear that token will die very soon. You can continue posting some BS here, nothing will help. Vitautas Scamralevicius and his friends became a millionaires because of this scammy ICO. They bought an offshore bank in Vanuatu and transferred all stolen money there.  https://cryptonews.com/news/developer-of-blockchain-based-bank-acquired-bank-in-vanuatu-1096.htm  https://pacificprivatebank.com  Trust page of bankera. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=1101537  Profile of CEO.

There are, for example, plenty of accusations floating around that the moon landings were faked, the earth is flat, the Queen of England is an alien lizard, etc. Some people genuinely believe nonsense, and that's one of the things that makes life interesting, albeit infuriating, I'm sure you will agree. The problem comes when other people start to try and make mischief by furthering such nonsense for their own ends. That's reprehensible.  As an investor in Bankera I can only say that, if it is a scam, it's the strangest scam I've ever encountered. Two years after being given all that ICO money the founders continue to answer questions in chat.bankera.com; they continue to send money to every token holder every week and they insist on building products and releasing them. Why, indeed how, do they do those things if they have, as alleged here, no staff, no offices and no money left? Occam's razor is your guide here, the simplest explanation is the most likely to be correct. They do it because they do have staff, offices and money and are working on delivering Bankera as promised.",False

Compliance issues are common in all centralized brokerages and/or exchanges and any financial service provider. I don't know why the response was so late or whatever but I assume the funds were not locked on SpectroCoin and he has the option to withdraw his funds so they were not ""scammed"" rather there were restrictions maybe based on geolocation or whatever KYC/AML reason - this information is for sure internal and I do not have any source to such information to ask why the user KYC was rejected. It says compliance so it is safe to assume it is KYC/AML issue, yet again I he or she did not say that their funds is locked and cannot be withdrawn so...  3. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2605779.40.

He was marked red because of that first link because of users attacking him for money and his screenshots seem very valid.  5. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2302255.0. Seriously? This is nothing... Someone saying it is scam just because they had successful pre-ICO. They did not have any working product at that time.. how? what? why?.. it is obviously nothing to mention or comment on.  And the external links are answered in Scrooge message about the Lithuanian Central Bank watching Bankera and its sister companies closely and looking over their shoulders and the fact that they won a case against the Lithuanian Central Bank is great news and the article shows that they operate in compliance to all KYC/AML regulations in the EU.  [Edit]: ToWS is a Jr. Member  [Edit]: If we are to call every project a scam just because 0.0001% of actual people who have registered in it, then everything is a scam. Realistically, nothing is perfect and there always will be issues with users in any project big or small but that does not make it a scam. I use SpectroCoin since 2017 and for me it is all good and I know for certain a lot others also use it since 2013. If all users are losing their money, there won't be a project alive till this day. We see how hard they work to update their platform and phone apps to include more and more - those are not scam signs, those are business growing signs and willingness to provide more for their users.",False

Put them in here!! :-)   Here some questions from community:   Are we getting soon Fiat gate to crypto in exchange? We have been told cards are being printed and could be delivered before end of the year vould clarify which ones? The SC cards? Bankera ones? Or third provider? Why do we need SC cards and Bankera Cards? I mean why distinct? New cards will have same restrictions as linked cards? As for example I cannot use card with SC as linked card due to my nationality.. What about Pervesk is it going to offer more services than IBAN?    Here the answers from the CEO  Yes, we have it in plans, but I will not lie, we are not currently working for it, but that's in the horizon. SC cards will be by third party provider and yes they are in process of being printed, Bankera cards are also in process to be issued by Pervesk. Firstly, Bankera and SpectroCoin are distinct products due to regulator and clarity, SC will focus on crypto -> fiat link, while Bankera is on track to be a neobank, I believe once regulatory climate will change we will merge everything in one peace, but for now as we said, we see it as a puzzle. Secondly, we have distinct solutions to leverage the risk of one program being shut down or so, so we would be able to offer the service anyhow. Linked cards are provided by another third party and the limitation is due to their policies, this does not have impact for issued cards constrains (well, I will not lie, SC cards will be for EEA first, but that's why we are building our own infrastructure with Pervesk etc to outgrow these limitations). Pervesk will be offering cards both issuing of cards as well as letting to accept cards as payments, also it will offer other payments methods, it is an engine behind a number of features.

We have been told cards are being printed and could be delivered before end of the year vould clarify which ones? The SC cards? Bankera ones? Or third provider? Why do we need SC cards and Bankera Cards? I mean why distinct? New cards will have same restrictions as linked cards? As for example I cannot use card with SC as linked card due to my nationality.. What about Pervesk is it going to offer more services than IBAN?    Here the answers from the CEO  Yes, we have it in plans, but I will not lie, we are not currently working for it, but that's in the horizon. SC cards will be by third party provider and yes they are in process of being printed, Bankera cards are also in process to be issued by Pervesk. Firstly, Bankera and SpectroCoin are distinct products due to regulator and clarity, SC will focus on crypto -> fiat link, while Bankera is on track to be a neobank, I believe once regulatory climate will change we will merge everything in one peace, but for now as we said, we see it as a puzzle. Secondly, we have distinct solutions to leverage the risk of one program being shut down or so, so we would be able to offer the service anyhow. Linked cards are provided by another third party and the limitation is due to their policies, this does not have impact for issued cards constrains (well, I will not lie, SC cards will be for EEA first, but that's why we are building our own infrastructure with Pervesk etc to outgrow these limitations). Pervesk will be offering cards both issuing of cards as well as letting to accept cards as payments, also it will offer other payments methods, it is an engine behind a number of features.  Also here a summary of real Information for the Project:  Regarding all the story related to UAB Pervesk, Spectrocoin, Lithuanian Bank and FNTT, long story short:  1) Lithuanian Bank has checked UAB Pervesk (partnership with Bankera, belongs to the same owners, has an Electronic Mony license in Lithuania with a right to operate in all European Union Member States), FNTT  (lit. - Finansinių Nusikaltimų Tyrimo Tarnyba - special Lithuanian criminal investigation body for the investigation of the financial crimes and all related) also participated in this audit.  use google translate (Verslo Žinios in Lithuania is the same as Financial Times for the rest of the world - the most credible resource): https://www.vz.lt/rinkos/2018/09/21/mokejimu-istaigai-ir-jos-vadovui--12-mln-eur-baudu  2) all the story is about KYC regulations - Know Your Client it is connected to AML (Anti Money Laundering), policies the Finantial institutions (UAB Pervesk in this case) has to implement to prevent crimes, basically to collect a relevant data from your Clients related to the source of the money. This audit had nothing to do with a scam or something like that!!!!!  3) One more time - the story with fines and FNTT is only related to KYC procedures!! Only!!!  4) Vilnius regional administrative court has lifted All the fines from UAB Pervesk and it`s CEO!!  read an 12-06-2019 article about that in Verslo Žinios (google translate will help): https://www.vz.lt/rinkos/2019/06/12/teismas-panaikino-baudas-bankeros-ikurejui-ir-susijusiai-imonei  and our Lithuanian second biggest news website 15min: https://www.15min.lt/verslas/naujiena/bendroves/teismas-panaikino-pervesk-ir-jos-vadovui-skirtas-baudas-663-1158840   5) AND FINALLY - LITHUANIAN CENTRAL BANK HAS ANNOUNCED ITSELF THAT on 25-01-2019 IT HAS LIFTED ALL THE RESTRICTIONS AND UAB PERVESK HAS NO MORE KYC ISSUES!!!!

They recently launched the loans platform and the management confirmed that credit cards and Ibans will come back most likely by end of the year and also Bankera wallet will be released this year. So I will give them till end of this year and reevaluate the project then. As I mentioned earlier I hope by the end of the year we see ICO prices coming back.,False

I have also to admit that they have always been open for talking even if their answers were not satisfying, they always are available on their chat almost 24/24 7/7 Chat.Bankera.com, I don't know much of project where you can have them that available, and they are not some ""Mods"" subcontracted to manage some Telegram, no, they are the company employees so they care as we acre about the token, project and community  Ho long it can take? well who knows, Comlobus did not know how long it would take him to reach india, and he reached America, and People though mankind will land in Mars by late 70s and look... people though old keyboard phones will last longer and smartphone will take too much time to take market...and look now...

I too invested with the same hopes as you and have been similarly disappointed with the pace of the project. We investors face a stark choice, to sell now at a substantial loss or hodl and wait for the returns to improve in future. It's not a great position to be in, but it's one we share with so many people who invested in speculative projects at the height of the ICO boom. I've made my decision to hodl, and the absurd accusations, threats and general bullying from mosprognoz, gorbal (my spell checker insists on calling him gerbil) which have turned this thread into a cesspit lately have only strengthened my resolve. Never give in to bullies. And I hope you decide to stay with us too. It's been a long, dark night for BNK and Weekly Revenue, but things are always darkest just before dawn.",False

About the Audit, as we all have been showing and we have been checking they are under European regulation and they are subject to financial audits, internal and to institutions, now do they have any interest in sharing their financial schems? I also doubt, if you are new startup and you build your financial engineering schems to lower costs and pay less taxes, or use multi companies to be efficient, you don't want that know how to be released to public and especially to some people with much more money than you and who could copy your schems and kick you out of the business.  Hear me, I would love to know a lot of data, and been asking and harrasising Admins and CEO/CCEO to get some data about volumes in SC or any other valuable information, and they kept that unshared  What I can say is that I see them going further every month and I see they choose their strategy and stick to it, and hopefully this will be a good train  At the end remember it is a Startup with very high risk and very high reward that is a thing we knew when we got in, and the infiormation is only theirs this is also a point I knew when I got in as it was in the T&C",False

Well as Huup already said here the price is not the most important as it is an Utility token associated with a weekly revenue (even if laterly they are not paying on time however  due to the any services they are setting up and getting back ..they always pay the total of WRs)  So the way I see it is if the WR rises than there is a bigger incentive in holding more BNKs and for more time as the linger you hold your tokens the more tou accumukatr in WR which makes it a good  ROI  So as in stocks people will first look for shares with dividends... and in Crypto people will look for tokens with returns meanwhile they hold them. Now the WRcan go higher for several reasons....If Debit cards are again active before end of 2019  we could see a good return on WR which will attract people to buy at low level price we have now...just remember Spectrocoin had 65.000 debit cards before the issue with Visa with Crypto related cards...so I believe we could hit +90.000 debit cards this years if we get them back that will be a big shoot on revenue as Cards are laying fees for operations and everyday there are a millions of operations...after...the loans service is just starting now and they are holding Back promotion untill they make KYC easier and better once they start promoting this will also sum up to WR I don't know how much will cost a BNK at that time by I think we could get back to ICO price before even seeing bull market as  as a token it will be profitable and people would buy them ay the lowest price making their ROI the higher  Hope I could help ypu,False

I just figured that even if it went upto just 10 cent it would be a nice gain so invested. I was just curious on what I could realistically expect in the future is all. I invest in stocks and shares so I know that no one can ever predict prices. I was just looking for informed opinions on what the price could realistically be. I take any advice as just that and make my own final decision on what I do. All we can all do is go the knowledge that we have to make decisions and I strongly believe it getting as much information as you can. I have little knowledge of all things crypto if I am honest so appreciate you guys",False

We have been told cards are being printed and could be delivered before end of the year vould clarify which ones? The SC cards? Bankera ones? Or third provider? Why do we need SC cards and Bankera Cards? I mean why distinct? New cards will have same restrictions as linked cards? As for example I cannot use card with SC as linked card due to my nationality.. What about Pervesk is it going to offer more services than IBAN?    Here the answers from the CEO  Yes, we have it in plans, but I will not lie, we are not currently working for it, but that's in the horizon. SC cards will be by third party provider and yes they are in process of being printed, Bankera cards are also in process to be issued by Pervesk. Firstly, Bankera and SpectroCoin are distinct products due to regulator and clarity, SC will focus on crypto -> fiat link, while Bankera is on track to be a neobank, I believe once regulatory climate will change we will merge everything in one peace, but for now as we said, we see it as a puzzle. Secondly, we have distinct solutions to leverage the risk of one program being shut down or so, so we would be able to offer the service anyhow. Linked cards are provided by another third party and the limitation is due to their policies, this does not have impact for issued cards constrains (well, I will not lie, SC cards will be for EEA first, but that's why we are building our own infrastructure with Pervesk etc to outgrow these limitations). Pervesk will be offering cards both issuing of cards as well as letting to accept cards as payments, also it will offer other payments methods, it is an engine behind a number of features.",False

What about Pervesk is it going to offer more services than IBAN?    Here the answers from the CEO  Yes, we have it in plans, but I will not lie, we are not currently working for it, but that's in the horizon. SC cards will be by third party provider and yes they are in process of being printed, Bankera cards are also in process to be issued by Pervesk. Firstly, Bankera and SpectroCoin are distinct products due to regulator and clarity, SC will focus on crypto -> fiat link, while Bankera is on track to be a neobank, I believe once regulatory climate will change we will merge everything in one peace, but for now as we said, we see it as a puzzle. Secondly, we have distinct solutions to leverage the risk of one program being shut down or so, so we would be able to offer the service anyhow. Linked cards are provided by another third party and the limitation is due to their policies, this does not have impact for issued cards constrains (well, I will not lie, SC cards will be for EEA first, but that's why we are building our own infrastructure with Pervesk etc to outgrow these limitations).

First of all that the token price is down doesn’t mean the project is a scam. Many Altcoins are down at the moment. Bankera‘s ICO was on the top of the end 2017 hype and got hit by the bear market following the hype. The volumes are low but should increase with the loans taking off and other products being released. The token price as of yet is pretty attractive as you can get quite a decent WR considering the low token price. Also there is a huge upward potential. Bankera is a long term project and not a hype or pump and dump project. So I think listing in Binance just for a little price pump doesn’t fit into the strategy.,False

The return on BNK bought at ICO is shockingly low, that's undeniable. But I am thinking about buying at today's price, which is much lower. In that case the WR would be quite reasonable. Further I can see a large potential upswing as new products get rolled out.  Now can you answer my question? If there are no staff or offices, where does the WR come from?  Your analysis of the exchange is unsound. It's like saying the motor in my car hasn't run for over a month therefore it can't run ever again. Obviously the exchange works, we can all use it, so it isn't dead and the question of resurrection doesn't arise. If people start to use it the volume will increase. So, again, I ask, if there are no staff, who wrote the exchange?  Anyway, thank you for your reply, ToWS",False

Who do you think is making these responses? 3) In the past few months Bankera have produced a crypto exchange and launched a crypto loans platform.

You are just coming up with the same unproven accusations.  Regarding the 100m raised: You don't really believe that a sheer amount of money means that R&D happens in a super fast speed? Some processes (like obtaining licenses and permissions) can't be accelerated through money. Same applies to many other things. In todays market it is not easy to find qualified developers. Especially not in the hyped and quite new blockchain space. And even if you find some good developers, you need to integrate them into your team, train them, etc.  It is good that they are keeping the money together and additionally they need the funds for their loans service. We must consider that Bankera is a relatively new player and it will take some time till they have an ecosystem up and running. We have to see that they are operating in a space becoming more and more regulated (Banking & Blockchain combined) that can also slow things down. Nevertheless I must admit that I would wish them to be faster too.",False

I am tired to see people here harming the great project with no arguments. I have posted this info a while ago here (check my previous posts). Bankera is operating through a different legal entities (a common practice worldwide, different jurisdictions, purposes, diversification and etc.). One of them is Spectrocoin, so:  1) Spectrocoin is registered in the Lithuanian Registry of Legal entities : UAB „Spectro finance“ (they have been established in 25-02-2013 (sorry, second link in Lithuanian, „įregistruoti“ - to register) https://www.registrucentras.lt/jar/p_en/index.php?pav=Spectro&p=1 https://www.registrucentras.lt/jar/p_en/dok.php?kod=303008845&pav=%2A&p=2  2) They are licensed by the Lithuanian Bank!!! I mean the Central bank which belongs to the Government, it is a governmental body to supervise financial market and it`s participants and you don`t want to do anything wrong to mess with these guys!! F*ck, Lithuania is a European Union member since 2004 and our central bank is supervised by the European Central Bank. Please fallow the link below, go to the official Lithuanian Bank`s website and find out, that Spectro finance has a licence to provide financial services:  https://www.lb.lt/en/sfi-financial-market-participants/uab-spectro-finance  Please pay attention to the company code 303008845, this is the same as in the section 1 of this post.  3) We can check public info from the Lithuanian Social Insurance Fund, how many employees has Spectro finance and how they are paying taxes. At the moment they have 37 insured persons (employees) and 0.00 EUR social insurance debt (payed every month in LT). Sorry, only in Lithuanian, but it is easy to check, go to https://draudejai.sodra.lt/draudeju_viesi_duomenys/ In a section „Noriu peržiūrėti šią draudėjo informaciją:“ check all three sections. Below in a graph „Juridinio asmens codas“ (company code), enter Spectro finance`s company code: 303008845, and in the graph „Kontroliniai simboliai“ put in the captcha. Finally press „Ieškoti“ (Search). There you will see „Apdraustųjų asmenų2 skaičius“ which means „Number of the insured persons“ - 37. Use a google translate if you want  UAB „Spectro finance“ is only one legal entity of the Bankera ecosystem. This is the way how grownups are doing the search. In your face HATERS!

Now you are not anymore interested in Spectrocoin? Spectrocoin is registered in a EU member state and supervised by the Central Bank of Lithuania. This shows that they are a regulated and legit business.   Sure... Bankera exchange 24 Hour volume = $24 https://cmc.io/exchanges/bankera  Bankera exchange is an additional product that was not in the original whitepaper. Still they are on track delivering everything from the whitepaper in time. So the exchange is additional product with additional income. I agree that it is a basic product now but being improved steadily.   Another LIE ! There are no cards. Post the link to the source where you are offering cards. Confirmation from receivers will be needed.  It was written that cards are comming back. How can that be a lie? There are no cards yet. So it would only be a lie if they were saying cards are here but they wouldn't be there. This is not the case.    Nobody is using them... Post statistic with proofs (TXID'S)  Are you proofing anything you claim? Why shouldn't nobody use it? They have extremely competitve interest rate (6% when paying with BNK token).    LIE again... There is no SINGLE office of bankera anywhere... Please post at least one address.  Who is lying here? Offices can be seen in this lithuanian TV documentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8KS-F4Z7eE&t=623s     There is no single review of bankera on known youtube channels. Post the link to at least one review.  Again it seems you are not reading thoroughly enough. It was said there is an interview with a Youtuber coming. So it is not here as of yet.     Shop of souvenirs ?  Again offices can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8KS-F4Z7eE&t=623s and here (from NEM foundation president): https://twitter.com/2017lon/status/908334221013471232 And of course Lithuanian Central Bank is overseeing a regulated souvenir shop...

There are many negative reviews about the team and the project as a whole. (accusations of misappropriation of funds from the ICO, and pseudo activities). These people can be understood. Much counted on a more rapid and effective development of the project. Especially if it's investors. However, we can see some development (I also want it to be faster). And there is no strong evidence of the misappropriation of the ICO funds by the team. Those funds that have not yet been spent are still needed by the project for further development.

I would consider taking legal actions against you. Regarding the reporting: Wasn't it you who claimed that he reported Bankera to Interpol? Any reply? They are operating under regulation of the EU - if just 1% of what you are claiming were true the authorities would be shutting them down. So far that has not happened. Spectrocoin is operating for several years now and Bankera is up and running since 2017. But why not reporting them to FBI, CIA, Europol, Interpol, SEC, ...

There are two types of payments that have to be made to service the loan:  1. Interest payments. Starting a month after you take a loan they are debited automatically every month from your Bankera Loans wallet on the same day when the loan was issued (or on the last day of the month if the month does not have enough days) at 00:00 UTC. Interest payments are debited from the assets you keep in your wallet on Bankera Loans. If you have enough assets in your BNK wallet, the interest payment will be charged from there, and a lower interest rate will be applied. If you do not have enough assets in your BNK wallet, the interest payment will be charged from your other wallets, granted you have enough assets there. If there are not enough assets in the mentioned wallets, the interest amount will be added to your loan.  2. Loan principal repayments. You can repay the loan by logging in to your account, going to your loan page and clicking the repay the loan section. You can repay it in EUR, BNK, USDT, BTC, ETH, XEM, and DASH. There is no minimum repayment or a loan schedule. Ensure that the loan is repaid before the loan maturity date, otherwise, we will extend the loan for a year, but at a higher interest rate.

It is very rare that a court will issue an order of only restitution in a securities fraud case.  Probation –   A defendant may be sentenced to probation if there was only a single act of fraud committed and no financial loss. The typical probation time for securities fraud is 15 years. The defendant will have to adhere to specific conditions of probation such as submit to drug tests, not commit any other crimes, paying fines or restitution, or any other condition he court sees fit.

In the short term, SpectroCoin is being developed as a link between crypto-currency and traditional money, and Bankera as a neobank, ”he said. There are several other companies related to V. Karalevičius in Lithuania. Bankera (Bankera Center of Technology (incorporated in Lithuania) is presented as a technology center. Shareholders of the company are V. Karalevičius, M. Mockevičius and J. Dobiliauskas. According to Sodra, it employs 15 people. Another company is Pervesk, which is managed by the same J. Dobiliauskas, V. Karalevičius and M. Mockevičius through another company Obolis. Pervesk employs 11 people.  An event related to the company Pervesk, about which V. Karalevičius did not want to speak more widely. In September 2018, it was reported that the Bank of Lithuania had fined 0.7 million for violations of money laundering prevention. EUR 5 million and V. Karalevičius himself - EUR 0.5 million. EUR 1 million in fines. ""The survey revealed that the company neglected the risk of its clients: there were no adequate internal risk management rules and other documents, and in most cases the customer information that was collected was incomplete and did not disclose the nature of the transactions. The company did not fully understand the origins of the assets and assets of its clients, most of whom carried out operations with virtual assets, and its internal investigations were, in most cases, superficial and formal, 'the central bank said. Interview DELFI V. Karalevičius pointed out that the fines imposed on him and the company have not come into force and have been appealed in court. ""I don't want to comment on this at this time,"" he said.  V. Karalevičius did not agree to disclose who is the owner of Finalify Ltd, a company registered in the Virgin Islands, which operated Bankeras ICO. ""It's confidential,"" he replied. However, DELFI has tried to find out who owns Finalify Ltd in this jurisdiction register. We've been able to get a statement of the company's position, address, contacts, and list of documents submitted to the Registry. One of them is the register of members and directors, but it is private, so it is impossible to find out the owners of Finalify Ltd. V. Karalevičius said that the Virgin Islands is one of the most popular jurisdictions for this type of project because of its clear, stable regulation in English and is recognized globally. The interlocutor pointed out that in other countries the Bankeros Crypto Currency Exchange is already in operation, and then it is planned to offer loan and deposit services. Interestingly, the website bankera.com is not available in Lithuania. Bankera.lt is currently being developed. V. Karalevičius explained that this is due to unclear regulation. “We are waiting for the Ministry of Finance to submit to the Seimas a supplement to the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act, which will take into account the 5th European Union Directive. Interpretations should end, ""he said.  As part of the ICO, Bankera introduced its white paper. It describes project goals, implementation plan, team, etc. One of the ambitions identified in the document is to obtain a bank license in the European Union by the end of 2019. V. Karalevičius indicated that this has not been done yet, but is consistently pursued. “We are considering several countries, we are also discussing partnerships with existing banks. Now we have a team that works with processes every day to get to it. We are developing products that will be financing to be the base and a real business model when we take the next step toward the bank, ”he said. However, he acknowledged that the EU would probably fail before the end of this year. It is also promised that in the long run, Bankera will be licensed in the UK, Japan, and Singapore. V. Karalevičius said that in some of these jurisdictions the project is moving even faster than in Lithuania.  ""There we have people who work, communication with the environment,"" he said. ""We go to those jurisdictions where the potential is greatest."" The White Paper further states that Bankera will have 200 employees in its first year of operation, with a figure of up to 2,000 over a decade. V. Karalevičius said that currently more than 120 people work in the group's ecosystem. Recently it has been announced that at least 50 more specialists will be hired in Vilnius and Kaunas in the near future. Previously, a banker plan was found on the Bankeras page, which indicates that loan and deposit services will be launched in 2019. V. Karalevičius said that at the moment the product is in the testing stage and the market should be launched in July. He also stressed that Lithuanian residents will not have access to loans and deposits.  ""Maybe later, we have such a dream. The majority of the world's population will be accessible. The world is big, Lithuania is small. You will not be a prophet in your country. Very sad, but basically that is the case. It would be much easier for us to provide services in Lithuania, so our competitors are doing the same thing and doing things well for them. Not giving you services in Lithuania is basically more complicated, even bigger costs, because you have a lot to think about how to do it, but that is life ”, - said V. Karalevičius. Divorced attitudes with advisers in Bankeros team are well-known names in public space. For example, former head of Šiaulių bankas Audrius Žiugžda, according to V. Karalevičius, works as a counselor. ""It is a man who has been working in the banking sector for a lifetime and the amount of knowledge there is, comparatively, inhuman,"" said V. Karalevičius. Previously, Bankeros team member Antanas Guoga, former head of the State Tax Inspectorate, Modestas Kaseliauskas, was also a member of the Bank. ""A. Guoga was actually near our business since 2015. He helped with the ICO project, his marketing, advertising. The role of M. Kaseliauskas during the ICO was counseling - an idea more "", said V. Karalevičius. He noted that the author of the Bankeras idea was neither Guoga nor Kaseliauskas. ""In the long run, when our differences in attitudes and priorities have come to light, our paths have separated with them,"" said V. Karalevičius.  In early 2018, Bankera was announced to acquire Pacific Private Bank, a bank based in Vanuatu, a Pacific island country. At first glance the exotic purchase, according to V. Karalevičius, was well known. ""It was the purchase of technology, teams and knowledge for the development of traditional finance. We knew the people who worked there, our peers, classmates. They are now working in Vanuatu. There are five Lithuanians at the moment, ”said the interlocutor. He said Pacific Private Bank now has about 10 employees. It is a small bank offering traditional banking services (loans, deposits) in the Pacific region. Mostly working with wealthy people. ""It was a good option in good time. Like with any items that are sold. For example, when an apartment is needed, it is not, and when it is, it may not be necessary. At that time, both the need and the fact of the sale coincided, ”V. Karalevičius explained. He added that at the moment Vanuatu Bank and Bankera are not being merged. ""Other things are business secrets,"" said V. Karalevičius. The previously announced plan also referred to the fact that Bankera will in the future offer investment solutions - index-linked funds, cryptographic mechanisms, and ""new types of money"".  V. Karalevičius said that these subjects were related to his doctoral topics. ""One of my research papers is about the influence of the media - how positive or negative news changes the price of bitcoin. There are still titers, forum posts, etc. That idea comes from the investment world, when scientific work appreciates how share prices change when positive or negative news is publicized. Our other direction, such a signpost, is the separation of money. Money is basically three things: custody, exchange and accounting. It has been a very long time, but we are moving towards these three values being distinguished. A payment channel can be something very innovative, cryptographic currencies can improve, payments can be made as easily as we send e-mail. email.  Technology is rapidly evolving and products that allow you to invest very smoothly and very quickly in real time. In fact, they give you the opportunity to keep your balance on your bank account at all times, with a deposit or other fund. And the unit of account is important as long as we have agreed, so it is good. Whether it is the euro or the dollar, it is good for everyone, ”said V. Karalevičius. The interlocutor explained that the biggest problem with money is the state monopoly. “Therefore, there is no competition, no incentive to create newer forms of money. Innovations in money are not there, because there is no motive, we do not think they can be better. But then there are crypto cards as an alternative to payments. Technologies appear that allow you to keep your savings in the form of a cash deposit. I think we're moving towards that, ”he said.  ....

I have held BNK since ICO but decided to cash out and invest elsewhere. I held my BNK with SPECTROCOIN. Last night  i exchanged my BNK for Bitcoin. 261,000 at a value of $0.001944 per BNK total vale of £507. When i exchanged for Bitcoin the value of Bitcoin i Received was $312. AN EXCHANGE RATE OF ALMOST 40%. i Contacted Spectrocoin. Their first response was you didn't have to take the trade if you thought the price to high. Trust me its always to high. I have looked to exchange several times over the past months. Imagine BNK going to the moon, its now worth $1.35 my 261,000  BNK are worth £217,350 I want to cash out and its going to cost me 40% nearly $87,000 to do so. The most disappointing thing is  Spectrocoin are meant to be promoting use of BNK. Below is a transcript of my conversation with Spectro coin and a copy of the transaction in closing spectro coin highlight the volatility of the market, this transaction took just over 3 minutes, check the volatility of the BNK and BITCOIN markets between those times i think you will be shocked.

Caroline (Sat, 5/18/2019, 10:50:16 pm) Please be kindly advised SpectroCoin always monitors the market situation and the final price is suggested accordingly. As a brokerage, we do offer the best possible price considering the circumstances.  It is also worth mentioning that the price could be checked in the exchange section. After the final price is offered, a client has the right either to confirm the exchange or to cancel it. Hence, the client might cancel the process if recognizes the price as too high.  Paul Read Read (Sat, 5/18/2019, 10:52:14 pm) please read the question i am requesting under GDR data protection the breakdown of how the transaction was calculated and what fees were charged  Caroline (Sat, 5/18/2019, 10:52:52 pm) Please be kindly informed that there is no fee for currency exchange. Exchange rate is established by SpectroCoin, therefore, our final suggested price visible in the exchange section may differ from the average market price at a particular moment. The exchange rate difference depends on the market price of a cryptocurrency in addition to the volatility of that price. At SpectroCoin, we aim to provide the most convenient way to buy and sell cryptocurrencies instantly at the best possible price of a current moment.

However, the client might cancel the process if recognizes the price as too high.  Paul Read Read (Sat, 5/18/2019, 10:57:35 pm) You do not offer the best price you have just charged 40% on a single transaction i repeat i would like a full breakdown of how this transaction was conducted.

Spectrocoin isn’t an exchange. They are a market maker. My suggestion is to google “market maker”. It’s like a whole sales for crypto. So you are always better off using an exchange. The downside to using an exchange is that you have to wait till someone buys your sell order. The upside of selling it to an market maker is that you can make the deal instantly, but the downside to that is that you get a much lower price. This confusion exchange vs broker isn’t always clear but that is the reason why you would pay a higher price when buying thru spectrocoin or get a lower price when selling thru spectrocoin.

More than 100,000 participants took part in the original bid of the crypto office. But they do not know who owns the Finalify Ltd, a company registered in the Virgin Islands. The head of Bankera talks about jobs created in Lithuania and his duty to his homeland, but soon he adds that there will be no prophet in his own country. There are more interesting things to do with the neobank, including the exotic shopping in the Pacific, and the exotic politician Antanas Guoga, who has already retired from the project, and the futuristic sound of ""new money"". At the end of 2017 - at the beginning of 2018, the initial coin offering (ICO) of Bankera was named the largest in Lithuania's history and one of the largest in the world. It has a total sales of $ 10 billion. over $ 7.7 billion. The unsold part is assigned to ICO participants with BNK tokens, counting the additional amount according to the proportional formula. Interview DELFI V. Karalevičius said that Bankeras ICO had participated in over 100 thousand individuals. The value of the tokens sold is estimated to be over $ 100 million. USD. ""We've released a very small part,"" he said. - The funds are used to develop new financial services and other Bankera related products. They are also designed to be used in loan portfolios, to develop other financial products that enable users to use both conventional and cryptographic. ”  The interlocutor explained that his team's goal is to combine the worlds of cryptovites and traditional finance. “In the first phase, these products and services will only be offered to foreign markets, giving priority to those countries that have established clear and stable market regulation rules for cryptographic companies. In the future, as the regulation goes ahead, it is planned to offer some of the services and products to the Lithuanian market, having prepared and received the appropriate permits, ”said V. Karalevičius.  V. Karalevičius explained that all participants of Bankeras ICO had to confirm their identity. ""We know who these people are,"" he said. According to him, unlike some other ICO projects, Bankera does not have large investors. “There are bigger ones who bought tokens for 5,000. ""There are people who are very small,"" he said. V. Karalevičius taught that the purpose of their ICO was not only the funds but also the creation of the community. “The value is not only in the money itself, but also in marketing, because there are people who help, are interested, give insight into what you are doing wrong, what is good. They are the first users to believe in you. Some of them knew us before, because we were our customers, knew how we were working, what services we provided, what we were able to do, ”he said.  V. Karalevičius can be called a cryptovist veteran. In 2013, together with his partners Justu Dobiliauskas and Mantas Mockevičius, he established a virtual currency exchange company SpectroCoin. Later, the company offered a virtual currency purse, a crypto payment collection service, and finally a payment card that could be added to bitcoins.  As noted in the SpectroCoin website, its business development is carried out by Spectro Finance Ltd, registered in the United Kingdom. According to Companies House, this company is managed by V. Karalevičius, M. Mockevičius and another corporation, Corporo Limited. SpectroCoin products are created by Spectro Finance, a Lithuanian company. According to the data of the Center of Registers, its shareholders are Ugnius Šimelionis, J. Dobiliauskas, V. Karalevičius and M. Mockevičius. According to Sodra, Spectro Finance had 38 employees on May 13th.  ""After reaching our original goals with SpectroCoin, we applied the payment institution license in Lithuania in 2016 so that we could expand our business by offering and regulating services. In 2017, we received a license from a payment institution, we searched for a name for our neobank and we invented Bankera, - said V. Karalevičius. He taught that in the summer of 2017 he was in a situation where he had a profitable product with nearly 300,000. registered users, a team of 40 people and a clear vision.  “However, ICO projects have started to come on the market, and many of them have had an idea similar to ours, but with no product they collected tens of millions of euros. And we realize that we will have to compete with them in a dilemma: either we do ICOs, or we run the risk of closing down in the long run, because it would be difficult to compete with a few times better-funded competitors, ”he explained.

Please give the Central Bank of Lithuania some credit.  Bankera would have been suspended or brought to justice if there was any wrongdoing.

They have probably negotiated a mutually acceptable deal where they can cooperate.  You would not get this with the larger exchanges, who do not value the business.   In any case, and this is probably the most important point, this exchange is not only a South Korean exchange, but it is one of a very small handful that is approved by the South Korean government.

You're saying that Bankera is illegal, yet it operates under the very close supervision of the central bank of Lithuania and in compliance with international AML and KYC regulations  Regardless of what are the best coins. Our project is working as per our white paper. We had delays with the launch of our exchange, but it is live now. A ""scam"" would not bother to launch the exchange and update it on two different iterations in less than two months and list a new token to help increase the demand on it while working on more features including but not limited to our exchange. We have run into some obstacles in regards to some other features that should be up and running since some time ago, but that doesn't mean we are not working on them. They will be coming no matter what the costs are (including the cost of time). In a magical world, we could have fixed everything in one day or month, but in real life, cryptocurrency is a field that is being constantly regulated in many different areas and we need to comply with everything in order to be legal and not a 'scam'.

SpectroCoin is a brokerage and NOT an exchange. It provides a vast array of options to deal with your cryptocurrencies, API for merchants, phone application for the most major mobile operating systems with a very simple and easy user-interface and 24/7 support among other things and is constantly upgraded to include the latest. 2. Bankera as a project is not JUST an exchange platform. Our sole purpose is to provide a blokchain-banking experience and that is not yet fully developed. If you are judging an incomplete project, feel free to reflect, but just don't mislead others by comparing Bankera to fully developed projects. There is constant work put to achieving the vision of Bankera and that work has not stopped. Therefore, the word scam is no longer anywhere appropriate to use since we are providing services with online support via all of our communications channels and introducing new updates to our products and including new features while working on others.  We appreciate constructive feedback and always report our community's feedback to the management and the most appropriate action at a time is done. There are main goals to be accomplished - developing everything from scratch takes time while assuring the functionalities work properly. If you have suggestions to us, please feel free to directly contact us by any mean available to you. If you are wondering what is coming next, you can find our past blog posts indicating what we are working on.

I don't want them to list on other exchanges. Tell me on how many exchanges is Kucoin or Binance listed? It would make no sense to list an exchange token on a different exchange. Just imagine the manipulation you are subjected to when you list at your competitor. This constant complaining we aren't listed at Binance makes you wonder if any of you ever thought about the complications?!  then there is that security thingy. You know where you can sell you BNB when Binance ever would been hacked for BNB's? Yes right at binance. That would be rather stupid right hacking a exchange for coins which you can only exchange at that exchange. So for me please also get delisted from HitBTC this makes BNK a worthless to hack coin on the exchange.  Then maybe in december 2017 when you got listed on binance you would see a rise in price. But these times are gone. Listing at binance will bring us: NOTHING! it will bring us completly: NOTHING. This isn't december 2017 anymore.... Don't try to make a hype coin out of this! we are a long term project which is heading for stability and trust.,False

I've been following Bankera since the Pre ICO and invested heavily. Now I totally get what Bankera is trying to do and I think it's brilliant but the existing products are lacking a bit. Especially their BNK token. The idea that their smart contract was developed to bring ease of access to shared revenues from their other services is great. But the fact is the inconsistency of these payouts brings a lot of doubt to the project in my mind.  What's the issue? A properly ran bank, (I hate banks by the way) should be able to set up foundational attributes such as this. The manual ""push"" to move funds from Bankera to token holders is a big issue for me.    I should end this by saying that I still believe in this project and will not be selling my BNK. This is definitely a HODL imo.  Not only here in Bankera land, but the crypto community as a whole has a huge problem calling legit project scams. If it doesn't make you a billionaire overnight, SCAM.  If the dev team is quiet for a couple days, SCAM.  I think it boils down to people not understanding how business dev happens, lack of technological understanding and the current cultural problem of instant gratifications.  I think the community as a whole should focus on this before fracturing and claiming everything a person doesn't like is a scam.  I look forward to seeing what happens next in this space.  gumshed",False

Given the present situation and the info from Tadas interview https://youtu.be/vz6rXPRHONo  1. As I understand you were planing to launch Bankera wallets and exchange at the same time, but because you are following the strict financial regulations some bureaucratic questions arose and you had to postpone the launch of wallets (but you could not postpone the launch of the exchange). This has greatly complicated your launch plans. So basically you have everything in place for the Bankera wallets and you are just waiting for the bureaucratic questions to be solved? 2. The whole point of the BNK is to distribute the WR and to trade it for free on the Exchange. So why there are no BNK/XEM and BNK/DASH pairs? At the present time this would have been the only one small thing that the other exchanges do not have. The idea is to trade BNK pairs for free and you have launched the Exchange with coins who have no BNK pair! 3. What in the world stops you from paying WR on time? The only right way to do it is to every time pay WR on the same day of the week: tuesday, thursday it does not matter, but on the same day! I can not see any excuses here.

Here is link to it: https://we.tl/t-VLoN7LjZ62  From the roadmap we can see that Bankera (not partner companies) should do following: ""Mid-2018 Establishing EU regulated bank"".  Section 1, intro  ""We encourage supporters to try Bankera’s services before participating in the ICO.""  Section 5, about banking  "" Licensing is one of the key assets of financial institutions. Currently, Bankera’s management team has obtained a payment institution’s (PI) license and is authorised to operate in all European Economic Area (EEA) regions. Bankera expects to obtain an electronic money institution (EMI) license before the ICO, to have a solid foundation in place to provide the planned services except accepting deposits and offering investment products, which will come later.""  Section 9, timeline  "" In terms of revenue streams, Bankera will initially focus on core banking activities such as lending and payment processing, following the establishment of an EU banking license. The next product option that Bankera will introduce will be low-cost investment options for clients via EFTs. Eventually, the bank will offer a full range of investment services including trading, custody and investment banking services for its clients. Bankera will also offer robo-advisory based wealth management services for its clients.""  "" The preliminary timeline is: pre-ICO by the end of August, the launch of the minimum viable product with working IBAN and payment cards support by mid-October, a start of ICO preparations by late September, the end of ICO by the beginning of November. Bankera will offer advanced payment processing solution by summer 2018. Applying for a banking license by autumn 2018. Getting banking license in EU by late 2019. Starting deposit and lending business by mid-2019 (initially from Bankera’s capital).""

It's been clearly said that Bankera will apply for banking license.  Now we can confront original Whitepaper with current one and statements from Bankera project.  Solution to get all clarified might be face to face meeting with board. ICO is form of investing, so investors meetup is nothing unusual. That way we could confront board with facts and see what they say.  Suggestion to Bankera  Because lot of promises has not been met as well as you not providing proper feedback and banning people asking right questions you should consider buy-back program, where you buy back tokens from ICO investors paying ICO price. We bought into different idea and project, described in original whitepaper and it doesn't seem it is being delivered as per original promise which made us invest. Oterwise, it might turn into official legal battle. Not sure if people you mentioned in Whitepaper (EU officials) are willing to be involved in this type of ""business"". Basically we invested in Bankera as product and future company and now money is being distributed amongst child companies which, I would assume, are not even own by Bankera, just by same people running those project/companies separately.  PS. I did try Bankera services, as advised in intro. Had virtual credit card, then Bankera (SpectroCoin in fact) cancelled it because WavesCrest cancelled agreement with them. Support said that in 2-3 months I will get new virtual CC, once they will have partnership with new card issues. That was about 6-7 months ago and of course as we can imagine, replacement card never showed up.",False

The problem lies in the fact that they are moving away further and further from the original plan. The plan was to make a crypto bank! BANKERA not EXCHANGERA If you have read everything correctly i have asked multiple times if and when they applied for a banking license.  The answer to that was: that it would be a waiste of time and resrouces to go and get a banking license because Pervesk already has one. Next to that we always have been told that pervesk was part of the whole ""eco-system"", but yesterday they told us there will be no wr from Pervesk.  So to keep it simpel. The revenue which should make our wr is now done by a sister company which they can let charge every price as they are the owners and whatver goos into Pervesk they don't have to share with you and me. And for Bankera there will be no banking license what was the idea what attracted me to the project.",False

The rest is waiting for the project to evolve. That's is something i was waiting on also and i was a big supporter. But as it turns apart from the exchange which they are supposedly building there is nothing really done for the bankera project. The exchange was never in the original whitepaper and all the things they did promise in the whitepaper are done by companies which aren't bankera. They promise those companies will al be part of the ""eco-system"" but after a year we don't receive any wr from any of those.  In the meanwhile the cards are out, the IBAN isn't working anymore, CMC situation isn't resolved, the new website has many shortcommings and they are receiving fines by the authorities. And if one asks hard questions about in on their chat or reddit. the posts get deleted or the people get banned or muted.

It was its first inspection and it happened only 6 months after Pervesk was granted with an Electronic Money Institution License. As a start-up, Pervesk began with a small team and focused on growing into a sustainable business. Nevertheless, balancing business growth and compliance is a complicated task even for large companies.  As soon as Pervesk was made aware of the shortcomings of its AML procedures and policies, it halted the expansion of its business operations and shifted its attention to compliance in order to ensure that all requirements would be met. This involved significantly expanding its Compliance division which included hiring professionals with ACAMS certifications and experience working at the Central Bank, as well as adjusting internal policies and streamlining procedures. Even though the conduct of AML requirements had been overhauled and we consider it fixed, Pervesk was given a  significant fine.  We have unfortunately learned the hard way that the guidance and mentoring a young company - on its first year of operation, expects to receive from regulatory institutions was not offered as promised. We were particularly surprised by the Bank’s decision, which did not take into account the company’ size, young age, the effort put towards fixing imperfections and the fact that there were no actual money laundering or terrorist financing instances found within Pervesk operations.  Pervesk is fully committed to adhering to regulations, therefore we believe that almost all shortcomings have been fixed. We would like to ensure our clients that we will not give up and we continue to move forward with our daily operations.",False

Everyone is responsible of their own actions and investments, investing in ICO is speculation and GAMBLE. When i see people like you calling scam or saying they got robbed, i can only determine how new you are to the cryptocurrencies world. Act like men, be responsible, and have some common sense.  When investing into ICO's, you must keep in mind you are giving your money to some people who have a project. A project means nothing exists yet, and all is to come. In other words you are speculating, and investing into nothing existing. This is why ICO's must be seen as a long term project. Promising or not.  Knowing this, you must understand that you may lose your money if the project does not work, this is the reason you must NOT invest into ico's bigger amounts than you can afford to lose. Bankera's not delivering what we were expecting, but they are still giving weekly payouts, and the coin has some nice ups and downs on Hitbtc, which gave me many opportunities to buy / sell. You must also remember that the coin was released at a higher price than the highest price of the ico, it means you could sell your coins the day it appeared on Hitbtc, and not lose anything.  Cryptocurrency's world is not for weak minds, nobody has been forced to invest into this project, and we only can blame ourselves for losing money (or not). Be men.",False

The rapport even claims that many projects have used the funds to maintain their token value, instead of developing the projects. Initial Coin Offerings is a subject that has been caught in a storm. Some places, like Jeju Island, wants to become an ICO-friendly blockchain hub while others, like South Korea, have banned ICOs altogether. However, they are looking at lifting the ICO ban. Then there has been a lot of fraud and scams circulating cryptocurrencies, and two weeks ago, news stated that an ICO fraudster got a lifetime trading ban as well as a $30,000 fine. SEC issued the fine to the CEO of Tomahawk Exploration LLC, who used an ICO format to raising money from investors to open up to ten new drilling wells. New research from BlockBeats, now states that most of the ICOs listed on big exchanges in Asia, such as Huobi, Binance, Kucoin, and OKEx, ended up trading below their token sale price with only a few exceptions. According to the report, 98,8% of 264 tokens researchers looked at were trading below their ICO prices as of August 21. The only ones that were able to keep their value or appreciate in value were stable coins and three other coins. “As of the market price on August 21, the breaking rate of these 264 SGD projects was 98.8 %, and only three projects have risen. Among them, the biggest decline was WBTC, whose price was 4.03 yuan, and now quoted at 0.0056 yuan, a decrease of 99.86 %, followed by WFEE, the price of the currency is 1.08 yuan, and the current price is 0.0035 yuan, a decrease of 99.68%”. Most of the projects fell below their ICO issue price within a few months after the currency was settled, and the currency decline price range was mainly concentrated between 70 – 98% – which can be seen as an air currency. 96 projects have fallen more than 90% of the price. Blockchain investment is now in a bear market, and a large number of break-through projects can smother investors with poor overall market performance, but they ignore the value of a project depending on whether the project team is creating value. It is very important to do your due diligence before investing in an ICO – especially since most of them fail.  It is very interesting to look at the Dot-com bubble and compare it with cryptocurrencies.  On November 9th, the year 2000, the Dot-com bubble popped. The article states that it was hard to think of companies that were not down 75%. “Of the 280 stocks in the index, 79 are down 90 percent or more from their 52-week high. Another 72 are down 80-89 percent. Only five are down less than 5 percent”.  What we should remember is that many companies came out of the bubble and grew like never before. According to tradingview.com, Amazon is a company who at the bottom of the bubble crashed from $113 to $5.  We all know that it is now trading at $1,927. The cryptos that survive this winter could potentially see similar growth.",False

Nothing good turned up. This is how they made headlines a couple of weeks ago:  Posted: Aug. 3, 2018 7:00 am Updated: Aug. 3, 2018 1:22 pm  NEW YORK (AP) — Federal authorities looking into the illegal sale of prescription drugs online are probing the business practices of payment processor Allied Wallet, according to a person with direct knowledge of the case. Allied Wallet's CEO has donated millions of dollars to both political parties in recent years.  The Associated Press reported Thursday that Ahmad ""Andy"" Khawaja's company has helped pornographers, shady debt collectors and offshore gamblers access the international banking system, often by using dummy corporations formed abroad and fake websites to disguise the underlying business.  The AP obtained thousands of internal records that showed the company did so while Khawaja, Allied Wallet and top executives contributed at least $6 million to Democratic and Republican candidates and groups. The donations earned Khawaja access to Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign and a post-election Oval Office visit with Donald Trump.  Now, criminal investigators from the Federal Drug Administration who scrutinize online pharmacies are examining records related to Khawaja's Los Angeles-based company, according to a grand jury subpoena reviewed by the AP.  Full article  They also had an episode with the FBI back in 2010:  Allied Wallet reached a civil settlement with the FBI in 2010 for a sum of $13.3 million, which the FBI had seized in an online gambling raid. According to the FBI, Allied Wallet knowingly partnered with a Scottsdale, Arizona-based bank to process offshore wire transfers and other payments related to gambling through an Isle of Man company called Pokerstars. Allied Wallet forfeited the total amount seized by the FBI and has not been cited for similar illegal activity since the ruling.    And then there is this:   The second issue we found was that Allied Wallet appeared to be operating a website designed to look like that of the Colorado DMV. The website, which had a “.org” domain, contained language specifying that it was privately owned and was not affiliated with the DMV, but this text was not featured prominently, especially when compared to the large, linked text encouraging visitors to renew or replace their driver’s licenses through the website. The site charged visitors $14.95 to renew or replace their licenses and was not shy about collecting visitors’ credit card numbers. At the very least, it appeared to be at the very least an attempt to dupe unsuspecting visitors into paying Allied Wallet unnecessarily for a service that is actually provided by the government.    AW and cards issued by them are probably on all kinds of watch/blacklists, which explains their short lifespan and other problems. Spectrocoin either made a very poor decision when they decided to partner up with AW or there is some kind of connection between SC and AW that I'm not privy to. Whatever the case, I recommend steer clear of those AlliedWallet cards or be ready to have your balance frozen.",False

Once one of those three products that are on their roadmap is available, they will start communicate and attract investors, nowadays they only offer the weekly revenue, which is already a cool feature, but not enough to be revolutionnary.

I am from Lithuania and I am used to gather the available official information from the official government resources. Please keep in mind that Lithuania is a member of the European Union since 2004. So, let’s begin: 1)   When I want to check when was the company established, I would check the official website of Lithuanian Center of Registers: http://www.registrucentras.lt/jar/p_en/index.php?pav=Spectro&p=1 As we see there is a company UAB Spectro Finance (Spectrocoin operational legal entity). We can also check on the page, that it was established on the 25th of Februrary 2013. http://www.registrucentras.lt/jar/p_en/dok.php?kod=303008845 So, we have this company is more than 5 years old and started operating long before the ICO of BNK. They are not marked in red (first link), it means that they submit all the financial info to the government in time. 2)   UAB Pervesk (announced partnership), their company for the financial services (payment solutions) also is not in red http://www.registrucentras.lt/jar/p_en/index.php?pav=pervesk&p=1 Established 22nd of February 2016. http://www.registrucentras.lt/jar/p_en/dok.php?kod=304186270 3)   When I want to check is the company healthy, I would check the official website of our Governmental Social Insurance Fund. It indicated that UAB Spectro Finance (Spectrocoin) has 37 employees at the moment and has no social insurance debt to the government. This is a green light for me, that it normal, operating company, paying their taxes in time (sorry, website only in Lithuanian, google translate will help you) https://draudejai.sodra.lt/draudeju_viesi_duomenys/;jsessionid=F0D41B711078A4A244DB0DFBE59DE5CA 4)   UAB Pervesk – 11 employees and no social insurance debt https://draudejai.sodra.lt/draudeju_viesi_duomenys/  Lets check the official info from our central bank – Lithuanian bank (governmental central bank, supervising all banks and financial institutions in Lithuanian)  5)   UAB Spectro Finance is registered in Lithuania as a financial market participant in category: Persons distributing e-money of an EMI established in an EU Member State https://www.lb.lt/en/sfi-financial-market-participants/uab-spectro-finance#68 This means that they are supervised by Lithuanian central bank and have to follow strict rules.  6)   They have also one intermediary listed Prepaid Financial Services Ldt. (UK company) https://www.lb.lt/en/sfi-financial-market-participants/prepaid-financial-services-ltd It says founder UAB Spectro Finance, so probably we have one more operating company and since listed by Lithuanian bank, category: ‘’Electronic money institutions of EU Member States providing services in the Republic of Lithuania through an intermediary’’, they should have a license in UK and be supervised by the UK’s financial institutions. And 9 activities are listed (check the link above). 7)   I do not know how many employees they have in the UK. And how many people could be working for Bankera in other countries or freelancing for them and also how many services they outsource.    When checking the Pervesk UAB it becomes more interesting https://www.lb.lt/en/sfi-financial-market-participants/uab-pervesk#item-lists 9)   They operate in 29 member states of the European Union (check the link above), CEO: Vytatutas Karalevicius. And have a Electronic money institution license.  So, for all who are chouting scam or scamers: you are talking nonsense here, like a bunch of kids. I am not a professional investor nor adviser, I am just the usual BKN holder (bought more on Hitbtc, than during the ICO), I think that it is a wise and strong team and they are truly building something great here. They are not kids, they are following the rules and regulations and will not be shut down as a real scammers after one letter of Cease and desist. Hope some of you will find this info useful. As to Bankera: you have a serious lack of communication, we hope that you will fix this soon.",False

Like I have said, it was my first time ever posting in a forum related to crypto, sorry for the confusion it may have caused. I work in a field where it is my job to search for this kind of info (took me about 45 min to write it down) and since checking this forum has become my coffee brakes routine, decided to share it, because there are so many crap here and so little real info. I can only imagine how much time it takes „to play by the rules“, issuing all that licenses and building a bank and how mush money they should be spending on lawyers and financial consulting in order to make everything right. But they do not communicate in right and this is not right, since the major amount of work done while working on the project stays unseen by the community.  PS I have noticed that links related to amount of employees are not working, in Lithuania we have a most popular commercial data base, you can also find all relevant info regarding Lithuanian companies there: https://rekvizitai.vz.lt/en/company/spectro_finance/ https://rekvizitai.vz.lt/en/company/pervesk/",False

Quote from: MORIS1986 on July 12, 2018, 02:35:56 AM Quote from: Traderbtcc on July 11, 2018, 09:27:12 PM Quote from: Thadeous on July 11, 2018, 12:39:12 PM Quote from: Ansault on July 11, 2018, 11:13:17 AM Quote from: Thadeous on July 11, 2018, 10:38:46 AM Current BNK daily volume is really low, less than 100k. But I can bet that it will increase up to 5 times after Bankera exchange takes off. So hodl and stay tuned.  Less than 100K/day? Where are you seeing that? BNK/ETH is showing 455K last HOUR on HitBtc.  Current BNK Volumes from HitBTC: BNK/ETH: 3.4 ETH BNK/BTC: 5.7 BTC  Check yourself.  So poor. The poor volumes won't help the ever declining price. I expected more from the bankera team and the ico. Its now like 60-80% + below ico price. I think even if It's launched on spectrocoin exchange, It'll have little to no effect. The exchange isn't known for volumes. The market too is not helping matters. BNK prices won't go up if the volumes are this low. What BNK needs right now, is constant news, partnerships and top exchange listings.       I honestly don't think that listing Bankera on multiple exchanges would have any good effect on the price. Their strategy seems to be to keep the exclusivity for their own exchange, which i must admit takes time to come.  Bankera's tokens will be way more valuable once they release :  -Their exchange -Physical cards -Iban  I think the good strategy would be to keep everything under silence until they have all three products ready, and at this moment they should release everything at the same time, which would pump the price incredibly high. You must try to add another roadmap like what has already happened with so many spectrocoin users. - Stole more and more bitcoin - ignore any accusation with enough proof and then run away with it.  That's the best scenario of how scam platform raised more than 100 million dollars. And those dumb investors have been getting what they deserve by investing in this shit scam project.",False

All information is provided only with the need to find and read. My questions to me are always connected to the Spectrocoin account and I put questions to which the BNK team responds very quickly. Having started exchanging BNKs through Spectrocoin we will only be able to see the real situation right now. I guarantee that it will not be cosmic, but if everyone pushes for selling their coins, this will further reduce the price. When the air bubble is generated by ICO, it will always explode. BNK coins via ICO were used to purchase the Bank for which the issuing of a license issue was a problem. This bank should work and carry BNK coin holders 20 percent dividend as a zaid team. Now that's what I'm getting. After switching through Spectrocoina, the bank has to function well, these dividends have to grow strongly. Only then will we see the results of the BNK team.

All cryptos are down, all of them. Take a look at the original Bitcoin... 20k at 4th quarter 2017, down to below 7k now. If anything, the lows present a good opportunity for buying.  Also, relying on the bitcoinforums or ANY forum for crypto investment advice is like trying to ask horses at the racetrack which one of them is going to win. You won't get a good answer from any of them, just a bunch of snorts and farts. I think the bitcointalk forum is pretty good for dealing with code problems devs are having, but as far as reliable investment advice goes, do you really think the 49ers of the Gold Rush era relied on complete strangers for advice? No... they took their chances with ""California or bust"" attitudes.  So... build a couple full nodes of some coins that you find interesting, read the forums (here or wherever) that have info about code development. Read the debug files from those full nodes and get a handle on how the system works first. If you don't have time to approach it that way, then investing in cryptocurrencies is like playing slots at the casino. You never know when it's gonna hit, but it eventually hits, just maybe not for you.

Why is it that a company with 150M or so in raised capital has such a terrible website.  Has anyone looked at the team page.  Its now way down at the bottom of the page. Its a very small team of people and the high profile advisors are no longer listed anywhere that I can see. Also in that team section it says 70+ team members and yet show only 11 within the company, according to the Linkedin company page that Bankers itself links to.  But to make matters worse, those aren't all employees. I happen to know one of those people and asked why his name was there and its because the company page grabs anyone on Linkedin that has mentioned Bankera, so it has pulled in investors as well as staff.  All of the above doesn't mean its a scam, but come on Bankera, with so much funding its time to so a better job on your website.",False

Did you invest?. If you invested and think its a scam, what new information do you have now that you didn't have before when you invested?  I suspect if the price was way above ICO right now many of these people wouldn't be complaining. So I'm not convinced by anyone saying the coin is a scam today because the price is currently down on their initial investment.  That said, while I haven't seen any new information that would make me conclude this is a scam, I'm also open to that possibility and if such information emerges I'll revise my opinion.    I say this not to belittle those who are raising issues with the coin, this is one of the few places people can openly raise questions about a project, but rather because I've done such complaining myself previously with other coins.  When I first starting investing, I thought some of my initial investments were scams and I complained just like some of the people here complained.  Then I discovered I was wrong and 6 months later the coin did a 10x. I've since learned to stay emotionless when investing in any coin or project or else I don't invest.",False

Last week, SpectroCoin generated a net transactional revenue of 65,381.76 EUR. 20% of that was distributed among Bankera token holders. This totalled to 13,076.35 EUR or 32.072679329677 ETH (given the current exchange rate of 407.71 euros for 1 ether).

To answer your question as best as possible...  All cryptos are down, all of them. Take a look at the original Bitcoin... 20k at 4th quarter 2017, down to below 7k now. If anything, the lows present a good opportunity for buying.  Also, relying on the bitcoinforums or ANY forum for crypto investment advice is like trying to ask horses at the racetrack which one of them is going to win. You won't get a good answer from any of them, just a bunch of snorts and farts. I think the bitcointalk forum is pretty good for dealing with code problems devs are having, but as far as reliable investment advice goes, do you really think the 49ers of the Gold Rush era relied on complete strangers for advice? No... they took their chances with ""California or bust"" attitudes.  So... build a couple full nodes of some coins that you find interesting, read the forums (here or wherever) that have info about code development. Read the debug files from those full nodes and get a handle on how the system works first. If you don't have time to approach it that way, then investing in cryptocurrencies is like playing slots at the casino. You never know when it's gonna hit, but it eventually hits, just maybe not for you.  The cryptocurrency era may eventually fade away like the dot com boom, and only a few strong developers will survive, as it evolves into something completely different.",False

Bankera appear to be a good team, and they have a track record through Spectrocoin already. My only concern was the number of coins.. which I think will limit how much each token can grow in value. I think all the worry will die down when they start to deliver.  This is a long term HODL. If you have weak hands this was not the right ICO to get involved with. I've seen all of this before in some many other ICO's.  Best thing is don't panic and just forget about this coin for 6-8 months.   ",False

Many have sold below the price they have bought, then the price goes down. If nobody sells below the ICO price these things do not happen.  It has also introduced many people like ""moris1987"" (there are others like him), well known in this world and in other forums and projects, since the beginning of a great project always tries to panic people and sell their tokens underneath from the price you have bought, then speculators can take advantage of a good price again. He is very active in forums such as ""reddit"", is known by all as ""Bolred"", is a nuisance for every project that tries to destabilize.  Investors should not fall into the trap of people like this, it is also introducing in the forum ugly words so that in internet search engines, these ugly words are associated with the project, that's why they always use the word ""scam"" in all his interventions. You can do an SEO analysis, he in each forum tries to get this effect  When you search for Bankera in search engines, this word is increasingly associated with this project and generates distrust for new investors.  And for now, the token does not stop falling, and it will be very difficult to find new investors if you associate these ugly words with the project.  That's why we expect new news from the team. We need to do good marketing, with good SEO. And finally, when the project is finalizing, we need proof of how and where 150 million euros have been consumed by all the investors.",False

It is a short term trend, until people find the small yet steady trickle of ETH dripping from the coin, which is a bonus in itself.  I do believe that the project is poorly managed.

Exhibit 1 - number of spectrocoin emplyees  https://rekvizitai.vz.lt/imone/spectro_finance/darbuotoju-skaicius/ (You will see the exact point when this project lost its proper social media support). Expansion is one of the most difficult business cycles and I do believe Bankera is suffering from a string of horrendous decisions. Why did they list the coin on hitbtc prior to launching their own trading plaform? Why is social media so poorly managed. It does look like a company managed by engineers, who are a bit optimistic about their own abilities, and very bad at communicating with the public.  On the plus side - a new law on electronic money is in the pipelines in Lithuania, it will be both very liberal and transparent (so - it will be not a garage type operation, but an entity working within a legal framework, which will give people who invested in the company reassurance.). Kegal grey areas will be no longer there. Which is good for any long time investor. Sooner or later Bankera will bring their exchange to life. It will boost the ETH trickle to BNK holders. And I do hope that Bankera/Spectro management will learn from their mistakes (one of which is paradoxically - to give very precise dates of their future plans, not rushing to please the anonymous and libelous commenters).

Hence, we would like to remind you of our vision and attitude towards our goals. First of all, we always try to choose the right way, which is usually the hard way. The BNK token was not an exception, as it is one of a few tokens sharing net transactional revenue with its holders. There were no relevant smart contract examples in existence, so we had to develop it in-house.  Before launching the BNK, it was mandatory for us to have full support of the BNK token at SpectroCoin. To do this, our IT team had to enable the ERC20/ERC233 token support at SpectroCoin. As a result, our clients will be able to use a number of ERC20/ERC233 assets as well as currently offered cryptocurrencies, to load their cards, exchange or as payment options through our merchant solutions.  The BNK smart contract development was not an easy task to accomplish, but the audit phase demanded even more of our attention. To avoid any potential vulnerabilities in our smart contract, we have done an extensive process of auditing. After four stages of internal and external audits, we are now confident about the stability and security of our contract.

It is trusted by over 800,000 clients and growing fast. Like any company in this competitive field we receive scam accusations sometimes, but we would not be operating for so long if those accusations were true. Management team and advisors (including Lon Wong - head of NEM,) have links to their LinkedIn profiles, you can check their very solid backgrounds. Also, SpectroCoin services are regulated by the laws and EU directives, as a result, SpectroCoin implements EU and international standard Anti-money laundering (AML), and your funds are processed through regulated EU financial institutions.  Regarding exchanges, our primary focus for BNK trading is for it to be traded in our own exchange. This is the advantage that very few other projects can offer. This way we will be able to give our clients excellent trading conditions, as we work hand in hand to fulfill the needs of our community and to offer benefits for BNK tokens - no exchange fees for pairs that include BNK and a wide selection of exchange pairs, both with other cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. Building an exchange was one of the key milestones in our roadmap and we have big plans and capabilities to deliver it.  Our clients have asked for BNK to be listed on external exchanges as well. The agreement with HitBTC will give that opportunity. Other exchanges are not out of question but, as mentioned, the focus is on making trading BNK on Bankera’s exchange an excellent prime choice.

It’s a digital bank with traditional banking services (e.g., giving out loans) but it supports traditional fiat currencies as well as cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, DASH, NEM, ERC20 compliant tokens and others. Just looking at the next milestone in our roadmap is launch of the exchange – this is crypto focused.  When comparing us to traditional banks, we have several differences. First, clearly, we will not be fiat focused and will cover both fiat and crypto. Second, traditional banks are not as technologically advanced to enter the blockchain period – their focus is on legacy products, such as SWIFT messages, payment cards and SEPA payments (for European banks). We do not have focus on them and will be able to quickly move to newer technologies once these ones become outdated. Third, physically, we will not have brick and mortar branches like most traditional banks do.  Bankera will offer 3 core services:  -Payments: including payment accounts with personal IBAN, debit cards, interbank foreign exchange rates, and payment processing for both fiat and cryptocurrencies; -Loans and deposits; -Investment solutions: consisting of low-cost investment products such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), crypto-funds (a portfolio of various cryptocurrencies and crypto tokens), as well as roboadvisory solutions for wealth management.",False

It’s a digital bank with traditional banking services (e.g., giving out loans) but it supports traditional fiat currencies as well as cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, DASH, NEM, ERC20 compliant tokens and others. Just looking at the next milestone in our roadmap is launch of the exchange – this is crypto focused.  When comparing us to traditional banks, we have several differences. First, clearly, we will not be fiat focused and will cover both fiat and crypto. Second, traditional banks are not as technologically advanced to enter the blockchain period – their focus is on legacy products, such as SWIFT messages, payment cards and SEPA payments (for European banks). We do not have focus on them and will be able to quickly move to newer technologies once these ones become outdated. Third, physically, we will not have brick and mortar branches like most traditional banks do.",False

Some would say, that it is a scam project.  Lets check: A disruptive banking service with a banking licence from Vanuatu? 800.000 users? C'mon. Who is using this service? Did they mean users that have once registered on the Spectrocoin website? Have they ever provided any proof of this number? And where are those people? Aaaah, yeah... crypto is anonymous. So, they are. The founders. Any of them seen in the wild? Or met them in real? And ever wondered where the payout money is coming from? From using the card? Or maybe from other sources? A card that has never been seen in the wild and reviewed by real people in a positive way?   PS: Gouga, the once famous poker player, by the way, has left the board of advisors. Jumping the ship is probably a good move. Well, you cannot.... because no place to sell your tokens.  Verdict: Haven't you (all) learned in school, to add 1 and 1 together?

This product is operated under the brand name SpectroCoin (https://spectrocoin.com/). It has been active for over 4 years now, so we are very familiar with the market.  From day one SpectroCoin was built with the intention of providing access for customers to a range of cryptocurrencies. However, to remain competitive, SpectroCoin was required to produce a number of products that are seen in traditional banking, such as debit cards, payment processing, international bank account numbers, foreign exchange and so forth. As such, SpectroCoin has already developed core infrastructure comparable to traditional banks. A natural extension of SpectroCoin is to leverage existing technology to build Bankera, a revolutionary bank for the blockchain era.  SpectroCoin’s services are trusted by over 800.000 clients, the project is profitable and Bankera is already paying 20% net transaction revenue shares to its clients every week. Also, Bankera’s founders have acquired Pacific Private Bank in Vanuatu. This will allow Bankera to offer banking products faster and more easily. We are delivering, not speculating. """,False

They said I should set up a new account with a different email address and then transfer the assets over. I can't do the second part due to email confirm requirements, but I already took care of the first part. They would need some way to prove that I own both accounts so that they can make the transfer on their end and feel confident that no one is getting scammed. I suggested they make a small deposit of some currency into each account and then have me tell support what it is. That I can do since I'm still able to log into the original account and the new account. Funny thing is that banks do that sort of thing all the time to double check that you actually own the bank account you are trying to link to whatever third party service it is.  Yes, I am going to keep bugging them about this until I regain access to my funds. There simply has to be a way to make it work for everyone. Thanks for the support.

You cannot change your SpectroCoin profile email address! So what happens if you lose access to your email address? The answer is you just lost all the funds in your account.  I'm learning this lesson the hard way, but never, ever register on any cryptocurrency related service with an email address that might expire or for any other reason not be there in a year or next month. YOU CANNOT CHANGE IT. Your profile email address is your permanent identity.  On SpectroCoin, you can create a new account and transfer all assets to the new account. If you have any doubts about the email address you currently use in your profile, then do it now. Use a gmail address to register an account, or some other email provider that is too big to fail. Make the change while you still have access to the old email address. Because once you lose access to it, you will no longer be able to confirm withdrawals and that's it. Bye bye funds!  SpectroCoin is not alone. Poloniex says they can't change profile email addresses either. Cryptopia for practical purposes (because they do not respond to support tickets) can't either. BitTrex has a process you can go through to change your email address (and I did this successfully) but it's not automatic. Coinbase does allow you to change your profile email address automatically, but they seem to be the exception.  When it comes to cryptocurrency related services, your profile email address is your permanent identity. So make sure your email address is also permanent!",False

Bankera‘s team has always been oriented towards building a strong and long-lasting community. While working hand in hand with our community, we were able to better identify the needs of crypto-users. We believe developing our own exchange will address those needs.  From the beginning, SpectroCoin has always been focused on payment solutions for cryptocurrencies (and it will continue to do so), but we have continually noticed a demand from our customers for a crypto-trading platform. Since we now have such a large community of BNK token holders, our wish to create an environment for this high-quality pool of traders has been strengthened. We want to offer them a low-cost and secure alternative to existing exchanges. In this way, we see SpectroCoin and Bankera as a symbiotic ecosystem that will cover all of the needs involved in exchanging currency.  In addition to expanding the range of services offered to our clients, we also see the development of our own exchange platform as a way to increase the liquidity of BNK, in the long term, by creating additional supply and demand. This will be done by offering free trade on all pairs which include BNK tokens on our platform. Therefore, it will be much more cost-effective for our clients to buy BNK with EUR and then buy BTC with BNK, rather than  directly buying BTC with EUR. This creates an additional demand for BNKs, which should provide additional liquidity and higher utility.  Initially, Bankera’s exchange will support these currencies: EUR, BTC, ETH, DASH, NEM, and BNK. Later, more currencies will be added, including ERC-20 and NEM mosaic tokens. We are already accepting applications for coins and tokens to be listed on Bankera’s exchange. For potential token listings, please visit: https://exchange.bankera.com/add-token  Our clients have asked for BNK to be listed on external exchanges, as well. The agreement with HitBTC will provide that opportunity. Other exchanges are not out of question, however, our primary focus now is to make trading BNK on Bankera’s exchange an excellent prime choice.  More information regarding Bankera’s own exchange will be announced soon on our official communication channels, so stay tuned!  https://blog.bankera.com/2018/02/22/bankeras-own-exchange-the-reason-we-are-making-one/",False

This is a medium of communication and is not designed for professional advertising.  So how does this affect Bankera? It does not.. Google where Bankera is based.  Post from someone on reddit:  ""On further research, they are based out of the British Virgin Islands and are not under the jurisdiction of the Lithuanian National Bank, so in that case I have to concur with you that this will likely have no impact on their plans.""   ""Position of ICOs in the British Virgin Islands  Below is a summary of the relevant considerations when launching an ICO through a BVI company. It is assumed that the ICO will be structured through a BVI business company, which is the vehicle of choice for ICOs in the British Virgin Islands.  Perhaps most importantly, no ICO or blockchain-specific rules or guidlines have yet been issued by the government or regulator. At this stage the British Virgin Islands is keen to 'wait and see' with regards to ICO regulation, which seems to be consistent with the position in the United Kingdom and across pan-EU law. As such, the question remains as to the impact of the pre-existing legislative and regulatory framework in the British Virgin Islands.  Primary legal and regulatory considerations  The following laws are the most relevant to structuring an ICO through the British Virgin Islands:  the Securities and Investment Business Act 2010; the Proceeds of Criminal Conduct Act 1997 and its subsidiary legislation the Anti-money Laundering Regulations 2008 and the Anti-money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Code of Practice 2008 (together, the anti-money laundering regime); the Financing and Money Services Act 2009; the Beneficial Ownership Secure Search System Act 2017 (the beneficial ownership regime); the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and the Common Reporting Standard (CRS); and the Electronic Transactions Act 2001. Below is a short description of the issues which each law seeks to address. The extent to which each law or a combination of the laws and regulations above will apply largely depends on the unique structure of the ICO.  Securities and Investment Business Act The Securities and Investment Business Act prohibits persons from carrying on, or presenting themselves as carrying on, investment business of any kind in or from within the British Virgin Islands unless they hold a licence from the BVI Financial Services Commission, or else benefit from one of the safe harbours. 'Investment business', 'investment' and 'investment activity' are all defined by the act.  Most relevant to ICOs is the definition of 'investments' under the act. This includes:  shares; interests in a partnership or fund interests; debentures; instruments giving entitlement to shares; interests or debentures; certificates representing investments; options; futures; contracts for differences; and long-term insurance contracts.  However, ICO tokens or any form of cryptocurrencies are not expressly classed as investments in their own right under the act. Understanding whether tokens issued under an ICO are investments will therefore typically involve the question of whether the token itself is equivalent to a security or a derivative contract caught by the act. This is a complex task and each case will require professional legal advice.  However, most ICOs would not usually fall within the scope of the act and therefore may conduct business legitimately without the need for the BVI company to hold an investment business licence.  The act requires that a prospectus be registered where an offer is made to the public. However:  Part 2 of the act, which deals with the public issue of securities, is not yet in force; and the digital tokens or cryptocurrencies issued under an ICO may fall outside of the definition of securities under the act. In relation to the latter, determining whether the types of crypto-currency can or will be considered securities within the context of the act is key. If they are, certain exemptions may apply so that no prospectus or offering document is required.  Anti-money laundering regime The anti-money laundering regime needs careful consideration with respect to ICOs launched through BVI business companies. The regime primarily focuses on the regulated sector in the British Virgin Islands and requires certain policies and procedures to be established by 'relevant persons' conducting 'relevant business' – both of these terms are strictly defined. The requirements seek to provide general regulatory rules to minimise and eliminate any form of money laundering or terrorist financing through the British Virgin Islands.  ICOs are not within the definition of 'relevant business' in the regime and therefore the vehicle through which they are structured (ie, the BVI business company) is unlikely to be deemed a relevant person. However, any ICO team should consider anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing obligations regardless, as a way of future-proofing the business.  Financing and Money Services Act The Financing and Money Services Act regulates 'money services business' in the British Virgin Islands, which under the act entails:  money transmission services; cheque exchange services; currency exchange services; the issuance, sale or redemption of money orders or traveller's cheques; or other such services. These services contemplate money which amounts to legal tender (ie, fiat currencies). Digital tokens and forms of cryptocurrencies would therefore fall outside the scope of the definition of a money services business.  Beneficial ownership regime Briefly, considerations around share ownership, voting rights, the right to remove a majority of the board of directors and the exercise of significant influence and control over an ICO company will play a part in determining who must be recorded on the register. With this in mind, it is relatively straightforward to ensure that the identity of ICO token holders will not need to be maintained on any beneficial ownership register of an ICO company.  Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and the CRS Both of these regimes relate to the automatic exchange of tax information between participating and reportable jurisdictions. The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and CRS legislation will be important in determining the ultimate beneficial ownership of the BVI business company issuing the ICO. While these pieces of legislation will not be immediately relevant at the launch of the ICO, they must be considered as the BVI business company acting as the issuer starts to conduct business more generally.  Electronic Transactions Act The Electronic Transactions Act is pertinent since everything in relation to the launch and conduct of the ICO will be done electronically. As such, understanding the impact of the act's provisions on electronic signatures and record-keeping requirements is fundamental. In general terms, the Electronic Transactions Act lends support to the position that electronic records will not be denied legal validity simply because they are maintained in electronic format, as opposed to paper.  Comment  The BVI legislative regime is flexible and able to foster the region's growing number of ICOs. Nevertheless, it will be important for each new ICO to be advised properly in order to mitigate any possibility of falling into regulatory prohibitions or other legal risks.""  http://www.internationallawoffice.com/Newsletters/Private-Client-Offshore-Services/British-Virgin-Islands/Harney-Westwood-Riegels/Launching-an-ICO-in-British-Virgin-Islands",False

Do you think members of the European parliament would agree to participate in some sketchy fly by night operation? This is a very high profile project that would have been shut down a long time ago if any of the scam allegations had any merit or legal standing.  Those ERC20 tokens can be withdrawn as soon as the ICO ends.  My personal opinion is that Bankera will either succeed spectacularly or fail completely. Nothing in between.

If illegal activity is detected, we cooperate with responsible authorities. We must and we do follow the regulations.  If you take a look at our official channels you will find that ""We want to increase Bankera’s scale, in order for it to be able to compete with traditional banks. The volume [177 MLN EUR] is needed for Bankera to become a proper Bank; as it is all about scalability and bank’s scalability depends on its’ capital.  It has to have 15 to 20% of its own capital of all loans outstanding in order to be successful and to achieve a scale. Let’s do some math: if we have 100 in million capital, the bank can loan 500 million, which means 5000 Euros in loans each for 100,000 people in case of overdrafts or 250,000 Euros in loans each for 2000 people in case of mortgages. So, it is not a significant amount.""  Also in our blog, you can find: https://blog.bankera.com/2017/12/15/bankeras-total-token-supply-explained/  And in all our official channels you can also find that you will be able to withdraw BNK tokens as ERC20 or NEM mosaic in the future, after the ICO.

One of the largest news sites in Lithuania published this article today, which I took time to summarise and translate.  Questions for Bankera: 1. Have you registered the prospectus?  ""The Bank of Lithuania has sent inquiries to Bankera regarding the ICO, whether the ICO follows the legal requirements established in Lithuanian law.  „According to the official position expressed by the Bank of Lithuania, in those cases when virtual currency coins contain features of securities, requirements stated in the Law on Securities are applicable, which include provisions regarding advertisments of the emmission of securities. Fines or other means could be applicable if the provisions of the Law are not followed"" - stated  Vaidotas Cibas, Head of the Regulatory Market Surveillance Division of the Bank of Lithuania  On October 10, 2017 the Bank of Lithuanian approved its position ""Regarding virtual currencies and initial coin offerings"", states the press release. This position states, that in those cases, when ICO coins contain features of securities (e.g. grants property rights, share of the profit or a say in management,  interest, of the coins are to be redeemed ), and also there is an option to sell the coin and to trade it in a secondary market or at organized trading venues, the requirements of the Law on Securities must be applied. One of the main requirements is that before selling coins in our country the company has to prepare a prospectus and the prospectus must be approved by the Bank of Lithuania or relevant authority within the European Union.  Then some general information regarding the ICO.  According the features stated in the position and according to the information stated in Bankera business plan (white paper?) we come to conclusion that this ICO is covered by the regulations of the Law on Securities, therefore is considered a public offering, therefore it must follow established regulations. Law on Securities state, that should the persons organise and conduct public offering without the approval of the prospectus or the public offering and trading in the regulated market is prohibited, stopped or do not follow the the Law on Securities, a maximum fine could be applied, which may exceed the common nominal value of the publicly offered securities. The Regulator have a right to apply sanctions to the company and its directors and other persons responsible for the transgresion, including subjects which disseminate the advertismens of illegaly conducted ICO."" https://www.delfi.lt/verslas/verslas/lietuvos-bankas-ispeja-del-virtualiuju-zetonu-platinimo.d?id=77185697",False

An SCO is only a possibility we are considering for the future. We don’t plan to have one anytime soon. We would only launch an SCO if the token price reaches 10 EUR cents and we determine that we need additional funds. In other words, we will only launch an SCO if we need more capital to satisfy capital adequacy requirement to scale our business even further.  https://blog.bankera.com/2018/01/12/bankera-qa-4/  - Why does Bankera need an SCO and when it will take place? It is important for Bankera to enter the market with sufficient capital, to stay competitive with other banks. The ability to issue loans is at the core of any banking business. Due to regulations, Bankera is required to have 20% of all outstanding loans as capital in order to meet capital adequacy requirements. For example, if Bankera raised 100M EUR, it would only be able to lend out 500M EUR, which is far less than a small bank‘s lending capacity.  The actual BNK token sale price will depend on the current prices on exchanges. The BNK token price will be equal to current prices on exchanges, but it will not be lower than 0.1 EUR per token. More detailed information about SCO will be provided in the future.  https://bankera.com/faq.html",False

To date, their ICO has collected over 100 million euros from over 80,000 contributors making Bankera’s ICO the biggest in regard to the number of contributors.

With SpectroCoin, investors can already see results and reap the benefits of the technology in which they are investing. Currently, more than 750,000 clients are using the SpectroCoin platform for services such as fiat and cryptocurrency wallets, free and instant peer-to-peer transfers, debit cards, exchange, and payment processing services, but, uniquely, clients can also claim IBANs for SpectroCoin accounts. An MVP like SpectroCoin not only makes Bankera less risky and different from any other ICO, but it also allows investors to use the technology they are financing in a fashion that is unprecedented in the ICO world.

I saw your finance specialist Jonas yesterday. Does he have a surname? Also is it possible to see some of his past credentials and work?  Id expect a bit more detailed explanation if he references himself as a financial expert for ""bank of the future"".  I do have another question for you to help me understand. Below is a copy of your first-page post under Services:  ""Loans and deposits will be a key competitive edge as well as a core service of Bankera. Not only saving, but also current accounts will receive interest. All Bankera clients will be able to benefit from higher interest rates due to proprietary information about borrowers' cash flows as most loans will be given to business clients of its payment processing solution.""  I would love to know more, how will Bankera be competitive with loans (as a core business service)? Eu banks give super cheap loans, i think it about 2% yearly. How are you going to have same or better rates but at the same time banera clients will benefit from high-interest rates? Doesn't really add up does it?  I am dying to hear an explanation because what you wrote above doesn't really have any meaning. For a core service id expect you at least know how to interpret your solutions.",False

Last week, SpectroCoin generated a net transactional revenue of 178,779.89 EUR. 20% of that was distributed among Bankera token holders. This totaled to 35,755.98 EUR or 41.36077594 ETH (given the current exchange rate of 864.49 euros for 1 ether). The total number of tokens outstanding includes 5,991,901,364 BNK of the pre-ICO and ICO BNK tokens, and 457,959,001 BNK tokens that were distributed by the end of last week as referral commission bonuses, bounties (for translations, promotion, etc.) and as compensation for some of the advisors. The 457,959,001 BNK tokens were issued from the tokens allocated for management and advisors. There were 6,449,860,365 BNK tokens issued in total. Since the net transactional revenue share is only allocated to issued tokens (not the total possible supply in the long-run), each BNK holder has been allocated 0.0000000064126622279973 ETH (0.0000055436823694814 EUR) per Banker.  This revenue share is equal to 0.000292 EUR per 1 BNK of annualized return. This is equal to a 2.92% annualized return given the pre-ICO price of 0.01 EUR, 1.71% annualized return given the initial ICO price of 0.017 EUR, 1.61% given the ICO price of 0.018 EUR, 1.53% given the  ICO price of 0.019 EUR and 1.45% given the current ICO price of 0.020 EUR.

SITE WEB  WHITEPAPER  CHAT  FAQ  Bankera  La technologie digitale a changé la face de la finance. Plus particulièrement, peut-être, la naissance de la Blockchain nous a permis de digitaliser la monnaie avec des cryptomonnaies, telles que le Bitcoin. Il y a eu de nombreuses tentatives pour utiliser la technologie de la Blockchain afin de révolutionner les autres secteurs financiers. Cependant, jusqu’ici, la plupart des compagnies FinTech se sont concentrées seulement sur un certain secteur (par exemple des versements ou des prêts) si bien qu’ellesne peuvent tirer avantage des échelles économiques utilisées par les banques traditionnelles. Bien qu’elles disposent de fonds, les banques traditionnelles ne sont pas aussi rapides pour adopter les nouvelles technologies, étant tenues par les systèmes légaux.  Bankera a pour objectif de révolutionner le monde de la banque en tirant avantage de ce que la technologie de la Blochain a à offrir, au lieu de se concentrer sur un seul secteur. Cela veut dire que Bankera cherche à devenir un guichet unique pour tous les services financiers, dans la même direction que les guichets physiques des banques traditionnelles, tout en utilisant la technologie pour réduire le nombre de contreparties et par conséquent en baissant le prix des produits bancaires pour bénéficier au consommateur. L’adoption de la technologie de la Blockchain permettra aussi à Bankera d’offrir des solutions nouvelles et uniques à ses clients.   Services   Bankera offrira trois lignes principales d’activité : Paiements, comprenant des paiements de compte personnel avec IBAN, cartes de crédit, échanges bancaires internationaux et traitement des paiements. Tous les services supporteront les monnaies fiduciaires et les cryptomonnaies comme Bitcoin, Ethereum, DASH, NEM, ERC20 tokens conformes et autres. Sur le long terme, Bankera implémentera des solutions innovantes comme le produit domestique brut (GDP) relié aux monnaies, ou bien l’utilisation de fonds d’échange boursiers en tant que substitut de monnaie. Prêts et dépôts seront un avantage compétitif clé en tant que produit phare de Bankera. Non seulement l’épargne mais aussi les comptes courants recevront des intérêts. Tous les clients de Bankera seront susceptibles de bénéficier de taux d’intérêts élevés payables exclusivement au propriétaire concernant les liquidités des emprunteurs comme les principaux prêts seront accordés à la clientèle commerciale comme solution de traitement des paiements.  La solution des investissements consistera en des produits d’investissement de faible coût comme des fonds provenant des échanges boursiers (ETFs), des cryptofonds (un portefeuille de plusieurs cryptomonnaies ou crypto-tokens) tout aussi bien que des solutions de conseils robotiques pour la gestion de fortune. Plus tard, Bankera offrira des services d’investissement bancaires incluant des stratégies institutionnelles de financement dans notre clientèle commerciale.   Situation actuelle de Bankera Bankera sera opérationnelle et aura une infrastructure significative mise en place précédant l’ICO (offre de cryptomonnaie).  Bankera a déjà les arrangements et les règlements nécessaires pour offrir des numéros de compte en banque personnels (IBAN) qui peuvent accepter et faire des paiements dans la zone Euro de paiement (SEPA). Bankera propose aussi des taux d’échange de monnaies étrangères préférentiels, des transferts bancaires rapides et économiques tout aussi bien que la « carte de paiement Bankera » reliée au compte bancaire du titulaire de la carte.  Tous ces services peuvent être testés sur Spectrocoin, un exchange de cryptomonnaies, un porte-monnaie électronique, une carte de crédit et un serveur de paiement au sujet duquel Bankera sera une branche opérationnelle. Ce qui a tout aussi bien été développé servira comme produit minimal pour Bankera afin de commencer ses opérations. Cependant, afin d’atteindre son but de devenir un total service bancaire opérationnel, Bankera a besoin d’obtenir un capital.  En quoi Bankera est différente des autres projets  Bankera est au moins depuis une année en avance sur les autres projets similaires, qui pour la plupart utilisent seulement des programmes de cartes prépayées. Nous, d’une toute autre façon, proposons déjà des IBAN à nos clients en utilisant Spectrocoin, notre produit minimal existant (MVP). Ce produit nous permet de payer un revenu transactionnel que nous partageons à nos clients de façon hebdomadaire, tout aussi bien qu’en produisant l’infrastructure de base régulière pour Bankera. Deuxièmement, Bankera sera un porte-monnaie adapté pour les monnaies fiduciaires et cryptographiques mis à jour quotidiennement et évoluera en banque dans les 2 années à venir. Troisièmement, nous offrirons des services bancaires actuels comme des options de prêts et de retraits, ainsi que des solutions de versement. Enfin, et surtout, nous avons une grande équipe et un conseil consultatif qui nous mènera à la réussite durant les année à venir. ROADMAP Développement de l’infrastructure  REALISE L’infrastructure technique nécessaire pour faciliter les solutions de paiement et produire des IBAN personnels et des cartes de paiement a déjà été développée et sont disponibles sur un produit minimum viable (MVP) sous la forme de Spectrocoin. Actuellement, Spectrocoin compte 480000 clients et a déjà produit 64000 cartes de paiement. PRE-ICO REALISE 10% des ICO ont été distribués pour déterminer le prix de l’ICO. Au total, 25 milliards de tokens ont été vendus pour 25 millions d’euros faisant d’elle une des plus importantes pre-ICO.Plus de 16000 contributeurs ont participé à cette pré-ICO. CAPACITE DU PORTE-MONNAIE REALISE Support du plein transfert P2P, porte-monnaie mobiles et le démarrage d’une application d’adhésion des principaux réseaux de paiement comme les cartes de crédit et les réseaux de dépôt. INITIAL COIN OFFERING Du 27 novembre à la fin février 30% des tokens seront distribués pour résoudre la solution du financement du capital afin que nous puissions construire une banque prospère pour la Blockchain ERA. LANCEMENT de l’EXCHANGE Première moitié 2018 Le début en ligne d’un exchange supportant les principales cryptomonnaies, ERC20 et les tokens NEM Mosaïc. CAPACITE BANCAIRE Début 2019 Après l’ICO, nous obtiendrons une licence bancaire qui nous autorisera à offrir un service de prêts et de dépôts bancaires. SOLUTIONS D’INVESTISSEMENT Fin 2019 Lancement des services de solution d’investissement à faible coût comme des fonds d’échanges boursiers (ETFs), fonds provenant de cryptomonnaies et de crypto tokens, tout aussi bien qu’un conseil robotique. NOUVEAUX TYPES D’ARGENT 2020 La synergie entre les produits de paiement et d’investissement offrira de nouveaux types d’argent comme la monnaie liée à la croissance économique ou l’utilisation d’ETFs comme moyen d’échange. Initial Coin Offering (ICO)  Pour implémenter sa vision, Bankera lance sa propre ICO. Pendant l’ICO, Bankera émettra des tokens de monnaie virtuelle appelés Bankers (BNK) sur la Blockchain publique. La valeur de chaque token dépendra de la commission de revenu de réseau de transaction partagée par chaque détenteur de token, de façon hebdomadaire. Tout d’abord, 20% des revenus de la transaction du réseau des tokens Bankera sera réservée et envoyée aux contrats intelligents.  Deuxièmement, le contrat intelligent distribuera les fonds aux détenteurs de tokens Bankera, au pro-rata. (Par ex, si un détenteur a 1% de tous les tokens Bankera disponibles, il recevra 1% du partage du revenu). Le 28 août, nous avons lancé une pré-ICO et nous avons offert 10% des tokens au public. Après trois semaines nous avons atteint le cap des 25 millions d’euros.  Le 27 novembre, nous avons lancé la campagne d’ICO pendant laquelle nous offrons 30% des tokens au public.  Le reste des 30% de tokens sera distribué pendant une seconde offre de monnaie (SCO), dans l’avenir, mais jamais à un prix inférieur à 0.1 EUR par BNK.  25% des tokens seront attribués à l’équipe, comme motivation, aussi bien comme bounties pour les programmeurs extérieurs. La part de tokens de l’équipe sera alloué dans le même temps.  5% seront attribués aux conseillers, qui nous ont aidés pendant de nombreuses années jusqu’à ce qu’une banque opérationnelle soit en service.  En tout et pour tout, le HARDCAP total de la pré-ico et de l’ICO est de 10 000 000 000 BNK (2,500,000,000 + 7,500,000,000) ce qui représente 177 millions d’euros (25M EUR + 152M EUR) et enfin 750 millions d’euros pour l’ICO secondaire.  Le prix du token pendant l’ICO actuelle est de 0.017 EUR. Il y aura aussi des soft-caps pendant l’ICO, si bien que le prix après chaque part de 1,000,000,000 BNK augmentera de 0.001 EUR.

Last week, SpectroCoin generated a net transactional revenue of 478,558.89 EUR. 20% of that was distributed among Bankera token holders. This totaled to 95,711.77 EUR or 105.98 ETH (given the current exchange rate of 903.1 euros for 1 ether). The total number of tokens outstanding includes 4,045,483,855 BNK of the pre-ICO and ICO BNK tokens, and 452,624,910 BNK tokens that were distributed by the end of last week as referral commission bonuses, bounties (for translations, promotion, etc.) and as compensation for some of the advisors. The 452,624,910 BNK tokens were issued from the tokens allocated for management and advisors. There were 4,498,108,765 BNK tokens issued in total. Since the net transactional revenue share is only allocated to issued tokens (not the total possible supply in the long-run), each BNK holder has been allocated 0.0000000235613187401955 ETH (0.000021278226954270500000 EUR) per Banker.  This revenue share is equal to 0.00116868993 EUR per 1 BNK of annualized return. This is equal to a 11.7% annualized return given the pre-ICO price of 0.01 EUR, 6.7% annualized return given the initial ICO price of 0.017 EUR and 6.3% given the current ICO price of 0.018 EUR.  It is also worth mentioning that the SpectroCoin community has grown by 36,847 new users during the last week, from 602,227 to 639,074, which led to more transactions and a higher net transactional revenue.

Last week, SpectroCoin generated a net transactional revenue of 348,529.41 EUR. 20% of that was distributed among Bankera token holders. This totaled to 69,705.88 EUR or 96.31 ETH (given the current exchange rate of 723.78 euros for 1 ether). The total number of tokens outstanding includes  3,613,557,827 BNK of the pre-ICO and ICO BNK tokens, and 452,624,910 BNK tokens that were distributed by the end of last week as referral commission bonuses, bounties (for translations, promotion, etc.) and as compensation for some of the advisors. The 452,624,910 BNK tokens were issued from the tokens allocated for management and advisors. There were 4,066,182,737 BNK tokens issued in total. Since the net transactional revenue share is only allocated to issued tokens (not the total possible supply in the long-run), each BNK holder has been allocated  0.0000000236851 ETH (0.0000171428 EUR) per Banker.  This revenue share is equal to 0.00093153238 EUR per 1 BNK of annualized return. This is equal to a 9.32% annualized return given the pre-ICO price of 0.01 EUR, 5.38% annualized return given the initial ICO price of 0.017 EUR and 5.07% given the current ICO price of 0.018 EUR.

Last week, SpectroCoin generated a record-breaking net transactional revenue of 572,003.2813 EUR. 20% of that was distributed among Bankera token holders. This totaled to 114,400.66 EUR or 190.46 ETH (given the current exchange rate of 600.66 euros for 1 ether). The total number of tokens outstanding includes  3,299,666,394 of the pre-ICO and ICO BNK tokens, and 452,594,910 BNK tokens that were distributed by the end of last week as referral commission bonuses, bounties (for translations, promotion, etc.) and as compensation for some of the advisors. The 452,594,910 BNK tokens were issued from the tokens allocated for management and advisors. There were 3,752,261,304 BNK tokens issued in total. Since the net transactional revenue share is only allocated to issued tokens (not the total possible supply in the long-run), each BNK holder has been allocated 0.0000000507583 ETH (0.0000304885 EUR) per Banker.  Given the initial ICO price of 0.017 EUR, this revenue share is equal to a 9.77% annualized return (0.00097654117 EUR per 1 BNK). If we compare the revenue share with the pre-ICO price of 0.01 EUR, the annualized return is 17.15%  (0.00171516171 EUR per 1 BNK).  It is also worth mentioning that SpectroCoin community has grown by 26,707 new users during last week from 552,394 to 579,101. Subsequently, leading to more transactions and a higher net transactional revenue.

Purchasing services with tokens accelerates the time it takes for a transaction to settle, it makes purchasing services easier and adds an element of privacy as well. In the beginning, when the company is scaling and spending more money than they are making, the volume of tokens exchanged for the purchase of services will be minimal, but as the company’s revenues grow, so will the token transfer rate. You don’t need to require tokens to purchase services, but providing the option (and possibly providing a diiscount for doing so) can go a long way in driving the use of your token.   n the coming year, I expect we will see tokens that provide true utility float to the top.

Last week, SpectroCoin generated a net transactional revenue of 344,529.79 EUR. 20% of that was distributed among Bankera token holders. This totaled to 68,905.95 EUR or 98.19 ETH (given the current exchange rate of 701.80 euros for 1 ether). The total number of tokens outstanding includes 3,125,571,741 of the pre-ICO and ICO BNK tokens, and 452,594,910 BNK tokens that were distributed by the end of last week as referral commission bonuses, bounties (for translations, promotion, etc.) and as compensation for some of the advisors. The 452,594,910 BNK tokens were issued from the tokens allocated for management and advisors. There were 3,578,166,651 BNK tokens issued in total. Since the net transactional revenue share is only allocated to issued tokens (not the total possible supply in the long-run), each BNK holder has been allocated 0.0000000274399 ETH (0.0000192573 EUR) per Banker.  Given the initial ICO price of 0.017 EUR, this revenue share is equal to a 6.06% annualized return (0.00060638894 EUR per 1 BNK). If we compare the revenue share with the pre-ICO price of 0.01 EUR, the annualized return is 10.5% (0.00105217175 EUR per 1 BNK).  It is also worth mentioning that SpectroCoin community has grown by 25,996 new users during last week from 526,398 to 552,394. Subsequently, leading to more transactions and a higher net transactional revenue.

As I am based in Lithuania, so I see that they (both Spectro and Bankera) started a hiring spree. As any user of a big web platforms you will know that maintaining a growing platform will cost more in terms of customer support, various web resources etc. So it would be reassuring to get a report on how is the entire project coping with the increased number of customers and complexity.  2) Burn rate. As this venture is using what it collects to finance itself when growing and pooling resources to start the bank it would give more confidence to see that it uses it's resources efficiently.  3) Regulation. As the entire venture will go into an area where regulation is important and elaborate (if you read the whitepaper you will see that Bankera will get into lending and investment banking), so when the regulatory enviroment will be chosen (If I understand correctly it will be EU , but the decission will be taken on where exactly - with Lithuania, Estonia, Malta, and the tax-havens as options) then some more detailed document on how this decision changes the project would be a positive sign.  4) More detailed timetables on the trading plaform. The sooner the better, as the coinholders will experience a bump in their returns.  The whitepaper explicitly states that they promise nothing in transparency on the abovementioned points. But IMHO they would help as honesty at this point in time is the best policy. The entire crypto entering the traditional and investment banking idea is interesting, and could be wildly successful.  If this machine is up and running I do see a future where the Bankera will at some point in the future buy out the coins and will become a successful bank.",False

Technology is changing how money is spent, stored, and exchange especially with the advent of the blockchain. Blockchain has enable startups to start addressing the woes of the banking industry, and while many attempts has been made to create an integrated solution, their focus on niche problems negates the impact of their solutions.  To truly revolutionize the banking industry, the platform will have to showcase the potential of becoming a one-stop store for all financial services, the same way, traditional bricks and mortar banks are now. The platform will also have to reduce the number of counterparties, thus lowering the cost of banking for the end consumer. Such a platform is what Bankera is offering.  Following a successful presale that raised 25 million Euros and gathered more than 16,000 contributors in September, Bankera has officially announced the launch of its token sale. Starting on November 27th, the blockchain-based startup will offer its BNK tokens to the general public to implement its decentralized banking services.  Bankera is an operational fork of SpectroCoin ( https://spectrocoin.com), a successful cryptocurrency exchange, e-wallet, debit card provider and payment processor with an established client base of 490,000 clients and over 64,000 cards issued. Leveraging core infrastructures whose functionalities are now comparable to the traditional banks, Bankera is the natural extension of SpectroCoin’s services to develop a banking system for the blockchain era.  https://coinidol.com/bankera-initiates-banking-revolution-on-the-blockchain/",False

Unless you launder your black money, then it`s another story.    -- the rules says clearly - IF YOU transfer/deposit bigger amount than rules says what happens? Can you do that?

The fact that he has been a member of EU parliament sure sounds like a serious title, which should give a lot of credibility, but everyone should keep in mind that its the people of the country who elect the parliament members, and there have been many occasions where total incompetent idiots have been put in those posts, not only from Lithuania, mind you.  But my point here is, the Tony G character has had a fair deal of not so righteous stuff done in the past, take the newest leak of off shore documents - the so called Paradise papers, it is quite evident that he has basically hidden a vast fortune obtained through shady deals with Poker Stars concerning the news site pokernews.net  Here is a link to a non yellow-paper newspaper about this, its in Lithuanian, but Google translate should help: https://www.15min.lt/naujiena/aktualu/lietuva/paradise-papers-kaip-antanas-guoga-mus-aplose-ir-is-kur-jo-pinigai-56-877216   DISCLAIMER: I am not preaching that this project is a scam, all I'm saying is that one or the other person backing this should not necessarily be reason to call the project trustworthy. Another example - a Lithuanian politician- past mayor of the capital - major shady league player Arturas Zuokas has been the face of a project called ""Token Desk"" (which is in my opinion 99% a scam), which is also funded by a LOT of shady Lithuanian businessmen with lots of black spots in their histories.

I participated in the pre-ico so it's a little different story but for those thinking of participating, it might not be very profitable.  Since ICO is until end of Feb and they have heavy marketing, it's almost certain it will reach the hard cap.  Total Funds Raised = Pre-ico + ICO = 2,500,000,000*0.01 + 1,000,000,000(0.017+0.018+0.019+0.02+0.021+0.022+0.023) + 500,000,000*0.024 = 155,000,000 EUR = 182,674,475 USD (today's rate)  Assuming my calculation is correct, it means right after the ICO, 1 BNK = 182,674,475 USD/(2,500,000,000 BNK + 7,500,000,000 BNK) = 0.01827 USD or 0.02 EUR, so people investing after 0.02 EUR, so from 4,000,000,000+ BNK during the ICO is losing from the start.  Then, now to think about market cap, it is certainly not easy to reach 182,674,475 USD in market cap, since it will land BNK to about 30th in cmc. Although in the long term I think it is attainable, and even if after Banker immediately reach this valuation, the profit is not great.  When say BNK reach 400,000,000 USD in market cap, basically doubled, 1 BNK = 400,000,000 USD/10,000,000,000 BNK = 0.04 USD This means even the early investors who bough BNK at 0.017EUR = 0.02USD would only have doubled but those at 0.023EUR = 0.03USD would have 33.3% gain. If you participate late, not amazing at all.  So I guess my point is either you invest early or you don't invest at all and look for other ICOs to invest.",False

Since the total supply will increase four times (pre-ico was 10%, ICO is 30%) and it's obvious for at least one or two years the Bankera's net transaction revenue will not show the same growth so the 20% that was being paid out will be nothing close to the 3% we see now. 4 times more BNK to share that 20% basically. But let's be extremely optimistic and say we take about 3% ROR after the ICO too, but if the market cap as I calculated does not perform, the ROR will very quick turn negative making late investors having very little financial incentive to invest. So from investor's pov if the market cap does not hold, the dividends are negligible and will face a loss. So I guess for the late investors this is not a good investment. I'm making this point because if people invest late, they will be facing a great risk and loss from the beginning and by them not investing it is very beneficial for the early investors like us.. win-win I guess. I would like to hear what you guys have to say about this..",False

Since our last update, we have launched several exciting features which users can currently try at SpectroCoin.  First of all, we have launched IBAN’s for both: individuals and companies. Thus, just like in banks, clients can now make fast and secure transfers in the Eurozone.  We have also launched cryptocurrency powered cards. Unlike the previous pre-paid debit cards that required the users to pre-fund their cards before POS/cashing-out, the debit cards are now linked directly to the user’s active cryptocurrency wallet at all times and allow spending and cashing out cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether or Dash seamlessly in your everyday life. Currently, these cards are only available to customers who reside at the European territory, however, we are developing a worldwide solution for our clients.  At the moment, we are also focusing on being able to provide deposit, withdrawal and exchange services for XEM before the ICO, since we have many NEM supporters among Bankera investors and we want to enable BNK purchase with a variety of different methods for our investors’ convenience.  Since our last update, we have also welcomed seven new team members in the IT, marketing and support departments which will help us to prepare more efficiently for the upcoming ICO.  We know you are awaiting for Bankera’s own debit cards and mobile app, which we are currently working on as well. In addition, as we have mentioned in our last update, we do not see the pre-ICO and ICO as just token sales: we want to develop a successful long-term project. Thus, we want to test all the new features we implement thoroughly before the ICO in order to ensure a smooth operation during our ICO. To match some of the development phase completion dates we have adjusted the ICO date. As a result, the ICO will take place at the end of November. The exact day will be announced by the end of next week in our official communication channels (please do not believe the news published in any unofficial channels).

If the ICO sells out, the market cap will be around 180MM, which is a pretty insane amount. Then yes, we'll see a major sell-off. However, it is more likely that the ICO will not sell out. The pre-sale was open for quite a while and 2.5B tokens were sold. So they're going to sell three times that amount at a much more expensive price €0.010 (pre-ico) -> €0.017-0.025 (ico). I highly doubt they'll get even close to their hard cap.  Perhaps if the ICO is not that successful and they burn plenty of tokens I can see the prices remaining stable post-ICO.  However, I do like this project which has the potential to achieve mass adoption. Also, they are taking their time to develop the product before launching their ICO, which is very positive. This might mean that they might actually come close to reaching their hard cap. We'll see. Either way, this is an interesting project to follow.",False

It looks like Bankera have made some changes to their Secondary ICO by lowering the coin offering from up to 25bil to just 10bil. This is a good thing as it's clear this is a long term play and this ICO was never going to benefit from the crazy speculating of some other ICO's where punters were looking to flip (Enigma, Monetha etc).   The early payout (relative to the investment) is only 4.5% annualised however this is based on current traffic.  This is both good and bad as all Spectrocoin throughput would have been artificially inflated by this very ICO however you might expect the long term outlook would include bank loans being issued which would drive this figure up.  So, less coins for the moment and the ICO will not be an overnight success but no surprises there.  My only concern is releasing the next wave of coins at .1EUR into a downward market.   Whether you like it or not, another bubble is here and it will burst just like the 4 other occasions since 2009.  cheers NFI.",False

I have been a Spectrocoin user for a while and am very happy with it. I can see that this is the way forward.  The Bankera tokens, however, are next to worthless by any reasonably objective measure.  They don't represent equity in any of the banking capital base (the way say, Bitshares does). The market cap is so high out of the gate that there's barely any upside in them as a security (compared with investing in say, top-10 cryptos directly) and the dividend is miniscule on a slither of profit margin. Even if it weren't, there's no priority for token holders since the banking entity can simply adjust the corporate reporting protocol to squeeze dividends out of the picture if revenue is tight.  The upside is all in the issuer's equity, not the tokens. But - being registered in the British Virgin Islands - good luck in getting your hands on any of that or even measuring it. Minimising transparency is as high a priority for this issuer as maximising takings of people's cryptographic capital.  It's not 20% of profits, it's 20% on a particular element of profits (net transaction fees) which makes it an expense, not a dividend. Ergo: conflicting incentives between the banking operation executives and token investors on top of everything else.  Pretty miserable. Think I'd rather have the BTC than the tokens. (So would Bankera apparently )",False

I personally not value Lithuanian Bank license very high. There are some banana-republics that have more credibility than Lithuania which is below Botswana, Saint Lucia, Cape Verde and the Dominican Republic in last year's global corruption rank.  Just that you know, across the European Union, authorised small specialist banks, have to meet the definition and hold an absolute minimum amount of capital equal to €5m or £5m (whichever is higher), plus a capital planning buffer. Once capital resources exceed €5 million it ceases to be a specialist bank and Bankera would therefore not qualify for being a specialist bank.  Why can't you answer my earlier simple question???  Bankera is looking to raise a lot of money, but it cannot use it for the purpose it claims. How will this work, because the CET1 capital requirements are against equity and Bankera ICO is not about equity, hence it cannot use the proceeds for the purpose it claims. This is very confusing.

I'VE TAKEN THE LIBERTY TO CHANGE IT ACCORDINGLY IN THE ANN TRANSLATION I WAS ASSIGNED TO   Don't miss out! Get your own Banker from 28th of August! Participate in the pre-ICO at SpectroCoin.com   FACEBOOK - TWITTER - LINKEDIN - SLACK - TELEGRAM  WEBSITE     WHITEPAPER  Bankera   Digital technology has changed the face of finance. Most notably, perhaps, the birth of Blockhain has enabled us to digitalize money via cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. There have been many attempts to apply Blockchain technology to revolutionize other finance sectors. However, so far, most FinTech companies have been focusing only on a certain niche (e.g. remittances or lending) as they cannot take advantage of economies of scale enjoyed by traditional banks. Traditional banks, although have the funds, are not as fast at adopting new technologies as they are held up by legacy systems.  Bankera aims to revolutionize banking by taking advantage of what blockchain technology has to offer while still focusing on scale. This means that Bankera seeks to become one-stop store for all financial services, in the same way traditional bricks and mortar banks are now, while using technology to reduce the number of counterparties, thus lowering the cost of banking for the end consumer. Adoption of blockchain technology will also allow Bankera to offer new and unique solutions to its customers.   Services   Bankera will offer three core lines of services:   Payments including payment accounts with personal IBAN, debit cards, interbank foreign exchange rates and payment processing. All services will support both traditional fiat currencies as well as cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, DASH, NEM, ERC20 compliant tokens and others. In the long term, Bankera will implement innovative solutions as gross-domestic-product (GDP) linked currencies or use equity traded funds as a substitute for money.  Loans and deposits will be a key competitive edge as well as core service of Bankera. Not only saving, but also current deposits will receive interest. All Bankera clients will be able to benefit from higher interest rates due to proprietary information about borrowers' cash flows as most loans will be given to business clients of payment processing solution.  Investments solution will consist of low-cost investment products such as equity traded funds (ETFs), crypto-funds (a portfolio of various cryptocurrencies and crypto tokens) as well as roboadvisory solutions for wealth management. Later on, Bankera will offer investment banking services including financing corporate strategies of our business clients.    Status Quo of Bankera   Bankera will be operational and will have significant IT infrastructure in place prior to the initial coin offering (ICO).  Bankera already has the necessary regulatory and IT arrangements to offer individual international bank account numbers (IBAN) which can accept and make payments in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). Bankera also offers competitive foreign currency exchange rates, quick and cost effective international bank wires as well as having the “Bankera Payment Card” linked to cardholder’s payment account.  All of these services can be tested at SpectroCoin, cryptocurrency exchange, e-wallet, debit card and payment processor provider of which Bankera will be an operational fork. What has been developed so far will serve as a minimum viable product for Bankera to begin operations. However, to achieve its goal to become a fully operational bank service, Bankera needs to obtain capital.    Initial Coin Offering (ICO)   To implement its vision Bankera is launching its own initial coin offering (ICO).  During ICO, Bankera will issue virtual currency tokens called Bankers (BNK) on the Ethereum blockchain operated by a smart contract and following the ERC20 protocol. The value of each token will depend on the net transaction revenue commission share paid to token’s holder each week.   First, 20% of net transaction revenues of Bankera tokens will be exchanged to ether every week.  Second, all ethers will be sent to Bankera’s smart contract.  Third, smart contract will distribute ethers to holders of Bankera tokens pro-rata (i.e. if a holder has 1 % of all outstanding Bankera's tokens, he will receive 1 % of all revenue share.)   This means that Banker owners can earn commission by recommending it to others through word-of-mouth.  On August 28th, we will launch a pre-ICO and we will offer 10 % of tokens to the public.  In mid-October we will launch ICO campaign and we will offer 30 % of tokens to the public.  An additional 30% of the tokens will be offered during a future Secondary Coin Offering (SCO) but never at a pricepoint lower than 0,1 Euro per BNK.  The remaining tokens will be allocated to employees and advisors. 25% of the tokens will be allocated to employees and be used for bounties to promote the ICO. 5% will be attributed to advisors who will advise us for several years until a fully functional bank will be in operation.  The price of a token during pre-ICO will be 1 euro cent and the price during ICO will depend on the total number of tokens issued during pre-ICO.   Don't miss out!

There have been many attempts to apply Blockchain technology to revolutionise other financial sectors. However, so far, most FinTech companies have been focusing only on a specific niche (e.g., remittances or lending) as they cannot take advantage of the economies of scale enjoyed by traditional banks. Traditional banks, despite having funds, are not as fast at adopting new technologies, being held up by legacy systems.  Bankera aims to revolutionise banking by taking advantage of what blockchain technology has to offer while still focusing on the scale. This means that Bankera seeks to become a one-stop solution for all financial services, in the same way, traditional brick and mortar banks are now, while using technology to reduce the number of counterparties and thus lowering the cost of banking for the end consumer. The adoption of blockchain technology will also allow Bankera to offer new and unique solutions to its customers.    SERVICES   EXCHANGE  Bankera Exchange is a global platform designed for secure and efficient cryptocurrency trading. The exchange currently supports Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), Dash (DASH), NEM (XEM), as well as Bankera’s own Banker (BNK) token. More cryptocurrencies are coming in the near future.  Bankera Exchange users can take advantage of exclusive benefits:  Free and instant deposits from SpectroCoin; Fee-free trading with all BNK pairs.  SIGN UP NOW   BROKERAGE  SpectroCoin, the first product of Bankera’s ecosystem, is a cryptocurrency brokerage with wallet, prepaid card, and payment processing solutions, operating in the market since 2013. The brokerage already has nearly one million users and provides its services in various languages backed by a 24/7 support team. Currently, SpectroCoin supports BTC, ETH, USDT, NEM, DASH cryptocurrencies, BNK tokenens, and over 20 different fiat currencies.  TRY OUR SERVICE   LOANS  Bankera will leverage its technology to offer crypto-backed loans for crypto-market participants who seek to get assets without selling their cryptocurrencies. The platform will provide swift loans for multiple jurisdictions, secure storage, and competitive loan to value ratios.  SIGN UP  WALLET  Bankera Wallet will provide access to a wide spectrum of traditional payment options for seamless deposits and withdrawals. The web and mobile (iOS, Android, Windows Phone) applications will allow you to access your assets from wherever you are.   INVESTMENT TOOLS  Bankera Investment Tools software will merge consulting services with artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. We will offer various investment solutions for individuals and businesses, such as low-cost exchange-traded funds, trading, advisory, brokerage, custody and wealth management.   ",False

However, SpectroCoin was and is created to be a solution for cryptocurrencies: wallet, exchange etc, but to be successful we have developed a lot of bank-like features such as debit cards, IBANs (personalized international bank account numbers to be live soon). So now we are doing a fork and will continue to develop SpectroCoin as a solution for cryptocurrencies, while Bankera will enter a banking sector by offering more banking products such as investments, not only crypto payment processing and deposits and savings.
