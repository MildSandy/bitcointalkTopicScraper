Soon you will be able to increase the number of your tokens! See the following information. We invite investors.   Blockchain application ""ALARM CLOCK""  This is my proposal should be interesting to all holders of tokens on the Ethereum platform. All of us are now in a bear market, and everyone is interested in increasing the value of our assets. I propose to create an application for working with a smart contract, which will attract new holders, enhance trade in tokens on exchanges, and thus ensure the growth of their value.  Question: What can encourage members of a crypto community to buy tokens? Answer: The opportunity to make a profit. Question: What can cause a stir around the token? Answer: The ability to make a profit quickly. Question: How can this be done? Answer: Play the right to receive additional volume of tokens among holders without any risk on their part. Question: Who can take part in the raffle? Answer: Any token holder who will make the required number of tokens on the term deposit of a smart contract. Question: If I do not win? Answer: You will pick up tokens after the expiration of the deposit. Question: Who replenishes the prize fund? Answer: Developers, or any other token holder interested in its advertising.  This means that holders or developers who are interested in increasing the value of the token should donate a small part of their tokens to create a prize pool, which will subsequently be played out among those holders of this token who will take part in the raffle.  Brief description of the main functionality of the smart contract: 1. Replenish the prize pool from an arbitrary address in favor of any ERC 20 token. 2. Method for reading information about the size of the prize fund. 3. Depositing tokens on a term deposit to participate in the drawing from an arbitrary address. 4. Method for reading information about the number of lottery tickets for a specific address. 5. Function to set the cost of one lottery ticket for the selected token. 6. Method for reading information about the cost of a lottery ticket for the selected token. 7. The function of setting the minimum number of tokens in the prize fund, the number of prizes and the proportions of the division of the prize fund among the prizes. 8. Method for reading information entered through the function described in paragraph 7. 9. Function for withdrawal of tokens of participants of the drawing, who are on the balance of a certain address after the drawing and the expiration of the deposit. 10. Method for reading for viewing the deposit term information for a specific address. 11. Function to determine the winners and the distribution of the prize fund. 12. The function for the distribution of profits of a smart contract among investors in the creation of an application.  Investors' addresses will be entered into a smart contract when deployed. 70% of the profit of the smart contract will be distributed among investors. The profit of the smart contract will consist of commissions from the replenishment of the prize fund. The size of the commission will be set by conducting a multi-signature transaction in which more than half of the investors will participate.  The weight of the investor's voice will be determined depending on the size of the investment. To become an investor, send at least 0.1 Eth to 0xC6f4DED1af12fc55aff5D69824EC0792EA463B57 (https://etherscan.io/address/0xC6f4DED1af12fc55aff5D69824EC0792EA463B57). Your address will be added to the smart contract as an investor's address. As a bonus, you will receive DEC tokens. The number of DEC will be calculated by the formula: The amount of your contribution in US dollars (according to etherscan.io) divided by 0.02.  My team and I will begin work when we collect at least 30 Ethers. Hard cap - 100 Ethers.  Investors will receive profits in the form of tokens of advertised projects, since we do not create our own tokens.  P.S. I will be the first to replenish the ALARM CLOCK application prize pool. These will be Digital Economy Coin (DEC) tokens of the new business platform “KOWABUNGA!”",False

Several questions were raised about the price of the token, node balances, and public listings.  We currently assume that the price of the token is $0.03. Of course, in reality the price will be determined by the market once we are out on exchanges. That is why we don't want to just dump the token there and instead are looking to be out towards the end of Q1 2019, by which time we will have enough promotional momentum to generate initial demand and come out at a good price.  As one user correctly surmised, we will not be placing an entire amount of tokens all at once or all in one year even. We will carefully manage the supply, as to ensure that the price has an upward momentum - for the benefit of all current token holders (which include ourselves).  As for the nodes, there will be a minimum balance of tokens a node must hold, but the actual amount will vary depending on the size of the business and the node's purpose. We expect that for starting out, the average node will have around 300,000 DEC tokens each. With time, bigger nodes will register and require even greater sums of DEC.",False

BGX ELEVATES THEIR CAPABILITIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY- DRIVEN WORLD.  CUSTOMER-FACING BUSINESS UNDER IMMENSE PRESSURES COOPERATION WITH OTHER BUSINESSES FOR CUSTOMERS, PRODUCT CREATION, EXPERIENCE ENHANCEMENT, AND OFFERING ADDED VALUE IS THE ONLY WAY TO SURVIVE UNDER INCREASING PRESSURE OF GLOBALIZED ONLINE COMPETITORS AND NEW WAVES OF TECHNOLOGY-INFORMED CONSUMERS  Digital transformation, internet-native consumers, and market saturation are creating challenges and opportunities for all customer- centric businesses.  Profits on core products often fall faster than costs of making them. Innovation is difficult to perform in most large corporations, which are being pushed by younger, disruptive projects. The companies that thrive in this environment are those that are capable of adapting their business model to the new conditions.  The essential part of a successful modern business model is cooperation. Airlines fall alliances that help them direct the flow of customers. Telecom companies are branching out into digital media, placing monetizable content into the consumer devices they already have access to.  However, this process is painstakingly slow. One-on-one deals take long to form and are ineffective. While building a coherent ecosystem of loyal customer communities, business partners, omni- channel communication, data utilization – that can take years.  THE BGX NETWORK MAKES BUSINESS ECOSYSTEMS EASY AND EFFECTIVE DECENTRALIZATION AS THE MEANS TO BRING IN PARTNERS EASILY, AS THE MEANS FOR COOPERATIVE UNITY.  BGX is a decentralized solution that eliminates intermediaries and excess costs, while allowing businesses to easily attract new partners.  BGX is irreplaceable in dealing with competitive threats in a customer-facing industry, a market with a large number of participants, a conflicted environment, and where digital data and goods are involved.  BGX unites businesses that sell related goods. A national marathon event opens up a top node on BGX. A running store joins the ecosystem and every time someone signs up for the marathon, they get “run points” to spend at the running store. A gym chains joins the circulation. Then come podcasts, fitness brands, sport events, advertisers... united by the common customer they share. Developing this infrastructure would take years for each industry, each business. Not with BGX.  BGX unites businesses that sell unrelated goods too. A coffee shop chain awards 3 “cup points” for every $1 spent inside. These cup points can be redeemed at one of the four national telecom providers, who joined the coffee shop’s ecosystem. Every customer that buys a coffee at the chain now has a subsidized phone bill. That’s added value other coffee chains can’t offer. Meanwhile the telecom giant gets recommended to a customer, new and old, every time they buy a coffee at the large chain. That’s a serious advantage in a saturated phone service market. Each new business participant in the ecosystem makes it grow and adds value.  BGX unites businesses down the value chain, optimizing logistics, allowing businesses instant data analysis and statistics on their franchises and offices.  BGX allows the most far-seeing business in a saturated market to step back, open a top node, and start earning from directing data and customers between what used to be its competitors, but are now its business clients.  Whatever the use case may be, the versatile, scalable, and integrative nature of BGX allows companies to build synergetic ecosystems, without the need to develop the technological infrastructure or thousands of relationships themselves.   EFFECTIVE BUSINESS INTEGRATION BGX developed the technological infrastructure to allow businesses attract partners that share the same customers, data, or value creation opportunity with them. The initializing business has control over who joins their ecosystem, but could leave it open for a company in any region, of any size, and in any market to join and contribute its customers, data and value.   INSTANTANEOUS DATA CLEARING Without a decentralized database like BGX, businesses have no ability to process all of the data coming from their omni-channel interactions, their social media engages users, or even in their own complicated supply chains. With BGX, there is no need to hire an army of financial analysts or integrate complicated software that is already obsolete once it’s fused into the company’s processes. With BGX, data is stored securely and insight is available fast for the right business decisions.   DIGITAL GOODS BGX is one of the only decentralized ledgers that allows the transfer of not just finances, or device data, but also any kind of digital good. That enables businesses to take advantage of the additional opportunities connected with offering more value to their customers, or earning from processing purchases on digital content.   PILOT OPPORTUNITY Currently, BGX is launching its pilot projects with a few select partners. To open a node, a business must purchase a certain number of DEC Tokens that will enable them to emit the inter-platform currency. However, during this stage of implementation, we provide the DEC Tokens free of charge, adapt the network towards specific needs, and integrate businesses into the network both free and risk- free. This gives us the opportunity to demonstrate the extreme versatility of our network, while allowing businesses to try out BGX and become part of the new economy.

Yes, our platform is designed for businesses. We believe that if we help businesses lower costs, manage data effectively and with respect to privacy, as well as to create new cross-business products that they couldn't before - that would not only help companies, but BGX consumers as well.  While we focus on businesses in a few key industries, none of which are games-related, any game business can join and create a gaming ecosystem that would be far more advanced than our original idea allowed.  Not only did we broaden our direction, our benefits increased tenfold! All this will allow us to create a far more superior product.",False

If we have customers on one side, the public chain in the middle, and customer-oriented businesses on the other side, then businesses have access to customer data, while customers remain anonymous on the public chain. But that's just one case. In all cases, we want to keep privacy in the hands of customers that use BGX, so unless they opt in, no one will be able to access their data. If they do give permissions, then businesses have a far better tool to use this data to tailor their offers than with traditional blockchains or enterprise systems.  Moreover, an important fact of our model is the cooperation between businesses themselves. So, for example, data may be easily shared and analysed between various participants in a single supply chain. A grocery store chain on BGX would be able to know where each food item was processed, stored, for how long, etc. - and be alerted at a moment's notice if a delivery is delayed; plus analyze the effectiveness of selling a given item at each of its outlets; plus manage customer omni-channel marketing flow, and etc. This opens new possibilities in identifying patterns and optimizing the business model.  As to answer your direct question - yes, application data can be encrypted.",False

The core differentiators of the transformative BGX distributed networks are the hierarchal nature of nodes, the ability to exchange digital assets, not just currency, and the dual token system.  BGX is a new generation ledger without blocks and miners. Nodes are combined into clusters, with each node owned by an independent business. Within a cluster, a quorum is reached of independent, and often competing businesses, which go through several rounds of voting to validate a transaction.  The now immutable data is then placed in a special structure of the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) instead of blocks.  Nodes also play another important role. By holding a certain amount of ERC_777 DEC tokens, they can emit white-label BGT Coins, a currency native to the network. The high-growth DEC coins cater to the interests of its holders by rising in price, while BGT coins remain stable in price, protecting consumers from volatility.  Moreover, dubious BGT transactions may always be dropped to a third-party public network for verification (Ethereum through DEC), which is protected by Proof-of-Work.

The DEC is the ERC-20 token. It will be traded on exchanges and available for investors. It will be required for node operators to open a node and every DEC token held by a node will have the right to emit and process a certain number of BGT coins.  The BGT coins are the ones actually used for the platform transactions. While DEC is volatile (being traded on an open exchange market), the BGT coins will always be worth $0.10 USD each, minimizing the effect of inflation.  This way, investors get a high-growth token with limited supply, demand pressure from nodes, and tradeability on exchanges. Consumers are protected from crypto-volatility by using the BGT coin. And since nodes possess DEC, each dubious transaction gets dropped down to Ethereum miners to verify, thus adding an extra layer of security.",False

AT&P itself will hold a node and process (& earn from) each transaction their user makes in interacting with the content.  Meanwhile, 22nd Century Fox doesn’t have to make a deal with AT&P directly.

CONTENT PROVIDER <-> NODE HOLDER   Let’s say that on one end, we have a movie studio (let’s call them 22nd Century Fox) seeking new ways to deliver content to more people. Fewer folks are watching TV nowadays and piracy is rampant.  On the other end, we have AT&P, a Telecom company — whose main profit is squeezed by smaller margins, while their total market is almost fully tapped. They are already seeking to earn from bringing digital content into homes.  While AT&P can make a deal with 22nd Century Fox directly, they can go a smarter way. AT&P can join BGX and have access to content from 22nd Century Fox, Columbia Sounds, as well as hundreds of smaller movie studios across the world — providing them with diversified content, without the need to create any of their own. Moreover, since BGX is also a delivery network — they do not have to build an infrastructure to join, just provide access to their users. AT&P itself will hold a node and process (& earn from) each transaction their user makes in interacting with the content.  Meanwhile, 22nd Century Fox doesn’t have to make a deal with AT&P directly. They join the BGX Network and access the users of AT&P, as well as those of TT-Mobile, Virginia Mobile, and other networks. That’s a far more powerful channel.",False

BUSINESS WITH FOLLOWERS <-> NODE HOLDER   Let’s say Starpucks wants to join the BGX network. Instead of having blank loyalty cards, that don’t enable them to truly get to know their customers, Starpucks emits S-Coins (using the white-label BGT coin emitted on BGX).  Every customer of Starpucks now gets 50 S-Coins for their every purchase or a bunch of S-Coins when they sign up for the Starpucks app. These coins are redeemable at any business of the BGX Network, say — AT&P gives free data for a month for 1000 S-Coins.  Starpucks creates a value-added service that the other coffee shops can’t match.  AT&P gets introduced to Starpucks coffee buyers (like 38 million of Americans each month) and the steady oligopoly where they hold 30% of the market is about to tip massively in their favour.  What has formed is like an airline alliance, except an Alliance where those earning more from cooperation are companies from different industries.  If Starpucks and AT&P decide to form a partnership now, who knows how long will it take for them to build an infrastructure for it? And if they build it after a year of expensive R&D, it will be exclusive to them only. The real power starts when participants of other industries join the cooperative too.",False

That means overcoming the common problems plaguing the blockchains: low scalability, high transaction costs, hidden centralization. Moreover, it means that we have to be integrative, allowing easy access to our system for businesses and consumers alike.  That hasn’t changed. We are building an innovative decentralized platform consisting of 9000+ independently held nodes that conduct processing in clusters, through the Federative Byzantine Agreement based consensus (that we’ll call proof-of-loyalty). Without getting too technical, we are abandoning the useless work in forming blocks and directing the economic incentive towards the competition between businesses holding the nodes.  What has changed is our model.  The model we are building is what we’re calling BBC: Business — Business — Consumer (as opposed to B2B or B2C or P2P). We know it could be confused with a certain famous broadcasting network, but hear us out… BBC means that while keeping the end consumer in mind, the core of our benefit is from business — business synergy.  One business processes the transactions — these are large corporations with a user base that they can earn from, if they would only have some additional value added services to sell.  The second business is the provider of the content that is being sold — seeking access to users and a payment infrastructure.  BGX is the one developing an infrastructure where each business can plug in within less than a week and start earning in a cost-effective decentralized way.  This synergy is greater when the businesses are in unrelated industries — and that’s where we can bring the most value. See our Cases.  And oh. Yeah. Our market got much, MUCH bigger.",False

LOCAL BUSINESS <-> NODE HOLDER   A local light shop, say it’s named Lights On is located in a small, but charming city Fargo, North Dakota.  One of the BGX node holders, say AT&P, is taking an interest in helping local shops. AT&P provides its users with an ATP coin when users sign up for its services, which can be used at any local shop that’s part of the BGX network.  Now that’s extra value to the “Fargo-ans” (“Fargonians”?) that are choosing which telecom to join. Not just residents of Fargo benefit, but residents of every village, town or city where enough businesses joined the BGX network.  Meanwhile, Lights On gets an instant boost in traffic when the city dwellers that have joined one of the largest service network are interested in shopping specifically with them.  Now that’s stronger than just Trip Advisor ratings.  By allowing an additional Business 2 “Business” 2 Customer participant, we avoid the “chicken and the egg problem”. The business that holds the nodes is the one bringing the customers, while the business that sells the digital goods (and loyalty is certainly a digital good) — brings the value.  The BGX’s value is building a bridge to connect many businesses to many businesses by ensuring easy integration and cost-effectiveness of the system.  In our examples, it was the telecom company AT&P that held the nodes. In reality, the nodes can be held by any business (a professional node-holder) that has:  (1) the required DEC token balance;  (2) technological infrastructure that they need to utilize to maximum profit;  (3) a defined user base that they want to get more returns from;  (4) and of course a certain ambition to survive in the economy of tomorrow.",False

That means overcoming the common problems plaguing the blockchains: low scalability, high transaction costs, hidden centralization. Moreover, it means that we have to be integrative, allowing easy access to our system for businesses and consumers alike.  That hasn’t changed. We are building an innovative decentralized platform consisting of 9000+ independently held nodes that conduct processing in clusters, through the Federative Byzantine Agreement based consensus (that we’ll call proof-of-loyalty). Without getting too technical, we are abandoning the useless work in forming blocks and directing the economic incentive towards the competition between businesses holding the nodes.  What has changed is our model.  The model we are building is what we’re calling BBC: Business — Business — Consumer (as opposed to B2B or B2C or P2P). We know it could be confused with a certain famous broadcasting network, but hear us out… BBC means that while keeping the end consumer in mind, the core of our benefit is from business — business synergy.  One business processes the transactions — these are large corporations with a user base that they can earn from, if they would only have some additional value added services to sell.  The second business is the provider of the content that is being sold — seeking access to users and a payment infrastructure.  BGX is the one developing an infrastructure where each business can plug in within less than a week and start earning in a cost-effective decentralized way.  This synergy is greater when the businesses are in unrelated industries — and that’s where we can bring the most value. See our Cases.  And oh. Yeah. Our market got much, MUCH bigger.",False

The decentralized industry is facing what is commonly described as the DSC problem — where decentralization, scalability (high network speed) and cost (low cost for the network) cannot be attained all at once.  Bitcoin and Ethereum are highly decentralized, but transactions are costly and take long to process.  Ripple is much faster, less expensive, but less decentralized.  Meanwhile, BGX has developed a whole new consensus model on the basis of the Federative Byzantine Agreement. We call if proof-of-loyalty. No blocks. Only nodes each owned by businesses earning a small fee from each transaction processes.  A limited number of nodes allows each one to handle enough transactions to remain profitable at low fees. The “cluster” model of the nodes means that a transaction has to be verified by a certain quorum, but not all nodes synchronise all transactions all at once (much faster speeds).  Moreover, there is a planned integration of the top-tier AI system designed to further strengthen security of the network.  The consensus algorithm is fully developed and the alpha version of the network is expected to be live by the end of 2018.",False

The DEC is the ERC-20 token. It will be traded on exchanges and available for investors. It will be required for node operators to open a node and every DEC token held by a node will have the right to emit and process a certain number of BGT coins.  The BGT coins are the ones actually used for the platform transactions. While DEC is volatile (being traded on an open exchange market), the BGT coins will always be worth $0.10 USD each, minimizing the effect of inflation.  This way, investors get a high-growth token with limited supply, demand pressure from nodes, and tradeability on exchanges. Consumers are protected from crypto-volatility by using the BGT coin. And since nodes possess DEC, each dubious transaction gets dropped down to Ethereum miners to verify, thus adding an extra layer of security.",False

Game developers and app markets can easily enter the crypto-economy with BGX. By using the internal token, they can monetize their games and access a large market, while paying only 10% commissions on their revenue. The commission structure is one third of what Play Market and App Store often charge. In exchange, the developers and marketers can access a variety of game-related revenue channels that these larger platforms lack and can use many financial capabilities formerly only possible in the crypto-economy The BGX platform has several key advantages. (1) It uses advanced self-learning artificial intelligence fuzzy network that eliminates fraud. (2) The off-chain hybrid approach to processing transactions enables the BGX platform to process more than 4,000 transactions per second, at a speed and capacity far superior to the Ethereum blockchain. (3) The double-token system separates the interests of the investors and the users, so that the investors can benefit from significant rise in token price, while the economy remains stable through a stable coin. (4) The revenue sharing club enables BGX token holders to share in the revenue of the platform, while the tiered system incentivizes holding of the token, raising its price.

BGX. The first open-source distributed ledger focusing on digital assets. BGX provides a seamless and easy integration between businesses - using decentralization to construct shared ecosystems of customers, data, and cross-products.  Change is coming.  We are out there to change the way companies do business and open up new possibilities for customers from all over the world.    Recent digital transformation trends have seen Fortune 500 companies close, entire industries seen their core product margins being decimated, and well-established corporations gave way to tech unicorns and omni-present giants like Amazon. Google. Alibaba. The companies that have shown the power of involving customers and other businesses in creating value; that have shown ecosystems as the emerging, clearly dominant business model. Yet for most businesses, building such ecosystems is almost impossible. They lack the technological framework. They also lack the economic model that would attract participants; and developing either of those mean large investments into infrastructure, years of development, and… risk. That is what BGX solves.  BGX empowers businesses to deliver more to consumers.  First, BGX allows businesses to operate nodes on its network and form clusters of shared customers, data, and products. BGX provides the much-needed means for seamless vertical, horizontal, and cross-industry integration. Businesses can create complimentary products or shared loyalty alliances. Second, businesses in one value chain share information, with companies having access to instantly available analysis of big data in regards to any supply chain participant or customer, without sacrificing privacy. Third, by being the world’s first blockchain that processes more than just payments or data, but also the creation and delivery of digital goods, BGX becomes an intermediary-free platform for collaborative commerce. Transactions no longer go through layers of intermediaries, financial systems, nation borders, industry divides, regulations and risks. All this is available to a business for almost no investment in almost no time needed to integrate into the network.  BGX empowers businesses to deliver more to consumers.  The engine of BGX, which powers this amazingly versatile system, is the unique F-BFT Consensus. A transformative solution to an ages-old mathematical problem of Byzantine generals, that until recently has been deemed unsolvable, it controls the economic motivation, decentralized trust, processing and near infinite horizontal and vertical scalability of the system. In one sentence, there is no other market-ready technological solution that brings such efficiency to the very foundation of business, no other than BGX.    Highly integrative network.  The BGX Network is highly integrative. Most enterprise software takes years to implement, growing obsolete by the time it’s in. Getting involved with the current blockchain systems as a business is a nightmare of high transaction costs, slow speeds, and weeks of development. BGX does things differently. Easy API integration allows the platform to easily become a part of any corporate information environment. Even additional features, such as having a mobile application or inter-ecosystem currency are white-label instruments provided by the platform. This ensures the maximum number of participants. The BGX Network also features powerful economic mechanisms. The low-fee transactions are processed quickly and are infinitely scalable. The double token system protects the platform’s consumers from crypto-volatility, while also anchoring the verification of nodes in a public proof-of-work system like Ethereum, thus magnifying security. Finally, each business that joins the platform is motivated to bring in their customers and more businesses, thus growing the BGX network’s value and usability exponentially with each new participant.  Unprecedented technology.  Of course, we also have to mention the unprecedented technology of BGX. This includes the powerful artificial intelligence engine designed at top-tier global research facilities. It provides security from the network and instantaneous analysis of data. Differential privacy gives businesses highly targeted information, while protecting the privacy of consumers. BGX has the ability to facilitate any kind of transaction, not just payments, but also the delivery of digital goods. Finally, the innovative information registry is based on the Direct Acyclic Graph, which gives the system very high speeds and horizon0al & vertical scalability.  That is the overview of BGX. The DEC Token, that is central to the system, will hit exchanges soon. So... what do you think?",False
