You filled in token A as the “first"" ERC- 20 you recommend, and Token A gets the most votes (say 100), therefore making it the No. 1 token in our ranking, you will get 5,000/100=50 JOY   Disclaimer  Only valid and completed form will be taken into consideration and qualified as participant of this activity.

Instead, trades occur directly between users, cutting out the need for the customer to trust the exchange and their security practices. However, fully decentralized exchanges put orders and order-matching on the blockchain, risking sub-optimal prices and creating delays that frustrate users and create security/arbitrage risks. Poor liquidity is another issue. JOYSO comprises a decentralized architecture for control of funds and a centralized database for dynamically matching market transactions. Only when a deal is done and tokens are confirmed available is the transaction published on the blockchain. Users do not relinquish control of their assets and have the benefit of a dynamic market where trades are processed sequentially, in near real-time.",False

The trading fee is the amount you pay to us for using JOYSO’s service, which is set around 0.1% from order makers and 0.2% from order takers.   The transaction fee (gas fee) is the fee we pay to miners. Transaction fee fluctuates accordingly to the degree of internet congestion. Discounts from JOY only applies to “trading fee”, but not to “transaction fee”. So if gas fee is what you mean by “transaction fee”.  There will not be a discount.  However, there will be a 50% on your trading fee. To make it clearer, let’s set up an example: If you are the taker and you took a order of  [1A (token) for 1,000 Ether], you pay [1,002 Ether + transaction fee (gas fee) ] in sum.  The 2 coins out of the 1,002 coins is the trading fee paid to us.  If you pay the 2 Ether trading fee in JOY, assuming the market price is 1Ether to 1JOY, you will only need to pay a total of [1,000 Ether + 1 JOY + transaction fee (gas fee) ].

Centralized Exchange  With a centralized exchange you need to trust them to protect your private key from hackers. Your privacy and your crypto are at risk if the exchange is hacked.  Decentralized Exchange  Fully decentralized exchanges are expensive in gas fees and don't do order matching as well as centralized databases. You risk not getting the best price. Users wait for confirmations and in some cases transactions fail.  The Solution: Hybrid-decentralized exchange (HEX)  The future is hybrid. Centralize for speed, decentralize for security. With JOYSO we decentralize access. You don't need to trust a central exchange with your private key or personal information. But we centralize order management, improving speed, matching and user experience compared to decentralized exchanges, and reducing costs.  Executive Summary:  This hybrid exchange (HEX), able to handle all ERC20-compatible tokens, eliminates the need to trust a central exchange with your private key or personal information, reducing to a historical minimum any opportunities for hacking. It takes order placement and order matching off-chain, substantially improving the user experience compared to decentralized exchanges.   In brief, the benefits and innovations of the JOYSO model are these:   - All orders are limit orders, giving users the best possible price.                                                                                                                                  - Smart matching is done off-chain, providing fast processing and one-to-many matches.                                                                                                - Smart matching eliminates security issues like front-running and makes arbitrage by the exchange transparent.                                                            - One-to-many matches merge multiple orders into one transaction, so gas fees are substantially lower than in first generation decentralized exchanges.    - The exchange cannot alter the balance in a user’s account, and has no access to the user’s assets.                                                                                - Users do not need to log on to a website; they just sign the bid or ask using their own wallet and send ether directly to the smart contract.                      - Users have the ability to cancel transactions up until they are matched and can even lock the smart contract themselves.                                                - Completed trades are published on the blockchain in a transparent, traceable way.                                                                                                         Compared to its competition, JOYSO has a low cost structure and offers users lower transaction and settlement costs. The marketing strategy includes aggressive pricing (including free listing for ICOs) and professional, targeted digital marketing. The development team comprises eleven people and is based in Taiwan. It has deep connections with the Chinese-speaking Bitcoin and Ethereum communities.   Wallet support currently exists for Metamask and Ledger Nano S. The project is currently in alpha and a beta release is scheduled for June 2018. Proof of concept has been done on all principal functions and the team is ready to migrate the system to the Ethereum Testnet. Margin trading and cross-exchange are part of the second phase launch. 200 million JOY tokens will be issued in total; 100 million of them in an ICO event commencing March 1st, 2018.            Token Sale      How do we generate profit?  Income will be generated from trading fees in ETH or JOY effective from the beta launch; June 2018. These will be set around 0.1% for order makers and 0.2% for order takers.Our price strategy is to attract users with a 50% discount for JOY token use. We will generate transactions and advertising by offering free and frictionless listings to ICOs.Advertising on JOYSO through the JoySelect program will also be competitive, with a 50% discount for ICOs paying with JOY.

(JOY and USDT are not considered as voting options) E.g. You filled in token A as the “first"" ERC- 20 you recommend, and Token A gets the most votes (say 100), therefore making it the No. 1 token on our ranking, you will get 5,000/100=50 JOY   Disclaimer  Only valid and completed form will be taken into consideration and qualified as participant of this activity. The token you recommend must be written under the  ERC-20 contract and qualified as utility token. Two rules are independent.
