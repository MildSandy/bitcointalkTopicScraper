The result is the need for technologies designed to block these viruses, generically called malware (malicious software), at all major network stops, but especially at the terminal end-user point. The throughput of most end-userâ€™s network connections, and thus the amount of potential data consumption, is greatly increasing as well. While network-based detection systems have reached speeds of over 1Gb/s, the speed of actual virus scanning and malware preventive systems has not kept pace. The amount of new malware released onto the public Internet is exploding.  WHAT IS BLOCKAV?  BlockAV is a decentralized antivirus solution which allows decentralization of the update and maintenance mechanisms of the software, traditionally performed by a central host, and uses a staggered scanning mechanism in order to improve performance.
