We faced a difficult task in the form of how to fulfill our obligations before the members of the bounty campaign if we canceled the issuance of DHT tokens, in which it was intended to pay remuneration to the participants. The team DEHEDGE took the decision to reward those who helped us with the tokens of the projects that we provided on our platform. By July 31, 2018 we will prepare a pool of tokens, which will include both current projects and those that will appear in the DEHEDGE portfolio in the near future. After that, bounty campaign participants will receive a 1: 1 remuneration in ETH based on our commitment. You can see the estimated remuneration here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3008695",False

We started the Pre-Sale at a difficult time for the crypto market and have taken into account many of your requests and queries, both in terms of reducing the market rates of the major cryptocurrencies, and regarding the minimum contribution amount required for participation in the Pre-Sale.  Therefore, for the convenience of the community, we have made the following decisions regarding our fundraising:  1) To fix the ETH and BTC exchange rates at the time of the start of the Pre-Sale and receive all further contributions only in ETH. In addition, the DHT exchange rate for the entire Pre-Sale period will be fixed as follows:  1ETH = 36,000 DHT 1BTC = 490,000 DHT  The amount to be raised at the Pre-Sale is 5000 ETH, and 50,000 ETH at the main placement stage.  If you have already purchased DHT Tokens, we will either recalculate the number of tokens in your favor, or leave it unchanged, depending on whether your purchase rate was higher or lower than that fixed in accordance with this clause.  2) To reduce the minimum contribution amount and set a minimum in the amount of 0.1 ETH or 0.01 BTC.  3) To extend the term of the Pre-Sale until April 20, 2018 inclusive.  We appreciate that you, along with us, share the faith in the mission and the future of the crypto market together with DeHedge!",False

DeHegde is a company aiming at creating a decentralized platform for hedging risks of crypto investors. DeHedge plans to create the infrastructure needed to protect ICO and cryptocurrencies investments in case of exchange rate fluctuations, fraud and bankruptcy of projects, offering its clients two basic hedging strategies: hedging initial token offerings and trading token exchange rate having free circulation.  The idea of crypto insurance is not new, several decentralized projects such as Cryptosterling, B.Sure and others, as well as a number of centralized banks, for example, Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, work on it. However, these companies implement local initiatives, but only DeHedge and B.Sure, declare insurance of the traders’ losses risk during market fluctuations directly.  The project's founders are public figures with experience in major Russian banks, hedge funds and business incubators, the staff of the project is balanced having competences in software, finance, marketing and jurisprudence. There are the well-known lawyer with experience in the cryptocurrencies regulation, the chief editor of CryptoCoinNews, the senior partner of Belgravia Wealth Management and the financier with extensive experience in dealing with risks in Troika Dialog and Sberbank CIB among the project's advisers. There are Derebit, Shivom, and Priority Token among project partners.  The DHT token will be used as an insurance premium payment and has utility-token features. The team also presents the test results on the non-recognition of the token as a security. In addition, the project team states that they are working to obtain the appropriate SEC licenses to work with institutional investors, and there are corresponding entries in the SEC archives. However, practice shows that the SEC is skeptical about cryptocurrencies, and this initiative is difficult to implement.  The tech side needs further development, the smart contract code for ICO and Pre-ICO has not been published on GitHub.  The project has already provided the first proposal for hedging Shivon tokens, that can be purchased through the DeHedge website, but there is one hedging option available that covers only 50% of the value of the purchased tokens at the moment.  In general, the DeHedge’s idea is pressing and promising, but the lack of information on the methodology does not allow to fully assess the potential of the project. If more hedging options will launch in time and more other ICO projects will be involved, DeHedge can compete with other projects in the multibillion hedge and crypto insurance market, optimize price risks for the target audience of the crypto industry, attract traditional investors to the cryptocurrency market, as well as attract investors, cryptocurrency traders, and funds managing the capital of trustees into ICO projects.

This is a good question that you are asking. We don't guarantee that the ICO prices will not dump. This is of course always a possibility, but please note that this is not automatic.  DeHedge will (through its MVP) offer a coverage of up to 50% decrease in the initial ICO price (for a certain period of time). So if the price drop immediately by 10-20% following the ICO, will all the investors claim their loss (and by doing so, end their ""contract"" with DeHedge). We don't think so. A smarter move seems to wait to be closer to the expiration date of the coverage to see if it is worth claiming the loss. By that time, the price will have had time to potentially increase again.  Following the ICO (which will allow DeHedge to constitute strong reserves), the company will be able to offer coverage greater than 50%.  Hopes this answers your question.",False

One of the most important tasks of the Pre-Sale is obtaining RegD, a special document issued by the US Securities Commission, but there are several more goals. A comment by the head of the Legal Service, Maria Andrianova:  “We need to do a lot of things, besides RegD. Firstly, it is the creation of a working group of legal entities with division of responsibility and functionality, under the presence of existing directors. Depending on the selected jurisdictions and the required number of legal entities, the cost of creating such a group can be very significant. We have “expensive” jurisdictions in our group. That is the UK and the Isle of Man. We have real directors who receive wages at average median rates that operate on the territories of the selected jurisdictions. The opening of bank accounts is also required, OPEX is also significant as our work requires highly qualified specialists. Our structure cost us more than 100,000 US dollars.  The best legal advisers of the market and the best risk specialists are working for us. Just consultations on the establishment of the structure and the procedure for Regulation D in the USA, the countries of Asia and Canada cost us about $150,000, and this is because we are sensible about money and we always conduct tender procedures when selecting contractors.” https://medium.com/@DeHedge/dehedge-is-looking-for-maximum-legalization-1bc2f98c5ab5",False

In one situation, they consider cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets as “miscellaneous property” with an obvious legal status and tend to include it into the taxable base and bankruptcy clauses. For example, it happened in the bankruptcy case of a Russian citizen named Igor Tsarkov (case No. A40–124668/2017). On the 2nd of February, 2018, the Moscow Arbitrary Court disclosed its position that cryptocurrency in a digital wallet of an insolvent individual shall be included into bankruptcy clauses and distributed among the creditors in bankruptcy proceedings.  Tsarkov’s defense insisted that cryptocurrency could not be taken into account when forming bankruptcy cases because of absence of regulation. Nevertheless, the court requested that Tsarkov provide access to his digital wallet and provide information on cryptoassets. The next hearing is scheduled on the 26th of February, 2018. There were some other bankruptcy cases during which Russian courts held their position that there was no reason as to why cryptocurrencies should be excluded from the bankruptcy clauses.  However, in another situation, the Russian Ministry of Labor took a different approach. It decided that government officials should not declare their income in cryptocurrency for the period of 2017, because the status of cryptocurrency is not properly defined and since there is no regulation.  DeHedge hopes that such discrepancies will be eliminated with the passing of new legislation in the summer of 2018 and this legislation will lead to equal, clear, transparent and predictable approaches to cryptocurrency related issues in Russia.  Before such legislation is passed, however, cryptocurrency market participants will have to act on assumption that absence of regulation might result in interpretation of a particular situation by enforcers in favor of the latter.  https://medium.com/@DeHedge/dehedge-legal-department-cryptocurrency-double-standards-ad3269b09c6a",False

The identity of this person or program has not yet been determined, but the DeHedge security service is working on this issue.  CTO of DeHedge, Vasilii Artemev, said that due to the high popularity of the project, such fraudulent proposals can appear with high frequency again on behalf of different employees of DeHedge. Vasilii Artemev urged everyone to be vigilant and immediately report suspicious activities either directly in the chat room or on our dehedge.com page  The security service of DeHedge would like to remind that neither DeHedge nor any of its employees will ever demand money under any pretext. All wallets for the participants of the ICO project are on the official website of dehedge.com and are not shared in any form.  The CEO of DeHedge, Mikhail Chernov, made in YouTube an announcement regarding today's incident: «Hi everybody! Today, my virtual clone appeared in our Telegraph chat groups. He was asking for money, but we caught him. DeHedge has always taken care of its clients, and we will always warn you of any cases of fraud at the ICO.

DeHedge was the first to enter the ICO market with a program aimed at combatting unscrupulous entrepreneurs eager to cash in on the uncontrolled flow of large sums of money in the new cryptocurrency industry.

DeHedge offers investors the chance to retain their original investments in case of events leading to drops in the exchange rates of the project tokens they hold.

Seriously, hacker attacks on ICO websites recently have become common and the culprits are managing to misappropriate considerable funds due to a lack of proper security measures. For such reasons, many ICOs have begun implementing two factor identification on user personal profile pages, boosting security scripts and enhancing firewalls.

DeHedge will not be conducting a Pre-Sale of its project tokens in order to improve the legal basis of the project and protect investors around the world from any risks associated with violation of relevant laws. To enable citizens of more countries to invest in the project and to comply with the regulatory requirements of the United States and the European Union in this regard, DeHedge announces the suspension of the Pre-Sale of its project tokens. The CEO of DeHedge, Mikhail Chernov, stated that the cancellation of the Pre-Sale was expected due to the great interest in the organization from international investors, especially from the United States of America and Europe. In order for DeHedge to become a new type of ICO brand that fully complies with the legislation of all countries, where the circulation of cryptocurrencies is not prohibited, the legal team of the project has recommended the creation of a full Legal Opinion and the passage of the registration process of the firm to the United States with the receipt of Regulation ""D"", the opening of a brokerage account in the North American financial system and the conduct of the KYC procedure under the supervision of the Securities and Exchange Commission (US). Mikhail Chernov assured the public that the company will continue to accept financing on special terms for the speedy release of the DeHedge investment product in the international legal field. ""Once again we want to double-check everything and ascertain ourselves in the opinion that everything is legal and there are no gaps in the legality of doing business in all legal systems. We want to protect our investors as much as possible, wherever they are. Investment security and zero appetite for risk are the pillars on which DeHedge is built. We are adamant in our thoroughness in all procedures and assessments, especially after we have published the Manifesto of a Respectable Startup, "" - said Mikhail Chernov. On November 29, 2017, DeHedge issued the Manifesto of a Respectable Startup, in which it highlighted the existence of a large number of fraudulent and unauthorized operations in the blockchain market. DeHedge has taken the initiative to clear the ICO market of unscrupulous entrepreneurs, offering blockchain opinion leaders to join the Manifesto.

DeHedge is a company, whose activities are aimed at protecting the interests of cryptocurrency investors and projects, advancing the development of the crypto economy as a whole.  The founders of DeHedge are confident that the development of the cryptocurrency market depends on the safety of investments and the reliability of business projects. We are convinced that businesses are obliged to protect the interests of their stakeholders and investors. We strive to make the market less speculative and reduce the level of fraud, so money is raised not for profit, but for the development of projects.  There are many unresolved issues on the novel crypto market, but the market will become more civilized thanks to projects like DeHedge. We have postulated the rules of a respectable start-up and will abide by them, so they may form the basis for the development of the entire blockchain industry.  The DeHedge rules of a respectable start-up:  — We freeze for a period of one year the tokens allocated to the DeHedge development team and Advisors, so investors and stakeholders can be confident that the development of the project is our highest priority.  — The DeHedge development team receives no more than 15% of the total sum of issued tokens.  — We stand against large bonuses and discounts on ICOs, as such measures lead to drops in the price of tokens on the secondary market.  — We apply the Cliff-Token Sale protocol, which temporarily suspends the resale of project tokens. The longer the suspension period, the higher the discount on the purchase of tokens. This approach excludes the possibility of a sharp drop in the price of tokens on the secondary market after the ICO and negates the speculation factor.  — We collect funds in rounds, and we will conduct subsequent rounds only after receiving confirmation from the market on the need to scale the business.  — We justify the amount of fundraising according to the venture classification Total Addressable Market, Serviceable Available Market, Serviceable & Obtainable Market.  — We present an MVP before releasing tokens to evaluate the attractiveness of our product.  — We will make an official market-making of our position on the stock exchange.  — We do not cooperate with entities or individuals engaged in speculating the value of tokens on the exchange, realizing that this is a violation of the law and is blatant fraud.  — We assign all intellectual property rights to the legal entity of our project.  — We will publish financial statements in Fiat and Cryptocurrency every quarter.  — We welcome any independent audit of the technical and financial part of the project.

Check this new article from DeHedge Editor in Chief, ""Crash And Burn"" #RomanBruskovBlog  The end of 2017 has seen Bitcoin take a plunge head-first into an empty pool with concrete floor lining. From $20K to $12K in a span of 24 hours is worse than many could have foreseen. There have always been optimists who prophesied over $60 by the end of 2017, but, as experience shows, optimism is often the counterfeit of despair.  The big question on every quivering investor’s lips is – how far will BTC plunge in 2018. Or will it? Of course, there is no simple answer as the crypto market is too volatile and unpredictable to make any sense of it using mere human brain processing power. There are too many factors at work which have brought the “miracle” coin from rags to riches and down to cripple in less than a year. Of course, the possibility of tracking immense amounts of data online in search of predictable patterns and intelligence is still on the table, but the fact of the matter is that most investors are still wary and keep an open mind as to whether the coin bears any potential for the future.  In fact, there is a very good chance than BTC will fall even further as there are many factors at work against it, not the least of which being the fact that the coin has no asset backing at all and the only factor keeping it afloat is speculation. Some factors that could diminish Bitcoin’s perception and crash its price even further include some rather realistic looks at the situation.  Regulations that are being introduced on the market by governments from South Koran to Russia and the US cannot realistically stop Bitcoin as a force on the market. But, they can do something far worse as they are capable of stopping liquidity from entering Bitcoin in the face of detracted investors. If institutional funds are forbidden from entering cryptocurrencies, then Bitcoin will eventually reach a peak at which point investors will lose interest in it and that will bring about a massive dump.  Scams, pump and dump schemes, speculation in other crypto assets and other factors on the market will torpedo the industry as a whole if regulating and insurance instruments are not introduced. If that happens and the market suffers a loss of faith, Bitcoin will suffer the same unenviable fate as other crypto assets and will be dumped, flogged and gibbeted.  If one analyzes the crypto market, it will be easy to notice that many ICOs are being used by projects that can do well without the backing of blockchain technology and are achievable by conventional means. If alternative, cheaper methodologies and approaches are available, investors are not foolish enough to pour their hard-earned funds into unproven technologies. In fact, blockchains is still under testing and evaluation and is not ready for mass adoption by the market. If the technology fails to approve of the hopes and dreams being laid upon its frail, young shoulders, a crash is inevitable.

Our insurance business has two sides of development. One of which is to insure investors who wish to put their capital into ICOs. The other one is to insure traders from price fluctuation. The mechanism is very similar - the analytics team will do a throughout analysis of over 80 parameters to add the currency on exchange to our platform. Traders/investors then can buy the currency and choose the period of insurance and pay using our tokens (DeHedge tokens (DHT)). The mechanism works the same as ICO, once the price drops below chosen range, the system automatically pays out the insured capital. This is done via our smart-contracts.  If you have any further concerns, we are happy to answer all your questions.  Best regards,",False
