Recently, you often ask questions about listing BIO on the stock exchange. We addressed your questions to the project's founder Boris Akimov. And this is what he said:  ""At the moment, we have now 4 exchanges: Yobit, Livecoin, Profit, Uralcpro. We decided not to force events. We are negotiating. But first of all I want to add a coin, because it is interesting and not because someone paid money for it. Our task now is to create many tools for using coins. And this is the main point. In addition, despite the fact that many crypto-exchanges declare that the listing is free of charge, this is not so. And the amounts they demand are very high! We see more reasonable use of funds for the development of the BioCoin ecosystem. If the BIO token will be used daily, it will be popular, then the exchanges themselves will want to flood this coin. This is what we are trying to achieve. This is the right way.""",False

How does the BioCoin team verify that the partner does not earn more points than is available?""  This is definitely a good question. üôÇ We answer:  The operator and integration platform of the BioCoin's loyalty program are the guarantors of the fulfillment of obligations of partners. According to the rules, to enter the loyalty program, a partner needs to make a deposit in BIO. This deposit becomes the security of the issued bonus points. The integration platform is configured in such a way that it prompts, in advance, about the approximation of the amount of points issued to the limit. And we will send a notification to the partner about the need to replenish the deposit. Thus, the partner can not issue points more than he is ready to provide. However, the partner himself can control the process of issuing points in its personal account of the loyalty program.  Points will be awarded within 1 working day in the absence of technical restrictions from the partner. On the limitations and features of the scoring of points from specific partners, if they arise, we will inform in addition.",False

But this means that our opportunities will become even more relevant - the possibility of instant exchange of any crypt for biocoin during the payment of goods or services with subsequent accrual and write-off points. That is, the law enables citizens to legally have a crypto.

As Promised, Let's Talk About Selling Tokens To Legal Entities!  On the official website of https://biocoin.bio, we are now setting up a new functionality for the sale and purchase of biocoins. Due to the configuration of some site functionalities, the short time worked incorrectly. At the moment we are launching the possibility of buying and selling biocoins by legal entities. This is necessary for the normal functioning of the loyalty system: a legal entity can officially acquires biocoins, which are then used to charge their customers. And sell them - for exemple to compensate for eventual lost profits. In this case, the possibility of buying and selling biocoins by individuals on the site is not yet possible - but individuals can still do this on stock exchanges.  Sale and purchase rate for legal entities: persons on the site will be guided by the weighted average rate (and turnover) of exchanges and the rate (and turnover) of biocoins within the loyalty system. At the same time, we will not change the rate more than once a day - to avoid the influence of sharp exchange fluctuations on the action of partners of the loyalty system.  Biocoins that will be sold on the site https://biocoin.bio are those that we take in payment for products and those that are bought from the legal entities (persons here).  In fact, we are creating an internal biocoin area for the purchase and sale of biocoins by individuals. Unfortunately, the legal field of Russia does not allow partners of the loyalty system to buy biocoins on stock exchanges yet - as they are outside the zone of right regulation. That is why we have been waiting very much, and are still waiting, for the ""Sunrise"" platform. We apologize that we misled some of the members of our Community. In the near future, all the functionalities will work in the regular mode.  For us, the main task is to fully launch the loyalty system. It‚Äôs the normal operation of the entire system and the growth in the number of partners that are the key to the growth of biocoin users and the growing demand for biocoins.

We are doing a serious work on entering large exchanges. At the same time, it is extremely important for us to create a foundation for sustainable growth of biocoin, and not to arrange instant ‚Äúpampas‚Äù and speculative leaps - such things are easily done by others, but why? It is important for us to build an ecosystem with its stability and ""sustainability"".  To do this, you need to do the most important thing - to create a broad business platform that unites hundreds and thousands of businesses - first in Russia, and then in the World.  To do this: a) everything is very clearly done from a legal point of view, b) to give convenient technological solutions to partners. This is what we are doing! At the moment, a juridical person can not officially buy or sell biocoins on stock exchanges - as they are not yet legitimate in Russia. The company must conclude an agreement and transfer money by bank transfer. And this is possible with biocoin! Not yet at the stock exchange but through the acquisition or sale of biocoins from one entity to another.  And this is a real breakthrough! There is not a single crypto-asset in Russia that can be officially and legally acquired. And that means one more thing - Biocoin is a legal window for companies of the crypto community. As soon as the partners begin to connect in large numbers - this will immediately impact the course on the exchanges.  In addition, in the next six months, a legitimate exchange will appear in the legal field of the Russian Federation.  In general, we are working on a plan to create a large project - the BioCoin Platform. And there will be big exchanges and stuff. But we definitely will not sacrifice for the sake of a momentary HYIP (High-Yield Investment Program) the fundamental principles - the legality and sustainability of the entire Platform.‚Äù  Then patience and integrity will be rewarded.

What agricultural issues can distributed registry technology solve?#agritech  1. Security of food Consumers are getting more demanding in relation to food consumption. As this tendency grows, large food chains will have no choice but use blockchain to provide for production transparency and food products quality.  2. Low effectiveness of the delivery chains due to information asymmetry.  Using blockchain will result in delivery chain becoming  more democratic and effective. As a result there will be less product removal and higher rewards for the farmers.  3. Forgery of food products. Blockchain will solve this issue by increasing the transparency of delivery for each sold product. Retailers and farmers can just scan the barcode on each of the products using their smartphones and learn about the origins of the products they buy.  4. Land registration Blockchain can make all the land registration types more effective and available ensuring the full transparency in the system. In Chechnya, by the way, Rosreestr (the State registry) is being transferred onto blockchain.  5. Subsidy payments Distribution and provision of subsidy can become more transparent using blockchain which will result in targeted payment of subsidy and decrease in the number of theft.",False

Usually ICO process looks like this: users leave their requests for tokens and pay 100%, and then after the ICO is over, coins are delivered to these users.  We put the token into the circulation before the beginning of the ICO so that our counter agents could receive their payments in Bio. Our asset is a ‚Äúlive‚Äù instrument which is used in real business. First transactions with BioCoin happened yet in August way before the ICO.  Farmers and other businessmen were already using our biocoins in the fall of 2017. So it would have been strange to oppose the circulation of our coin at the exchanges. Since it was being used, it should have been traded as well.  Regarding trading of Bio at Yobit, Livecoin and Profit exchanges. These exchanges have low volume of Bio and it is not interesting for a serious investor. If you want to purchase small amount of coins, then you can certainly do that at an exchange. If you want volume, then it is worth buying it off our website biocoin.bio.  And a little about our plans.

Using blockchain technology, delivery chains from different economy sectors could be combined into one global database.  Such level of transparency would allow to define specific ecologic benefits such as ecologically clean fuel, natural proteins or renewable energy sources, and turn them into market products.

We received a lot of questions after the news that a Bali hotel Bondalem Beach Club accepts biocoins for payments. We answered these question in BioCoin chat. And then decided to interview the founder of the hotel Maxim Demenchuk. Before dealing with crypto currencies he had been a trader for 15 years, working with currencies, shares, bonds. So he knows enough about investments. Maxim explained why BioCoin can be useful for a business.  -Why did you decide that it is useful to have payments in BioCoin?  I like new trends, new things. It is possibly a  thrust for illiquid assets with high growth potential. ;-) BioCoin is not your true crypto currency which makes it even more appealing. I have read that there had been attempts to create similar loyalty systems in other countries though they did not work. BioCoin in spite of some flows is developing and if it keeps up the growth rate then in 2 years, if the government will allow it, the project will scale.  Additionally, it is easier to explain to any regular user how a loyalty system works than hold a lecture about crypto currencies, mining and etc.  We all deal with loyalty systems, store cards, coupons on a daily basis. What is then BooCoin for any business? It is one part of marketing, advertising.  -What does a hotel get from participation in the BioCoin loyalty system? Advertisement, advertisement, advertisement. It does not cost anything, and time will show its effectiveness. I advise to use this marketing step to all my acquaintance from different businesses. However, when they hear the words ‚Äúcrypto currency‚Äù, they picture the MMM pyramid. I guess some had participated back then:) The project attracts partners, we in essence are creating a ‚Äúclosed club that is open to new participants‚Äù. We want to believe that everyone who becomes a partner will fulfill their obligations to accept and credit loyalty points BioCoin. It is true that there are difficulties with payments in crypto currencies in the RF. However, if a partner announced that he would accept it, then go ahead and accept, or leave the partnership. It is difficult now to pay for products and services in crypto currencies in Indonesia as well.  If BioCoin is successful in scaling, I am sure it will benefit everyone. What is so bad that instead of numerous cards of Lenta, Perekrestok, Diksi, Baxettle, Pyaterochka, Mvideo, Eldorado etc, I will just hold one card with points.  The competition will certainly partially switch from price segment to service quality evaluation segment.  A little about Bondalem Beach Club:  The hotel opened in 2013. There are 4 luxury bungalows and 2 double-occupancy suites. There is an ongoing construction of a stand alone villa with 11 double occupancy suites on the hotel‚Äôs territory.  It will be possible to rent suites separately or the whole villa at once for large groups, corporate events, fitness/yoga tours, trainings. Launch time is set to May/June.  Payments in Biocoins are accepted directly at the time of booking or during the stay at the hotel restaurants. Guests receive 10% bonuses in biocoins from money spent on lodgings and 5% for food purchases at the restaurants.",False

Here are the top-10 recommendations:  1. All the markets are cyclical. Do not be afraid of market rollbacks and collapses as during these moments you can potentially get the biggest profits.  2. Be very careful and concerned with gurus and experts that offer you trading schemes promising immediate generation of profits.   3. The best way to have intraday trades of crypto currencies is NONE, it just does not exist.  4. Do not think that if you managed to earn big profits with crypto currencies, you can easily enter other financial markets with similar results.  More than 95% of traders loose money. Just remember, this is a game of agreements and it gets manipulated. Keep to the ways that work for you.  5. Crypto markets work 24 hours a day, 7 dats a week, 365 days a year. It is impossible to catch every trend, so if you missed one, please do not worry, there is ALWAYS going to be another one.  6. If you earned large profits that can completely change your life, do not do ANYTHING in the next 30 days.  7. Do not create daily goal profit indicators; instead focus on long-term effectiveness indicators in reaching your set goals.  8. Do not trade before announcements of big and important news as it is impossible to estimate the market reaction to that.  9. You will DEFINITELY make mistakes. Do not be too hard on yourself when it happens however try not to step on the same rake.  10. Do not invest into token that you have not researched thoroughly.

Let us explain what it all means (careful, it is going to be a long read!!!).  Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake  are two most famous algorithm consensuses with crypto currencies. They offer different structure mechanisms to proof work done.  PoW mechanism provides an ability for the nodes to check that a miner (a node in that role that is adding a new block into the blockchain) has physically done the calculations. This process includes an attempt to find hash block title (part of the blockchain that has a link to the previous block and summed up data of transactions included within) that would in its data match the current difficulty level. PoW quickly turned into a monster burning electricity to make profits from mining. In 2012 the total combined power of Bitcoin network was already higher in performance than the most powerful supercomputer in the world, and the first alternative, Proof of Stake has appeared on the horizon.  In Proof-of-Stake approach nodes also try to hash data in search for a result lower than a defined data though the difficulty in this case is spread proportionally in accordance with the balance of a given node. In other words, it is spread in accordance with the number of coins (tokens) on a user‚Äôs balance. Thus, a node with a higher balance has more chances to generate a new block.",False

I will try to describe everything in simple words.  Biocoin crypto currency came to existence as a result of an ICO by a company called LavkaLavka. What kind of a company is that? This is a cooperative, or a society of farmers and consumers in other words that are brought together to interact directly excluding intermediaries that are there only to make money on resales. ICO or token sales are performed under the scrutiny by the government , though with the support of the government as far as the development of a legislative framework. That means the token is legal on the territory of the Russian Federation.  What we get as a result is a real company, not a start-up on papers, and an acknowledgement of the token by the state. It means that the whole thing is not going to just disappear in one moment, and the price of the token depends on the demand and the project‚Äôs team work.  What can we use Biocoins for?  1. Currently, biocoins are used for settlements of payments between the owners and companies that accept biocoins. The list of these companies is growing day by day which is a result of efficient work of the team. There are more than 50 companies that accept biocoins such as farms, stores that sells farmers products, famous equipment distributor MyHoreca (customers get biocoins as a reward for registering and then for each purchase), Eldoradio will accept biocoins as payments for the commercials, UAZ factory is also on that list. As we can see, the list is rather long, so companies are recognizing crypto currencies. 2. The second direction where we can use this coin is the clients‚Äô loyalty systems, which would award coins for completed purchases from partners that joined the network. 3. As we can see, this is not just a speculative coin but a real coin that can be used to pay for products and services.  Where and how to buy BioCoin.  The first option to purchase coins is through the ICO that is being held now until February 18, 2018. How to buy biocoins on the site: 1. Go to https://biocoin.bio/en/invest 2. Fill in a simple form: number of coins you want to purchase, e-mail, payment method (with crypto currency, electronic money or bank card) and indicate your wallet number that you need to create beforehand (info on how to set up your wallet is detailed later in the article). 3. Accept the conditions and pay and then wait for biocoins to be credited to your account.  Second option is to purchase these coins through a currency exchange, for example, LiveCoin exchange.  And option number three is to start accepting biocoins as payments for your products and services.  Where to keep BioCoin crypto currency and which wallet to choose.  In reality, everything depends on the ways you are going to be using the coins for. If you just want to hold on to your coins and wait for their growth, then it is better to have your wallet on the desktop computer.  If you are planning to trade the coins, then it is better to have the wallet on the exchange. If you want to pay for products and services, then obviously a mobile phone would be the place to set your wallet. A full list of options could be found here: https://wallet.biocoin.help/en/  To summarize we can say that this is a very interesting project, and in my opinion, it has great potential and after the ICO the coins will grow in price. This is a practice for any coin that has real team and activity. So, I have purchased some coins myself, and recommend you to take a look at it and think for yourself.",False

For example, creation of a new ‚Äúmilky‚Äù crypto currency MilkCoin has recently been announced in Russia. We have nothing against cows, on the contrary, we love them very much!) However, all money raised by this ICO would be used to build a plant. So, in essence, people invest into a non-technological plant.

Payments and the buy-back of tokens will be done in Ethereum currency.  In the future MilkCoin tokens can be exchanged for any products of ‚ÄúKhSK‚Äù ( Khokhol agricultural company) with 50% discount.  In this case, tokens resemble shares of the plant though without legal guarantees and binding.  Let‚Äôs discuss that in the chat https://t.me/biocoinchat",False

Or odd. I am now somewhere in between. I am sitting on an ocean shore (Bali sea to be exact), my kids are near me splashing in the water and so am I, why not. Here is black volcanic sand, weather of +26C, there is nobody on the beach, just fishermen waiting to catch their barracudas and tuna which you can immediately fry right here at a local restaurant. There are palm trees with coconuts, rambutans, salas(salaks, not fish) and other fruits with some hard to pronounce names.  Shots hold local rice distillates, glasses are served with non-local wine. There is also quite decent (in all senses) Bali massage. Water cruises with dolphins, finishing, waterfalls. The hotel offers a pool right in front of a personal bungalow and sea 30 meters from it. So, you know even without me about the fairytale Bali. What you do know not is that all of that (from bungalow, pool and massage to barracuda, dolphins, waterfalls and distillates) can now be purchased for biocoins. Yeah, you heard that right.  The same farmers biocoins that are spreading fast not only in Russia but all over the world! I just could not pass by such news that now you can pay with biocoins in Bali and thus, I went there with an inspection. And the inspection is going on so nicely. For a day I was silent, just walked, swam, sniffed, chewed, drank. And now I can assure you that it is right and biocoins are accepted in Bali. And now when you are going to LavkaLavka (and not only) and receive biocoins as bonuses for a purchase of farmers salami by Alexander Potcheptsov, for example, or for chicken soup by Andrey Ovchinnikov at Dmitry Akishin restaurants made by Elena Savchuk, you can then celebrate the end of the year by such Bali trip. Do it just by using the accumulated biocoins.  Here is another way. You bought biocoins on the site biocoin.bio or at an exchange. The exchange rate changed during few months and you followed my footsteps much cheaper than using rubles.  This is a long one. Though I had to explain everything to myself and you.

Could it happen again in 2018? Quite possibly. It is possible BitCoin will not grow as rapidly though there are other interesting crypto currencies that could show their potential.  Many projects that went for ICO this year planned in their Road Maps that the start of the working versions would happen in 2018 (different times of the year for different projects.) We will be able to analyze what happened with these projects and whether they managed their tasks and goals. If they really start their projects, then we could see their fast growth on the exchange.  However for now we have time to look through all these projects and find the best ones with the highest growth potential.

Though it was actually the day before but we are just getting to share the news. BioCoin was created to be an effective instrument for revival of local business and development of local societies and territories. And in that it is easily integrated into all of the projects of LavkaLavka as well as our Territories Development Fund Big Land. In 2015 we went to Teriberka that after the ‚ÄúLeviathan‚Äù movie became the quintessence of the Russian sadness and hopelessness. A lot has been told about our activities there.  At first our civic engagement on our knees brought us to the festival of territory development. And something started to move slowly, turn around here. Teriberka came alive. We gained experience, the festival turned into a constantly working group that united us with architects, sociologists, economists, Urbanists and other concerned and caring civil activists. We started to work on methodologies of steady territories development, indices of steady development. A center of expertise for rural and suburban territories development had began to develop there  within the frames of the ANO Big Land.  And there was that important day. Big Land received an official order from the administration of Murmansk region to create a master plan for Teriberka development.  This will be first Russian experience of creating a full development plan of rural territories that will be based on principles of steady development.  And we are not talking about architecture or urban design. To be specific, it is not just about that. We firstly will work on social, economic, ecological aspects of harmonious development of the space. That is about a man, active local society, social environment, business, culture, nature. Urban design and architecture will be there as well but only as adequate answers to substantial requests based on main direction development. Our goal is not only to create mechanisms of steady development of Teriberka, but also to create in the Big Land a working methodology that will help bringing alive the most distant (and not so) places and regions of Russia.  Teriberka is not our only direction, we have already started our work in the Jewish Autonomous Region (last place in the rating of development of the Russian regions). And few more interesting territories are currently under our development.  We live in the largest country in the world. However, it is just a phrase from a textbook for all of us. Turkish shores, European capital cities and beaches of Thailand become closer to us than almost any of the regions of our own country. We at Big Land wish that we as citizens of Russia, learn how to use in full something that undeniably belongs to us, our great space around us. ¬´Our country‚Äù should stop being just some semantic abstraction. We need to give back the true meaning to the word ‚Äúours‚Äù. ‚ÄúOurs‚Äù means that we have all the rights to use our own country in all its incredible and beautiful dimensions, however simultaneously we bear responsibility for this country. Any right and property is first of all a responsibility. So, the goal of the Big Land is to create steady mechanisms that will revive the responsibility for the environment around us. Once we have that responsibility then everything else will come along.  Big Land, LavkaLavka, BioCoin, biologists, sociologists, economists are all going to Teriberka on January 11th. They are going there to take everything that had been done and talked about for the past few years and create a well built and working mechanism of territories development that could be used and replicated all around the country.  So, it was an important day. It is time to return this land to us.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALdCIzsoO9s",False

There is this most famous charitable fund ‚ÄúPodari zhizn‚Äù. Today we went to Peredelkino near Moscow where we met with Gregory Mazmanyanz, the Fund‚Äôs director. Here at the territory of a former beautiful manor the fund will build a boarding house for sick kids and their mothers. The issue is that between their chemo therapy sessions at Moscow hospitals kids go home for a few weeks though their homes could be thousand kilometers away. This causes mothers to look for some temporary lodgings in Moscow which could also be quite costly and not so affordable. ‚ÄúPodari zhizn‚Äù rents dozens of apartments in Moscow for such families. Now the fund has received ownership to this former manor and this boarding house would be build for kids and mothers.  How can farmers and BioCoin help these kids and this fund? Here is how: We have agreed that farmers of the cooperative will send products to the cafe at this boarding house, and chefs from LavkaLavka will cook in that cafe.  With that there will be a garden where products will be grown for cafe and for sales through cooperative to raise additional money for the boarding house. There will also offer working places for mothers in the cafe and the garden to distract them a little from the reality and also to give an opportunity to make some additional money.  And also our farmers and chefs will come there to hold master classes and educational programs for kids and adults. Biocoin application could be set up in such a way to make a donation to the boarding house of ‚ÄúPodari Zhizn‚Äù from each transaction. Simultaneously, the Fund will spread it on their channels and in communications with other benefactors that it accepts donations for the boarding house and kids healthy farmers food in biocoins.

Shortly: Expert appraisal of the demand for LavkaLavka BioCoin crypto assets purchases at the Voskhod platform is more than 100 million biocoins. BioCoin ICO is this being extended until February 18. Starting December 1, 2017, cost of BioCoin will amount to 1.90 rubles. Starting February 1, 2018, cost will be 2.50 rubles. On February 27 site BioCoin.bio will host market place where partners of the BioCoin loyalty program will be able to place purchase orders for biocoins, and those, who bought biocoins during the ICO will be able to sell them.  Details: after series of lengthy consultation sessions with the non-commercial partnership RTS, a decision has been reached to extend the ICO of LavkaLavka until February 18, 2018. Partners have agreed on that due to the desire to reach the regulatory ‚Äúsandbox‚Äù of the Bank of Russia. Another reason is the support of interest of the investors  that will receive additional opportunity to purchase more than 100 mln biocoins in case biocoin hits the legal Russian trade platform Voskhod. At the moment, more than 9 mln dollars have been raised from the ICO. Changes to the time frame will not affect the road map of the project in any way.  On September 22, 2017, ‚ÄúNP RTS‚Äù association and farmers cooperative LavkLavka reached an agreement for the strategic partnership and holding of ICO with subsequent token circulation on Voskhod platform.  Shortly before the date of the ICO start the government of the RF and The Bank of Russia received an assignment from the President of the RF to create a structure on the basis of the Central Bank for ¬´approbation of innovative financial technologies, products and services‚Äù in order to identify additional risks. Voskhod had expressed a desire to participate in the work of the ‚Äúregulatory sandbox.‚Äù  After going though all the necessary procedures in accordance with the testing regulations set by regulatory and supervisory authorities, Voskhod platform is going to be ready to place the electronic assets of the farmers‚Äô cooperative LavkaLavka. The expert appraisal of the demand for purchases of crypto assets by LavkaLavka on Voskhod platform is now more than 100 million.  Currently, BioCoin is traded on a few international platforms and their number will increase in December. LavkaLavka‚Äôs loyalty system is working in the test mode and Biocoins are already accepted. The fully operational system should start working in winter 2017-2018. Based on the first stage of the ICO, LavkaLavka is continuing to develop the sales system of the farmers products, which is reflected in the ICO prospectus. In the nearest time there will be a start of a new project that will allow farmers from the cooperative to sell large volumes of products though new wholesale sales channels of LavkaLavka where Biocoin would be actively used.  After regular round of consultations this week with RTS and the Central Bank the new time frame for the ICO has become clear and understandable. ICO will finish on February 18, Sunday, at 18:00 Moscow time.  To celebrate that (also to note that February 18th is the last day for Maslenitsa, Russian festival), we will hold a special dinner at the LavkaLavka restaurant in Moscow ( Petrovka, 21) and BioCoin team and LavkaLavka want to invite all the bites of biocoins!!  Please plan your time and come, the dinner will be quite tasty! There also be an opportunity to have personal interaction with the team and discuss all interesting and important questions. We will watch the last minutes of the ICO together! Starting December 1, 2017, cost of BioCoin will amount to 1.90 rubles. Starting February 1, 2018, cost will be 2.50 rubles.

We‚Äôre truly happy BioCoin has a big and strong community. Without you, phase one of our tokensale wouldn‚Äôt have been successful.   We‚Äôre deeply disturbed by the seeming lack of understanding between BioCoin and our community. With this statement, we would like to mitigate all disagreements by answering three crucial questions asked by the community:   1. Why did BioCoin slow down the tokensale? 2. Why is prolongation good? 3. How can I sell or supply goods for BioCoin right now?   1. Why did BioCoin slow down the tokensale?   It‚Äôs not a secret that BioCoin is Russia‚Äôs first legal ICO. We planned to hold it with platform Voskhod and signed a respective agreement with the RTS.   Voskhod itself was not ready for launch on time, so we had to kick off the tokensale by our own efforts. Voskhod stated on November 1st that it would join the tokensale later. After that, BioCoin became the country‚Äôs first token to receive legal assessment and recognition as a legitimate asset. The legal conclusion was developed by expert lawyers headed by Elina Sidorenko, the head of Russia‚Äôs parliamentary working group for cryptocurrencies.   The second important step was to put the asset to a legally compliant exchange service in Russia. The project‚Äôs team and lots of investors all agreed that a legal cryptoasset at a legal cryptoplatform was what we all looked for.   We believe that we must keep our promises, so all this time our team was negotiating with Voskhod, the Russian Central Bank, and the RTS.   The regulators do try to describe cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. For that purpose, they do researches and develop mechanisms including so-called ‚Äòsandbox‚Äô where legal frameworks for cryptocurrencies and ICO in Russia will be developed. BioCoin will be an active player in this sandbox.   Our cooperation with the Central Bank will not only let us hold the first legal tokensale in Russia but also make BIO a legitimate exchange asset. At the moment, it‚Äôs possible only if they‚Äôre traded at Voskhod as it is the only place to have received the Central Bank‚Äôs permission to trade cryptoassets for the moment.   Therefore, the prolongation of the tokensale was a necessary step to (a) keep our word given to the community that we‚Äôll make our token a legal exchange asset; and (b) help the Central Bank develop an approach towards regulation of cryptocurrencies and ICO.    2. Why is prolongation good?   Thanks to extending our tokensale we hope to enable BIO trading at Voskhod. We‚Äôll also keep our promise to make our token a legitimate exchange asset. You shouldn‚Äôt forget that many tokensale contributors joined the campaign for that very reason.   Prolonging the tokensale will let us keep biocoin holders safe as BIO will be legally regulated. The price of tokens acutely responses to introduction of regulation in different jurisdictions. Once it‚Äôs understood that Russia has finalized its regulatory framework using the practical case of BioCoin among other things, it will reflect positively on our token‚Äôs price.   We also heed the Central Bank‚Äôs stance towards cryptocurrencies, tokens, and ICO. We do want to help them create a beneficial legal environment for us and other companies, so we‚Äôre willing to take part in their ‚Äòsandbox.‚Äô That‚Äôs how we help make cryptocurrencies, tokens, and their trading understandable and regulated. That‚Äôs a good and reasonable thing in the long run. Not just for BioCoin, but for all of us.   We also want to ensure steadily high demand for BIO. Due to the prolongation of our tokensale, the number of tokens held by users will only grow. One may safely assume that they won‚Äôt be just means of storage but also be actively used in the entire BioCoin ecosystem as a way to provide bonuses or buy goods/services from LavkaLavka and our partners in Russia and abroad. Finally, together with international platform RCN we make it possible to issue loans to farmers with BIO tokens.     Prolongation of the tokensale will only expand the ecosystem, its capabilities and potential. It will let us implement our roadmap in an extended form: we have already launched some new projects that hadn‚Äôt been thoroughly formulated in the beginning, but will make BioCoin much stronger. For instance, it‚Äôs the opportunity to exchange any cryptocurrency or token for goods / services of BioCoin‚Äôs partnership network.  Any issuer of their own token or cryptocoin will be able to build in our exchange module into their wallet to exchange their tokens for BioCoins on the fly. Thus, the demand for BioCoins gains new traction. We‚Äôll soon describe this and other new projects in greater detail, so please stay tuned.   3. How can I sell or supply goods for BioCoin right now?   We understand that, regardless of all our plans and the actual implementation of BioCoin in the existing services of LavkaLavka and our partners, there are some buyers that could feel unsatisfied because of the extension of the ICO. To that end, we remind that BioCoin isn‚Äôt a coin from some uncertain future, like ‚Äúhere we hold and ICO, then create an infrastructure, and then the coins will be used.‚Äù Our ecosystem has been working for a long while now: it‚Äôs the entire infrastructure of LavkaLavka, it‚Äôs over 200 farms, it‚Äôs stores, restaurants, production facilities, it‚Äôs our partners who connect to BioCoin. BIO doesn‚Äôt live on its own: our blockchain solutions have been integrated in a real business, in an existing infrastructure. Farmers and lots of our partners are using BioCoins as we speak. They‚Äôve been doing it for a while. Thousands of wallets with coins, transactions, exchange trading, it‚Äôs all been there for some time now. It‚Äôs all real. It‚Äôs not tomorrow, it‚Äôs today. You can always sell biocoins or exchange them for farm goods or other goods / services.   We‚Äôre confident that the prolongation of our ICO is directly related to the growth of BIO ecosystem, which is the guarantee for the coin‚Äôs future success. It‚Äôs not a mere speculative instrument, it‚Äôs a token directly connected to real businesses. It‚Äôs down to earth in the least figurative sense of the word. We don‚Äôt have to make exuberant statements to make biocoin buyers like us. We believe that a real business is a living thing. It cannot exist as a dogma. It has to develop, evolve, and grow.  Those who can adapt are those who win. That‚Äôs why those who count on rapid growth will only win because BioCoin is deliberately building our business on the principles of steady growth. They are the cornerstone of development of business and the demand for biocoins.  A few moths ago we couldn‚Äôt anticipate anything that happened to us afterwards. Together, we‚Äôre building a new world, an unknown one maybe, but it will be the way we create it.   Best regards, Boris Akimov and the BioCoin team",False

Hooray!!This day has come! BioCoin is the first legal token of the country. Expert group under the direction of Elina Sidorenko, a director of the interagency group of the State Duma for risk valuations of the crypto currency circulation, who is providing legal support to BioCoin, has prepared a legal opinion. Here it is! The legal opinion for the BioCoin.  https://biocoin.bio/files/conclusion_ru.pdf   Here is a big big discussion. It is all about BioCoins, crypto currencies, venture capital investments and fate of Motherland. Boris Akimov says: ‚Äú As a citizen and a human being, I am interested in crypto currency not just as a way to increase capital, but as a way for the local community to get self-organized. I think this is the path towards a stable development. A thought that a local (wherever it could be) society could set their own rules of the game, create a new tool based on trust that could be transferred from hands to hands and proves this trust, makes me thrilled. For example, we spoke to a local official in Tatarstan about the fact that there is a region that desperately needs a bridge. He is proposing to have a state-private partnership where they( state) will contribute part of the funds, and local citizens will contribute the second part. They will build that needed bridge for themselves, and tokens could be used for free rides through the bridge (or sell them to others.) People can start building bridges, roads, gas stations, schools, kindergartens, hair salons.  This is a ‚Äúreplacement‚Äù for the state. We have an initiative with RAKIB( Russian Association of Crypto Currency and Blockchain), it reminds me of an idea for a blockchain zemstvo ( local government.) Before the revolution there were zemstva in Russia that opened schools and hospitals and learned to manage the funds so that they do not disappear.  Georgy L‚Äôvov that announces the ‚ÄúAll Russian Zemstvo Help Union for the sick and wounded soldiers‚Äù became the director of the Temporary Government because he had created the biggest non commercial and non-governmental organization that took place the role of state to an extent. Although he could not manage the suppressions of riots and mobilization of troops and these functions should be left with the state government. It is not clear whether a blockchain can deal with the army and fleet, as it can manage everything else.   https://incrussia.ru/understand/inc-talks-ico-vs-venchurnye-investitsii-kak-my-budem-delat-biznes-investirovat-i-zhit-v-mire-blokchejna/",False

Here is a great article on that topic: https://www.google.ru/amp/www.forbes.ru/amp/310117  At the conference of RAKIB association where BioCoin is a member. The growth of the usage of crypto currency has been increasing twice as fast compared to the original growth of Internet. If it stays the same, there will be 3 billion crypto wallets by 2030.      Foreign press is talking about BioCoin being the first Russian legal token.  https://www.btcsoul.com/noticias/biocoin-e-reconhecido-como-token-legal/   We have secured a very promising partnership with blockchain project RCN Network. RCN is a dedicated credit network protocol and their expertise will help us develop a superior framework for lending and borrowing resources within the platform.  From the very beginning we have envisioned BioCoin platform as an instrument facilitating small businesses and farmers. Lending support is of course key here. BioCoin‚Äôs partnership with RCN will allow us create a robust framework for lending/borrowing BIO to support a budding green business and keep the generated value within the network. https://biocoin.bio/en/blog/biocoin-combines-efforts-with-rcn-network-to-better-assist-green-businesses-worldwide    The story of dramatic ‚Äúlove‚Äù of BioCoin and Voskhod and RTS is still on! The expert appraisal of the demand for crypto assets by LavkaLavka on Voskhod platform is more than 100 million BioCoin! Based on the consulting sessions that were held this week between the farmers‚Äô cooperative LavkaLavka and ‚ÄúNP RTS‚Äù Association, it was decided to extend the ICO of LavkaLavka. Partners have agreed to this because of the desire to get to the ‚Äúsandbox‚Äù of the Bank of Russia. And also because of the inquiries from the investors. The change of the time line is not going to affect the project‚Äôs road map.  Here is the official statement by ‚ÄúNP RTS‚Äù and LavkaLavka on this matter: on September 22, 2017,  ‚ÄúNP RTS‚Äù Association and farmers cooperative LavkaLavka signed an agreement for the strategic partnership and holding of an ICO with a subsequent token circulation on Voskhod platform.  Shortly before the date of the ICO start the government of the RF and The Bank of Russia received an assignment from the President of the RF to create a structure on the basis of the Central Bank for ¬´approbation of innovative financial technologies, products and services‚Äù in order to identify additional risks. Voskhod had expressed a desire to participate in the work of the ‚Äúregulatory sandbox.‚Äù  After going though all the necessary procedures in accordance with the testing regulations set by regulatory and supervisory authorities, Voskhod platform is going to be ready to place the electronic assets of the farmers‚Äô cooperative LavkaLavka. The expert appraisal of the demand for purchases of crypto assets by LavkaLavka on Voskhod platform is now more than 100 million.  At this moment the collections from the ICO have gone over 9 million dollars; BioCoin is traded on a few international platforms and their number will increase in December. LavkaLavka‚Äôs loyalty system is working in the test mode and Biocoins are already accepted. The fully operational system should start working in winter 2017-2018.  Based on the first stage of the ICO, LavkaLavka is continuing to develop the sales system of the farmers products, which is reflected in the ICO prospectus. In the nearest time there will be a start of a new project that will allow farmers from the cooperative to sell large volumes of products though new wholesale sales channels of LavkaLavka where Biocoin would be actively used. Boris Akimov, the founder of the farmers cooperative LavkaLavka, states: ‚ÄúWe think that in the interest of current and future investors we need to let the original plan be implemented and enter the first legal electronic platform in Russia. Few days ago BioCoin was named the first legal token in the country by the expert group under the direction of Elina Sidorenko. To have that supported by the entrance to the first legal electronic platform in Russia would be quite right. Secondly, there are investors that are interested in such configuration where BioCoin is traded on Voskhod platform. I think that for additional 100 million biocoins we should really make the effort. This would also give us an opportunity to come closer to our goal of 15 million dollars.
