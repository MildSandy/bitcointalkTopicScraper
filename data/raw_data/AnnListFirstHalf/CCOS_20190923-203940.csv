Blockchain-based insurances can be for example parametric ones, tied to big data and statistics, and allow the most varied policies that can be imagined to be formulated. A great example of these is the Rainy Day insurance set up by them to share some BLCK tokens via airdrop.  Black Foundation is the first client to CrowdCoinage’s token sale platform and on the 1st of October, they will go live with their ICO. The team behind CrowdCoinage has gone the extra mile developing their token sale platform to ensure that the launch will be a smooth one.

We’d like to promote our ICO platform in countries where the ICO-s are banned or is very difficult to conduct one with the following core message:  “You want to raise funds with token sale? We have a simple solution for you. Become an e-Resident, register a company in Estonia and launch an ICO campaign! Start the application process from CrowdCoinage.com.""   Best regards, Peep  ",False

We chose Ethereum because it suits best our platform needs and we really love the huge and helpful community behind it. 2) Smart contracts with voting tokens Voting rights for investors, to let them be in control of their investments by releasing funds for next milestones startups are facing. We believe that through this feature ICO campaigns can gain more trust and popularity. 3) Listing in two crypto exchanges We are currently in talks with many exchanges. HitBTC will be our first target, as the negotiations have already started.  Quote from: seriosman on January 09, 2018, 02:08:55 PM For what purposes will public API of CrowdCoinage system be used?  CrowdCoinage Public API enables powerful features for our platform users.  1) Public API for marketplace data and ICO campaigns to support PR and marketing. Example: Showing the campaign status information like token sale and campaign deadline is a good incentive for potential investors and makes the experience more interactive. The user can integrate all that and much more into their third-party website or application. 2) Integrating all major tools of productivity into our ecosystem. Example: when a campaign has multiple parties related to it, then it will be easier to maintain it through a Slack channel and have their to-do lists at Trello for improved productivity. 3) Possibility to offer payment solutions Example: we believe that our clients would love the possibility to offer payment solutions that are based on cryptocurrencies to their clients. The CrowdCoinage OS payment API will be offering the functionality similar to PayPal's shopping cart.  Quote from: hollybit on January 09, 2018, 02:25:09 PM When does the company plan to launch Marketplace and what goods will be sold on this platform?  Marketplace is planned to be launched in the fourth quarter of 2018 as stated in our Roadmap.  Vision is to create a decentralized borderless marketplace for all kinds of financial services and products where anyone from anywhere can be either a service provider or a consumer of these products and services.  Moving further, we are aiming to develop tools and instruments for market analysis and investments.  Think of Amazon, eBay and the likes, only that it's going to be better.

I understand that this is the most important question that many of the community members want me to answer. I actually answered this question in this conversation yesterday.  Its true that our hard cap seems to be high but there is much more to it to build a modern all-in-one financial platform like the CrowdCoinage OS than just the development process. We have to apply for at least five different licenses and permissions in order to offer the services that have been promised on our roadmap. These are not cheap and many of them require us to hire a certain quantity of qualified staff or people with special skills and knowledge. We also cannot forget the marketing and PR bills that need to be paid when we start expanding our services for example to Asia were ICO-s have been banned by many countries.   Currently we are working hard on our first beta/prototype version that includes the crowdfunding, ICO campaigns and escrow functionality and it will be launched very soon.  The roadmap is an indication of what will be developed when a certain amount has been met. We have agreed among the founders that we are going forward no matter how much funds would be raised. Even in the case of not meeting our hard cap during this ICO, we are going to deliver all the financially feasible milestones provided on the roadmap. It's important to bare in mind that 50% of all CCOS tokens will be sold during this ICO campaign. We've had great response from the community lately and when you guys believe in us and we get your trust and support we can launch another token sale to meet all the funding requirements needed for our further developments.  Thanks, Peep",False

The first version of CrowdCoinage OS Allows startups, software developers, etc. to launch and manage crowdfunding and ICO campaigns by selling dividends* or equity tokens that are freely tradable in cryptocurrency exchanges. CrowdCoinage OS will allow founders of different startups to communicate with each other and find talents and professionals with specialized skill sets, verify their business model, make an elevator pitch, collect the trusted reviews and find the first evangelists.  *An ICO is a completely new way to raise funds besides the existing methods like IPOs, bond issue or loans. Thanks to the ERC20-type tokens that CrowdCoinage OS uses for token distribution, founders can define the value of these tokens. Subject to relevant registrations or licenses, the value can be for example a share of yearly dividends, equity or the token can be even used as a payment method to purchase products or services.  On the next step We are going to add a wide variety of financial services, based on cryptocurrencies and blockchain: P2P loans, insurance, saving deposits, debit cards for everyday use, an exchange and a wallet.
