O projeto tamb√©m inclui um mercado de servi√ßos financeiros integrados, que permite aos usu√°rios acessar (no lan√ßamento) mais de 250 produtos e servi√ßos usando seus documentos de identidade certificados.     O sistema de gerenciamento de identidade digital da SelfKey permite que seus usu√°rios possuam, controlem e gerenciem sua identidade digital. Ele traz a descentraliza√ß√£o para o gerenciamento de identidades, permitindo que os usu√°rios armazenem seus atributos de ID e documentos em seus pr√≥prios dispositivos, e n√£o no servidor da SelfKey ou no blockchain. Os usu√°rios podem decidir o que, quando e com quem compartilham com seguran√ßa esses atributos e documentos do ID. Ningu√©m mais tem acesso a essas informa√ß√µes sem o consentimento do usu√°rio. Isso √© algo que a SelfKey chama de ‚Äúidentidade auto-soberana‚Äù.     A rede SelfKey inclui uma carteira de identidade (que permite que os usu√°rios solicitem certifica√ß√µes de documentos de identifica√ß√£o) e o Marketplace (que permite aos usu√°rios comprar produtos e servi√ßos).  O token KEY ter√° um papel cr√≠tico na execu√ß√£o do ecossistema SelfKey, pois todos os produtos e servi√ßos (alguns listados abaixo) est√£o dispon√≠veis por meio do KEY como um pagamento nominal. Por exemplo, a KEY pode ser usada para pagar por atestados de solicita√ß√µes e para listagens de mercado, bem como para receber reivindica√ß√µes de identidade.     Cada membro do ecossistema desempenha um papel no envolvimento do sistema e no uso do KEY.  Alguns dos produtos e servi√ßos incluem:  Registro de Bitcoin e Asset Digital Asset Cidadania por programas de investimento Cidadania atrav√©s do investimento em aplica√ß√µes imobili√°rias Incorpora√ß√£o de empresas (incluindo empresas limitadas por a√ß√µes, funda√ß√µes, LLC's e Trusts) Introdu√ß√£o e aplica√ß√£o da conta banc√°ria Pedidos de autoriza√ß√£o de resid√™ncia para mais de 50 pa√≠ses E-Wallets ou recursos de valor armazenado Compra e armazenamento de ouro e metais preciosos Aplica√ß√µes de seguros internacionais Servi√ßos de remessa e transfer√™ncia de dinheiro Para mais informa√ß√µes, recomendo conferir o whitepaper da Selfkey aqui .  O time: De acordo com a empresa: ‚ÄúA equipe de projeto da SelfKey engloba um grupo de inovadores altamente experientes que s√£o apaixonados por identidade e seu futuro, bem como algumas das mais brilhantes mentes legais e de neg√≥cios da ind√∫stria.‚Äù  Ao visitar o site, n√£o h√° links para mais informa√ß√µes sobre os membros da equipe.     Dito isto, h√° muitas informa√ß√µes relacionadas √† empresa, como v√≠deos do Fundador Edmund Lowell dando palestras sobre prote√ß√£o de identidade em v√°rias confer√™ncias da FinTech.  Embora haja muita imprensa em torno do projeto, eu gostaria de ver uma melhor tentativa de transpar√™ncia sobre as pessoas que, em √∫ltima an√°lise, estar√£o usando seu dinheiro para fazer esse projeto acontecer.  Tokens (KEY) e Distribui√ß√£o: O whitepaper faz um √≥timo trabalho explicando o conceito e os objetivos do projeto, mas n√£o √© t√£o interessante para explicar as informa√ß√µes de venda de token da OIC.  Isso √© prov√°vel porque ainda estamos muito longe do ICO real, mas aqui est√£o algumas informa√ß√µes que consegui encontrar.  Nome do token: KEY Data de lan√ßamento da OIC: 15 de janeiro de 2018 Pre√ßo: 1 KEY = 0.015 USD Plataforma: Ethereum Tampa macia: 2.500.000 USD Tampa dura: 21.780.000 USD      O projeto parece estar atualmente nos est√°gios de ‚Äúpr√©-venda privada‚Äù, o que √© uma √≥tima oportunidade para obter um retorno melhor do que a pr√≥pria OIC. Isso s√≥ faz com que estabelecer uma refer√™ncia para o que voc√™ pode esperar √© que o tempo da OIC seja um pouco dif√≠cil.  Riscos Tal como acontece com a grande maioria dos outros projetos, h√° uma infinidade de concorrentes por a√≠. Embora o SelfKey tenha a vantagem de ser um dos primeiros impulsionadores da prote√ß√£o de identidade baseada em blockchain, ainda est√° longe de ser o primeiro. Projetos como o Civic (CVC) j√° existem e registraram um crescimento substancial, com um aumento de 3,5 vezes no pre√ßo em apenas algumas semanas. -2 O whitepaper estava faltando. Enquanto o whitepaper faz um bom trabalho em descrever o que o projeto est√° tentando realizar, n√£o h√° muita informa√ß√£o em borracha sobre a equipe ou os tokens que ser√£o emitidos. Isso provavelmente se deve ao fato de o projeto estar em seus est√°gios iniciais. -3 Potencial de crescimento: A prote√ß√£o de identidade j√° √© uma necessidade enorme, e continuar√° a crescer √† medida que o mundo se torne cada vez mais integrado ao cen√°rio digital. O que antes era apenas o n√∫mero do seguro social (ou outra identifica√ß√£o do governo) com base agora inclui uma gama muito maior de identificadores das m√≠dias sociais para o email. +2 A identidade descentralizada elimina o risco de um servidor central ser invadido por suas informa√ß√µes preciosas. Com o SelfKey, usu√°rios e organiza√ß√µes podem evitar viola√ß√µes de dados em escala Equifax. +2 √â cedo no jogo para este ICO. A OIC est√° agendada para ser lan√ßada em 15 de janeiro de 2018, e agora √© uma √≥tima oportunidade para entrar na pr√©-venda privada, ou pelo menos entrar em contato com qualquer futura venda pr√©-OIC. +3 Os custos de verifica√ß√£o de identidade para bancos e outras organiza√ß√µes est√£o apenas aumentando, e a SelfKey pode ajudar a minimiz√°-los. Al√©m disso, a conformidade com a lei KYC √© obrigat√≥ria para praticamente qualquer pessoa que lida com informa√ß√µes do usu√°rio: longa lista incluindo troca de moedas, startups de fintech, transmissores de dinheiro, empresas e agentes imobili√°rios, negociantes de metais preciosos ou instala√ß√µes de armazenamento, fiduci√°rios, prestadores de servi√ßos corporativos, credores, bancos corretoras de t√≠tulos, advogados, contadores, funda√ß√µes sem fins lucrativos, prestadores de servi√ßos profissionais, not√°rios, governos, seguradoras, resseguradoras, institui√ß√µes financeiras e, em geral, qualquer pessoa jur√≠dica ou pessoa f√≠sica que trabalhe em dinheiro ou finan√ßas. O custo anual m√©dio recorrente da conformidade com o KYC√© de US $ 60 milh√µes para o banco m√©dio, mas pode chegar a US $ 500 milh√µes para outros. +2 Uma solu√ß√£o de verifica√ß√£o de identidade como a SelfKey poderia ajudar os bancos n√£o apenas a reduzir custos, mas tamb√©m acelerar o processo. +2",False

Since it went live on Binance I have filpped this coin SIX times each time for a profit. 1 bounce was 187%, and the second big bounce was 155%. It's sitting at .00000241 STS's now 5:24 EST on Binance. Volume is picking up once again and I expect another ride to 300 or even 400. It all depends on how much volume and money flow come into the coin. Volume is KEY. You see another 50 million BTC in volume, ohhh my. Enjoy the ride.  Regardless of what the company does you are here to invest and make money any way you wish. Buy, sell, buy, hold sell, buy hold, sell etc......  It's just an unusual trading pattern and very predictable. Very easy to track the technical indicators and know when it's over bought and over sold. Every bounce SIX times I profited since the pop from .00000200...I have never seen a coin do this so consistenly EVER on Binance. Binance has so much liqudity it's actually very hard to move a coin with such a large supply. Binance has 15 million traders so when a coin does this people are watching and buying.  Do not be discouraged if you bought at .00000500 and you are still holding. Average down at this price and you can possibly break even or better get a little profit. Who knows the way this baby trades, it could see .00001500 and that is no joke.  If and only IF the volume returns and you see the RSI back over 50 it's a no brainer. Bet the ranch. I did and turned .25 BTC into 2.65 BTC's. I'm not bragging about it, just saying for those who got caught at the top, as long as volume stays over 20-30M, you will get your money back but you must average down.  I just loaded the entire 2.65 MINUS my iniitial .25, so I just bought at .00000240 ? Stupid Yes, Risky yes, but I'm telling ya this coin has a routine people. It will go back up, how much, how soon all depends on the volume. You see a spike in volume. Buy. Anyone caught over .00000350 would be very follish not to average down here. Again, I have been trading crypto since November 2017, I took all my money out of the NYSE and NASDAQ and invested everything I had, even my 401K. I suffered huge losses, but I did not lose my initial investment. You can't swim up a river with a huge current so wait until the current turns. We are entering that phase of the next bullish run of BTC into 2019 where the experts have predicted 25,000 by year end. Now any solid alt-coin on Binance will rock 100K or even 1000X the current price. I've seen it last year and I will see it again.   A coin like KEY is KEY to success as long as the volume is good. It also follows BTC very evenly so when BTC spikes, this baby will too. Don't be discouraged, it's consolidating now for a HUGE push higher. Sure it may drop to 200 but not for long. I plan to ride my 997,000 coins of this baby to at least .00000400 from where it is now @.00000242",False

There were a couple of reasons for the decision. More flexibility with multiple ETH addresses. In our current data model, every new ETH address created in the SelfKey Identity Wallet is associated with a SelfKey ID consisting of your ID attributes and documents. This creates a lot of friction if you want to have multiple ETH addresses for different use cases. By decoupling this in the backend and using profiles, there is more flexibility to use different ETH addresses for one SelfKey ID. Login with SelfKey Dependency: Login with SelfKey (LWS) is a browser plugin that offers participating websites a decentralized mechanism to securely identify and authenticate users without exposing them to a single point of failure in the event of a data hack. On a high level, the authentication mechanism works by using your ETH address that‚Äôs connected to the SelfKey Identity Wallet as login details. The database updates we‚Äôve been working on will improve how this works in the backend as the browser communicates with the application.  Login with SelfKey In the last month, our business development team has taken a working MVP of the browser plugin to meetings with crypto exchanges in China and provided a brief demo of how it works. For exchanges, this helps them reduce the operational cost of KYC while allowing new users to onboard faster and maintain compliance. By having this button on their website, it also provides SelfKey with more visibility within the blockchain identity space.  Manual Refreshing of Transaction History Sending assets on the Ethereum network can be challenging when the network speed is not within our control. Inside the SelfKey Identity Wallet, we have a transaction scanner built that monitors incoming and outgoing activity of assets to be displayed in the dashboard. Last month we made an addition to this by including a button to manually refresh the transaction history. During testing, we found that the network confirmation speeds vary a lot between transactions and that it‚Äôs better to have this functionality to improve usability.  Automatic Builds with Travis CI To improve our internal workflows and increase efficiency, we‚Äôve implemented automatic builds of the SelfKey Identity Wallet with Travis CI for internal testing whenever a pull request is approved and merged from the development team. Travis CI is an integration service that helps us automatically build and test the codebase from Github. After a build is exported and zipped, it gets uploaded into a cloud platform where our QA and product teams can download it to test new features or bug fixes.  Nano Ledger S We‚Äôve successfully sent ETH and KEY on the Ethereum mainnet through the UI of the SelfKey Identity Wallet. We will have a few remaining tasks to finish before this integration is complete, namely error message handling if a transaction isn‚Äôt confirmed, disconnections, and HD derivation paths of new ETH addresses to select when connecting your Ledger. We look forward to wrapping up this integration soon as it was in very high demand from the user testing group and community feedback. After this, we will also move on to integration with the TREZOR hardware wallet.  Decentralized Identity A smart contract was implemented as the basis for Selfkey decentralized identities, which allow the management of different authentication keys, among other attributes for future use. Also, a DID (Decentralized Identifier) resolver library was implemented, for retrieving the keys and relevant authentication data linked to a given identity from any client app. DIDs act as the entry point for self-sovereign identity, and provide the foundation for the development of verifiable attestations on the Selfkey Marketplace. You can read more about DIDs and verifiable attestations here.  Marketplace Development of the Exchanges marketplace is on track. We are implementing and testing components to enable an instant KYC sign up from within the Wallet, both for exchanges that plan to use our KYC software and for integrations with platforms that use their own KYC systems.  Conclusions We have finished another month of intense work with satisfactory results. We will be planning a small beta release to a group of about one thousand community members that initially signed up to participate in alpha testing group. While not everyone was able to schedule a test session, we hope this can help you get a better idea of what we‚Äôve been working on in the last few months. Please stay tuned to the official announcement channels when this is ready. From the alpha testing group, we also got some good feedback from participants in Telegram and will continue to do so with more structure by having dedicated office hours every week. Our product team will open up 4-5 time slots (30 mins each) every Thursday for community members to book a call to talk about SelfKey, discuss what we are working on, or demo the latest features in development. Community members that applied to be in the alpha testing group back in March will get first priority. Our team has also been busy with recruitment, working adding team members to the design and development roles. Specifically, we‚Äôve been looking for a senior UX designer and Junior UI designer to work together across all our product verticals for both B2B and B2C. We are also shifting elements of our application to React that can provide reusable components to give us more flexibility and efficiency within the codebase. We‚Äôve also added new hires to our internal operations and marketing team this month. As a remote team that is growing fast, it‚Äôs important to have good processes in place since we‚Äôre not all in the same room. Part of this involves nurturing the culture that we already have with the internal team, and maintaining this as we become a larger organization and work with candidates of all walks of life that are interested in blockchain technology.",False

We‚Äôve been in contact with 40 community members so far to join this initial group, and are excited to get their feedback.  In the alpha version, you can build your SelfKey ID (KYC profile), which consists of two parts: attributes and documents. Attributes are data points about your identity such as name, birthday, nationality, tax numbers, or email. Documents can be an ID card, driver‚Äôs license, passport, utility bill, or bank statement, among others.  In line with our self-sovereign identity core purpose, these KYC documents and attributes are encrypted and stored in your personal device, nobody, except you, has access to them and will only be shared with your consent.  In addition, with the Wallet you can manage your ETH-based tokens. Sending, receiving and adding a custom token in a much more intuitive and smooth way than in other cryptocurrency wallets interfaces like MyEtherWallet. You can also track your portfolio dollar value easily with the latest price information of CoinMarketCap.",False

For example, a purchase of $10,000 worth of physical gold enables a $7,500 loan. The ability to leverage assets for loans is not only for businesses, individuals are also eligible.   For its part, the Dutch Antilles-based bank will initially accept business and personal bank account applications in either EUR or USD.  Selfkey has been conceived to provide the necessary tools for individuals and companies to truly own and manage their digital identity and to find more freedom, privacy and wealth.

Invox Finance is a blockchain-based peer-to-peer invoice lending platform that brings decentralisation to the invoice financing industry and allows quick and effective connection among invoice buyers, sellers, and financiers sellers on the blockchain.  We will deploy a customized web app to conduct KYC to participants of their Token Sale, and provide identity and compliance services for sellers, buyers and investors that participate in their invoice lending platform.  As most of you already know, we have already enabled KYC platforms for successful fundraising events such as the decentralized exchange Airswap, which managed to raise more than USD 36M, the luxury goods and services decentralized marketplace Aditus, which raised USD 7M, the gaming platform HoToKen, which has already raised USD 20M, and Gatcoin, a retail reward platform that sold USD 14M worth of their native tokens, among others.  As the latest news confirm, cryptocurrencies and token sales are increasingly under regulatory scrutiny, and most of these projects are aware of the importance of carrying out KYC with the highest standards to avoid onboarding bad actors and the future legal drawbacks that may entail, which represents a great opportunity for our project.  We are positioning SelfKey as a market leader in this space, and the future looks promising: With the Identity Wallet and the Token Sales marketplace, we offer an all-in-one solution for users to safely and with certainty perform all required actions when participating in a Token Sale and companies to easily conduct compliant KYC processes.

KEY also is the value exchange method within the Bihu Community, such as tipping between users.

Four days before the planned closing date of the sale we hit our Cap with $15,840,000 worth of KEY tokens sold. We would like to thank you for your support and confidence in our project.  If you did not have the chance to participate, on January 14th, SelfKey will hold the Crowdsale. The event is scheduled to last two weeks, until January 31st.  This will be the only Public Sale of tokens.  The following are important facts about the token sale:  An amount of $5,940,000 worth of KEY tokens will go on sale. The Token price is $0.015 and there is no bonus schedule. We have reduced the minimum individual purchase cap to $100 so that even small purchasers can participate For the first day the maximum individual cap will be $3000 After the first day, the cap will be $18,000 The maximum amount of tokens that a person is eligible to purchase is 1,200,000 KEY. This represents an amount of $18,000 per purchaser. Note that tokens purchased during the pre-sale count towards this limit of $18,000 Other things to note:  All purchases must be made sending ETH to the SelfKey smart contract address. ETH/USD conversion rate will be determined by the average market rate 24 hours prior to the Crowdsale start. Rate will be published in your KYC account as well as in the official site of SelfKey: selfkey.org Only whitelisted addresses are eligible to participate. More on that below. DON‚ÄôT SEND FUNDS FROM A CRYPTOCURRENCY EXCHANGE. YOU MUST SEND FUNDS FROM AN ERC-20 TOKEN COMPATIBLE WALLET. BE CAREFUL: WE WILL NEVER ASK FOR YOU TO SEND FUNDS VIA E-MAIL, MESSAGE OR ANY WEBSITE OTHER THAN TOKEN.SELFKEY.ORG Make sure that you understand the Token Sale Instructions and the KEY Token Sale Terms and Conditions before participating.  WHITELISTING  All participants are required to whitelist their addresses before purchasing.  In order to whitelist their address, participants must go through the KYC process, upload a copy of their ID (ID card or passport or driver‚Äôs license),a selfie holding it and answer 4 binary questions. After that, they must wait for a confirmation e-mail with the result of their process (Approved/Rejected).  Only approved KYCs are eligible to purchase tokens.  Note that US, China and New Zealand residents are not eligible to purchase.  Participants that have already whitelisted their address during the Pre-Sale are not required to go through the process again.  The whitelist is open now at token.selfkey.org and won‚Äôt close until the end of the Crowdsale. However, we recommend to go through the process as soon as possible to make sure that you will be ready to join the Crowdsale from day one.  Unlocking the tokens  The KEY tokens will be automatically credited in your wallet after your funds are successfully sent to the SelfKey contract address and your KYC is approved. However, these tokens will be locked until the end of the Crowdsale.  The crowdsale will end when all KEY tokens allocated to the sale are sold or on January 31st at 23.00 UTC, whichever comes first.  Once tokens are unlocked, you will be able to freely transfer them to another wallet.",False

As shown in the graphic above, the Identity Owner for example wishes to open a bank account in a bank listed in the SelfKey marketplace. The bank requires him to provide a certified copy of his passport, proof of address and bank reference letter from his current bank.  Through the Identity Owner‚Äôs digital identity wallet, the Identity Owner can access the documents stored in his personal device and share hashed parts of them with a Certifier, such as a notary, in order to certify them. To do that, the Identity Owner needs to pay KEY tokens to the Certifier.  The Certifier will send the certified documents back to the Identity Owner who in turn will share them with the Relying Party (the bank) to open the bank account.  The Relying Party will require a payment of KEY by the Identity Owner to conduct the KYC process and get his bank account opened. In turn, the Relying Party will pay KEY to the Certifier each time a certification made by him is used to onboard a client.  Placing KEY in a locked contract will also be required to access to the network (to prevent spam via an anti-Sybil mechanism).   Selfkey‚Äôs token economy is consistent and designed to be feasible in the long term:  A user will pay tokens for the attestation of his identity. In the same way that you go to the notary with your physical document to certify it.  The user will pay tokens to onboard in a product or service. In the same way that you currently pay a registered agent to incorporate a company.  The relying parties will allocate a portion of the tokens received to reward certifiers, who have verified the identity of the customer that has been successfully onboarded.  As we have seen, each member of the ecosystem has a valuable role to play utilizing KEY, enabling a transactional economy between the parties. The user can truly control and manage his digital identity and can apply for products and services easily and immediately, avoiding tedious application processes. Certifiers monetize their attestations and relying parties charge tokens for a product or service, get new customers and reduce KYC onboarding costs.  KEY is a mean of value exchange inside the SelfKey marketplace. KEY will be an efficient payment method to buy more than 300 products and services that will be available at launch.  With KEY you will be able to apply for citizenship and residency by investment, incorporate a company, open a bank account, purchase gold and other precious metals, apply for insurance and sign up for bitcoin exchanges, e-wallets and money transfer services, in a safe, secure, self-sovereign manner.",False

Four days before the planned closing date of the sale we hit our Cap with $15,840,000 worth of KEY tokens sold. We would like to thank you for your support and confidence in our project.  If you did not have the chance to participate, on January 15th, SelfKey will hold the Crowdsale. The event is scheduled to last two weeks, until February 1st.  This will be the last Public Sale of tokens ever!  The following are several factors regarding the crowdsale that you must keep in mind before purchasing:  An amount of $5,940,000 worth of KEY tokens will go on sale. The Token price is $0.015 and there is no bonus schedule. We have reduced the minimum purchase from $1,000 to $100 so that even small purchasers can participate The maximum amount of tokens that a person is eligible to purchase is 1,200,000 KEY. This represents an amount of $18,000 per purchaser. Note that tokens purchased during the pre-sale counts towards this limit. All purchases must be made sending ETH to the SelfKey smart contract address. ETH/USD conversion rate will be determined by the average market rate 24 hours prior to the Crowdsale start. Only whitelisted addresses are eligible to participate. More on that below. DON‚ÄôT SEND FUNDS FROM A CRYPTOCURRENCY EXCHANGE. YOU MUST SEND FUNDS FROM AN ERC-20 TOKEN COMPATIBLE WALLET. DON‚ÄôT BELIEVE ANY BOT/EMAIL/PERSON CLAIMING TO BE US WE WILL NEVER OFFER A DISCOUNT NOR SEND THE SELFKEY ETH ADDRESS IN AN E-MAIL, MESSAGE OR ANY WEBSITE OTHER THAN TOKEN.SELFKEY.ORG Make sure that you understand the Token Sale Instructions before participating.  WHITELISTING  All participants are required to whitelist their addresses before purchasing.  In order to whitelist their address, participants must go through the KYC process, upload a copy of their ID (ID card or passport or driver‚Äôs license),a selfie holding it and answer 4 binary questions. After that, they must wait for a confirmation e-mail with the result of their process (Approved/Rejected).  Only approved KYCs are eligible to purchase tokens.  Note that US, China and New Zealand residents are not eligible to purchase. If you are citizen but no resident of one of these countries, we strongly suggest to include a proof of residency along with the proof of ID, such as a residency permit or a proof of address.  Participants that have already whitelisted their address during the Pre-Sale are not required to go through the process again.  The whitelist is open now at token.selfkey.org and won‚Äôt close until the end of the Crowdsale. However, we recommend to go through the process as soon as possible to make sure that you will be ready to join the Crowdsale from day one.",False

SelfKey is the first identity wallet in the market which allows you to access to your identity documents stored in your device, notarize them and apply for and buy residency and citizenship by investment, company incorporation, bank accounts, digital wallets, etc. (check out all services that will be available at launch at http://alpha.selfkey.org/marketplace).  KEY is the first Token with which you can buy these products and services.  The SelfKey platform also provides eNotary, eSign, customized KYC templates, sanction screening, company registry lookup, company laws and kyc laws lookup. I want to remark that this technology is live, tested and implemented in start ups, renowned banks and even used for token sales whitelisting processes. Every process follows the principle of absolute minimization of data exposure by only storing ID data on the users device whereas the blockchain is only used for transmission of hashed Data bits (like your Age for example) There is no centralized database.  Also, the KEY token economy is substantially different from that of other identity management projects. A user will pay KEY for the attestation of his identity. In the same way that you go to the notary with your physical document to certify it.  The user will pay tokens to onboard in a product or service. In the same way that you currently pay a registered agent for the incorporation of your company. The relying parties will allocate a portion of the tokens received to reward certifiers, who have verified the identity of the customer that has been successfully onboarded. This allows for a transactional economy feasible in the long-term, where all parties involved are incentivized to use the KEY token.  If you are still unsure why or how SelfKey is so different from Civic, check out this article: https://blog.selfkey.org/what-makes-selfkey-different-from-its-competitors-ad58e74f4984  And for those who want to dig deeper:  The Whitepaper   Have a wonderful day everyone!",False

Quote from: marcgv on October 29, 2017, 10:48:02 PM Quote from: IgorShumilo on October 29, 2017, 06:24:21 AM Good afternoon. After reading your project, I get the impression that you want to offer a product that is already on the market and they are already being used, I'm talking about projects like Civic and Stratis Identities. Tell me what is the difference from them?  Hi Igor, thank you for your message  I honestly think that there is no similar product in the market.  Civic's current product is focused in authentication (phone number and email), which is not an international KYC standard, whereas ours is.  There is no identity wallet in the market which allows you to access to your identity documents stored in your device, notarize them and apply for and buy residency and citizenship by investment, company incorporation, bank accounts, digital wallets, etc. (check out all services that will be available at launch at http://alpha.selfkey.org/marketplace).  There is no token, with which you can buy these products and services.  There is no identity system in the market that can provide for linked identities and multilevel verification, and offer services to aid company management, such as stock transfer ledger services.  There is no identity wallet with which you can access to your ID documents and store any ERC-20 token, and instantly send them to participate in token sales.  The SelfKey platform also provides eNotary, eSign, customized KYC templates, sanction screening, company registry lookup, company laws and kyc laws lookup. I want to remark that this technology is live, tested and implemented in start ups, renowned banks and even used for token sales whitelist processes.  Currently, there is no product in the market that allows for data minimization.  I want to highlight that SelfKey's approach is transparent. The user does not store any data or documents on SelfKey servers or the Blockchain. These are stored on the user's personal device. There is no centralized database.  Also, our token economy is substantially different from that of other identity management projects.  A user will pay tokens for the attestation of his identity. In the same way that you go to the notary with your physical document to certify it.  The user will pay tokens to onboard in a product or service. In the same way that you currently pay a registered agent for the incorporation of your company.  The relying parties will allocate a portion of the tokens received to reward certifiers, who have verified the identity of the customer that has been successfully onboarded.  This allows for a transactional economy feasible in the long-term, where all parties involved are incentivized to use the KEY token.",False

Currently Civic is a mere email and phone number verifier - SelfKey is an ID product used to do KYC in several token sales and fintech startups such as airswap, aditus, gatcoin etc. Selfkey will deliver an iD wallet on January before our main round, Civic has not delivered any iD product, 6 months right after their token sale. Also, SelfKey has a clear vision of how to manage ID data with minimum risk and exposure - the data is stored on users device never in a server nor in the Blockchain. The Blockchain is used for transmission of single ""ID-bits"" like your age for example, but only after this data has been hashed and is therefore useless to any potential penetrator. SelfKey has many partnerships which some of them are disclosed and other under nda‚Äôs to provide services in the selfkey marketplace - the Technology is tried and true, it has been tested for 3 years now and is already being used in various Token Generation Events (see above)  Please review these articles for further details:  https://blog.selfkey.org/what-makes-selfkey-different-from-its-competitors-ad58e74f4984 https://blog.selfkey.org/the-growing-selfkey-ecosystem-ada849781ca5",False

Not an interesting feature, it is a marvelous feature.  Also, icos would love to use them because at some point near all people will on their database so only a few people would need to make a kyc.

Currently Civic is a mere email and phone number verifier - SelfKey is an ID product used to do KYC in several token sales and fintech startups such as airswap, aditus, gatcoin etc. Selfkey will deliver an iD wallet on January before our main round, Civic has not delivered any iD product, 6 months right after their token sale. Also, SelfKey has a clear vision of how to manage ID data with minimum risk and exposure - the data is stored on users device never in a server nor in the Blockchain. The Blockchain is used for transmission of single ""ID-bits"" like your age for example, but only after this data has been hashed and is therefore useless to any potential penetrator. SelfKey has many partnerships which some of them are disclosed and other under nda‚Äôs to provide services in the selfkey marketplace - the Technology is tried and true, it has been tested for 3 years now and is already being used in various Token Generation Events (see above)  Please review these articles for further details:  https://blog.selfkey.org/what-makes-selfkey-different-from-its-competitors-ad58e74f4984 https://blog.selfkey.org/the-growing-selfkey-ecosystem-ada849781ca5    Quote from: Piggy on December 14, 2017, 06:28:37 PM Is there some plan for a demo of the wallet?

ID remains locally stored in your device.  This makes identity theft unlikely, as there is no database to hack. The only way to steal your identity could be hacking your personal device, but this is an existing risk, whether you use or not SelfKey.     Adding to my previous comment: ID is shared through a hash on the blockchain. This means that your ID is never stored in the blockchain.  Quote from: Robert L.

But all this may on the upside raise peoples awareness about their digital ID.  This is like Orwellian warfare  Could you see a project like Self-Key being implemented into a country like this w/ states? I understand the Nigerian fed. government allowed their states to do as they please, as this identity wallet could be very beneficial to countries that centralize all of their peoples IDs.  Im not sure i understand you correctly here.  Are u asking if a decentralized ID wallet  would be beneficial for countries that centralize IDs?  How would a decentralized ID wallet work in countries that have centralized IDs? Sorry if I'm missing something  SelfKey is a platform that connects users, certifiers and service providers.  Example:  User: you  Certifiers: e.g. notary  Service Provider: e.g. Bank, a crypto exchange, a token sale, corporate secretary, immigration agent..etc  You will have your documents notarized through eNotary services (fully electronic and online)  Then you will share your document notarized with a service provider to access a product or service. Some services such as a coin exchange or a token sale could not require a notarized document. In this case you could directly apply without notarization.  There is no government interaction here.  We have already partnerships in place to run the platform so we can guarantee its usability.  At some point, could be good having governments as verifiers, but this is NOT indispensable. Platform can run without them.  Our desktop wallet will be ready on January, with this wallet you will be able to access ID documents and store ETH, KEY and any ERC-20 Token. This means that you could send KYC+Payment to Token Sales with just one click.  The web wallet is already in use/has been used by Token sales such as Gatcoin, Airswap and many others.  Let me know if any other question.",False

SelfKey won't have control of the tokens sold, so yes you will be able to trade them if you wish.  Regarding your questions about exchanges,  a number of them have expressed interest, as we are also partnering with them to us our Identity Wallet and KYC platform to conduct their KYC onboarding process. By now, we cannot disclose more than that.  2. There is no blockchain based digital identity system in the market with the features of SelfKey. I will quote an answer I gave to another user with a similar question  Quote Hi Igor, thank you for your message  I honestly think that there is no similar product in the market.  Other competitors are focused in authentication (phone number and email), which is not an international KYC standard, whereas ours is.  There is no identity wallet in the market which allows you to access to your identity documents stored in your device, notarize them and apply for and buy residency and citizenship by investment, company incorporation, bank accounts, digital wallets, coin exchanges etc. (check out all services that will be available at launch at http://alpha.selfkey.org/marketplace).  There is no token, with which you can buy these products and services.  There is no identity wallet that can store ETH or any ERC-20 token, where you can send ID documents and ETH, and participate in token sales with just one click   There is no identity system in the market that can provide for linked identities and multilevel verification, and offer services to aid company management, such as stock transfer ledger services.  There is no identity wallet with which you can access to your ID documents and store any ERC-20 token, and instantly send them to participate in token sales.  The SelfKey platform also provides eNotary, eSign, customized KYC templates, sanction screening, company registry lookup, company laws and kyc laws lookup. I want to remark that this technology is live, tested and implemented in start ups, renowned banks and even used for token sales whitelist processes.  Currently, there is no product in the market that allows for data minimization.  I want to highlight that SelfKey's approach is transparent. The user does not store any data or documents on SelfKey servers or the Blockchain. These are stored on the user's personal device. There is no centralized database.  Also, our token economy is substantially different from that of other identity management projects.  A user will pay tokens for the attestation of his identity. In the same way that you go to the notary with your physical document to certify it.  The user will pay tokens to onboard in a product or service. In the same way that you currently pay a registered agent for the incorporation of your company.  The relying parties will allocate a portion of the tokens received to reward certifiers, who have verified the identity of the customer that has been successfully onboarded.  This allows for a transactional economy feasible in the long-term, where all parties involved are incentivized to use the KEY token.  It is easy to see that as the availability of products and features in our identity wallet and marketplace increase, demand of tokens could increase too.

In the SelfKey marketplace you can apply for citizenship by investment, which in layman terms means to buy a passport.  Citizenship by investment are programs launched by countries which offer citizenship in exchange of a donation to the Government, buying real estate in the country, making a bank deposit or starting a business, among others. It is a tool that some small countries use to raise funds.  This means that if you buy real estate or make a donation you can get a Passport of this country.  A second passport is one of the most powerful freedom tools, as provides benefits such as travel freedom, residency, banking, business opportunities, low taxes, and the most important a worst-case insurance.  Think about a Chinese Businessman who is constantly traveling for his business, Chinese have only visa-free to Indonesia, Morocco, Ecuador and a few small countries. This means that for each travel, he has to personally go to an embassy to apply for a visa, which may lasts 3-4 days and sometimes more than 1 week. This is painful.  If he gets a Maltese passport, he can travel to more than 150 countries visa free, including Schengen Area, United States and Canada.  A second passport can change his life, and this is only in travel freedom terms.  Imagine that there is a strong financial crisis, or in the worst case a war, if you have a second passport, you can easily move and start a new life in other place. Think of all of refugees if they had a second passport, their life could change a lot.  However, citizenship by investment applications are document intensive and usually involve several middle-man. Here is where SelfKey stands out: with SelfKey you can get all your identity documents easily and quickly certified and instantly share them with a local lawyer who is authorised to process your application. Things that currently may need a month can be done in a matter of days with SelfKey. Also, as going directly to a local lawyer, applicants avoid fees of maybe 3 or 4 middle man.  At the marketplace demo you can get an idea of the Passports you will be able to buy through SelfKey: http://alpha.selfkey.org/marketplace/passports  here you can find real estate investments that will lead you to citizenship: https://alpha.selfkey.org/marketplace/realestate/  Here it is a press release announcing a partnership between SelfKey and one renowned Citizenship by investment authorized agents: https://imidaily.com/editors-picks/ntl-trust-selfkey-partner-process-cip-applications-blockchain/  If you have any other questions, let me know, I suggest to join our telegram http://t.me/selfkeyfoundation for a live conversation.",False

Hey! Check this answer from Marc of the marketing team, that has all the info on why SelfKey is different.  Quote from: marcgv on October 29, 2017, 10:48:02 PM Quote from: IgorShumilo on October 29, 2017, 06:24:21 AM Good afternoon. After reading your project, I get the impression that you want to offer a product that is already on the market and they are already being used, I'm talking about projects like Civic and Stratis Identities. Tell me what is the difference from them?  Hi Igor, thank you for your message  I honestly think that there is no similar product in the market.  Civic's current product is focused in authentication (phone number and email), which is not an international KYC standard, whereas ours is.  There is no identity wallet in the market which allows you to access to your identity documents stored in your device, notarize them and apply for and buy residency and citizenship by investment, company incorporation, bank accounts, digital wallets, etc. (check out all services that will be available at launch at http://alpha.selfkey.org/marketplace).  There is no token, with which you can buy these products and services.  There is no identity system in the market that can provide for linked identities and multilevel verification, and offer services to aid company management, such as stock transfer ledger services.  There is no identity wallet with which you can access to your ID documents and store any ERC-20 token, and instantly send them to participate in token sales.  The SelfKey platform also provides eNotary, eSign, customized KYC templates, sanction screening, company registry lookup, company laws and kyc laws lookup. I want to remark that this technology is live, tested and implemented in start ups, renowned banks and even used for token sales whitelist processes.  Currently, there is no product in the market that allows for data minimization.  I want to highlight that SelfKey's approach is transparent. The user does not store any data or documents on SelfKey servers or the Blockchain. These are stored on the user's personal device. There is no centralized database.  Also, our token economy is substantially different from that of other identity management projects.  A user will pay tokens for the attestation of his identity. In the same way that you go to the notary with your physical document to certify it.  The user will pay tokens to onboard in a product or service. In the same way that you currently pay a registered agent for the incorporation of your company.  The relying parties will allocate a portion of the tokens received to reward certifiers, who have verified the identity of the customer that has been successfully onboarded.  This allows for a transactional economy feasible in the long-term, where all parties involved are incentivized to use the KEY token.   Quote from: IgorShumilo on October 29, 2017, 06:38:51 AM I immediately had another question: why do you make your token on the platform of the Etherium? After all, he will be dependent on her and I think that this is a bad choice. The project on the platform of the Etherium becomes more and more, and its bandwidth is less, although they say about improvements, but that it is not visible.Personally, I like this Etherium  Classic, why did everyone forget about him((( I'm sorry that not in one message.  I understand your concern but we have chosen the Ethereum Blockchain because in our opinion it is the fairest, most inclusive, and well adopted blockchain currently existing.  If you have any questions on this , please feel free to ask",False

We have reached the Public Sale Maximum Cap ($5,940,000) in 11 minutes! The Total Amount sold is $21,780,000.  The participation, support and feedback has been spectacular. On behalf of the entire SelfKey team, I would like to give you our sincere thanks for all the support shown since we publicly announced the project in early September 2017.  BEWARE OF SCAMS‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäTHE TOKEN SALE IS OFFICIALLY CLOSED DON‚ÄôT BELIEVE ANYBODY CLAIMING TO BE FROM SELFKEY ASKING TO SEND FUNDS TO AN ETH ADDRESS TO BUY KEY TOKENS  SelfKey Token Sale   Identity Wallet and Marketplace to access Token Sales with one click, buy a new passport, set up a company, exchange cryptocurrencies, manage your ETH or ERC-20 tokens and much more‚Ä¶  The SelfKey ecosystem is a blockchain based identity management system that puts identity owners in control of their digital identity and allows them to request document certifications. After the user is verified, they can instantly and securely access products and services avoiding any repetitive and burdensome KYC process. Relying parties, certifiers and identity owners can transact in a secure, private, decentralized manner to exchange identity claims.  SelfKey runs on smart contracts with economic incentives powered by SelfKey tokens (KEY) and smart contracts run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Ethereum Blockchain.  The SelfKey Network mainly consists in the Identity Wallet, the Marketplace and the KEY token‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääall of which are open source and fully auditable:  SelfKey Identity Wallet  The SelfKey Identity Wallet, an open-source digital identity wallet through with which identity owners can securely access and manage their identity attributes and documents, such as passports, stored on their personal device. This removes the need to have that sensitive personal data held by a third party on a vulnerable centralised database or in the blockchain.  In addition to access and share ID documents, the Identity Wallet is capable to store, send and receive ETH, KEY and any ERC-20 Token. Through the SelfKey Identity Wallet and your cryptographic key pairing (private and public), users will be able to digitally sign documents, request identity checks and document certification from certifiers, such as eNotary services, and authenticate at multiple platforms.  These certified identity attributes and documents can be shared with relying parties offering services in the SelfKey marketplace in order to access to their products and services.  SelfKey enables automated processes that re-uses KYC data, allowing for a quicker KYC onboarding process and to save time to complete applications that are currently tedious.  The Corporate Identity Wallet will allow for linked identities that can provide multi level verification, ideal for organizations to easily and quickly have their documents notarized and open bank accounts or establish subsidiaries painlessly.    The SelfKey Marketplace The Marketplace allows users to compare and apply for products and services without having to go through the manual and paper-intensive KYC processing that service providers would require outside the SelfKey network. A pre-alpha version of the SelfKey marketplace is available at alpha.selfkey.org.  These products and services include but are not limited to: citizenship and residency by investment, company incorporation, bank accounts, fintech products, insurance, real estate, precious metals purchase and storage, among others.  In addition, the Identity Wallet will allow for an instant Exchanges account sign up and verification.  As the Identity Wallet is capable to store ETH and any ERC-20 Token, it enables instant onboarding to Token Sales. Being possible to whitelist an address sending KYC documents and transfer ETH to Token Sales, within the same App.  In fact, SelfKey has already powered/is powering several Token Sales KYC processes such as Airswap, Gatcoin, Polymath, AiX, Aditus and others. SelfKey has already established partnerships with financial service providers, corporate services providers, registered agents, lawyers, consulting firms, notaries, exchanges to offer the aforementioned products and services.  Partnerships officially announced and not under NDAs include but are not limited to: Blockchain space: Gatecoin, a Hong Kong based exchange Lykke: B2C Wallet Polymath: B2B2C Securities Token platform Zilla: B2B2C‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäFundraising platform for various ICO‚Äôs Kommerce‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa trade finance blockchain venture for frontier markets Malabar AI‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäB2B & B2C Roboadvisory  Further details: The Growing SelfKey Ecosystem: The 10+ companies building on SelfKey Tech.

KEY Token  The native token KEY, an ERC-20 token used as access rights and payment unit within the network.  The SelfKey network will require participants to stake a certain amount of KEY tokens to access the network. This prevents spam, decreases the total amount of float, and encourages people to buy and hold KEY, and act in accordance with the trust framework (legal agreement) so that relying parties don‚Äôt for instance, misuse identity data‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbecause if they do, they will lose their stake.  Participants will need to hold a certain amount of KEY to unlock marketplaces also. We call this, proof of reputational stake and bonded notaries. Bonded notaries will work exactly how notaries work in the real world, except on chain. The notaries will need to stake a certain amount of KEY in order to become a notary‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin the same way as it currently happens, where a notary has to post a surety bond with the government.  KEY will be also used as a payment unit for document notarization and for products and services offered by relying parties in the SelfKey marketplace. Marketplace listings will be either wholly or partially priced in KEY.  Each member of the ecosystem will have a valuable role to play utilizing KEY, enabling a feasible transactional economy between the parties.  Token Sale The KEY Token Sale will be the only KEY token generation event. A total supply of 6,000,000,000 KEY will be generated and will be allocated in the following way: 1,980,000,000 KEY (33%) to the Token Sale Purchasers 1,980,000,000 KEY (33%) held in a pool to incentivize, support and build the SelfKey Network. This pool will be used at early stages to stake tokens required by Relying Parties and Certifiers, so they can participate in the network at no cost and therefore incentivize the maximum functionality and utility of the platform at its launch. These tokens will be staked in escrow. 990,000,000 KEY (16.5%) to to the founding team, vesting over a 1-year period. 990,000,000 KEY (16.5%) as a reserve and for expenses of establishing and maintaining the Foundation longer term (accounting, legal, marketing, advisors, development and reserve). 60,000,000 KEY (1%) to cover legal costs of the Token Sale.

Am I thinking wrong with this? Because even if you have that encrypted key to unlock your personal identity, still there's some cold storage out there or data storage where you need to access to. So it means that, it is still controlled by a certain entity. So it's not really secure. Please enlighten me on this one.",False

Your identity data and your identity documents are stored in your device, not in a server, not in the blockchain.

Best Regards, Nokaskili  Thank you Nokaskili , stay tuned, we will launch a bounty program, you can join our telegram (http://t.me/selfkeyfoundation) and ping me there and I will personally contact you for that Quote from: li03 on October 24, 2017, 10:00:08 AM This idea is novel and advanced, but this project needs to open up the various governments and policies, only to break these, can be implemented   Hi li03,  SelfKey is an Identity Ecosystem that will allow you to certify your documents and apply for products and services (more than 300 at launch) easily and securely, while having full control of your digital identity. At this level, we do not require government approval. However, we do believe that a new approach on ID is required and sooner rather than later, governments will embrace decentralized technology on this matter. We are confident that the SelfKey Foundation will be there.  Quote from: }{uNdd on October 24, 2017, 10:20:26 AM this is a nice project , but full of personal INFO ....

Civic's current product is focused in authentication (phone number and email), which is not an international KYC standard, whereas ours is.  There is no identity wallet in the market which allows you to access to your identity documents stored in your device, notarize them and apply for and buy residency and citizenship by investment, company incorporation, bank accounts, digital wallets, etc. (check out all services that will be available at launch at http://alpha.selfkey.org/marketplace).  There is no token, with which you can buy these products and services.  There is no identity system in the market that can provide for linked identities and multilevel verification, and offer services to aid company management, such as stock transfer ledger services.  There is no identity wallet with which you can access to your ID documents and store any ERC-20 token, and instantly send them to participate in token sales.  The SelfKey platform also provides eNotary, eSign, customized KYC templates, sanction screening, company registry lookup, company laws and kyc laws lookup. I want to remark that this technology is live, tested and implemented in start ups, renowned banks and even used for token sales whitelist processes.  Currently, there is no product in the market that allows for data minimization.  I want to highlight that SelfKey's approach is transparent. The user does not store any data or documents on SelfKey servers or the Blockchain. These are stored on the user's personal device. There is no centralized database.  Also, our token economy is substantially different from that of other identity management projects.  A user will pay tokens for the attestation of his identity. In the same way that you go to the notary with your physical document to certify it.  The user will pay tokens to onboard in a product or service. In the same way that you currently pay a registered agent for the incorporation of your company.  The relying parties will allocate a portion of the tokens received to reward certifiers, who have verified the identity of the customer that has been successfully onboarded.  This allows for a transactional economy feasible in the long-term, where all parties involved are incentivized to use the KEY token.
