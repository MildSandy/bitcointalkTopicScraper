The pre-sale will close at 23:59 UTC today!  So far the Pre-Sale has matched our expectation, even while having a slower start then we anticipated on.   The team is currently negotiating with several companies and some of them have shown interest to invest into FarmaTrust.   We urge those that are interested to join the pre-sale, to follow the procedure and contact us via presale@farmatrust.com , with the following details: an copy of your ID or driver license, your address of residence, the amount of ETH you wish to invest, your Ethereum address. Keep in mind that he are holding on to the minimum of 25 ETH during the pre-sale.   High scores on ICO rating sites and articles about FarmaTrust  Foundico rated FarmaTrust with a 8.7 out of 10 ICObench scored us with a 4.4 out of 5 Trackico scored us with a 4.6 out of 5 ICOexpert.biz gave us a 4.7 our of 5 ICOranker scored us with 80 out of 100 ICOholder scored us a 4.24 out of 5  Yahoo News has mentioned us 1 of 3 Startups using Blockchain to save lives! TNW has listed us as a Tech to keep your eyes on! HackerNoon has listed us as 1 of the 11 Startups to watch The founder of ICO-Translate has used FarmaTrust as example in his article: Blockchain in Healthcare: Use Cases  Hardcap, what is the position of the team on this? Will the hardcap be lowered?  As our community managers have mentioned several times on the Telegram Channels and other channels, the team has had an extensive discussion about this subject.  In view of the market conditions and fluctuations in the Eth price, the team has decided to limit the amount to be raised on a fiat basis. The hard-cap will be capped to USD$45M. In the current design with an fixed amount of tokens per ETH, we have chosen not to adjust the amount of tokens, but to lock any tokens that will go unsold by this criteria.  Hence the following alternative solution for any unsold tokens will be put into place:  Any unsold tokens will be locked for a period of at least 3 years, with an annual release of 10% (of the initial value) to be offered via FarmaTrust. The tokens will be offered on a market rate +5% to prevent market value decrease. If the tokens are not bought at the offered price, they will return into the lock for another one year period, to await the next release of the 10%.  This design is currently used by Ripple and prevents an dilution of value and support our vision on the possibility to increase token supply by a market demand.  Management Tokens and Advisor Tokens  We've seen several questions arise about the lock on tokens, that are reserved for the management, advisors and other related persons. As in the whitepaper is stated, the tokens are locked for management, but we may have been unclear on those reserved for the Advisors. Tokens that are reserved for the Advisors, will have the same lock periods as the management, respectfully 50% locked for 6 months and 50% locked for 12 months.   FarmaTrust is expanding its team, with an extra advisor!  As FarmaTrust is increasing the intensity of activities towards the Main Token Sale (ICO), we are expanding the team. Desmond Marshall has joined FarmaTrust as an Advisor. Desmond Marshall is the Country Managing Director for The Floor in China and a Partner of Rouge Ventures, specialised in Venture Capital Investment Projects, Advisory in Financial Services and a corporate training partner. Rouge Ventures is also the founder of Pitchperfectevent.com, Asia’s top investor platform.  More information about Desmond Marshall can be found on: http://desmondmarshall.weebly.com/   Activities on our central Telegram Channel  As the waiting time for the launch of the Main Token Sale is still several weeks away, the team will undertake some surprise activities as well as scheduled ones, to keep everyone on their toes! This could be a surprise raffle or a Quiz to keep everyone active, some will be announced days ahead, while others may go without announcement! If you wish to join in on these events, please join our main Telegram Channel, via https://t.me/farmatrust   The management team of FarmaTrust wishes to thank everyone that has shown their interest in our pre-sale and those that have joined.

FarmaTrust uses the blockchain to allow easy monitoring of drug products from the point of manufacture to the point of consumption.  Our aim is to create a network between the pharmaceutical companies, logistic providers, hospitals, and pharmacies to have an integrated worldwide system so data can be trusted, shared, analysed, thereby saving lives and creating efficiencies. Incorporating AI and machine learning will also allow FarmaTrust to provide value added services.  What are the problems FarmaTrust solves? Eliminating counterfeit drugs and save lives Eliminate wasted drugs through expiry dates or environmental conditions Provide transparency and visibility to governmental, NGOs and commercial operations Utilise innovative technologies   What are the industry numbers?  Pharmaceutical industry is worth         $1.2trn and expanding Pharmaceutical industry will be worth    $1.5trn by 2021 Counterfeit Drugs industry is worth     $200bn Online pharmacy industry is worth     $75bn Supply Chain Management industry is    $80bn pa Pharmaceutical Cold Chain Logistics is      $13.4 Billion Pharmaceutical R & D            $149.8 Bn pa Pharma Returns Fraud case, in one instance $300m, in another $180m by one company Expired drugs estimated at approx        $6-10bn pa (USA) Waste through storage             $2bn (USA)   What is the FarmaTrust objective?  Create easily accessible data from Supply Chain Participants in the Pharmaceutical industry and thereby:  Save lives globally by eliminating counterfeit drugs; Prevent price spikes through even global distribution of drugs; Use predictive AI to ensure drugs are delivered “just in time”, to the right place; Use machine learning to find greater efficiencies in SCM and routes to market; Reduce corruption in the supply of drugs by ensuring drugs go where they are meant to (no diversions) Use smart contracts to assist in automatic audit Use smart contracts to make automatic tax payments Use smart contracts to make automatic payments Provide data dashboards to Ministry of Health, Regulators and Pharmaceutical companies   How does it work?  FarmaTrust uses blockchain to track pharmaceutical drugs from the point of manufacture until the point of consumption by working with unique labeling or smart Rifid labeling or  similar tags FarmaTrust is technology neutral, so will work with any legacy system that the SCM participants my use In certain countries where technology solutions are not available, then FarmaTrust provides smartphone Apps to collect data from customs authorities, logistics providers, pharmacies and hospitals.   The FTC Token  FT utility token has the primary use is to track the billions of medicinal packets in circulation throughout the world. The economy is designed upon a holder token, that mints the utility tokens per x period ( weekly ) with an growth amount per quarter to encourage holding.   Why is FarmaTrust Different?  It uses blockchain technology so has immutable records unlike Cloud based systems It can be easily scaled, globally It works with legacy systems (hardware and software neutral) It works in parallel with existing systems  - no additional costs It is blockchain platform neutral It works in both Emerging and Developed markets (it uses smartphone apps in Emerging markets) It provides services to companies as well as the consumer (consumer app) It uses AI and machine learn to provide value added services to companies, governments and NGOs",False

Give me a few day or 2 to get a clear answer on it.  Quote from: bolshojkush on December 09, 2017, 12:17:54 PM I’ve opened the link for whitebook but it is not available at the moment. Do you have agreements with pharmaceutical companies producing medicine or at least maybe you work to some activates with them??     The paper has been updated, but they forgot the name format, This is the correct link. Currently we have received clear indication from an European Pharmaceutical (~50B yearly turnover)  that they are interested in our technology, but due to an NDA we can't openly discuss this. I have requested our CEO to give me the complete information, as I do not receive all the direct information if a company shows information.   Edit: Our CEO gave me the following: The cost of implementation lays into the Millions but it all depends on the length and size of the entire company chain. Do not forget, even if the costs are seemingly high, the market we are speaking about has over 1,3Tn turnover yearly. As example this is the top 10 company's:   Currently we are in talking position with 5 company's and 2 entire country's. We expect to be able to publish 1 or 2 in late Jan, but currently it is all under Non Disclosure Agreement.",False
