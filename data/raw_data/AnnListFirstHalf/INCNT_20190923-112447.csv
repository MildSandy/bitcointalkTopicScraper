The reward rate varies depending on the particular business, but you will get rewarded across all your spend including bills etc. For instance, during August members who spend at caltex will receive 2% of their purchase price back in INCNT. We cannot say the specific amount of INCNT you would receive as that would depend on the current exchange rate. As members will be purchasing in AUD our calculations are based on AUD and converted to INCNT. People who sign up and sync their accounts are NOT committing themselves to any form of subscription, Incent would need to specifically request that a subscription payment and you would be required to consciously approve it. We ask you if you want to subscribe towards the end of your trial period. If you don't like what you see after the 30 days are up, you can delete your account without any cost to yourself.",False

Amber and Incent look similar in the way they automate the purchase of crypto in the course of everyday spending, but aside from buying different crypto (BTC/INCNT), what funds the purchases is very different. In the case of Amber, customer purchases are rounded up and the change used to buy BTC. For Incent, the money comes partly from regular subscriptions and partly from retailer deals.  Waves World is an ecosystem that includes a mining pool, Telegram community and tipbot, marketplace where you can buy things for crypto, and a few other things. WW is focused on the crypto world, while Incent is designed for mainstream adoption. They both use the Waves blockchain but the infrastructure used to deliver rewards is completely different.",False

Over the past two years, loyalty has emerged as a major use case for blockchain technology, offering efficiencies and entirely new business models. It is an open secret that conventional consumer loyalty is broken, with most rewards schemes offering little value for customers and retailers alike.  Now, Incent – Australia’s first major crypto project, established in 2016 – is ready to target a broken industry with ground-breaking new technology. Incent offers a means for ordinary consumers to save and build wealth as they go about their day-to-day spending – turning their crypto rewards into a meaningful nest egg at a time when millennials and younger generations are struggling with debt and lack of opportunity as never before.  Flagship Product Incent’s flagship product is a platform with a built-in wallet that plugs into bank accounts and other services, seamlessly distributing rewards against spending and other user activity. The product enables users to receive tailored rewards from retailers, while businesses can learn more about their customers’ spending habits on an aggregate basis, allowing ordinary shoppers to monetise a valuable resource: their data.  ‘As a crypto token, the openness and fixed supply of Incent means we can actually use it to build wealth through everyday spending – channeling consumer dollars into an asset of holding value that can’t be expired or diluted by the issuer,’ comments Incent CEO Rob Wilson, the former naval officer who founded the company.  Frictionless tech Incent’s advantages are built on two key technologies. The first is blockchain. INCNT is a digital token that can be transferred, traded or held independently of any third parties – unlike conventional rewards, which are carefully controlled by their issuing companies. The INCNT token has been freely available to trade on major crypto exchange Bittrex since early in 2017. (For everyday users, the AUSTRAC-registered and patent-pending Incent platform offers a simple and convenient way to access their rewards.)  The second major strand is Incent’s custom-built InSync technology, which offers users the ability to sync their bank accounts in a similar way to mainstream accounting software and mobile phone banking apps. The upshot is that issuance of rewards against purchases can be absolutely seamless, with crypto tokens automatically credited to the customer’s Incent account. ‘And it’s all without the need for any plastic loyalty cards, new point-of-sale terminals or any other retailer infrastructure,’ explains Jins Kaduthodil, Incent’s co-founder and Head of Product. ‘There is literally zero friction for businesses or consumers.’  Mainstream launch Incent’s waiting list is currently live, with full launch planned for July. Consumers will be rewarded in Incent tokens on every spend they make. To find out more, visit www.incent.com.

A ton of loyalty point plastic. How much value did it represent? Did we even know?  Well, not much as it turned out most had expired. The conventional loyalty sector looks a lot like the contents of my wife’s purse; tired, bloated and segmented, with value leaking all over the floor.  This is because points loyalty is centred around the individual issuing entities. This leaves consumers cold because the digital “buttons” awarded only have any utility if redeemed with the issuer – and only then for a limited time. And issuers don’t like points loyalty either because nobody likes operating (or paying for someone else to operate) something that consumers – who are humans too – just don’t value any more.  humans don’t like restriction  Then bitcoin and blockchain came along – and everything changed. We glimpsed a better future;  a future in which consumer spending decisions might better be incentivised with real, open, tradable value than digital breadcrumbs. In a post-GFC climate where ‘financial wellbeing’ is widely cited as the number one stressor in the first world, it seemed to us that anyone who rewarded desired behaviour with real, open, tradeable value was far more likely to secure customer loyalty than those offering time-limited IOUs.  humans love freedom and will come back to get more of it  Jins and I founded Incent on a shared belief that humans who are are doing a little better than struggling from pay-check to pay-check are happier humans; that the means to build a little capital as they go about their everyday lives gives humans the ability to make plans, to hope and to see the best in themselves and others.  We realised that the malaise of conventional loyalty represented an opportunity to re-engineer the mechanics of incentivisation writ large. After all, in the post-internet era, it isn’t just merchants vying for our spend. As the Attention Economy explodes around us, everyone who wants to incentivise anything is vying for our eyeballs. Humans have become the finite resource.  In the Attention Economy humans are the finite resource  Post blockchain we thought it ought to be possible to build technology that allowed anyone to reward any digitally trackable action – not just purchase behaviour. And then it would be possible for humans, just through living their everyday lives, to start accumulating real value – above and beyond their paycheck.  So we assembled a small team, started talking about our ideas and secured the backing to get to work. Our brief was to build technology that:   1. Puts humans first – because if the benefactor of a reward really values it, loyalty follows.  Not Loyalty but LoyalME  2. Removes barriers to entry – that is, seamless and frictionless for both issuers and recipients.  Set and Forget  3. Broadens utility – so that anyone can incentivise any desired behaviour, not just merchants and not just spending.  Buy, Click, Scan, Read, Watch, Send and Do  For the last 2 years, we have been building and testing solutions that nudge us towards this goal. We’ve had some setbacks and successes along the way but we have stayed true to our core values and brief and we’re very proud to announce that our first mainstream consumer launch is finally just around the corner – July to be precise. And it’s truly revolutionary. Using our global patent-pending technology it will be possible, for the first time ever, for humans to get rewarded seamlessly across their entire spend, irrespective of what they spend on (including rent, bills and even tax!) or how they pay. No cards or swipes are required – just set and forget.  And that’s just for starters. The next launch will make it possible for merchants to offer and track bonus rewards to our community for their custom.  Finally, by year-end, it is our goal that all of our users have the ability to reward and be rewarded for any digitally trackable behaviour by any other Incent user, instantly and seamlessly, with a real, open and tradeable digital commodity that revalues as a function of demand for it.  With all revenue funnelled back into the reward commodity itself, everyone benefits from the activity of everyone else.     It’s worth taking a minute to consider the potential good that this technology can bring to everyone from the smallest scale content creators to the largest brands, and consumers rewarded for their attention, actions and behaviours – building wealth as they go about their everyday lives. This is what drove us to build Incent. We’re excited to be approaching the next stage of what we hope and expect to remain a rewarding journey.

That quote is from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gFVfMTBOuo - it's not clear at all whether this launch happened, or simply failed. Noteworthy for me is that the question posed by Phil as a comment remains unaddressed - how on earth can this work as a way to build a business or platform?  https://www.producthunt.com/posts/incent was also posted recently - ""So shopping is just the start"" said the founder, then ""We are already running a trial with a few video streamers"" - which seems different to me.  Simone posed the same question basically that Phil did before, and this time the answer is ""We are currently giving it away to get users on board. BUT we are actively working to have businesses and merchants come on board to pay for the reward itself."" - so it seems that for 3 years, the product has basically been a confused  solution in search of a problem.  https://medium.com/incent-loyalty-blog/archive details several 'launches' over the last few years ( ""Incent Goes Live!"" - March 2018) but no actual genuine adoption or users.

Esports is a fast-growing, global phenomenon which can see live crowds in the tens of thousands, and millions more tuning in online to watch the world’s best video gamers battle it out for prestige, professional prize money and even national pride.  New and existing Australian fans watching the Gfinity Elite Series presented by Alienware will now have their time and levels of engagement rewarded with an innovative new, tradeable cryptocurrency (INCNT).  Incent co-founder and CEO, Rob Wilson, said the deal is the culmination of two years’ hard work developing a truly scalable, world-class digital currency platform that is simple, flexible and secure to use.  “This is a massive opportunity for Incent to plug in to one of the world’s fastest-growing communities and introduce it to a completely unique, simple and frictionless means of acquiring a tradable digital currency that is theirs to keep, and does not expire. This is the first ever mass-market application for crypto in Australia – if not the world – and we’ll be putting crypto into the hands of tens of thousands of new users as a result of this one partnership alone.”  Incent runs on the Waves blockchain, which has been lauded for being able to handle vastly larger transaction volumes than the Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchains, for dramatically less cost, while also boasting best-practice security capabilities.  According to Dominic Remond, CEO Gfinity Esports Australia, Incent is the ideal platform to help it drive deeper engagement with its already tech-savvy audiences, while yielding valuable data and insights to inform marketing and broadcast programming.  “Esports and blockchain are a natural fit and we look forward to working with Incent at the vanguard of this exciting new trend in entertainment and sport, where fans and players will be able to interact and share value in an entirely new way,” Remond added.  Founded in Sydney late 2016, Incent built the world’s first crypto-based engagement and rewards platform and Australia’s first cryptocurrency: INCNT.  There are currently over 5,000 individual members signed up to the platform to earn INCNT from close to 400 merchants. Incent expects this number will grow on the back of the deal announced today.  Gfinity Esports Australia was established by HT&E Events and Gfinity Plc, in August 2017, to launch Australia’s first city-based franchise league, the Elite Series presented by Alienware.  According to the Interactive Games and Entertainment Association’s (IGEA) Digital Australia 2018 Report 67% of Australians play video games, and almost half (47%) are women. And while video games were once considered just for kids, the average age of an Australian gamer today is 34. A third of Australian gamers report they have watched esports, of which 10% watch to follow an esports team, with 52% tuning in to watch the best in action and learn tips to improve their own gaming skills.  About Incent Incent is a rewards platform hosted on the Waves blockchain network. The initiative was launched in 2016 and the Incent token (Symbol: INCNT), Australia’s first cryptocurrency was created shortly afterwards. In January 2018, Incent launched its toolbar, a Chrome extension that rewarded users for browsing the web. In May Incent launched its online Marketplace, enabling customers to earn INCNT as they shop online with hundreds of affiliated merchants. Most recently Incent unveiled technology that makes it possible for users to be rewarded seamlessly by shopping directly at partner merchants, online or in-store.

It would not be a major payoff for someone creating a phishing scheme, also given that the majority of targeted users would probably still figure out how to avoid getting scammed by such a scheme.  It would be worth mentioning to the community that the various Incent Loyalty accounts and webpages have been verified by Metacert, which means that if you navigate using Metacert's Cryptonite chrome extension, you will always see a green shield when you are on an official Incent page.   If you were to somehow end up on an identical looking fake Incent page, the shield would be black, indicating that it is not the official page, and that there could be some danger if you enter any of your personal details.   If such a scheme were to be created, it could be reported to Metacert and they would flag the page so that when you navigate towards it with the Cryptonite App, you would see a warning page appear on your browser alerting you that it is not safe to proceed.",False

I am a member of an Instagram P&D group, and while I haven't partaken in any of the pumping/dumping activity, I have limited myself to just watching and using it as yet another tool to gain a wide understanding of these markets and I have analyzed all the activities for this particular Instagram P&D group and I haven't seen any mention, not once of INCNT, they mentioned a few other coins like BAT coin, and some other weird low profile coin, but INCENT wasn't there.  This leads me to believe that POSSIBLY the price hike wasn't related to soneone wanting to intentionally pump the price up, but mere people speculating, after all this is a speculative market where only one rule governs how the price is going to be next: speculation, or gambling, with the hope that with a future higher price pays a great return.  I have noticed that the standard 24 H volume for INCNT was within the $5x,xxx ranges or 5 digits range but recently it has spiked to over $1.2 million for the 24H volume, this is something that is very difficult to perform with one of those classic Instagram Pump and Dump groups.  With the price of Bitcoin surging mid $8xxx people are starting to take it to the altcoin market and INCNT could be very well part of people's target of coins/tokens to invest/speculate or gamble in, since its total supply is limited to 48 million tokens, it's priced at $0.15 to $0.20 cents and its very easy to see this priced in the multi dollar range in the future giving its relatively low supply.  Other tokens that has way more circulation than what INCNT has is priced somewhere around the 40 to even 1 dollar range and the friction to get to those prices was much higher than that for INCNT total-circulation-wise speaking, so I am pretty sure it can entirely be possible for one INCNT to be priced around $1~10 in the future.

I hope it's been worth the wait and think you'll agree things are looking pretty exciting right now. Cross-posted from Slack:  rob [5:10 AM] Okay chaps, so I'd like our next formal update to centre on a product development update by Jins, but in advance of this I do have some news I'd like to share. Here goes:  [5:13] 1. Our litigation finally settled yesterday. I am not at liberty to discuss any of the details but suffice it to say that I am content with the terms reached. And I am more content still that we have emerged relatively unscathed from an ordeal which, for a time, posed an existential threat to the project.  rob [5:22 AM] 2. The team is growing: Jins Kaduthodil (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jjkaduthodil/) is now full time as COO and Head of Product, Mary Powell is full time on Compliance preparation, Bobby Watts (https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertjwatts/) has joined as our lead on Business Development and Jackson Chan (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackson-chan/) is joining us from Macquarie Group on 13 Nov. We are on the hunt for one further developer but we have sufficient to get out of the gate and I want to make sure we get the right fit. (edited)  [5:27] 3. Timeline: with back-end work (internal) progressing well and front end effort ramping up (Round Table Apps) I see nothing at the moment which will prevent the core work being completed in-step with the product roadmap we released last month.  rob [5:34 AM] 4. Launch. We have taken the decision to target 26 Jan 18 (Australia Day) for the launch of our first pilot product, which will be a Chrome Extension that when active, rewards Australian consumers with Incent (which we buy back off the secondary market) for online purchases. Essentially this is an affiliate marketing play but whereas competitors make program members wait up to 3 months for a cash-back reward, the release of Incent can be more or less instantaneous. Given the prevailing hunger amongst the Australian public to 'get into crypto' we are quite excited about the potential of this product to make an impact. So we are going to give it a red hot go.  rob [5:39 AM] 5. Brand. We've spent the last month in a branding exercise with this gentleman https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-busby-andrews-6b9b275/. As I await formal feedback on Busby's deliberations I genuinely don't know how far he will suggest we go or the extent to which we will feel compelled to enact whatever he recommends, but I will keep you informed before we do anything drastic.  [5:41] 6. Marketing and PR. You'll appreciate that to succeed, the pilot product is going to need quite a push locally, so you're going to see marketing efforts ramp up gently until Christmas and hit 'overdrive' as we move into the New Year.  rob [5:50 AM] 7. Market Operations. It will surprise none of you to learn that the approach of a commercial release is concentrating thought this end on settlement. As it stands we have programmatic solutions ready through both Bittrex and Waves DEX but while our preference, for reasons you all understand well, would be to settle through the DEX, we need to move the volume across first. While I'm not in a position to confirm exactly how we will attempt to achieve this just yet, I want you to know that this is our aspiration so that you understand what you are seeing when we do get cracking. Finally, I want to be clear that any market operations we undertake have the sole aim of facilitating settlement.  [5:51] Okay, so that's the headlines for the moment.

That is fully considering that this has been a project that has been put on ""hold"".   We have seen a few instances where there was a temporary increase in price, but that was only due to various pump and dump efforts.  We have even noticed a fake Incent twitter account that someone set up in the hopes of spreading fake news in order to artificially inflate the price.   Until there is an actual push from real market activity related to Incent's core product, you are really just looking at poorly informed market speculation of some random altcoin.   Looking at it that way, you are better able to separate fact from fiction.   Very soon this will change, based upon the latest news that the team is now very close to launching.  So if this is a very low price point for Incent right now, it could be an opportunity to get in, or get back in for those who left after the period of trouble.    The original roadmap was devised a year ago, at a time when the crypto world looked and felt very different than it does today.   I think it is a good sign if they have changed certain important details in  order to adapt Incent to the current cryptocurrency ecosystems.  ",False

Central to this effort has been forcing ourselves to re-validate our mission and re-imagine our stack from first principles. Not only is this work complete but with a month of development effort under our belt, we’re ready to update you on where we are at and where we are heading.  The first thing to confirm that since our mission is for Incent to become the global rewards programme, we still need to build a fully ‘hosted’ solution that will allow e-commerce and bricks‘n’mortar merchants, and third party developers, to rapidly integrate our rewards solution into their existing operation, and trade in and out of Incent (INCNT) seamlessly thereafter.  …think, Stripe but for loyalty rewards  The aspiration is that our partners and their consumers enjoy a seamless gateway between fiat and crypto that allows them to benefit from the value without having to endure the friction that has, in our opinion, attenuated mainstream adoption of crypto thus far.    Meeting this demands that we take responsibility for the security of account holders’ value and its movement across our ledger and this, in turn, requires a cloud-based Payments Card Industry (PCI) compliant platform, even if we are not actually handling credit cards ourselves. A PCI-compliant architecture will also enable higher security for the storage of all sensitive data.  After researching potential solutions, we have commissioned Round Table to build this architecture. Co-location in Sydney has allowed us get to know the Round Table team well; they have a deep reservoir of expertise and horsepower on which to draw and this arrangement allows Jins, our COO and head of product, to oversee their efforts while our in-house team focus on development of the Incent Exchange engine, which we consider our core IP.  Once this core architecture is complete, Round-Table’s focus will shift to the front-end components as our team completes work on the API and client integrations.  With respect to client integrations, our first priority will be an e-commerce snippet or ‘droplet’ that can be ‘dropped’ into any existing codebase to allow the award and redemption of Incent against total basket value. Focus will then switch back to completion of a mobile app that can be profiled for the requirements of either a merchant or a consumer, to transact Incent at the Point-of-Sale.  As you can appreciate, there’s a bit to get through but while I remain as cautious as any tech startup CEO with respect to the forecasting of delivery milestones, this is what we are currently thinking…    In the meantime, the rest of us are finally able to turn our attention back to marketing and business development. More about this in a later update.  Best,  Rob W.",False

Let me be blunt with you from the start – the purpose of my trip was to see with my own eyes if the project is still worth investing my time and effort in, particularly as I felt like being left in the dark since pretty much mid of July, and to communicate my findings to you, the community. The above-mentioned communication issue reflected in our Slack team and Bitcointalk thread – communication from my side was at an all-time low. Working remote doesn’t make such a situation easier, neither for me nor for Rob & Tara Down Under.  In this community update I want to mainly make you understand and realize what lead to this unpleasant situation. Allow me to be extensive as there were numerous different factors and fronts that caused all of this. Moreover, I am going to give you an insight into our current team, our reworked concept and where we stand development-wise. Last but not least, I want to make you aware that all of what you’re going to read in this update is my view on things without anyone else interfering.   The “Incident” & its aftermath So, before I kick off I want to state that I can’t share any hard facts as the lawsuit is still on-going. Actually, I don’t even want to talk about “the incident” but solely focus on the aftermath and my view on how the story (hopefully) pans out.  Let’s dive straight into it: So, Peter quit the project from one moment to the other without any succession planning in place. The Sydney team didn’t have access to anything related to IT: Servers, BitBucket, E-Mails, Intellectual Property, Google Firebase, any online service/account as well as several crypto wallets. The Sydney team, in particular Tara, spent a tremendous amount of time throughout the course of 1.5 months just on getting access back to the above-mentioned services and infrastructure. The mission was a success, we regained access to everything, the last missing piece being our servers just a couple of days ago. Also, Rob had spent pretty much all his time on the lawsuit and other issues associated with it; luckily this has decreased down to 1 or 2 days per week. All of us can’t wait for the day when this story is finally settled, we can put all our efforts back into the project and look ahead towards a hopefully bright future.  What I find more important to stress here, however, is the mental impact. Please allow me to be blunt and upfront with you: Rob had difficulties sleeping, lost his appetite and was more occupied with sorting out the legal case than with anything else. This is both very frustrating and health damaging. This resulted, understandably, in a lack of communication with the community and me in particular. I’d like to take the opportunity to admit that I can fully understand that behavior and do not hold any grudge. It’s actually quite the contrary – Rob (and Tara) proved a level of integrity and commitment to the project only a handful of people have. Last but not least, I’d like to emphasize the commitment Guy showed right after “it” happened – he did not hesitate but booked the first flight he could to Sydney. Trust me when I say that it’s not easy to find such people.  The Incent team First things first, we are going to update the team section on our homepage within the next couple of days; the old, outdated team picture has already been removed.  At the beginning of June, when the world was still intact, we employed Matt and Nadia. Both of them started working for Incent Loyalty without having had experience with blockchain applications before and are slowly but surely finding their way into this new technology. They weren’t even working for Incent for two months when “it” happened. Nonetheless, Matt and Nadia continued their work seamlessly which I personally don’t take for granted. Both have displayed their integrity in this difficult time and that can’t be emphasized enough. I experienced them at work over the last couple of days and can openly say that I am impressed – they are diligently working hand in hand, supporting each other for the sake of the project. I am super happy to have them on board and am confident that they will continue to have a positive impact on the project.  Jins was originally brought on board to organize the business: Implement internal processes, take care of Human Resource Management, upgrade the internal communication and more. He is also instrumental when it is about turning Rob’s ideas and concepts into an understandable task list for the developers. Jins also did not hesitate and was ready to fill in as CTO, even if it turns out to be only temporary in the end. Considering he had his own startup and brings in an IT background, we are lucky to call him a part of the team.  Rob also brought in Mary as Compliance officer and she was a vital part of the team from the very start, particularly at the beginning of July when the story kicked off. However, her main task is to make Incent Loyalty’s business model compliant in accordance with the domestic regulatory framework.  Our re-worked concept Our original concept was aimed at online businesses, rather than brick & mortar businesses, in the form of self-deployable plug-ins. This in itself was fine, the problem were the many dependencies in our original approach, e.g. real-time purchasing of Incent on a centralized exchange. Not only does this put a lot of load on the applications back-end, but also does the model, as mentioned above, create massive dependencies on external services over which we have no power. This became evident when we tested the concept in ICOtech – we never managed to achieve real-time purchasing of individual Incent orders.  Furthermore, Rob talked to a top-notch marketer and her impression of Incent was positive: It’s sexy. Her educated suggestion was to not roll-out with online merchants but brick & mortar businesses, aim for millennials in their hot-spot areas and grow from there. Combining all these findings, it became clear that we have to change our approach.  The concept we have worked out during my time in Australia is a little different as we decided to include an Incent customer card. There are two QR-codes on the customer card – once a private key to scan and set up a user account, once a public key to have it scanned at the check-out and receive Incent. The intention for the MVP is that the merchant scans the QR-code of the customer either from the application or the Incent customer card, enters the billing amount and Incent get dispersed to the customer out of the merchant’s account. The percentage of Incent a merchant wants to give customers as cash-back is either defined in his profile or individually adapted per client through a slider (which overwrites the default settings). As we decided to not buy Incent in real-time from the secondary market, merchants have to hold Incent themselves. Basically, a merchant tops up his account in-app, distributes Incent to his customers until he starts running out of Incent and then tops up his balance again. In consequence, we are buying Incent in bulk from the market rather than buying back every single order individually.  Our Trump The most significant difference from our original plans is a natively implemented affiliate program. Whenever a user or merchant on-boards a new user (by sending out a referral link either over text or e-mail; phone-to-phone by reading their QR-code or by providing his Incent card to scan the QR-code), he is going to earn an affiliate payment on every transaction ever done by that user. This is made possible as we charge a percentage commission on each transaction issued using our application or as Rob calls it – “clip the ticket”. The ultimate goal is to have existing users and merchants on-board new customers, earning an affiliate commission on every transaction and therefore seeing their own balance increase in real-time.  Let’s visualize this fee management assuming the sender, who was on-boarded by Merchant A, wants to send reward value to a random recipient. The commission on the transaction by Incent is 2.5% and the affiliate, Merchant A in this case, gets 20% of that.  http://i.imgur.com/TFg5Xwt.png   The sender gets charged the reward value he intends to transfer plus a commission. Incent receives the commission of which 20% flows to the affiliate. This model is set to become one of our main revenue streams.  I’d like to add that each user, be it a merchant or a consumer, has an affiliate. The affiliate can be Incent Loyalty, a merchant which on-boarded a consumer or merchant to the program, or a consumer himself who on-boarded another consumer or merchant. Call to action! We are very interested in hearing your feedback on this re-worked concept and particularly the fee management with the implemented affiliate program.  Development Progress I hate to admit it but there is something that I want to bluntly break down to you: The work that has been done on the project development-wise from February until July was pretty much nothing, sadly. Things are brightening up, though. Matt is in the process of turning the mock-ups we shared with the community into an actual application and he’s almost done with that. I have the TestApp on my phone and it looks great. Our current main focus in terms of development is to turn the new concept into a task list for programmers. We expect this to take another week or two – this is when we are finally going to be able to push the actual application forward. We are planning to have the application development managed, lead and mostly realized by RoundTable who is in Tyro FinTech Hub too, right next to our desks. If this time things turn out the way they should, we hope to have an MVP ready for roll-out by the end of the year. Last but not least, I’d like to admit that development updates in the past were very rare and that this will change.  On another note, we only managed to get back access to our server environment a couple of days ago. Matt set up a new Waves node and Incent is soon going to actively support the network again. Hurray!  Some last words We have a very, very tough time behind us and it’s not yet over. However, things have brightened up significantly, development is finally moving as it should and hopefully the law suit will find an end anytime soon. Rob and Tara both have proven an incredible level of integrity over the last weeks and as Rob said to me: “We will definitely get that fucking MVP out there”. The only reason for giving up on the project really is not finding a market-fit – nothing else will stop us from getting Incent Loyalty out into the wild! To close off, I also want to take the opportunity to thank you guys, the community. Even though shit went down and you were left in the dark, the majority stayed calm and supportive. At no point in time I felt like we lost your trust and goodwill. I cannot express how much appreciated that is from our side – it makes us work even harder for the success of Incent!

Let me be blunt with you from the start – the purpose of my trip was to see with my own eyes if the project is still worth investing my time and effort in, particularly as I felt like being left in the dark since pretty much mid of July, and to communicate my findings to you, the community. The above-mentioned communication issue reflected in our Slack team and Bitcointalk thread – communication from my side was at an all-time low. Working remote doesn’t make such a situation easier, neither for me nor for Rob & Tara Down Under.  In this community update I want to mainly make you understand and realize what lead to this unpleasant situation. Allow me to be extensive as there were numerous different factors and fronts that caused all of this. Moreover, I am going to give you an insight into our current team, our reworked concept and where we stand development-wise. Last but not least, I want to make you aware that all of what you’re going to read in this update is my view on things without anyone else interfering.   The “Incident” & its aftermath So, before I kick off I want to state that I can’t share any hard facts as the lawsuit is still on-going. Actually, I don’t even want to talk about “the incident” but solely focus on the aftermath and my view on how the story (hopefully) pans out.  Let’s dive straight into it: So, Peter quit the project from one moment to the other without any succession planning in place. The Sydney team didn’t have access to anything related to IT: Servers, BitBucket, E-Mails, Intellectual Property, Google Firebase, any online service/account as well as several crypto wallets. The Sydney team, in particular Tara, spent a tremendous amount of time throughout the course of 1.5 months just on getting access back to the above-mentioned services and infrastructure. The mission was a success, we regained access to everything, the last missing piece being our servers just a couple of days ago. Also, Rob had spent pretty much all his time on the lawsuit and other issues associated with it; luckily this has decreased down to 1 or 2 days per week. All of us can’t wait for the day when this story is finally settled, we can put all our efforts back into the project and look ahead towards a hopefully bright future.  What I find more important to stress here, however, is the mental impact. Please allow me to be blunt and upfront with you: Rob had difficulties sleeping, lost his appetite and was more occupied with sorting out the legal case than with anything else. This is both very frustrating and health damaging. This resulted, understandably, in a lack of communication with the community and me in particular. I’d like to take the opportunity to admit that I can fully understand that behavior and do not hold any grudge. It’s actually quite the contrary – Rob (and Tara) proved a level of integrity and commitment to the project only a handful of people have. Last but not least, I’d like to emphasize the commitment Guy showed right after “it” happened – he did not hesitate but booked the first flight he could to Sydney. Trust me when I say that it’s not easy to find such people.  The Incent team First things first, we are going to update the team section on our homepage within the next couple of days; the old, outdated team picture has already been removed.  At the beginning of June, when the world was still intact, we employed Matt and Nadia. Both of them started working for Incent Loyalty without having had experience with blockchain applications before and are slowly but surely finding their way into this new technology. They weren’t even working for Incent for two months when “it” happened. Nonetheless, Matt and Nadia continued their work seamlessly which I personally don’t take for granted. Both have displayed their integrity in this difficult time and that can’t be emphasized enough. I experienced them at work over the last couple of days and can openly say that I am impressed – they are diligently working hand in hand, supporting each other for the sake of the project. I am super happy to have them on board and am confident that they will continue to have a positive impact on the project.  Jins was originally brought on board to organize the business: Implement internal processes, take care of Human Resource Management, upgrade the internal communication and more. He is also instrumental when it is about turning Rob’s ideas and concepts into an understandable task list for the developers. Jins also did not hesitate and was ready to fill in as CTO, even if it turns out to be only temporary in the end. Considering he had his own startup and brings in an IT background, we are lucky to call him a part of the team.  Rob also brought in Mary as Compliance officer and she was a vital part of the team from the very start, particularly at the beginning of July when the story kicked off. However, her main task is to make Incent Loyalty’s business model compliant in accordance with the domestic regulatory framework.  Our re-worked concept Our original concept was aimed at online businesses, rather than brick & mortar businesses, in the form of self-deployable plug-ins. This in itself was fine, the problem were the many dependencies in our original approach, e.g. real-time purchasing of Incent on a centralized exchange. Not only does this put a lot of load on the applications back-end, but also does the model, as mentioned above, create massive dependencies on external services over which we have no power. This became evident when we tested the concept in ICOtech – we never managed to achieve real-time purchasing of individual Incent orders.  Furthermore, Rob talked to a top-notch marketer and her impression of Incent was positive: It’s sexy. Her educated suggestion was to not roll-out with online merchants but brick & mortar businesses, aim for millennials in their hot-spot areas and grow from there. Combining all these findings, it became clear that we have to change our approach.  The concept we have worked out during my time in Australia is a little different as we decided to include an Incent customer card. There are two QR-codes on the customer card – once a private key to scan and set up a user account, once a public key to have it scanned at the check-out and receive Incent. The intention for the MVP is that the merchant scans the QR-code of the customer either from the application or the Incent customer card, enters the billing amount and Incent get dispersed to the customer out of the merchant’s account. The percentage of Incent a merchant wants to give customers as cash-back is either defined in his profile or individually adapted per client through a slider (which overwrites the default settings). As we decided to not buy Incent in real-time from the secondary market, merchants have to hold Incent themselves. Basically, a merchant tops up his account in-app, distributes Incent to his customers until he starts running out of Incent and then tops up his balance again. In consequence, we are buying Incent in bulk from the market rather than buying back every single order individually.  Our Trump The most significant difference from our original plans is a natively implemented affiliate program. Whenever a user or merchant on-boards a new user (by sending out a referral link either over text or e-mail; phone-to-phone by reading their QR-code or by providing his Incent card to scan the QR-code), he is going to earn an affiliate payment on every transaction ever done by that user. This is made possible as we charge a percentage commission on each transaction issued using our application or as Rob calls it – “clip the ticket”. The ultimate goal is to have existing users and merchants on-board new customers, earning an affiliate commission on every transaction and therefore seeing their own balance increase in real-time.  Let’s visualize this fee management assuming the sender, who was on-boarded by Merchant A, wants to send reward value to a random recipient. The commission on the transaction by Incent is 2.5% and the affiliate, Merchant A in this case, gets 20% of that.     The sender gets charged the reward value he intends to transfer plus a commission. Incent receives the commission of which 20% flows to the affiliate. This model is set to become one of our main revenue streams.  I’d like to add that each user, be it a merchant or a consumer, has an affiliate. The affiliate can be Incent Loyalty, a merchant which on-boarded a consumer or merchant to the program, or a consumer himself who on-boarded another consumer or merchant. Call to action! We are very interested in hearing your feedback on this re-worked concept and particularly the fee management with the implemented affiliate program.  Development Progress I hate to admit it but there is something that I want to bluntly break down to you: The work that has been done on the project development-wise from February until July was pretty much nothing, sadly. Things are brightening up, though. Matt is in the process of turning the mock-ups we shared with the community into an actual application and he’s almost done with that. I have the TestApp on my phone and it looks great. Our current main focus in terms of development is to turn the new concept into a task list for programmers. We expect this to take another week or two – this is when we are finally going to be able to push the actual application forward. We are planning to have the application development managed, lead and mostly realized by RoundTable who is in Tyro FinTech Hub too, right next to our desks. If this time things turn out the way they should, we hope to have an MVP ready for roll-out by the end of the year. Last but not least, I’d like to admit that development updates in the past were very rare and that this will change.  On another note, we only managed to get back access to our server environment a couple of days ago. Matt set up a new Waves node and Incent is soon going to actively support the network again. Hurray!  Some last words We have a very, very tough time behind us and it’s not yet over. However, things have brightened up significantly, development is finally moving as it should and hopefully the law suit will find an end anytime soon. Rob and Tara both have proven an incredible level of integrity over the last weeks and as Rob said to me: “We will definitely get that fucking MVP out there”. The only reason for giving up on the project really is not finding a market-fit – nothing else will stop us from getting Incent Loyalty out into the wild! To close off, I also want to take the opportunity to thank you guys, the community. Even though shit went down and you were left in the dark, the majority stayed calm and supportive. At no point in time I felt like we lost your trust and goodwill. I cannot express how much appreciated that is from our side – it makes us work even harder for the success of Incent!

In the future I look forward to doing this by AMA or Interview but right now I need to choose my words with the utmost care and cannot afford to be drawn. I can only hope you understand. Firstly, and with respect to the most recent unpleasantness, I can only say 3 things at this point:      1. A third of our crypto assets are not currently under our control.     2. A NSW high court injunction would render their further movement a criminal offence.     3. We are doing everything we can to secure their return.  Clearly, none of this is ideal but having spent the last 10 days, working up and through a damage limitation and recovery strategy, I feel like we are pulling out of the dive. The purpose of this note is to to share with you all why I feel this way.  Team  So, it’s a jolting moment when one’s Technical Director is, literally, no longer present, particularly without any succession measures in place. But, it’s important to remember that at this point Incent’s technical team is bigger than one man. Matt and Nadia have been with us for nearly 2 months, Bok is alongside and Sergey has rolled straight into the TD role. Also, Jins’ technical background has enabled him lean-in, secure and shore up our technical infrastructure. So while it’s a fact that a lot of IP walked out of the door with Peter, it isn’t like anything we were working on has ground to a halt. Further, it’s forced us to take a fresh look at our development path in the broadest sweep and this has been a wholly positive process.  Further, the arrival of Mary Powell as GM and Compliance Officer could not have been better timed and together with our legal and accounting specialists, I feel that a close team is being forged in a crucible of pressure. This is not what any of us would have wished for but we’re committed, professional adults and we’re determined to come through this trial better and stronger.  Core  So far as the core product is concerned, we have made the decision to simplify the MVP — significantly — such that Incent is bought via a web-app then distributed and traded via a mobile ‘kiosk’ app to and from a consumer’s mobile wallet app. These 3 components will allow us to get to market with an end to end solution in the shortest possible order and provide us with a foundation upon which to build the more advanced functionalities and plug-ins.  I accept that is a more modest entrance to the mainstream commercial market than we had originally envisaged but if we have learned anything over the last 3 months, it’s that sophistication doesn’t scale well, quickly. Beyond which, this MVP realisation removes all barriers to global merchant participation at the outset and gives us the tools to demonstrate the product to potential partners. So this is what we are going to do and we’re excited about it.  ICO Tech  I want to acknowledge the community angst swirling around our hosted ICO service, which stems from a decision I made back in December of 2016 to support demand for Incent quickly, using something we had already built, in a market I felt was set to catch fire.  I also want to assert that there wasn’t a lot wrong with this strategy; the ICO market has taken off and this tech provably boosts demand for Incent when deployed.  Equally, I recognise that our execution of the strategy — both commercially and technically — was poor and I accept that the impact of our failure to deliver what we had hoped to has been significant, on our reputation generally and your confidence in us to deliver our core mission.  Painful though this is to acknowledge, I am minded that history is replete with examples of things that didn’t go right the first time, so while I have hated presiding over such a bloody mess and understand that the course of least resistance would be to shutter it up and move on swiftly, I’ve felt compelled to weigh the strength of the original strategy against the complications we experienced in its execution.  And this process informed a decision I took a month back to re-build the code base, remove the dependencies, strip out the complexity and then look to open-source the lot, with a far simpler demand servo for Incent built-in.  If we follow through with this plan, the code would benefit from exposure to community audit, our maintenance costs would be zeroed and demand for Incent would still be supported whenever a new team deploys it. It would also lower entry costs for new projects wanting to launch projects on the Waves platform, which feels like the least we can do.  Anyway, while we are yet to make final deployment decisions, as I write this update the heavy lifting is well progressed. And what I can promise you is that whatever we decide ultimately to do, Incent will never again host an ICO on behalf of a client. On this point we have most certainly learnt our lesson.  Thoughts  So there you are. As I read this back to myself, it occurs to me that just 74 days have passed since the start of MobileGo’s ICO. How different life looked for us here at Incent HQ just 2 and half months ago…  But, d’you know what? Hard as they have been to endure, we are still here. Nothing has been done that cannot be undone, learnt from or improved. I haven’t undergone a change of personality or conviction. I’m still driven to deliver Incent’s core mission and despite everything, my team still has more resources and talent in place to achieve that now than we did last December. Viewing things from this perspective helps me to appreciate that the sky really isn’t going to fall in and that, in fact, we’ve only just begun.  Yours Aye,  Rob W.",False

I mean I already see ICONOMI reach $5 and their current total available supply is 87 million tokens.  INCNT in the other hand has the advantage of being, at the moment, 23 million meaning that under INCNT a price increase should be much easier and if INCNT were to tie the marketcap of ICONOMI the price of each INCNT would be $18.981 (87 / 23 = 3.782608 x $5) each which would be not bad.  Whats the likelihood for INCENT one day to have a marketcap in the same level as ICONOMI's today's market cap?  Another advantage INCNT has is that its already listed under Bittrex, a joy ICN currently doesn't enjoy.

But it's yet unclear when he will actually start. Here's the passage from the March Update:   Quote Commercial Operations Client#1 The question that everyone has wanted to know the answer to: ‘who will be merchant Client#1?!’. So forgive me for keeping you waiting but I am very pleased to formally announce that Client#1 will be a Chinese employee incentive company called Jufenbao. We consider Jufenbao an ideal fit for Incent as they are super keen to move their client’s employee reward tokens on-blockchain, they are a well established entity in a huge market and they have local representation in Sydney, which enables us to work through the specifics of a bespoke solution quickly and easily. And clearly, it isn’t lost on us that the value our product will bring to their existing user base has the potential to deliver meaningful and sustained demand for Incent. I hope you are thrilled — we certainly are. Further Opportunities Knocking Aside Jufenbao, we are in dialogue with two further commercial prospects worth mentioning. The first is an Australian employee incentivisation company who are exploring the benefits of doing exactly as Jufenbao are doing and the second is a very well established and successful US marketing entity who having recent sold their merchant gift card business, have bought the Puntos.com (‘Points’ in Spanish) domain name, with the aim of selling blockchain rewards into the Spanish speaking world, starting with Mexico (…!). This is all pretty heady stuff and you can probably detect a theme emerging but I want to be clear that both discussions are at an early stage. Hopefully I will be in a position to provide more clarity next month. In the meantime, we are hugely encouraged that both of these prospects sought us out unbidden.

I suppose that would involve storing more on local database. The huge strength of the approach Incent has taken is that it's extremely secure: the blockchain is the ledger of balances, and deposits are not recorded centrally (I always wonder how many regular ICOs ended up with databases that were tampered with, or where the issuers just created a bunch of extra tokens at will). That does mean you have to be able to query the blockchain to get the data you need, though, which has resulted in these display bugs - and recently, there have been more issues with that than there would ever normally be.

Please, help us spread the word and share it on Twitter: https://twitter.com/KarlKarlsson_/status/871338736860180480  Incent update: May 2017  4 June 2017  G’day Cent’urions!  Without wishing to overstate it, this last month has been a watershed: a month where Incent moved from a project in-build to a commercial entity. And as we emerge from this period of intense operations it is cathartic for me (and hopefully of interest to you…!) to reflect on what has been learned and achieved along the way.  ICO Mania  At the beginning of 2017, when I first mooted our intention to roll Incent out to market on the back of the deposit technology we had built to execute our own crowdfund, some of you expressed concerns that it represented a departure from our core mission — from the project you had backed. My hope is that the last month has assuaged those concerns and provided some measure of proof that we were right to pursue this course of action.    As many of you will know ICOTech enabled two token crowd-sales in May, both of which exceeded expectations, raising a shade under $60 million between them. Consider for a moment this figure (which in volume terms is equal to the monthly revenue of a major global retail operation) and you will appreciate that from a standing start this has presented our infrastructure and technical team with the sternest of tests, particularly noting that both Waves and ERC20 tokens were accommodated for the first time.  So while both projects presented significant and differing technical challenges, I am satisfied with the way these challenges were negotiated, note that both have provided us with the technical feedback to take this product to the next level and — in the meantime—am pleased with the impact these activities have had on market demand for Incent.  As these operations wind down, we are taking care to capture and roll lessons identified into an application development plan which has, as its target, the realisation of our core product. What I mean to say by this is that I want us to get to a point where every time someone invests in a project through ICOTech, they are instantly on-boarded to the Incent mobile application, where they receive their Incent reward and can do something with it.  In the meantime we’ll continue to work with our infrastructure partners to render the platform and its various interfaces as robust as possible, to optimise both User and Client operator experiences. And believe me when I say that this is an investment well worth making because while I do not know how long it will last, the ICO market is booming and every exposure to it spreads awareness of Incent (over 10,000 new holders in May), demand for Incent, the means and imperative to improve our core infrastructure, a vehicle against which to role out our consumer wallet application and the profit potential to invest in our team.  So it’s all good…  We’re Growing  While prototype development during Q1 allowed us to run lean on in-house technical horsepower, this always had a half-life and last month our plans to augment our in-house technical horsepower came to fruition. I am pleased to announce that our Ethereum guru, Bok Khoo, has been joined by a Waves specialist in the form of Sergey Ischenko, direct from the core Waves team in Moscow. Further, we are joined by Nadia Begicheva (UX) and Matthew Geale (full stack), bringing our core technical team to 5.    Last but by no means least, Jins Kadouthodil has joined us in a consultancy role that both of us hope will grow into that of Incent’s Chief of Operations. Jins and I go back a bit professionally, having worked together on another project in 2013.    An IT specialist by education and top-flight management consultant by training and experience, Jins has been immersed in the local start-up scene for the last two years. I think he’s absolutely ideal for Incent. He’s already making a huge impact as we commercialise and I look forward to announcing his permanent tenure in the months to come.  What about Everything Else?  Basically, we continue to march forward on all fronts. With respect to core development:  ICOTech is already the subject of focussed optimisation aimed at improving reliability, UX and autonomy. Blockswap will soon feel the love following the winding down of our recent ICO operations and will either be open-sourced or offered to interested parties under licence thereafter. Jade Shyu is into the guts of App UX design work and we’re lining up the specialist development talent locally to integrate her output. We’re conceptualising a redesign of our website to pull everything together under ‘one roof’.  With respect to Business Development, we are still pursuing relationships locally and the game changing opportunities that I spoke of last month, States-side. And on the organisational front, Jins is pulling together the various commercial, accountancy and compliance threads.  So what are your priorities?  Personally speaking I have two. Firstly, I want to take what we have learned from the last month and leverage it to develop the best ICO deposit technology on the market, then use that to entice the best projects into the Waves ecosphere. And I want us to continue to build awareness of and demand for Incent on the back of this effort. My rationale for this is straightforward; this is where the market is exploding, this is where we can provide the most support for Incent demand right now and this is the perfect high-tempo technical environment in which our core product will have to operate, and ought therefore to be developed and stress tested.  Secondly, I want us to continue to build a consumer wallet application so capable and intuitive that the benefits of partnering on our core loyalty product are obvious and explicit. The key here is an end-to-end solution that requires zero crypto knowledge to use, while offering mainstream consumers access to this exciting economy — and all its benefits. It’s not the work of a moment but I am confident that with the core infrastructure in place and the right talent engaged, we are lining things up to deliver a game-changing product, and I am excited to see the impact that this is going to have on demand for Incent, once we are in a position to release it into the wild.

Yes, you can send it to the Waves address of your wallet. All tokens are stored in that address.  You'll need some Waves to transfer Incent out of the Waves wallet again. You can get some free Waves from this faucet: https://wavesdrop.com/ Thx. Is anywhere a list, which coin/token I can keep in my Waves Wallet?  How do you mean? The Waves wallet supports Waves assets. You can also store BTC and fiat currencies there (coming very soon), via gateway services which hold your BTC/USD etc and send you proxy tokens on Waves. You can then trade against those on DEX and withdraw them back through the gateways. Okay, is there anywhere a list with all the Waves assets? Does that mean, I can transfer my BTC from Electrum wallet to my waves wallet and then to an exchange?  No, if you store BTC on Waves then it's as a Waves asset (WBTC). An exchange will want real BTC. You can move the WBTC out to an exchange via the Waves BTC gateway, if you want. Okay. And the BTC gateway will be included in the lite client and the process (changing WBTC to BTC) will be automatically? The BTC gateway is already live within the Waves Lite Client and the process is automated. You deposit Bitcoin and receive the wBTC asset within a few minutes. If you withdraw, you return the wBTC asset and receive real Bitcoin to your Bitcoin address.",False

The big news is upcoming, but here is a little sneak peek...  ""Laughing Poppers"" the world's largest balloon and clown fetish porn site is rumored to be on board as offering INCT to all their loyal customers in the upcoming weeks. Part of Rob's recent traveling was to attend their annual ""Hilarious Helium"" party. There he was busy finding various end-to-end solutions for them. I can't go into specifics on this yet but let's just say that he also gave them some front-end, back-end, upside down, and oiled solutions as well... They all got along very well and this trip is unlikely to be his last. Frankly, partnership here would change the game. Honk! Honk!  You're probably thinking that such a meeting took away from the core focus of INCNT. Don't be daft. One of the key connections he made was with the clown Bam Bam Boinks A Lot. He has been pursuing Ms. Boinks A Lot and her little clown car for awhile now.  I'm sure he'd be pleased to report and share some pictures from her first consensual submission.  Yet again, it's shaping up to be another crackin' month down under as the team continues to weave all the various threads into a good looking pair of crypto skinny jeans that any hipster would be proud to wear.

Every responsible project should audit their ICO, it's best practice. We did the same with our own ICO and will continue to do that with each and every ICO yet to come. Don't forget - once distribution is done, any error which might have occurred can't be reversed. If a project chooses not to do an audit, so be it. Personally, I wouldn't feel comfortable as an investor in that case.  The typo was our fault which resulted from a code merge.  It's important for you to know that the master ledger of our ICO technology is the blockchain of each currency. If a node forks/corrupts, it can't return the necessary data. This resulted in display issues which is the very first lesson we got from the ICO - we want to read the data from the blockchain but without affecting users. We'll implement a mechanism that addresses/balances/deposits don't appear in case a node doesn't respond. Generally, we aim to make the technology slicker and way more robust as it is now.  I can't really go into detail regarding the last question. We're already working on improving the application and have some ICOs in the pipeline. It will be announced in time.",False

So it’s been another big month, right?! Listing on Bittrex has changed things rather, just like many of you advised me it would, facilitating a nice run up in price to just over 20 US cents on the eve of the ICO activities we are supporting.  Anyway, they say one should never start with an apology but I am going to make two. Firstly, I want to apologise for the delay in releasing this sitrep and secondly, for its brevity.  Apology #1  So as some of you know last weekend I was, at short notice, invited out to the USA to work with some senior executives of a multinational financial services corporation.  “Why would a multinational be interested in Incent?” I hear you ask. Well, it’s simple really: they like that we are commerce-focused and that we’re building an end-to-end solution that doesn’t require mainstream consumers to know what a Genesis block is ;-)  So you will appreciate that this was an opportunity deserving of my full and undivided attention (so the newsletter got postponed). And you will also appreciate that it is far too early for me to be any more specific than I have been here…  …but what I can say is that we all got along very well, that this trip is unlikely to be my last and that we are all cautiously excited this end — because frankly, partnership here would change the game. Anyway, this was the view from my Adirondack as we finally wound-down, prior our return flight to Sydney; I was tired but happy…    Apology #2  …And the reason I’m going to keep this brief is because we are busy — crazy busy in fact — supporting 2 ICOs concurrently with ICOTech: EncryptoTel and MobileGo. Neither of these activities have been without issue and in MobileGo’s case we have, corporately, encountered significant technical challenges but we are proud that our tech has facilitated the flow of nearly $15 million into these projects, simultaneously, in just 2 weeks. And MobileGo in particular is unparalleled in the sophistication of its deposit (native deposits across 4 blockchains) and pricing models.  Why have we put ourselves under this pressure? Simple really: if we are to succeed commercially our technical solutions must be sufficiently robust to work seamlessly and securely, at scale. What better way to expose them to these demands than the cauldron of pressure that is an ICO?! In addition to which, facilitating these events rapidly increases ownership of and exposure to Incent and WAVES; MobileGo has attracted 5,000 unique investors already and is likely to complete one of the largest-grossing ICO raises of all time. All these investors will become members of the Waves and Incent communities. And finally, baking Incent into the deposit technology, as a reward for investment, allows us to support arket demand for our token — which we know you all care about deeply ;-)  Finally, I would close this point by saying that interest in ICOTech is currently ‘off the hook’, allowing us to select projects that we feel have a strong chance of success and will be of benefit to the ecosystem and holders of WAVES and Incent.  So What About Core Development?!  You’re probably thinking that with everything else going on, this has stalled. Don’t be daft. One of the key connections I cemented while in the US was Ms Jade Shyu, who some of you may know of as the UX design lead of the winning project at last year’s Money 20/20 hackathon. I have been pursuing Jade for some time now, to lead on the UX/UI of our consumer App (and if you spare the time to look at her site you will see why) and I am pleased to report that as a result of our meeting and her first conceptual submissions since, it looks like we will be doing business.    It is, of course, very early days but bearing in mind that our mobile app needs to present its end-to-end functionality to mainstream consumers, I think Jade is already on the right lines and has a huge amount to offer the project. More generally, we are getting more and more excited about the sweep of the App’s intended functionality and our conceptual focus at the moment is the incorporation of seamless off-ramps, in order to optimise the utility of Incent to consumers.  The other big news in the dev area is that we are working closer and closer with Bok Khoo, the by-now legendary Ethereum developer responsible for the first Ethereum Decentralized Exchange. Bok helped us conceptualise and code Blockswap , the first-of-its-kind application that allows a token to exist simultaneously on the Waves and Ethereum blockchains. Bok has become more and more central to our market infrastructure build and has recently moved into our Sydney HQ to work alongside us moving forward. When combined with Peter’s burgeoning Waves expertise, this gives Incent significant technical horsepower across these critical infrastructures.  Commercial Development  More of the same this last month as we move closer to pilot programs with both the Australian Employee Incentive company and the Puntos team. We’re also working with local loyalty consultant, Philip Shelper of Loyalty Reward Co, whose team are helping us to finesse our offering to Tier Two commerce and Loyalty Providers. On the crypto-infrastructure front, we are working with Sam Lee of the Australian Crypto Exchange to get Incent listed against the AUD and we are also in dialogue with Wavecrest on the subject of an Incent branded (and app embedded) visa debit card, which like Xapo would allow holders of Incent to transact with unpartnered merchants online (think Amazon…) and over the counter.  Boom!  So as you can see, it’s been another cracking month and as we continue to pull on the various threads we are taking great satisfaction in breathing life into a concept that many of you reading have, through your material support, given us the opportunity to do. We won’t ever forget this and we have no intention of letting you down.  On! On!

The decision to give a 24-hour grace period was good: with BTC and WAVES so volatile, just the rise in the markets would have triggered the end of the crowdsale, only to have the risk of the total dropping back to $2.7 million or so not long afterwards. No one could know that a massive whale would come in like that. Frankly it's a difficult situation to negotiate. If the whale had come in at $2.99m, then that last $1m would have to have been accepted anyway. So far the team has proven highly professional and competent. And this was an unintended consequence of doing the right thing. So it's worth being more constructive about any criticism.  I'm an Incent shareholder too, not particularly big anymore, wondering what other Incent shareholders think about ICO's changing such critical terms significantly at the last minute & Incent coming out in support of that behaviour?

Effectively, you have to trust Incent not to dump this on the market. If we did so, it would naturally kill our business, so we won't. Whilst that probably won't reassure some people, you have to bear in mind that trust to some degree is inherent in any business like this. It's centralised, it has a dev team and offices, and a CEO. So you're already trusting us to do a good job if you've invested. All Incent used for ICO payments (I think a total of 10-12%) for team and other collaborators came from the other half of the initial supply.

One is that there was a relationship there already, and so we had access to the dev team - which is a pretty big deal. Another is the DEX, with real-time trading and asset-to-asset trading. Both of these help with settlement. Also paying tx fees in the token itself, rather than a separate coin, is a big deal, because it vastly reduces friction for users and makes life a lot easier when developing the app. We kicked around a lot of ideas and a lot of tech solutions for Incent over the previous 2 years, and these were quite big problems to overcome.",False

Quite apart from their utility and business plans, some trade more against BTC than fiat - and obviously, the more thinly traded a currency, the bigger the fluctuations.

Meaning that when Waves DOES get big, which it will, the ability to trade between Waves<>ETH block-chains is Incent's  Incent has held up fairly well considering BTC is at an all time high. BTC rises like this used to decimate alt coins in 2016.  The team is a serious team. They are available all the time in their Slack (can't say that with many post ICO coins/tokens) and the CEO is jetting around the world as we speak getting more business.  The businesses that got paid in Incent bonuses have already dumped. Anyone dumping now is doing so at a real $ loss.  The first retailer is about to come on board. Retailers as I understand it will need to buy Incent to use the Incent program.. So there should theoretically be constant buy pressure at some point.  That's why I decided that this is the price either to buy what you want for the future or slowly accumulate.  I invested today.   The only thing that I would ask of the team is to sit down and have a real serious conversation amongst yourselves about balancing your responsibilities towards your clients with those of your investors.

There's certainly a lot going on at the moment, and we hope to have a more extensive update for the community in due course. Re: the comment about Incent being sold to businesses - I'm not sure I understand what you mean? Merchants will not handle Incent. When a customer buys something, a proportion of the purchase amount (configurable - could be 0.5-20%) will be used to buy Incent off the open market. That is sent directly to the customer.

This is why we need a reserve, because obviously there are delays in dealing with exchanges - we wouldn't want to withdraw directly from an exchange to the customer's wallet. It was important to us that the merchant didn't have to deal in Incent. That's a barrier to adoption and we didn't want to impose that on them.

Re: locking Incent for partners - as I said, that's problematic. I guess we could have done for the team, though (unsurprisingly) no one from the team has sold.

At some point the circle will complete itself and those that wanted to dump have dumped and those that want to buy have bought.

Unless there is a hack of a holders wallet or some other material event, dumps should become less over time and as adoption grows holders will become more distributed and at some point the resistance level will be broken where it becomes difficult for one holder to dump the price in a material way.

The headline figures you give are a little misleading, because BTC was much lower in October/November, when we crowdfunded. So I think the fiat price of tokens was around $0.06 for most people (there were discounts for larger, earlier investors). As often happens with alts, when BTC started rising Incent dropped in BTC terms, staying roughly even in fiat. Then when BTC's rise slowed and we got closer to deployment with the ICOs, Incent rose in BTC terms. So net: yes, Incent is up perhaps 250% in fiat terms, up a little in BTC terms right now.",False

The launch of both platforms has presented specific challenges for a plethora of reasons. Notwithstanding, cooperation between ourselves and client teams has been strong and through working together we are knocking down the issues rapidly. As it stands we are confident that the back of this work will be broken and the backlog of Incent market purchases cleared within hours.",False

Was thinking today about Incent. I have a question.  When Incent takes BTC and ETH from a client like mobileGo, they buy Incent with it at market. So what markets are they buying from and how is that decision determined ?  https://coinmarketcap.com/assets/incent/#markets  So I am sure that the client wants the lowest price for his Incent purchase, why would they not.     So the answer might be that Incent purchases the coin at the lowest possible price for the client, as to offset any additional costs and pass on maximum savings to thier client.  We the investors want the highest price for the Incent.     So the answer might that Incent purchases at the highest market price we can in order to boost ROI for our investors.  Now with a stock the first responsibility is to the shareholders. What is Incent's official position ?  If it's a mix of the two, how is that accomplished specifically.",False

This time around, for reasons explained, we need to bundle up a few payments and submit them together.

No, they buys haven't been made yet   Not quite. Basically every time a deposit comes in we take 0.5% of it and purchase Incent from the secondary market. Whatever amount of Incent we get for that is credited to the investor. This happens in real-time (within a few minutes after the deposit) and investors are able to withdraw their Incent right away.",False

He can give you details on that, but I think it'll be pretty fast.  But I don't know why this would effect the GAME team. 90% of MobileGo investors will not have heard of Incent. They will see they have bonus Incent tokens in the ICO panel. Only a small % of people will be focused on this. I see this entire set up doing two things for Incent - 1) providing some buy pressure and maybe some price pressure (we'll see) and 2) introducing a few thousand more people to Incent. These people will then take various periods of time to learn about what these bonus tokens were. Some will dump Im sure. Some will probably forget about them. And some will probably become part of the Incent community.  The MORE the Incent community supports and helps the MobileGo project, the more likely people investing in the MobileGo project will want to learn more about Incent.

Clearly that early investment boost was crucial to meeting the target of their crowdsale, at a time when the Waves token ICO was a concept that still needed proving.   I think it might have been only 1 or 2 of those individuals who actually decided to sell that Incent on the exchange for profit.  There is nothing that could prevent that.   Given that they paid less for their Incent than anyone who bought during the ICO.   It was most noticeable when OpenLedger was the only exchange available.   Then you had a secondary sell off from people that bought those cheap Incent, then wanted to sell for profit given that Incent has risen in value since they bought it a couple months ago from the pre-ICO whale.

March has been a huge month for us here in Sydney and I’m really excited to bring you all up to speed.  Technical Development  Core Build  To review our core product build, I am pleased to report that we are exactly where we hoped to be at this point. The (IONIC) consumer wallet app is complete to MVP, Crypto Integration is complete to MVP, the API is complete to MVP and both Merchant Integration and Operations Management are in-build as we work with Client #1.    From here, Client #1 decisions will, to an extent, drive time-scale to ‘go-live’ in all areas, including a localised UX for the App, but we have been working in close co-operation for the last 2 weeks and progress has been pleasing.  Blockswap  BlockSwap has been live in beta for the last 3 weeks, with Riptobux, WCT, Waves(BTC) and Incent ‘live and swapping’ with no issues. Golem Network Token and Waves are next up. Further, and enabled by BlockSwap, Incent is now listed and tradeable on Bok Koo’s Crypto Derivatives DEX. More on this later.  ICOTech  ICOTech has been the subject of focussed back-end development in preparation for MobileGo’s forthcoming ICO (opening 25 April). We’ve tightened the code base significantly, enabled deposits in Ether and Game Credits and, following ICO completion, user triggered withdrawals from their deposit dashboard.  The Development Path from Here  As I have already alluded, to a large extent, technical development from here will be driven by commercial activity — meaning that we need to remain flexible to the needs of our clients and always responsive to the commercial opportunity. Notwithstanding, some of you have been asking questions about our intentions regarding the consumer mobile app; namely, ‘will an Incent App be available for anyone to download from Apple or Google?’. While I’m not ready to put a time-scale on this, with the MVP built we are actively exploring the means to allow app users to buy Incent, lock value in local currency, and search / buy products from vendors with whom we have no commercial relationship. Once these modifications were in place and a slick UX applied, we would have a mobile product ready for release. We are excited by this vision and once we have identified a solid commercial benefit for doing so (or a client who wants this functionality enough to pay for us to develop it) we will pull the lever. Watch this space.  Commercial Operations  Client#1  The question that everyone has wanted to know the answer to: ‘who will be merchant Client#1?!’. So forgive me for keeping you waiting but I am very pleased to formally announce that Client#1 will be a Chinese employee incentive company called Jufenbao. We consider Jufenbao an ideal fit for Incent as they are super keen to move their client’s employee reward tokens on-blockchain, they are a well established entity in a huge market and they have local representation in Sydney, which enables us to work through the specifics of a bespoke solution quickly and easily. And clearly, it isn’t lost on us that the value our product will bring to their existing user base has the potential to deliver meaningful and sustained demand for Incent. I hope you are thrilled — we certainly are.  Further Opportunities Knocking  Aside Jufenbao, we are in dialogue with two further commercial prospects worth mentioning. The first is an Australian employee incentivisation company who are exploring the benefits of doing exactly as Jufenbao are doing and the second is a very well established and successful US marketing entity who having recent sold their merchant gift card business, have bought the Puntos.com (‘Points’ in Spanish) domain name, with the aim of selling blockchain rewards into the Spanish speaking world, starting with Mexico (…!). This is all pretty heady stuff and you can probably detect a theme emerging but I want to be clear that both discussions are at an early stage. Hopefully I will be in a position to provide more clarity next month. In the meantime, we are hugely encouraged that both of these prospects sought us out unbidden. This is — we believe — the potential power of our value proposition.  MobileGo  The attraction of drawing bluechip projects onto the Waves blockchain was a key motivation for us when we made the decision, back in December, to iterate on our own deposit technology and pitch it to market as a complimentary side project. As I’ve already mentioned, our partnership with the MobileGo team has both stimulated and financed significant technical development of strategic value to our core business. And in the meantime, their funding activity, due to kick-off 25 April, promises to be a belter - that will provide a most welcome and early stimulus to demand for Incent, given that all MobileGo token purchasers will be rewarded with a bonus amount of Incent, which we will source from the market on their behalf.  If you haven’t taken a look at MobileGo’s literature yet you really should. Unlike Incent, which I would characterise as an early stage, longer-term proposition, albeit with stratospheric upside if we get it right, the Game team are a strong and established team, with a mature product and partnerships, seeking marketing funds to pitch their unique solution to a market and demographic ideally suited to crypto-adoption. Further, their value proposition is highly credible with significant, quantifiable, short time-scale returns. Our unique position as a development partner has presented us with a unique insight as to the interest that their ICO is attracting and we are not at all surprised that significant institutional money is interested. This is, without question, going to be big. I’m proud that they trust my team to deliver their ICO technically and thrilled that Incent holders will be direct beneficiaries of their inevitable success, whether they decide to get involved or not.  ICOTech  Interest in ICOTech is growing with enquiries growing at the rate of several a week. In the wake of an unpleasant experience at the hands of our first ICOTech client, we had been somewhat reticent of moving forward with any but MobileGo, as we wanted first to understand what (if anything) we needed to improve internally and whether, having done so, the commercial sense of continuing with it still made sense. On the one hand, we see tremendous strategic value for both ourselves and Waves of encouraging projects onto the Waves Blockchain. On the other, doing so has to pay its way without distracting us from the main effort.  While our reflections on this front are incomplete, we have hired additional horsepower to ensure the management of MobileGo’s ICO is super-slick and we have re-opened dialogue with enquirers, so there may be some more Incent enabled ICOs down the pipe, all of which will help to support demand for Incent.  BlockSwap  As you may remember, our primary motivation for developing BlockSwap was to provide ourselves with an alternative means to settle core client trades in and out of Incent, in the case that Waves was, for whatever reason, unavailable. However, crypto-community interest is again suggesting wider commercial utility, both in its current form and as something to extend upon. Already, BlockSwap allows Waves assets to be traded on an Ethereum DEX and the arrival of Waves DEX will allow Ethereum assets to be traded on the Waves blockchain. For all you clever people the potential arbitrage potential will be obvious and with BlockSwap standing between the two (and potentially more than just two) we recognise the potential of owning the gate that all must pass through — and the impact this might have for demand for Incent were we to charge even a little for each swap.  I know that some of you doubted the wisdom of our allocating resource to this endeavour but I hope you can now see that beyond the essential redundancy we sought, BlockSwap links and resonates with both ICOTech and the emergence of DEXs, all of which support our core mission and demand for Incent.  Market Operations  Over the last month we’ve made some big strides in this area too, recently listing on LiveCoin and Crypto Derivatives, to bring the total to six exchanges, with Waves DEX to follow within the next week. Aside this we have conceptualised, built and tested our market-making bot, with an intention to deploy within the next 14 days. Let me tell you a little about it here.  GuyBot 9000  When many consider bots and algos, they envision tools that allow their operators to trade a market for profit. This is not our objective. What our core business requires is the means to discover price as efficiently as possible and execute trades with the minimum slippage, on behalf of our clients. If Mrs Smith suffers a 30% price slip every time she tries to spend her Incent we are dead in the water.  With this in mind, the GuyBot 9000 will be an active counter-trend presence in every market in which it is deployed. It is designed to attenuate volatility and minimise slippage. And its only variable is the trade size we elect to set in the pursuit of this objective.  We elected to test GuyBot 9000 on Crypto Derivatives because Bok Khoo, who coded that DEX, has become a close collaborator who works alongside us regularly. Once Waves’ DEX is live, next week we understand, the intention will be to code and deploy GuyBot 9000 here first — and probably on Crypto Derivatives too. Following confirmation that it achieves what we want it to, the longer term aim will be to deploy it on ‘n’ centralised exchanges, coordinated by an application within our order engine that can compare prices across this market and drive client orders to the best price, with sufficient market depth to achieve fills with the minimum slippage.  It may seem odd that we are preparing to step in and settle our own trades but this, as you will remember, was the whole point of retaining a reserve of Incent and building one of Waves. Since we will be trading one for the other our net position will be straightforward to monitor and we’ll adjust GuyBot 9000’s trade sizes as required. And it’s our expectation, and hope, that active traders find and deploy ways to trade against GuyBot 9000, as it all adds to market liquidity and depth, to the benefit of our core business.  I hope this makes sense!  Bittrex and American Exchanges  Okay, so the clarion calls for Bittrex listing have been growing steadily louder and we are listening, we’re in dialogue and pending the finalisation of some business emanating from our ICO, I am prepared to pay for them to list us, based on their volume, the quality of their service and what I understand of their ambitious development path.  However, doing so, with Bittrex or indeed any US domiciled requires that we can be considered absolutely compliant within their jurisdiction — and this requires that we ditch completely our original aspiration to pay a dividend to Incent holders as a proportion of any profits derived from market-making. In the interim we have laboured to conjure alternatives to deliver on this commitment in spirit but to his credit, Bittrex Bill’s position has never wavered. Any mention of a dividend makes Incent smell too much like an equity for him to take the risk of listing us.  Therefore, since our market making activity is not designed to generate revenue, you all want us to list with the bigger exchanges and the exposure upsides are so obvious, it makes no sense to continue digging our heels in on an issue that was unlikely to have provided any material benefit to our community anyway. So, to be crystal clear, market-making dividends are dead as a concept.  Compliance and Structure  So this has been a long update and I can imagine eyes starting glaze over as you read this this sub-heading. But they shouldn’t because if we fuck this up the men in suits arrive and the value of your Incent goes rapidly south. Okay, so Mary, our Compliance officer has spent the last month studying the licensing and taxation landscape in Australia and I am bound to say that where both are concerned the treatment of crypto-currencies and crypto business remains somewhat opaque. While many in the sector regard this as an opportunity (…!) we are beginning to form the view that separating development (onshore) from operations (as a distinct and separate offshore entity) would be the more prudent and effective course of action. This would allow the onshore entity to benefit from Australia’s generous R&D rebate and the offshore entity to execute the exchange function as efficiently and effectively as possible, without falling foul of ASIC or the ATO.  I won’t make any final decisions just yet but this is our thinking as I write.  Nearly There!  So you can’t say that I didn’t tell you this would be huge upfront! If you’ve read this far I hope it has given you confidence that our foot remains flat to the floor, that we are making solid progress in all areas, that we are taking the right decisions and that the commercial case for our product(s) is continuing to build. Thankyou for your continued support and interest, which is invigorating and heartening for us as we continue to drive forward.  On! On!

Moving operations offshore from AUS seems a very smart move.  This always worried me that you were going to operate in AUS to be honest.

I'm considering strengthening my position, but I need some additional questions answered first.  1. My wife misplaces her keychain very frequently. Thankfully she has 16 plastic loyalty cards hanging on it of various sizes, shapes and colors. It is a rainbow ball of plastic roughly the size of a grapefruit. This usually makes it very easy to locate. If INCNT is widely adopted then she may be reduced to her house and car keys which are of significantly smaller profile. This is much harder to locate when it's still dark and you're rushing to get your shit together and get to work on time. I don't want to be woken up at 0600 to help turn over couch cushions and search through the laundry so she won't be late. I work varying shift times and get very grumpy when disturbed when I finally do get to sleep. Will the return on additional money I invest be enough to pay for the needed marriage counseling?  2. As Aussies you should realize how big the beef/leather industry is in your country and how powerful their unions and lobbies are. Less loyalty cards to carry means smaller wallets and less leather needed to make them. I hear the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association is notoriously ruthless. I have small children.

It's natural that we took a beating in BTC terms considering Bitcoin increased by 100% since our ICO concluded. I would even go that far and say that we have been one of the most professional ICOs ever and we will continue to keep honoring this exact value.

The reality is that if BTC had dropped, alts including Incent would probably be more valuable.

If they'd sold on Cryptopia they could have got 3x more, so I assume it was just an impatient bounty dumper. I can agree that 3xxx is frustrating if you bought at ICO (which I also did) but that is the nature of the crypto markets. Equally, though, I'd like to give the Sydney team credit for the work they're doing. They are on schedule for release at the time given 6 months ago when we first put out word about the ICO. That is incredibly rare when you consider the delays routinely incurred on other crypto projects. So I won't accept any criticism that we're not doing what we said we would do, based solely on a market that is notoriously fickle.

For those of you who don't know me, I'm Michael Wagner, founder of the Tokes Platform. I would have preferred for Rob and I to navigate this conversation privately, but as the Incent team has announced a 'discontinuation of support' for our ICO distribution, I'm compelled to provide a response.  For some background, the terms of our MOA included a 5BTC deposit up front, 5BTC closing payment, and 2% of total funds raised as a share of revenue. In return, we were to receive a functional investment management backend portal along with a component of technical support for our users. We made payments on the initial deposit, as well as an interim payment based on funds raised (~1.8BTC). If you were a participant in our ICO, you can attest to the fact that the execution of distribution of tokes proceeds left a lot to be desired, and in fact was never officially completed. Our ICO closed on January 15th, and our investors are still waiting on distributions to be processed by their team.   For additional context, this is the email message I sent to Rob and Peter following our call earlier in the evening. Please note that this went out at 8:05PM PST, and the 'discontinuation of support' post was released in the early hours of the morning, without having any additional communication with me.     While I made an appeal to them regarding the payment amount to them proportional to funds raised, this is not about us 'not raising enough money'. This is about inadequate execution of their side of the agreement.   An earlier attempt to communicate with Incent at the beginning of February:   From: Michael Wagner [mailto:michael@tokesplatform.org] Sent: Monday, February 6, 2017 12:23 PM To: 'Peter Godbolt' <peter@bitscan.co>; 'Rob Wilson' <rob@bitscan.co> Cc: gabriel@tokesplatform.org; jon@tokesplatform.org Subject: ICO and Bounty Distributions  Gentleman,  Hope all finds you well following the weekend. As we near completion on the Tokes ICO, I just wanted to follow up on a few final details…  1.   Jon has completed the reconciliation for bounty distributions and prepared a spreadsheet with waves wallet addresses and their respective payouts, which I’ve attached. Please let me know if you still plan on adding these payouts to the remaining distributions or if we should process manually.  2.   Remaining investor distributions…not surprisingly, a few members of the community are getting a bit restless about receiving their tokes. I understand that you’re being methodical with the distro, but just wanted to get an idea of when all members with withdrawal addresses will receive their full payouts?  3.   Tokes Reserve Address: given that the majority of ICO payments have gone out, you should be able to process the tokes reserve distribution. You can retain some units as necessary to ensure complete distro, but ~95% of the reserve can be sent to: 3P5WW7ebPaZF5NXDm1ZZYmrbgFm784tsRPw  4.   Per my communications with Fran, we’ve released escrow including the 2% payment due to Incent. I can pull transaction details if needed, but you should have received that payment late last week.  5.   Incent bonus: several members have inquired about the 1% incent bonus to be paid to ICO investors. I assume those will be going out along with the final tokes distributions, or should we be preparing for a different scenario?  6.   Customer testament: I’m sure you’re eager to further promote the ICO technology. Per our earlier conversation, I’m happy to write up a customer statement for you, pending completion on the remaining items above.   I think that just about covers everything from our end. Looking forward to getting everything wrapped up from an ICO perspective, and potentially continuing the conversation regarding POS development. I’ve loosely discussed this with Peter, but we might have an opportunity to jointly develop a mobile app and point-of-sale system, as our projects have some overlapping interest in that technology. In any case, look forward to hearing back.  Best, Michael   In essence, we paid for a product we thought was robust and complete from individuals we felt were professional. What we received was complete garbage. It would be irresponsible from both a company perspective, and in considering the impact on our investors, for me to relegate additional funds from our operating capital to pay a non-performing contract. I would caution anyone considering the use of Incent ICO technology to strongly reconsider the other options currently available in the ecosystem. If the Tokes team did anything wrong, it was engaging with Incent on this feature.   Given the fact that we are terminating our relationship with Incent, I don't feel that the Incent ANN thread is the most appropriate channel to continue this conversation. If you were a Tokes investor, or have interest in our project, I encourage you to join us in slack (you can register at: https://tokes-slack.herokuapp.com/ and join us at http://tokesplatform.slack.com).   For those who invested in Tokes Platform, know that we will be making you whole through the issuance of a new asset on Waves, with the name Tokes, but under a new asset ID. Any exchange listings will be based on that new asset ID. The members in our slack channel have requested that the initial 1% Incent bonus that was offered be replaced with a 1% Tokes bonus, which we will honor. Feel free to reach me direct at michael@tokesplatform.org. Bear in mind that we might be inundated with emails initially, so please bear with me on response time. I'll begin processing the replacement asset today.",False

The inference being that we should share the impact of an aspect of your ICO for which we had no responsibility.  Settlement in Tokes is not acceptable to me because it is not what we agreed in our MOA - since which we have enabled your ICO with IP, server and technical support, to the best of our ability, over an extended period, in the best of faith.  Since you are not, after the fact, prepared to settle on what we agreed, I am not happy to continue to expend our finite resources in supporting you. This should not surprise you.  Notwithstanding, if I understand your post correctly, you now intend to re-issue the Tokes asset from scratch. This strikes me as nuts and doing so will distract your team and burn your community.

Let me get the facts straight:  We are a startup. As for any other startup, money doesn't grow on trees. We are trying to spend our working capital as efficiently and effectively as possible for the sake of Incent and, inevitably, its price in the long-term. We are hard at work to release the core application and on-board the first merchant. We expect this to happen during April. After having achieved this milestone, the money situation will be slightly different: There will be a revenue stream through commissions and our goal must be to write black figures as soon as possible, meaning to generate more revenue than expenses.

Besides, the community clamoured for Incent to be added to exchanges. Read back through the post history if you're in any doubt. If you're upset that the market has treated Incent unfavourably when we're pre-launch (no merchant demand) and bitcoin is spiking, that is unfortunate but beyond our control.

We are spending money where we need to: on developing the app/tech, on business development, on compliance - basically on all the things we need to make sure happen to launch a viable product that operates within the current regulatory structure. What we cannot afford to do is spend funds where we do not need to. Everything at this point goes behind launching a successful consumer app. Everything else comes from that. Get it wrong and we're dead in the water before we start. Get it right and the sky is the limit.  You're right that bitcoin's volatility is a risk assumed by the investor. That is the case with any investment, of course - that the currency in which you invest (i.e. that you sell for the asset purchased) rises in value. If bitcoin had fallen in value, likely Incent would have risen against BTC, as is the case with just about any alt under those circumstances. This is just a given in the crypto economy. It is unavoidable and it affects every ICO and crypto project to some extent.  Bottom line, we're not launched with Merchant 1 yet. We need to be on exchanges ahead of that. The price you see there isn't realistic - it wouldn't be possible to cash out large amounts anyway, as there simply isn't the liquidity. (One of the things we discussed at length in Sydney was our marketmaking strategy, and how we will add depth to the order books. This will allow merchants and traders to buy in/cash out with lower slippage, and will benefit everyone.) We're not at go-live yet, so the sorts of criticisms you're making of us just don't stack up. We're doing what we need to and what we said we would, within the schedule laid out.",False

A lot to cover and therefore quite extensive - well worth a read!    G’day Cent’urions!  So February is a short month but it’s been a busy and productive one for the Incent team,and I wanted to take a moment to bring you all up to date.  Strategy  I want to start by bringing you all right into the tent with respect to our Strategy, as I think it isinteresting in its own right and it will also help to frame the remainder of this update in context. So, here it is in a picture...    The first thing I want you to notice is the circle on the far right, which recognises that growth of Incent’s market capitalisation is our grand strategic objective. Put another way, we fully recognise that if the market capitalisation of Incent (the currency) is growing, we must be getting the supporting components of our business right. Put yet another way, yours and our aims remain completely aligned. So, with this said, working left of this objective, you will note that from our perspective, growing Incent’s market capitalisation requires us to focus on two subordinate activities, commercial and market operations, which are discrete but mutually supporting.  Finally, both require and benefit from a strong organisational infrastructure. This presents us with specific Lines of Effort (LoE), all of which we have been advancing over the last month.  Commercial Operations  Let’s kick off with an update on the Commercial Ops LOE, which right now centres on development of the core commercial product and the crypto-specific technologies that support and augment it.  With respect to our core product, Hawky’s team are a good way through the Consumer Appbuild and Kyle is advancing our Operations Management App, which is the component which will be released and documented on a re-orientated website (due to launch in March), in order that developers can swiftly implement third party integrations.  As I’ve mentioned before the core product will be rolled out to online merchants that operate the Magento platform in the first instance, and we’re about to commence work on this Plugin.  This leaves the Crypto Integration component, which had required us to make a decision on which platform we will be settling through. You’ll be pleased to learn that this decision has now been made and we are forging ahead with the integration engine. More on this later...    In the meantime, we’ve kept our foot down with respect to commercial operations in the crypto-space. I’m hoping that exposure to our strategy underlines the logic of pursuing implementations in the crypto-space as well as mainstream commerce. In our view, any project that can be leveraged to support market demand for Incent makes huge sense - so long as it evolves core development in the process.  This was our rationale for the ICOTechside-project, the next big implementation of which will be the MobileGo ICO, which announced earlier this month.  Your own opinions may differ but we believe that MobileGo has the potential to be a big raise - particularly since we have made it possible for them to pitch to both Waves and Ethereum communities on the promise of a cross-blockchain token.  Delivering on this promise has required us to build some unique IP that we have named BlockSwap, which allows any listed token to be swapped instantly between blockchains, without compromising total supply.  The commercial implications of these developments is significant near term and enduring demand for Incent, which will be baked into both MobileGo’s ICO deposit technology and BlockSwap. More generally, we feel that both ICOTech and Blockswap have the potential to drive more and more interest and activity to Waves and Sasha (CEO Waves) agrees, which is likely to drive a further deepening of our strategic relationship as we move forward.  In the meantime, we have a prototype of BlockSwap live here, where those of you with IncentCoffee tokens can test the technology.  Market Operations  The first stage of this LoE required us to make Incent tradeable and those of you watching closely will know that we put our foot down on exchange integration over the last month, listing on Liqui, Cryptopia and Tidex so far with Livecoin (which has a bigger volume than Bittrex) to follow soon.  So far we have been pleasantly surprised with trading volume on Cryptopia, and the way price is trending, particularly since we are yet to provide any liquidity of our own or stimulate demand through commercial operations.  This will change next month as we roll out our Market Making operation.  And where this is concerned I want to let you know that we have decided to centre our operations on the Tidex exchange. This may seem odd in the light of trading volume to date but there are several reasons supporting this decision, including: the absence of trading fees, Tidex’s strategic proximity to Waves, the prospect of DEX integration and the ability to settle using Waves as a counterparty currency. We also recognise that our market making operations will draw volume onto a platform which is strategically important for Waves.  With respect to the detail, we are developing a trading bot that will lay a configurable lattice over the Incent market, deploying Incent and counterparty currencies to provide market depth and sufficient liquidity to assure settlement at knowable values. In concept, the IncentBot has the potential to generate a profit but the proof of this pudding will be in theeating. In any case, our intention is to roll this out as soon as we can, in order that we can understand and optimise it, in advance of the commercial launch of our core product in Q2. Assuming we can get IncentBot playing nicely, we’ll open-source the code so that y’all can see how it works and run it for yourselves in ours or other markets if you wish.  In all of this I want to make it absolutely clear that our Market Operations are not aimed at profiting from our position at the centre of the Incent ecosystem but rather, enabling that ecosystem to function in a deep and liquid market. If we get this right consumer demand for Incent, driven through merchant partner integrations, will drive price North.  Organisation  A flick back to our Strategy diagram will confirm our intention to underpin our product and operations with a robust organisation. On this front we spent February reestablishing as an Australian entity and sorting out our banking. As I have written before, we regard the establishment and maintenance of blue-ribband governance and compliance standards and credentials that doing so will secure - as essential to securing business at the top end of town. To this end we have retained the services of a Compliance professional to lead on this work and represent our interests with the Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association(ADCCA) and the legal entities we retain in support of this effort.  We are also in the midst of an internal security audit, the objective of which is to ensure that we fully understand and mitigate the vulnerabilities and attack vectors that we face.  Finally...  I’d like to close by re-assuring you that in amongst all this heavy lifting, business development continues - ably led by our COO Richard Farrelly - with active conversations ongoing at all commercial tiers. And this is important because while we appreciate that we will likely need to have demonstrated commercial credibility at the bottom end of town before anyone at the top signs on the dotted line, engaging corporates and the agencies that support them can never start early enough and on this front, I can assure you that interest in what we are doing is only building.  Watch this space...  On! On!  Rob Wilson CEO Incent Loyalty PTY Ltd",False

In short: When the solution for merchant #1 is up and running chances are good to be listed on bigger exchanges.  We should get a new status update next week as the team has a meetup this week.  Quote from: KarlKarlsson_ on January 22, 2017, 02:12:33 PM Liquidity and Exchanges   I want to close be tackling a subject that I know is particularly close to your hearts. While it confuses me that anyone would seek to liquidate their holding of an asset that has not had an opportunity to demonstrate its potential, I absolutely understand the need for Incent to be liquid by the time our core product is live.    Where this is concerned I want to be open with you that I have pitched Incent to both Bittrex and Poloniex, neither of whom indicated an intention to list Incent until demonstrable demand for it is broader and deeper. While this may disappoint you I want to be clear that I understand it - and that I am not concerned by it. Allow me to explain…    In no more than a few weeks Waves will have launched an exchange facility of their own. Since we are running 4 full-nodes and hold a lot of Waves, it makes sense for us to support the core market for Incent through this channel - not least because Waves will be the primary counterparty currency against which Incent trades.        This in turn will allow us to execute a commercial operation with fiat transactions completely separate from crypto settlement - zero’ing the risk of unforeseen ‘banking failure’ - which would be catastrophic for our business.    Channeling all our commercially driven demand for Incent through Waves infrastructure will likely draw the attention of other exchanges - at which point they will list Incent, because it will make commercial sense for them to do so.  In the meantime, it is not in my nature to go to anyone on bended knee and I don’t think that it would make the slightest difference even if I did. With this in mind I would counsel that you hold your nerve and your Incent.",False

Two of POSW's exchanges offer listing for payment (YoBit and LiveCoin). 4. YoBit's reputation is shady at best - we don't want to be associated with them and are surely not striving for a listing there. 5.

I have no evidence, but hey, it ""can be"".    @ancientcoins Any statement on the coincidence that you announce to sell 200k Incent and when it happens you blame it on the Incent team?",False

There is a hidden story and motive here IMO - beyond just selling off Incent - but you will have to draw your own conclusions.   Also - consider this:  In BTC terms - they bought at 0.00004167 BTC/Incent They are selling now at 0.00005 Thats a nice profit  BUT - in USD terms  They bought at USD 0.025/Incent At current BTC prices that would be USD 0.044 (but its not because they were bought 29 Sep 2016 when BTC price was USD 600 - not 1050 like now) Selling at 0.00005 BTC/Incent - the USD price is 0.0525 So good profit - its more than doubling.   So from that springs some better news for Incent Investors.  Many if not most bought at 10k Incent per BTC = 0.0001 BTC/Incent So the USD cost was 0.06 in Sept 2016 The current USD market price is 0.0525 with BTC at 1050 at 0.00005 BTC/Incent - (and its above that at present - 0.000054 to be exact) So we are still down about 12.5% (but not by as much as the BTC comparison (buy at 0.0001 - current price 0.00005 - a halving)  I like to be positive - until faced with imminent death - so I'll choose to consider the USD comparison. Not much has to change here to be in the GREEN. A few releases and partnership announcements and the whole game changes.  I'm not worried - and when we get BTC price equalisation (0.0001) - in USD terms - we will be laughing.",False

Because it's Incent deposit tech, it will operate on Waves and create a Waves token at the end, as well as an Ethereum token (I'm not sure at what point the Ethereum MGO tokens are created). Everyone will need to register a Waves address for their tokens, so Incent will be bought off market and sent there. Again, I'm not 100% sure whether the distribution will work in real time, or whether the Incent will be registered to them and then distributed with the MGO token after the ICO. Either way, it's pretty cool and a nice use case for Incent. And the better MGO does, the more buy pressure and liquidity there is for Incent.",False

The gist was that if we didn't start buying tokens to increase the price, he and his mates would create a thread on bitcointalk and denounce Incent as a scam, ruining our reputation. Naturally we told him where to go. We also took screenshots, which make it very clear what's going on should we need to. (In practice, I doubt it would make much difference, since the businesses we're talking to don't routinely come to bitcointalk for information.)  We'd all like to see a higher price, but that will come with merchant adoption and we're simply not prepared to use the BTC we collected for marketing and development of Incent to manipulate it, at the expense of the long-term success of the project. That's not what we held the ICO for and it would be unethical and possibly borderline criminal to do that.  A final cross-post from Rob on Slack: Quote Okay @bitcointalkdtm: I have allowed this to run far enough. My position is that we have been upfront, honest and clear with our community. My team have confirmed that we are not, as an entity, active on either side of the market. As proof of this we have made the location of our reserve public so that it can be audited by the community. Conversely, what I can understand of your invective is ill-informed, destructive and inflammatory.

Our short- to mid-term roadmap is all focused on getting our product integrated with the first merchant. We are aiming for end of Q1/beginning of Q2. As soon as this is completed, roll-out and integration to further merchants is considerably easier and faster.  Parallel to that we are still licensing our ICO technology. We will continue to do that since it provides a revenue stream for Incent iself (with which some interesting development have been funded) as well as it creates demand for Incent in the secondary market.

It's 'value' that gives with one hand and takes away with another. So Ebay gives you something you can't spend anywhere else, and that will expire in a few weeks. My guess is that, like most reward programmes, it doesn't do a great deal to foster loyalty.  Incent is Open Value. You can spend it with any supporting merchant, hold it for the increase in value (which should come with growing adoption) or, if you want, cash it out on an exchange. It's totally up to you.  The cool thing is that the businesses we've talked to grasp that 1) This is not like traditional loyalty, which has more in common with the fiat system. 2) It's really attractive and offers advantages they don't currently enjoy. Like no forward liability, known costs, and incentivising consumer loyalty via a different means that actually respects the customer and gives them the choice to do what they want with their own money.",False

A big business like Amazon is a slightly different case. We will be making plugins so that Wordpress sites etc can use Incent easily, but a reseller like Amazon probably won't want to look at this.

Take a look at this blog post: https://medium.com/incent-loyalty-blog/first-ecommerce-partnership-4552dd9005a0#.9q99rvm37 The CEO of Sure Green liked the idea because he gets hit with major commission fees when he sells via third-party sites like Amazon.

While it confuses me that anyone would seek to liquidate their holding of an asset that has not had an opportunity to demonstrate its potential, I absolutely understand the need for Incent to be liquid by the time our core product is live.    Where this is concerned I want to be open with you that I have pitched Incent to both Bittrex and Poloniex, neither of whom indicated an intention to list Incent until demonstrable demand for it is broader and deeper. While this may disappoint you I want to be clear that I understand it - and that I am not concerned by it. Allow me to explain…    In no more than a few weeks Waves will have launched an exchange facility of their own. Since we are running 4 full-nodes and hold a lot of Waves, it makes sense for us to support the core market for Incent through this channel - not least because Waves will be the primary counterparty currency against which Incent trades.        This in turn will allow us to execute a commercial operation with fiat transactions completely separate from crypto settlement - zero’ing the risk of unforeseen ‘banking failure’ - which would be catastrophic for our business.    Channeling all our commercially driven demand for Incent through Waves infrastructure will likely draw the attention of other exchanges - at which point they will list Incent, because it will make commercial sense for them to do so.  In the meantime, it is not in my nature to go to anyone on bended knee and I don’t think that it would make the slightest difference even if I did. With this in mind I would counsel that you hold your nerve and your Incent.",False

This triggers the transaction to your account (merchants can decide themselves how many % 'cashback' they want to grant their customers). Note that BitScan acts as broker so we buy Incent from the open market in the name of the merchant and send it to you as customer.  This is the merchant demand we are always talking about and it also shows how important a number of different and liquid exchanges is for Incent. We need a stable secondary market (which we do our part for through market making) with small volatility.

There will be a day when people FOMO into Incent because it's so cheap and when the system really get's rolling there will be marketbuys, and therefor additional buy pressure. I like Incent especially because it's such a longterm thing and the system is designed to increase the buy-pressure the more Incent is used. And it's a no-brainer for both merchants and customers who need nothing to know about cryptocurrencies.  When you read the whitepaper you know how the system will be designed when it is up and what happens when more and more merchants adopt it. (Only 10 pages, 8 of them with content, because it's so simple to understand: https://www.incentloyalty.com/frontend_js_css/assets/whitepaper/UsingBlockchaintoBoostCommerce.pdf)  So worrying about the low prices today is really not what you should do. It's also never wrong to get listed on small exchanges way before bigger exchanges even think about listing, for understandable reasons. A little patience will definitely pay off.  I heard Charlie Lee talking about Altcoins being ""solutions without a problem"". In contrary to that Incent aims to disrupt an industry that can't improve itself and that not many people use as much as they would if it would be worth the hassle. The Incentive industry can be streamlined and universalised. Let sink in how such potential will increase the vlaue of Incent tokens if Incent gets massive adoption.",False

There you go:  Quote from: KarlKarlsson_ on January 22, 2017, 02:12:33 PM Liquidity and Exchanges   I want to close be tackling a subject that I know is particularly close to your hearts. While it confuses me that anyone would seek to liquidate their holding of an asset that has not had an opportunity to demonstrate its potential, I absolutely understand the need for Incent to be liquid by the time our core product is live.    Where this is concerned I want to be open with you that I have pitched Incent to both Bittrex and Poloniex, neither of whom indicated an intention to list Incent until demonstrable demand for it is broader and deeper. While this may disappoint you I want to be clear that I understand it - and that I am not concerned by it. Allow me to explain…    In no more than a few weeks Waves will have launched an exchange facility of their own. Since we are running 4 full-nodes and hold a lot of Waves, it makes sense for us to support the core market for Incent through this channel - not least because Waves will be the primary counterparty currency against which Incent trades.        This in turn will allow us to execute a commercial operation with fiat transactions completely separate from crypto settlement - zero’ing the risk of unforeseen ‘banking failure’ - which would be catastrophic for our business.    Channeling all our commercially driven demand for Incent through Waves infrastructure will likely draw the attention of other exchanges - at which point they will list Incent, because it will make commercial sense for them to do so.  In the meantime, it is not in my nature to go to anyone on bended knee and I don’t think that it would make the slightest difference even if I did. With this in mind I would counsel that you hold your nerve and your Incent.",False

I'll check about this but there may be a good reason for it. If not, apologies in advance and thanks for keeping us on our toes.

We're in contact with other exchanges, including one that has significantly higher volume that Bittrex, and will keep people updated as soon as we know more. 4) Ultimately it would be good to have Waves' DEX operational, and we'll be using that once it's up and running. But so long as we have at least one regular exchange, we can function ok and can get the MVP out there.

The key here is to try such exchange to do your trading 'thing' then promptly transfer the coins or tokens to your offline wallet, and of course trading a little by little at first while you gain confidence in such an exchange.    For liqui, I would first send a low amount such as 0.01 BTC first, buy some INCENT tokens and then promply transfer your INCENT tokens to your Waves Chrome wallet, wait for it to arrive, if successsfull rinse and repeat, if everything pans out alright for the first 0.5 BTC exchanges, then you might up the ante a bit to 0.25 BTC at a time and further up towards your comfort zone.  If Liqui proves that it can be a trusted exchange and only TIME can help in proving that, meaning no ""getting hacked"" or any of that, then people can start sending very large amounts of BTC at once to perform their exchanges.  Personally, I would have no trouble trying out LIQUI for my trading needs, but at the moment I am completely sold out, I have zero BTC's because I have invested in everything that I needed to invest, in INCENT and in ICN, both project where I believe it will be a success more for ICN than INCENT at the moment, so I have nothing to buy at the moment unless I want to sell either tokens which is not an option for me since I am holding for the long term and when I am ready to sell I wont have any problems trying out Liqui utilizing my little by little testing method at first and that's provided that by then Liqui hasn't had any major issues in terms of security and confidence.",False

Based on Waves, it's quite possible that some of this won't be claimed for months or ever. Perhaps it's been forgotten about or details lost. Who knows? Bottom line, if you haven't claimed your Incent yet, please do so! It's very easy to get started with the Waves lite client, no blockchain download required and very good UI.  2) Updates. Major updates will be monthly, like the one issued by Rob towards the end of January. That was pretty comprehensive and at this point, with dev work being the over-riding priority, there's not much to add on a day-to-day basis. Pete it doing a great job getting the MVP ready, we have hired another dev in UK, and basically it's all going pretty well. It's tight for Q1 rollout but right now we're on track. Aside from saying 'Pete wrote 193 lines of code today', there's not much more to say at this stage.  3) Exchanges. We're actively seeking listing because this is a critical part of our product. Incent needs the ability to buy tokens in more or less real-time. Aside from Tidex we are talking to another couple of exchanges. As soon as we get confirmation on those, we'll let you know, but you'll appreciate they have their own dev overhead and timelines for integrating new tokens.  4) Slack. If you have any urgent questions, particularly about claiming your Incent, Slack is the best place to ask them as we can be more responsive there.  That's all for now!",False

Feel free to share: https://twitter.com/KarlKarlsson_/status/823172746209267712  Incent Update 22 Jan 17  G’day Cent’urions!    So it’s been a little over one working month since our ICO closed and I wanted to take a moment to update you all on where we stand.    We’re Building...   As we continue to sweep up the ICO distribution tail it won’t surprise any of you to learn that we are in ‘build’ mode, and you will be pleased to learn that work is advancing nicely on the core product. Contextually, the task before us looks like this…        As you will see, we conceptualise the build as 4 distinct components, and have targeted the end of 2017 Q1 to have a working MVP together. That’s just 10 weeks away….(!).    You will also note that this diagram probably looks very similar to what BitPay might have drawn back in the day (and their wallet has just emerged from Beta!). I don’t say this to court butterflies or sympathy as we have absolute confidence that we can build it, but I do want you all to be clear about the scope of the task before us. It’s a big job.    To help us get across the work, we have taken on a second, very experienced and capable dev, Kyle Hengst, who is very well known to both Peter and I. The two of them are currently working on the Ops Management component and Peter is working separately with Waves’ ‘Hawky’, to prepare the path for a switch of focus to Crypto Integration with the Waves platform. This is clearly vital as it is the means by which the front end interacts with the underlying market for Incent to settle transactions. Once this component is complete we’ll be able to hook it up to a slick consumer wallet, which we will likely commission to a third party - most probably an outfit like Crew. Finally, the exact nature of the first merchant API will depend on who is the first cab off the rank.    In the Meantime… Many of you will be aware that I have made the decision to offer the ICO deposit technology we built for our own ICO to others. The first to use it has been the Tokes team and we are finalising arrangements to support a far bigger ICO 2017 Q2.  Some of you have been critical of this decision so I wanted to take a moment to explain my rationale for making it;    1. It is consistent with our overarching vision for Incent, as a means for anyone to incentivise whatever commercial activity they are prepared to pay for. In this case an ICO ‘merchant’ is no different from a mainstream merchant.    2. By baking Incent into the platform and reflecting issuance back into the market, we can support the market price of our token before and independant of the core product build.    3. We’ve already been able to deploy the revenue from this side project to improve the code base and incorporate new, groundbreaking functionality that will bleed into our core products moving forward. More of this later...    4. The ICO tech product has forced us to forge a deep understanding of the Waves infrastructure and an even stronger relationship with the Waves Team - who are so energised by its potential to drive business to their infrastructure that they are marketing it on our behalf.    5. It allows us to forge early commercial relationships with industry projects which presents the opportunity to bake Incent into their core offerings.    Hopefully, you can see that having already built this technology, it made sense to leverage it in this way, especially since doing so presents little distraction and actively assists us in pursuing our core vision and goals.    Cutting a new Edge...   By way of an example, I want to expose you to an initiative that began with us exploring redundancy contingencies on the Ethereum blockchain (in order that we will always be able to settle commercially).    We deployed our revenue from the Tokes ICO to contract a senior Ethereum developer to help us advance this concept. Together we have since devised and coded a way to create and distribute a token that can reside on both blockchains simultaneously and be switched from one to the other instantly thereafter. A concept demonstrator for you all to try will be available very soon...        It is this cutting edge technology that has attracted the big ICO project I spoke of earlier, with all the price support for Incent that it will generate. Think about it for even a moment and you will appreciate that this specific technology has way broader commercial implications still - all of them good for Incent and Waves price support moving forward.    Core Business Dev For those mainstream entities already keen to integrate Incent, this build period is demanding patience but you can rest assured that we are keeping those relationships warm. I need you to understand that before we have a core product live in the market, I need to tread a careful line between building commercial interest out further and overwhelming my devs. Notwithstanding, you’ll be heartened to learn that over the last two weeks we have been approached unsolicited by two very different entities to explore potential integrations.    Ju Feng Bao are a Chinese company that allow employers to part-pay their employees with tokens that can subsequently be exchanged for partner merchant goods and services. It is, perhaps unsurprising that they see potential in outsourcing to the blockchain.  The other is Sri-Marks, a global affiliate marketing operation, for whom incentivization would be infinitely simpler were they to incorporate an open value token.  You should take huge confidence from the fact that these prospects are seeking us out before we have deployed any resource on the marketing of the core product. It further convinces us of the huge breadth of the opportunity we are striving to exploit and of the implications this will have for the value of Incent as we do so.    Liquidity and Exchanges   I want to close be tackling a subject that I know is particularly close to your hearts. While it confuses me that anyone would seek to liquidate their holding of an asset that has not had an opportunity to demonstrate its potential, I absolutely understand the need for Incent to be liquid by the time our core product is live.    Where this is concerned I want to be open with you that I have pitched Incent to both Bittrex and Poloniex, neither of whom indicated an intention to list Incent until demonstrable demand for it is broader and deeper. While this may disappoint you I want to be clear that I understand it - and that I am not concerned by it. Allow me to explain…    In no more than a few weeks Waves will have launched an exchange facility of their own. Since we are running 4 full-nodes and hold a lot of Waves, it makes sense for us to support the core market for Incent through this channel - not least because Waves will be the primary counterparty currency against which Incent trades.        This in turn will allow us to execute a commercial operation with fiat transactions completely separate from crypto settlement - zero’ing the risk of unforeseen ‘banking failure’ - which would be catastrophic for our business.    Channeling all our commercially driven demand for Incent through Waves infrastructure will likely draw the attention of other exchanges - at which point they will list Incent, because it will make commercial sense for them to do so.  In the meantime, it is not in my nature to go to anyone on bended knee and I don’t think that it would make the slightest difference even if I did. With this in mind I would counsel that you hold your nerve and your Incent.  But…    Having said this, I do see the same utility for exchanges to incorporate Incent in their platforms as I do for mainstream merchants, i.e in its primary role, as an incentive to transact.  Some of you may know that Retail FX exchanges offer rebates, based on the interest rate differential  (called a Swap rate) between trading pairs, to encourage trading. Crytpo cannot offer Swaps because interest rates don’t exist but my contention is that rebates could, if a small portion of a third party token was bought ‘at market’ from a portion of spread profit and passed back to the trader as a reward for taking a trade. And this token could be Incent, right?!    You will be pleased to learn that we have pitched this concept to 2 of the smaller exchanges and both are interested in moving forward. If implemented this would, in my view, have a significant and positive impact on trading volume for the partner exchange, and a similarly positive impact on the market price of Incent. Better still, implementation requires no development effort on our part.    Get Involved...   This last point brings me to the thought I would like to leave you with. As you can tell, we are interested in exploring any concept where somebody is happy to pay to incentivise the activity of another - because this is where open-value, like Incent, just thrashes the closed-value options that preceded it.  As I have often said, this opportunity is way bigger than conventional loyalty.  My point here is that you guys are better placed to identify these use cases, within your own professional niches, than we are. So if you do spot an opportunity, get busy! Do some groundwork and connect us up with your counterparty; we will make it well worth your while to do so!    In the meantime, I hope that this update finds you in good health and heart. We are immensely excited by the opportunity to get stuck into this project and hope you feel as upbeat and energised as we do.    On! On!

The tokens on Openledger are ""real"", that means you can withdraw them from there to a Waves client. On Openledger there's a Deposit/withdrawal section. More exchanges will follow after the app is released. You can read on that in the posts above. If you can get the tokens below ICO on Openledger price I guess it's a clear buy if you understood the project and believe in it. I don't think we'll see prices like that ever again in the future. Also remember that the Incent team sells the tokens to merchants for the fixed price of 0,00020000 BTC.  As soon as the app is out and the system gets used the price will rise. That's why I invested in this project. Also the project is easy to understand, even for people that know nothing about crypto at all. I explained it to my grandmother. Even she understood it, because she takes part in several loyalty schemes, but all of them are not really worth it.

Pete took quite a lot of effort to develop our ICO tech, which is a lot more secure than anything else around. We've had plenty of interest in businesses licensing it, starting with Tokes. There will be others and we have at least one signed up for the near future. These will be 'Customer zero' for Incent. While Pete finishes the wallet and integrates with the first merchants (like Sure Green) later this quarter, these are the guys who will place early external demand on the Incent market. Every time someone deposits to the ICO, 1% is used to buy Incent as rewards. So Incent is baked right in, which is pretty cool - a kind of 'Incent Inside' initiative.

Seems to have gotten a lot tougher to get listed these days. (edited)  pyneer [8:13 AM] joined #general  blackpete [8:15 AM] or are there any considerations to list INCNT on Waves DEX first? Make it some sort of exclusive?  rob [8:19 AM] I can tell you that the relationship between Waves and Incent is very tight and that we shall defo be making the market for Incent with them. I had made overtures to Bittrex and, to a lesser extent, Poloniex, but ultimately this proved a mildly distasteful business.  [8:21]  We are a Waves token. This is where I have pitched our tent and it's a decision I am very comfortable with.  blackpete [8:23 AM] thank you for clarifying and your open words. Market making on Waves is a very good idea in my opinion. This is a marathon and not a sprint.  [8:24]  Both Waves and Incent can profit massively of the first successfull CAT on the Waves platform.  marousi [8:25 AM] bingo  rob [8:29 AM] So I should be clear that we are (jointly) thinking way bigger than this. Allow me to explain...  [8:29]  Within the next week we shall be launching this site http://icotech.me  [8:30]  ...as a side project.  [8:30]  Incent will be baked in. Allowing us to support market price, in advance of core product launch.  [8:31]  Sasha sees its potential to bring business to Waves and will support with marketing horsepower from the get go.  [8:32]  My team will also swing back into action on marketing.  [8:32]  We are in the process of negotiating our first big ICO.  [8:33]  The result will be a Waves token that resides on both Waves and Ethereum blockchains.  [8:34]  More generally, this will keep Incent at the cutting edge in the building of the Waves CAT community, with us in the centre of those relationships, and our stack ready to white-label to projects as they come on line...  [8:35]  ...all with Incent baked in.  marousi [8:35 AM] very very good @rob  rob [8:36 AM] I want to stress that none of this detracts from our core dev roadmap. Instead it complements and leverages it, to the benefit of our backers.  marousi [8:36 AM] even better  rob [8:37 AM] This is exactly where I wanted us to be at the start of 2017. The team are, as you can imagine, stoked, and we are ready to press hard.  blackpete [8:37 AM] Rob, you are a free-thinker and very creative entrepreneurial mind. However, please don't get carried away and focus on incent's core product. This was your pitch and that is what your investors lined up for. Now, please tell me, how the same team that works on incent now has a side-project and that this side-project does not take away any ressources  [8:39]  besides that, I totally support the idea behind icotech.me. Its a missing link  [8:39]  and I have been playing around with a similiar idea myself  rob [8:39 AM] Good question. So the core ICO Tech is built and basically deplorable on a key. What my devs now need to focus on is the core stack. The rest of us can market this while they do that.  [8:40]  Remember, an ICO and other client that wishes to tokenise their business is no different from a merchant client where Incent is concerned. The better they do the more Incent is sold and the greater the sport for the price of Incent on the secondary market.  [8:41]  This is a way for us to stimulate demand quicker than we had originally thought possible.  [8:42]  And if it pays for itself we will hire against it.  [8:43]  It is - I want to stress - completely synergous with our core mission.  [8:43]  It simply leverages tech and expertise we have to support Incent and Waves.  blackpete [8:44 AM] probably a good decision business-wise. You know your ressources better than anyone and I trust you in that regard. An ICO is primarily not about a promise anyway...its about investing in a team (edited)  rob [8:44 AM] Pete, trust me, things are lining up nicely.  [8:45]  In the meantime I'll publish a roadmap shortly. I need to bring you guys into the tent on this so you can keep us honest.",False

Exchanges do. All we can do is ask them - the decision is ultimately up to them. The exception to this rule is if the exchange is decentralised, like Waves' DEX, on which Incent will trade once it's up and running. Arguably that's all we need for price discovery, though of course a traditional exchange like Polo or Bittrex would be nice and we will continue to pursue that. The current price on Open Ledger is a short-term anomaly, due to low liquidity and soaring BTC price. I would STRONGLY advise people not to sell at below ICO. Once merchant integration takes place there will be real, ongoing buy support from both inside and outside the crypto-sphere. At that point we get to find out what happens when a deflationary currency with a current market cap of ~$1m experiences growing demand from hundreds or thousands of transactions a day. I hope people can wait that long.",False

Every fork which has potential eventually will make it's jump and the ones off the train won't be able to get back on at the same price (Murphy).

I have reported on this page that the waves wallet is not working and all the recommended solutions have been tried but the issue still persist, the block count is still 0 and not synchronising with  the network and it doesn't make any sense for me to make the same mistake twice especially what happened with Antshares wallet that got me sweating for days. I think it is better to put withdrawal option on the ico page instead of this auto withdrawal of a thing.     they did account here in this thread to pm karl the email used in your ico dashboard account so they could send incent to each account. if you haven't done so already, may be you should do it right now.

Because Incent is a token on top of Waves - if you transfer Incent, it's on the Waves blockchain. Think of the Waves Lite Client as a multi-wallet for Waves and all assets hosted on their blockchain. Is that mean that INCENT will never have its own wallet? Incent will have its own wallet for users of the loyalty program. This wallet will be intuitive and user-friendly and will show the value of one's Incent in the local currency.  For crypto users we will not make a separate wallet since the Waves Lite Client offers all you need already.

You're right about the total supply but the bounty pool is 1% of total Incent tokens sold which is half of the total supply.  No news about exchanges but we're working on it.

Thank your for taking interest in the Waves Platform!  I am a Waves Slack member for 6 months now following the news daily and participating in the testing and development of Waves.  I respect your contribution to the worldwide crypto community very much.  Waves is a unique project in many ways.  1. It is the first blockchain technology written in the functional language Scala. With functional programming you can run things much faster and with much less LoC(lines of code) than with other languages. E.g. the Scorex Platform (which forms the foundation of Waves and which is also written in Scala) implemented the same functionality as Bitcoin with only 4000 LoC compared to BTC's 90k LoC! 2. Waves has rolled out custom asset creation on testnet last week. Mainnet release is imminent. Now everybody will be able to create his/her/its own assets very easily. This can be used for e.g crowdfunding, to distribute shares in a company etc... 3. Waves will also implement a decentralized asset exchange to trade your custom assets and any type of assets(e.g. BTC/ETH assets, USD/EUR/YUAN assets). 4. Fiat gateways are under way which will enable custom assets conversion(e.g. collected during a fundraising campaign of the Waves Platform) to fiat. 5. With LPOS everybody will be able to lease stakes to trusted nodes and earn money from transaction fees. 6. Also the features secure messaging, blockchain voting, prediction market(analog to Augur), decentralized reputation system and smart contracts are under way. 7. I have read the white paper of the coming scalability update. Waves' blochchain growth will be 1/10 of what ETH currently has. This solution will form the foundation for a high tx load network(>1000tx/sec) 8. The project has a very low burn rate $70k/months and with $16M collected during the ICO Sasha has enough money for marketing and advertising.  As for Poloniex:  A Slack member of ours(who is also BTC talk legendary member) has a direct contact to one of Poloniex's owners and asked him this question about two months ago. The answer was basically that they were waiting for the release of the full node which happened only two weeks ago. After that they have to do a code review and plan the listing. This could take several weeks.      ",False

If we are listed on an exchange before the DEX release, you'd have to sell your Incent for BTC and then buy Waves and vice versa.  Right now you cannot buy more, no.

It's a Chrome plug-in, you can download it from www.wavesplatform.com. In due course there will be a dedicated Incent app for consumers, but this is the first step for crypto folk. Secondly, there won't be a buywall at the 5k/BTC level. We're saying that we'll be issuing Incent to clients at no more than 5k/BTC (20k sats), so this is where we will place demand on the market as funds come in from the first ICO partner.

However, you will need a tiny amount of Waves if you want to transfer them (transaction fee).  No, you're all set if you entered your personal wallet address in the ICO dashboard.  Incent will generate lots of transactions on Waves which directly benefits Waves and the Node operators. That's the ecosystem we frequently talk about: Services on top of Waves bring users and transactions which will make Waves what we plan it to be - a full-fledged financial platform. However, there is no relation between the two projects like 'if one price spikes, the other has to as well'.

Nothing is free! You are providing a value by spreading the word about something, you are promoting it in your signature. Translating something into another language takes time and knowledge of at least  languages and it helps spread the world to potentiality hundreds, even thousands and more people from that country or places where that language is spoken! Most importantly you are taking your time and time is money, you could have done something else , even earn money, in that time.  No one is giving a free money and bounties are not free gift. If it would not bring benefits to any project no one would offer them - why would they give you free money? No one is that stupid or generous. I am NOT talking about incent but in general.  Then there is more: some coin might not get listed on any exchanges, you might not be able to exchange them for real ""money"" or the value might fall so low that the hours you spend on translation might be worth next to nothing by the time you exchange it for btc or something else. Heck, there are even cases, like Darcrus for example, where you might be doing all promo or translations for free (read: at your own loss) because if it doesn't get 1000btc then the project doesn't go ahead.  You never know if your translation or you signature or your twitter RT might have brought a bigger investor. I really don't like people seeing translators,social media campaigners or signature holders as a bounty hunters and wanting to get something for free, many times being portrayed in a negative light. For bounty activities bring value to the coin and project, that is the sole reason why they introduced them. Everyone helps the way they can.

They as well will get 2,5% of increased value? ie person invests 1k waves via referral during black friday effect, do I understand correctly: - Investor gets Incent tokkens for virual ammount of waves of (1k * (20% + 5%))*(1+ 2,5%) = 1281,25 waves - the one who referred investor will get 2,5% as well = 1281,25-1250 = 31,25 waves  Meaning that this 20% bonus also works for referrers?   I am currently checking with our dev Peter how exactly the bonuses are calculated, will get back to you!",False

Thank you for your comments, we took them into account.  We usually write only few reports per month and make them very detailed and comprehensive (about 30 pages).

Since it was an experimental report, written in a shorter than usual period of time, it’s quite possible that it was of a lower quality than usual.

We have a different approach: We not only want to make loyalty programs more efficient and cheaper (which mostly benefits the business) but fully rethink how loyalty programs are constructed. With Incent, customers will enjoy open value meaning they can redeem their reward in the whole Incent network. Furthermore, they are free to sell their reward in the secondary market or transfer them to someone else. Last but not least, Incent tokens don't have an expiry date; users can simply save their Incent for as long as they wish and maybe even make a capital gain due to a price increase.  I'd suggest you to read our whitepaper instead of accusing us of being a 'Quick buck ICO' with your first post in this topic.",False

Sasha raised 100's of thousands from a number of Coinomat based assets, then abandoned them in favour of WAVES which raised 10's of millions. What's to say he doesn't abandon WAVES for a project in the 100's of millions. If this idea seems ridiculous (Sasha abandoning WAVES for something bigger/better), then try and explain why a promising project like Incent seems perfectly content to work with Sasha given his past behaviour? Either Incent guys don't realise all these past projects have been abandoned (which would be diabolical negligence in itself), or they do know, but are using WAVES anyway. The Crypto community obviously tolerates a lot more shonky behaviour.  Maybe others know what's going on with all Sasha's past coinomat based assets and businesses, (if so please share), but on the surface it looks like a collective delusion where everyone is happy to ignore reality.

The greatest advantage of Incent is it's open value meaning that people can redeem it for rewards, sell it on the market or transfer/save it.  Imagine if there is a company in your country and it's the only one. The company could still participate in Incent and distribute rewards to its customers. They will then be able to choose how to use their tokens, be it for redemption at this exact or another company in the network, market selling or transferring/saving. Surely, if it's the only company in the respective country, the user won't have as many possibilities to redeem his tokens as in Australia for example. Nevertheless, there might be participating companies in Australia who'd deliver their products to other countries as well. Additionally, there will be businesses in the network offering online services so the customer's location doesn't matter at all. If a user can't find what he desires, he will simply hold his Incent or sell them (both ways he received his reward).

Remember, every merchant client puts Incent into the pockets of all of their customers and reflects demand back onto the underlying market for Incent every time any of them transact. So Incent doesn't need to scale globally, immediately, to have massive utility to merchant clients, their customers and all holders of Incent, wherever they are and whatever their niche.

Once live, Incent will be redeemable anywhere, forever. To the holder, they will be 'money good'. This is, to use Peter Thiel's vernacular, a 10x improvement.  Blockchain makes this possible, through creation of token of finite supply aimed at this specific function.  Our thesis is that consumers will love this (open) value proposition and because Incent incurs a fraction of the operating costs and liability of conventional schemes - so will merchants.  The result will be regular and building demand for the token on the secondary market, as more and more merchants adopt - with the associated impact on token price.  Put another way, while the scenario you envisage is theoretically feasible, we deem it highly unlikely. And bear in mind that any conventional loyalty point is worthless - by design - at the one year point. Viewed from this perspective even 50 cents on the dollar is a significant improvement on the current status-quo.  In the meantime, the value proposition for holders of Incent (as a speculative investment) is similarly strong, as the project will see mainstream commerce paying to put crypto into the wallets of mainstream consumers. Every single transaction from every single participating merchant will result in a new demand impulse for Incent on the secondary market.  RW.",False

The tokens are transfered to the customer's wallet from the reserve fund. A few days latter, you guys get paid y amount in fiat, which you use to buy bitcoin. you then proceed to buy INCENT in the open market to balance the books. This creates demand for the token and benefits savers and investors. Great!  But what happens when a customer wants to redeem his tokens? Customer pays in incent, you guys probably have to wire the merchant the equivalent amount in fiat(since the reason Rob started this project is that most merchants dont care about BTC). In order to balance the books, you know have to sell the INCENT you got from the customer in order to replenish your fiat reserves, causing the price to fall.  So, all things being equal the price stays the same, right? Am I  missing something here?  b)Also how do merchants deal with volatility in fiat terms? e.g., a merchant might issue a token for $ 1 in INCENT, only to see it go to $2 a couple of months later. How do you deal with this issue?  c) Regarding Waves: You guys said that an increase in the price of Waves won't result in the appreciation of the INCENT token. Could you share the rationale for making that statement?  As things stand, INCENT's fate is very much tied to Waves and Sasha. The project might be able to recover in the long term should Waves fail, but in the short term it would be disastrous for you guys. As such, I  think it is only fair the price of INCENT should benefit from the appreciation of the Waves token.  Thanks in advance.",False

There will be overall pressure on the price of Incent for a couple of reasons at least. The spread (we will redeem Incent at a slightly lower price than it's bought) for a start. Also, the merchant ecosystem will expand rapidly in the early months and years. A lot of Incent will therefore be bought. There will necessarily be a lag between that being sent to the customer and the customer redeeming it - if in fact they do, since many will probably hold as an investment or possibly forget about it! Essentially, any adoption brings greater scarcity of available supply.  b) If a merchant issues a token when Incent is $1 and it's at $2 when the customer redeems it, that's good for both of them! Remember, Incent is just another form of money. It's not backed by that individual merchant, it's sold at market price. This is one of the things that merchants love about Incent - there's no forward liability. Of course, Incent may be worth less when it's redeemed by the customer, due to market fluctuations. That's not great, but everyone knows what the deal is from the start at the value of Incent in fiat will be displayed to the customer in the app. Also, we've designed Incent in such a way that the value should rise sustainably over the long term, whatever short-term volatility there is.  c) Waves is a platform and Incent a Waves token. So Waves is a tool here, rather than 'backing' Incent in some way. Incent will trade against fiat (merchants buying and redeeming) and BTC (on exchanges). Confidence in Waves is important, but so long as the platform works well I don't see that the price of Waves should materially impact the price of Incent once it's in the wild and being used as intended.  Does that all make sense?",False

Based on funding rate at the moment you would be inclined to guess that we will run right through to the end of November. Against that we are lining up some meaningful Business Development announcements over the next few weeks, any one of which could provoke a deluge of funding. Also, the imminence of Waves full nodes and distributed asset exchange going live could provoke a similar reaction. My limited experience of ICOs suggests that it tends to happen all at once - and generally in the last week. Our situation may prove the exception because we are an application rather than infrastructure, actively pursuing mainstream commercial opportunities which we are announcing as we go.

Quote from: mummybtc on October 26, 2016, 09:44:25 AM This is just my observations  1. I think the social media presence is not visible enough unlike some projects, I don't like to name names  2. I do think the way the price of each token was fixed also have impact on it, I am saying this because I bought my first tokens when the price was at 1BTC = 10000incents tokens but now I which to buy more but as an investors and looking at the way prices of these token dropped significantly after hitting exchanges recently buy at 1BTC = 7000incents tokens seems unwise to me. Assuming there is 50 million tokens for-sale and let the market determine the price of each tokens 1. Considering we collected almost USD 1m I think we are doing pretty fine. A lot of people have an eye on Incent.  2. I have to disagree here. Due to market effects if you would invest in Incent now with Waves you make the better deal in the end than if you had invested at the beginning with the big bonus.

So for early investor (like my self), I'd be glad to see atleast reassesment of collected funds in terms of value in fiat, which at least will affect on possible investors to react faster, meaning that time of ICO can be shortened that way and CAP reached faster. Seriously there is no point of prolonging time of ico for more than 1 month, because most of investors will react on latest moment, so this latest moment needs to be chosen precisely when investors have funds on hands  Basically we might see today some inputs and if not then on last day of ICO. If CAP was set in BTC/Waves equivalent at the start of ICO then such questions woudn't be a problem",False

Once this is confirmed, I think you will see a lot of money flowing into the Incent ICO.

I have always felt that this particular ICO, for a lot of reasons, could bring in a lot of money in the last week or two of its running.  That is why current prices are still very very cheap.

I've pondered the same thing and took it upon myself to do some math... I'm hoping this rings accurate or at least within reason... If an investment cap of 5 million usd is achieved and based on the current BTC price, the total btc to be raised will be in and around the 7843 mark (as you know the btc price will most likely change over the next month). That said and taking into account that over time you will get less incent per btc you invest, I've worked out the maximum amount of coins that could possibly be issued based on an investment cap of 5 million and a price of 8000 incent per btc (the current price)... the total amount of tokens to be issued based on that little sum comes to 62 744 000. Obviously the actual amount will be considerably lower given the incent price increase every week/weeks until the ICO ends.

Looks like maybe someone thinks we're worth taking offline... We'll investigate and fix asap (Peter is asleep right now, being in Aus). Annoyingly, these 'display issues' come as a result of doing things MORE securely than other ICOs. Everything is on the bitcoin blockchain. That's the final arbiter of how Incent balances are calculated. But you have to be able to read stuff off the blockchain, which is what these problems affect. With other ICOs, there's generally a MySQL database that could be attacked, corrupted, deleted... At the end of the ICO, there will be a thorough audit before Incent are distributed. For now, it's just worth re-iterating that your Incent balances are created from the amounts and timestamps on the bitcoin blockchain. So unless someone finds a way of messing with those, you're fine.",False

Looks like maybe someone thinks we're worth taking offline... We'll investigate and fix asap (Peter is asleep right now, being in Aus). Annoyingly, these 'display issues' come as a result of doing things MORE securely than other ICOs. Everything is on the bitcoin blockchain. That's the final arbiter of how Incent balances are calculated. But you have to be able to read stuff off the blockchain, which is what these problems affect. With other ICOs, there's generally a MySQL database that could be attacked, corrupted, deleted... At the end of the ICO, there will be a thorough audit before Incent are distributed. For now, it's just worth re-iterating that your Incent balances are created from the amounts and timestamps on the bitcoin blockchain.

As u invest you get tokken for the market price at the moment of transaction. Price is taken from here: http://bravenewcoin.com/waves#Trading-Pairs  So yes if waves go to let's say 100k satoshish and you bought it now for 35k then you let's say lose some from possible investment if it'd stay in waves, but incent tokkens will be traded on decentralized exchange and price will be decided by the makret. It can happen that price of incent will be even hight than wave's price at some point of time but you never know that depends on how both teams deliver promises. Don't forget, that for every spent waves now you get more incent than u get let's say on last week of november (about 30% less) and as well with small 5% bonus.",False

More generally my sense is that community is coming round to the view that Incent really could be the Trojan horse to mainstream adoption which has so far eluded all of crypto.  While Incent is not a mind-bendingly complex infrastructure project, it is a clever little application that connects that infrastructure to a mainstream market by solving a real-world commercial problem.

Its well worth a read...  XXXXCC[6:01 AM] I need a final push for my investment decision though. Would you help giving that to me? :slightly_smiling_face:  rob [6:02 AM]  Im more than happy to walk you through our product and plans etc  XXXXCC [6:04 AM]  I know you cannot *officially* make predictions about the market cap. If you'd say $100M in 12 months I won't come back and blame you for not achieving it. I just would like to know your personal opinion, your gut feeling about the prospects.  rob [6:04 AM]  Ok so there's a couple of factors at play here...  [6:05]  Firstly, we aren't building any super complicated infrastructure from scratch. This means we can be out of the gate relatively quickly post ICO.  [6:06]  The second thing is when we do get out of the gate our business development focus will not be crypto but mainstream commerce.  [6:07]  and for every merchant we bring onboard, the secondary market sees a new demand impulse every time they transact with every one of their customers from then on.  [6:08]  This represents a huge network effect of mainstream consumers who will then be able to buy Incent through their wallet - which they will want to do to secure the best deals on products marketed to them through their wallet; more demand impulse.  XXXXCC [6:09 AM]  Okay  rob [6:10 AM]  When I consider this against the finite circulation and modest market cap on Incent at launch - I cannot see how price per Incent doesn't rise - and all other things being equal, continue to do so in perpetuity.  [6:11]  The rate of this rise is going to depend on the success of our business development efforts but already I can tell you that EVERY entity I have engaged is interested and they represent a broad sweep of commerce.  [6:12]  Every time we effect a new merchant integration we can shrink wrap that tech and move it to scale.  XXXXCC [6:12 AM]  Why would Mrs. Jones with absolutely no knowledge of cryptos would use Incent?  rob [6:12 AM]  We only need to build a magento plug-in once, for example  [6:13]  Mrs Jones need have no idea what crypto even is. She just bought something from a participating merchant and her phone went beep.  [6:14]  She followed a link to claim a $5 reward and now she can see it, displayed as value in her local tender.  XXXXCC [6:14 AM]  Aha  rob [6:14 AM]  She checks back in a week or so and now it's worth $5.30  [6:14]  now she's interested. now she starts doing some sums. now she goes back to that merchant and buys something else  [6:15]  now she sees other things she can buy through her wallet  [6:15]  now she sees they are cheaper if she pays with incent  [6:16]  she still knows nothing about crypto  [6:16]  but she's the home economist  [6:16]  and she understands value  [6:16]  she may even remember what its like to save  XXXXCC [6:16 AM]  It's like the coupons in the old days except everything is on the Internet...  rob [6:17 AM]  and now she sees she can do that 'for free'.  [6:17]  she starts wondering about that family holiday they can't afford  [6:18]  only maybe now they can if she can build up their incent, and get better deals with incent  [6:18]  etc etc, rinse and repeat  XXXXCC [6:18 AM]  Great! It's common sense even house wifes could understand it....  [6:19]  Why would merchants use Incent instead of creating their own digital incentives?  rob [6:19 AM]  @XXXXCC, housewives are the sharpest of all of us but while they never understood crypto - because they were too busy sorting our shit out, they totally understand value.  XXXXCC [6:20 AM]  True.  rob [6:20 AM]  And if crypto can help them do better here - they'll champion it materially.  [6:21]  When  say that incent is a trojan horse of mainstream adoption, this is what I mean.  [6:22]  If you get this you'll want to be part of this project because you can only see one ending. It'll feel historic and you'll want to be a part of that.  XXXXCC [6:22 AM]  Yeah, that is what my gut feeling tells me: it's historic and I will be part of it.... :slightly_smiling_face:  rob [6:22 AM]  To your original question, I think x10 by Christmas is distinctly unlikely  [6:23]  but x100s in 3 years is, to my mind, a racing certainty.  XXXXCC [6:23 AM]  :grinning:  rob [6:23 AM]  Does that help?  XXXXCC [6:24 AM]  Very much so, Rob! Thanks so much for taking the time! :wink:  rob [6:24 AM]  my pleasure. gotta jump now but good to talk.  [6:24]  And welcome aboard.  You have 3 hours before the price of Incent rises.

Don't forget that the first bonus stage ends in about 25 hours; I can't promise that it will be running until then.

Is it possible for Incent to exceed Waves in value? Another question; say I buy 1 Btc worth of Incent which will get me 10,000 units now. Will the number of units I own decrease by the end of the ICO?  Absolutely. Incent is a service on top of Waves and, once the decentralized exchange is live, will be traded against any other currency which is issued on Waves in the form of a token. Theoretically, Incent could be worth double as much as Waves.  The beauty is, the bigger Incent grows, the more Waves profits from it due to having more transactions on the platform. It's a win-win situation for both projects.  To your last point: No, we are not selling proportional stakes of a fixed supply. What you see in your ICO dashboard will stay there. You can only make it increase   Quote from: myferrari on October 03, 2016, 07:09:07 PM Why i remember sig bounty is 300k incent? But where I saw it os 1% of ico coin is bounty, 40% of that 1% is sig bounty. You maybe have calculated a maximum of 200k Incent for the social media bounty, but never was it posted that there will be 300k for the sig campaign. As you said, it is 40% of the total bounty pool which is equal to 1% of sold tokens.  Thank you for the prompt reply. This seems very appealing. Looks like I'll be investing in this as well.

You need the necessary skills/equipment to set up a safe cold storage which you are responsible for. Furthermore, their work doesn't finish by end of ICO, that's where it actually starts. They bear a lot of responsibility, also towards the community, since they release funds according to milestones. It's not just 'I am escrow' and that's it.   Pre-ICO investments are not just any investment - the other party is committed to support the project in whichever way it can and this is exactly happening right now.

The deal at the top was for pre-ICO Angel investors, who typically bring much more than money to the table. This deal no longer stands now that ICO has started. There were a limited number of Angel investors, and they don't have a lot of incentive to dump.  The 50% Reserve is not held for 'costs'. Please read the detailed posts about this Reserve. It's not for the team, or anyone else. It's to maintain orderly payments to customers. Fiat funds sent from merchants take 2-3 days to arrive. Obviously we cannot wait that long before we remit Incent to the customer. Thus the Reserve is required for the project to work properly, and in return, Incent holders will receive regular 'dividend' payments from BitScan's marketmaking.

Are the tokens calculated and their ammount is final at the time of investment or ammount of tokkens will be calculated at the time of ICO end/hit 5mln via initial calculation of collected investments.  stategically thinking best option is to buy waves on main exchange, price will go up (wave's pretty easy to change +5-10%) and after that invest in incent (depends how fast we can extract from exchange but for that purpose i already have waves on separate wallets so no prob here).

Incent is a service on top of Waves and, once the decentralized exchange is live, will be traded against any other currency which is issued on Waves in the form of a token. Theoretically, Incent could be worth double as much as Waves.  The beauty is, the bigger Incent grows, the more Waves profits from it due to having more transactions on the platform. It's a win-win situation for both projects.  To your last point: No, we are not selling proportional stakes of a fixed supply. What you see in your ICO dashboard will stay there.

Naturally there will be some costs to integration, particularly at first, hence the ICO.

The fact that this is software and requires no extra hardware helps a lot. We really don't want to be asking anything more of merchants than we have to.

That does not sound fair at all, actually that is absurd.  Also 50% of the total supply is held for costs and what not, maybe I'm missing something or didn't understand but along with the ICO funds you're going to hold 50% of the supply.

Based on this our sense is that a lot of people are lining themselves up to buy before the price goes up. BUT, here's the thing: you should only do so if you understand and buy into what this project is really about. If you are expecting a 10x return by Christmas we are probably not the project for you. If you are targeting a 100x return in the next 24 months we may be. Let me explain why...  Incent is about proving that we can have mainstream consumers pay to put crypto into the pockets of mainstream consumers - in a way that is friction free and accessible. Its going to take us a few months post ICO to prove this concept in the market but once we have, we can rapidly scale through the network effect of the crowd and all the time, every transaction from a growing army of merchants represents a new demand impulse on the secondary market.  When this penny drops you understand that over medium term time-frame there is only one outcome, given that the supply of Incent is finite.  Anyway, its your call. Good luck with your decision!

The merchant configures their dashboard to pass a configurable percentage of their sale revenue, by product or basket, back to the buyer in the form of digital value.  Through a webhook at their point of sale we make this happen, every time they transact thereafter. The customer receives this value in a digital wallet and the merchant settles with us after the fact in local tender. In the meantime, we reflect that demand back onto the secondary market for Incent, so that all holders of Incent see the impact on the value of their holding.  Boom!

The funding cap of USD5million was put in place because we want to preserve a strong secondary market for the sake of those who have supported us.  Make no mistake, this project is going to happen and we are highly confident of success - and quickly.  RW.",False

The web-app has evolved into a fully featured eco-system with embedded e-mag and e-commerce, enabled by google firebase and algolia instant search. It is, so far as we know, the biggest curated directory of bitcoin-ready business available and it is well trafficked.  To your second point. The quick answer is, 'the power of the value proposition' which has been informed by, but is fundamentally different from what it was in 2014.  Cast your mind back. At the time there was a rush to onboard mainstream commerce to the bitcoin eco-system. Problem was, the value proposition was just not compelling enough for sufficient merchants to risk enabling a bitcoin payment facility and even those that did found that the bitcoin consumer base simply wasn't big enough to make any difference whatsoever to their bottom line. And we know what happened.  Informed by this outcome - Incent turns this failure on its head by offering mainstream merchants the ability to incentivise increased custom and repeat custom, from an expanded customer base, at no upfront cost or friction and no ongoing overhead. Yes, blockchain is what makes this possible but its 'under the bonnet', and since the merchant doesn't even need to handle or hold the crypto, its invisible to them.  Offering merchants a means of materially improving their bottom line - at no upfront cost, drag or risk. is a very different conversation than proposing that they accept bitcoin - because its cool.

The short answer is that our target of $1m will give us the means to re-organise structurally around this product, attend to compliance, complete the development of the consumer and merchant facing applications for commercial roll-out, and cover all associate marketing and business development activities for a period of one year. Given the advanced stage of product and business development already achieved we estimate that this will an ample amount of runway, providing us with the means to get to market in good shape.  Any funds raised beyond our target simply make our business objectives easier and faster to achieve. More can be attempted and our tolerance for risk can be notched up without fear that one false move could be catastrophic  We have capped funding at $5m because we judge that beyond this starts to undermine the secondary market for Incent - to the detriment of token holders and our ability to raise further cpital from traditional investment markets due to an overinflated valuation.

Unfortunately, due to incent's value, it's only feasible to reward customers with a percentage of incent.  Merchants are now rewarding customers with 0.001 incent.  This reduces incent's perceived value for loyalty participants upon their introduction as theyre not even receiving a whole token.  Bitcoin has this issue. People want to own at least ONE of something.  When customers recieve 2000 flybuys, they're excited and have no idea of the value. Having 2000 of something just seems like a big deal and generates interest.  If a merchant sells a product for $5, theyre not going to be able to reward with whole incent tokens forever - even at the 25c low cap, there's an adoption issue.  Why so little coins from the start and why the cap, why not change it?   This all seems quite obvious from a marketing perspective, so am I missing something here?  Is the goal not mass adoption?",False

The token is the fuel but it exists 'under the bonnet'. Recall Intel's annoying little jingle against the words ""Incent Inside"" - ;-)  Consumers receiving 2000 plastic points and having 'no idea of the value' is precisely what we are trying to move away from.

What you are suggesting is that our messaging should focus on the way it delivers value, whereas I want to start the conversation with the genre or industry in which Incent lives, because it helps people to situate cognitively and provides us with a backdrop against which to describe Incent's unique features and points of difference.  I believe this allows us to have a more expansive conversation than a start point of 'digital cashback' would allow.  Were digital cashback the extent of Incent's breadth or ambition we wouldn't have bothered to embed e-commerce functionality in the consumer wallet, or include an analytics package in the merchant side dashboard - to give just two examples. We might also have just piggybacked on a tethered crypto or even side-stepped crypto altogether.  Bottom line is that while digital-cashback describes, in part, what Incent delivers, we feel that characterizing Incent in these terms is unhelpfully limiting.  RW.   ",False

BitScan acts as primary broker and charges a small fee, and takes care of sending the Incent to the customer - the merchant doesn't have to handle crypto at all.

What's most likely going to happen is people are going to realize what you are creating as more and more of these types of announcements get released, with far larger clients than this. Then those people will be scrambling to buy but at higher prices than we are now.  I've invested in around 15 ICOs over the last 3 years. I've made a profit in EVERYONE. The reason - I do my homework.  And this ICO is one of the most no-brainer ones I've ever invested in.

To the second: the customer is getting a reward, essentially for nothing. Incent is structured in such a way that its value should rise in the medium-term, which might actually make it an attractive investment to hold for customers as well as a means of payment. In the short term, they understand that this is the deal, that the value may fluctuate somewhat (and is displayed in their app in fiat terms, as well as Incent), but that they received it as a 'gift' and so any fluctuation comes at zero risk to themselves.  Probably not all will be satisfied with this. But, like present loyalty points, they can always opt not to accept them if they don't like the idea.",False

How it will be realized? How and at the expense of what its should rise?  Once the big whale sells in the market by 100000 INCENT one order which he received at a discount 140% during your pre-sale (example). The price falls for 240%, people buy it cheap at this time at the exchange. Then they come to my shop of the equipment, and they say we want a discount according to your loyalty program for our cheap INCENT.  And I bought INCENT and extended among the clients at the price much above that which became now. It means that I will incur losses.

Firstly, there are a relatively small number of early investors, who have a vested interest in the project succeeding (and not dumping the market). Secondly, coins with poor distribution are far more susceptible to pump and dump; coins with good distribution are far less vulnerable. Thirdly, there will be a period before go-live with merchants where we can see how the market treats Incent and quirks of distribution can be worked out. Fourthly, any fluctuations in the underlying market have to be seen in the context of additional and ongoing buy-pressure from merchants. Lastly, BitScan will act as primary broker. They will serve a market-making function to add liquidity to the market and ensure orders are fulfilled.  No merchants incur losses: Incent is can be considered a form of parallel money. If the currency is worth less (which may happen, especially on the short-term timescale) you don't lose out. Customers could equally decide to spend the money elsewhere. This is actually one of the great strengths of Incent, that the merchants we've spoken to have loved: there's an up-front cost, but it's known and controllable. There's no forward liability, which is a problem with loyalty schemes as they currently exist.",False

I don't post it to spam you, but as I get more practiced at talking about what has taken us so long to craft, I feel like Im getting better at tightening the language and expressing myself.  Anyway, you be the judge...  Other Dude: Rob can I ask you some questions?  Me: Sure!  Other Dude: How did you get involved in Bitcoin?  Me: I bought my first bitcoins in the Spring of 2013 and BitScan was founded that summer, with the mission of promoting bitcoin adoption through commerce. We launched our first product, a bitcoin merchant directory in the Spring of 2014 and have been building on that ever since.  Other Dude: How has the product evolved since?  Me: So what started as a directory, now incorporates a full e-commerce marketplace where merchants can lodge, market and take payment for their products in Bitcoin, any Shapeshift supported altcoin or even fiat. It includes a unique reputation system and in-platform messaging, incorporates cutting edge Instant search functionality and is built on Google’s Firebase. It’s a pretty Rolls Royce stack to be honest!  Other Dude: So what have you learned in the process?  Me: (Laughing) Well, what we took a long time to accept is what you would read on Page 1 of any startup guide; namely that your product must be focussed on solving a problem that people need solving! We built something really cool but it wasn’t solving a problem that enough merchants were facing to make it a business. We built it because we knew bitcoin needed it without stopping to consider whether mainstream merchants actually wanted what we were building. It seems simple to see from 2016 but you have to bear in mind that for a long time all of bitcoin was chasing mainstream merchant adoption.  Other Dude: Has the experience informed your latest project?  Me: You bet! Incent gets right at a problem that mainstream commerce is desperate to tackle. Namely, how to encourage greater repeat custom from an expanded consumer base, without selling the farm to Google and your Loyalty-as-a-Service provider.  And you would be staggered at the difference targeting a real problem has made. Having spent 3 years virtually pleading merchants to give our platform a try, the conversations are very, very, different when you have a product with the potential to attack genuine pain points and give your prospects a competitive edge in the market.  Other Dude: So, how will Incent help mainstream merchants?  Me: It will enable them to offer way more value as reward for custom for way less cost than is currently possible (with existing loyalty-reward schemes). Way more value because the customer will be rewarded with a digital commodity that has the utility and portability that all crypto-enthusiasts appreciate, plus the potential to rise in value. Less Cost because set-up costs are negligible, accounting infrastructure is outsourced to the Blockchain and because the reward can be redeemed beyond the ‘walled garden’ of the issuing merchant, there is no forward tax liability - as is the case with all ‘plastic money’ schemes. Better and cheaper is a pretty compelling value proposition - as we are learning.  Other Dude: And how does Incent fit into BitScan’s original mission?  Me: It chimes precisely with what we originally set out to do - only way better. Consider for a moment that every new merchant operator of Incent will be putting crypto currency into the pocket of every customer, at every transaction thereafter. Without mainstream consumers thinking about it, they will experience the benefits of crypto-currency, and mainstream merchants will be paying for them to do so, because of the value it adds to their own businesses.  In the meantime, all  holders of Incent are likely to enjoy the impact of enduring and growing demand on a market of finite supply.  With Incent, everybody wins and we think that’s pretty huge...

We are wrapping our heads around the system and want to make sure to represent it well. I've been heads down in the info packet and talking to colleagues.  [8:48]  So here's a couple things we think are true. Please make sure we have them right :smiley: 1. There is a set amount of incent tokens--no more are created. When the WP or info packet says ""issuance"" it means Bitscan releases them from reserves, not creates new tokens.  [8:49]  2. When a merchant enters the network, s/he decides on a percentage amount of the sale that will be given to the consumer as a reward. Presumably, there are limits on this e.g. the merchant can't choose you to give 100% of the sale back in the form of tokens, but the merchant can choose an amount. The merchant must also start taking tokens as a form of payment.  rob [8:50 AM]  Hi Guys, so to your questions:  [8:51]  1. Correct.  scresearch [8:51 AM]  3. Presumably, goods are priced in the fiat equivalent of tokens (lest the merchant must constantly update token prices as it fluctuates)  rob [8:52 AM]  2. As we have coded it right now a merchant could issue 100% of a transaction value back to the customer in Incent.  [8:52]  A merchant can also adjust the % discount against Incent redeemed against a purchase  scresearch [8:53 AM]  @rob thanks for the responses! re: 2 - does that mean the merchant must buy the tokens from Bitscan? (otherwise, isn't there an incentive to issue as many as possible)  rob [8:54 AM]  BUT in neither case is the merchant required to handle or account for Incent. We issue and settle on their behalf as primary broker. Unless they wish otherwise we always settle with the merchant in local tender (edited)  [8:55]  3. The goods and services are always priced in local tender  scresearch [8:56 AM]  re: 3 - that makes sense, so the merchant doesn't need to worry about the value of the incent token at all  rob [8:57 AM]  re: 2. That's exactly what happens: BitScan issues Incent at the P-O-S as instructed by the merchant and the fiat equivalent of what we issue is re-directed to our bank in settlement.  [8:58]  re: 3 - Correct. Its Blockchain under the bonnet. The aim is to be very low drag.  [8:58]  TBH this goes for the consumer too. Their tokens are represented as value in the tender of their choice.  scresearch [8:59 AM]  ok, re: 2. That what prevents merchant fraud or runaway token issuance - they bear the cost of issuing the token  rob [9:00 AM]  Correct, and this happens programatically.  scresearch [9:01 AM]  if the merchant tokens are all fungible, does that make this more of a network loyalty program rather than a merchant loyalty program?  [9:01]  if the token issued by one merchant is redeemable by any merchant in the network  rob [9:02 AM]  Its what gives us to the confidence to issue tokens on their behalf, then reflect that demand back into the secondary market by buying tokens we just issued back out of circulation. WE KNOW THE MERCHANT REMITTANCE IS ON THE WAY.  scresearch [9:02 AM]  exactly  rob [9:04 AM]  Re yr last: I guess, but we are happy for this to be merchant configurable. In the case of a corporate that wants to protect an eco-system we will show their customers whatever they want us to.  scresearch [9:05 AM]  but the merchant can't issue a token redeemable only at their business, like a 'colored token'  [9:05]  ah, unless it's enterprise level perhaps  rob [9:06 AM]  More generally, however, our aim is to move them away from the thesis that their is value in restricting reward utility and portability, to one that that recognises the impact of openness on reward value, and leverages this as the means of encouraging repeat custom  [9:06]  Right.  scresearch [9:07 AM]  will the merchant be able to choose which currencies trigger the token issuance? (e.g. BTC, fiat) or is it restricted to cryptocurrency POS?  rob [9:07 AM]  TBH is all about moving the dialogue away from the tokens and towards the concept of value  [9:08]  Actually, it will be fiat.  [9:08]  That's what we have coded. The MVP assumes a mainstream consumer will, in the first instance, always pay in fiat  scresearch [9:09 AM]  so would the 2.5% commission be on top of the cc fees merchants pay in POS fiat?  rob [9:09 AM]  Once they are in possession of reward value they can settle any portion of a future transaction with a mixture of Incent and fiat  [9:10]  Yes. Our commission only applies to the rewarded fraction of the purchase or redemption  scresearch [9:10 AM]  yeah, I like the paradigm shift. There have been some very successful experiments with local currencies based on similar principles. Restricting a money supply does not equal an increase in value.  [9:10]  ah, that makes sense  rob [9:11 AM]  Good!  scresearch [9:15 AM]  and to confirm, there is no utility to the tokens, they are purely a payment mechanism (and more accurately, a payment rail if merchant and customer only see the value of their token holdings)  rob [9:17 AM]  Not sure what you mean by 'no utility'  scresearch [9:18 AM]  Is it fair to say the following? In this kind of loyalty program, merchants are purchasing $1 worth of loyalty tokens in the belief that as the network grows, this will become $1+ worth of tokens that customers want to spend in the network. This appreciation in value makes it different from a discount program, in which a merchant would give back $1 but know that the $1 will only remain $1.  [9:20]  as in, holding them doesn't confer additional value. Having 100 tokens gives me a free upgrade for a coffee. Or I can redeem 100 tokens for exclusive goods and services that fiat currencies can't buy. It is intended as a payment currency, just like BTC.  [9:21]  @rob appreciate the responses, by the way. We're putting Incent up on our site (smithandcrown.com), just want to make sure we fully get the value proposition right. Lots of ICOs going up these days too.  rob [9:21 AM]  token value really makes no difference to the merchant in the way you are characterising it. They never hold it and we do the conversation at the POS in both directions  scresearch [9:22 AM]  right. I suppose we're trying to understand why a merchant would want to sign up if there's an additional 2.5% (not on the entire sale, just the issuing token). Why part with $1 in order to give the customer $1 worth of tokens?  rob [9:23 AM]  The value proposition for the merchant, as we see it, as that for little expense he is able to incentivise behavior he values with a reward so valuable, relatively, to conventional options, that customers will return to him because they want more of this value.  [9:24]  And that's the Q. This product is pay as you go loyalty. A merchant is paying forward (or sacrificing margin) for the benefit of establishing an enduring digital connection with his customers  scresearch [9:25 AM]  in this context, the behavior he is incentivizing is buying the merchant's goods, and the customers come back in order to get more of those goods or spend the reward the merchant gave them.  rob [9:25 AM]  You's be surprised how many regard this as a refreshing change when viewed against the infrastructure and accounting overhead, and forward tax liabilities that characterise traditional schemes.  scresearch [9:26 AM]  isn't the digital connection weakened if the token can be redeemed with another merchant? Or will the UX link the merchant with customer is some other way.  [9:26]  yeah, I think you understand the payment processing business quite deeply--and that industry is far more complex than people think.  rob [9:27 AM]  ultimately the UX is configurable. But remember, by opening our consumer optionality a merchant gets to cross market to eveyone else's customers. Think, instant coalition.  [9:30]  *our s/be up  scresearch [9:31 AM]  and because the market value fluctuates (facilitated by Bitscan, but with supply/demand forces driven by  merchant adoption and token redemption), a consumer could even choose to speculate on the token. If they acquire a token, it could increase in value over time if demand for it increased.  rob [9:33 AM]  Yes. We obvs have to be really careful with that claim but noting that this token only has one function and is finite in supply, more and more demand is - all other things being equal - likely to make nice things happen to price.  scresearch [9:35 AM]  yeah, ok that makes sense. Relative to traditional programs, this has the advantage of not creating future liability, not needing to design a loyalty scheme, and being more user-friendly to customers (though, it does involve more up-front costs because the merchant pays and it means the merchant issues something that could be spent by another merchant). Based on your experience in the industry though, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.  rob [9:35 AM]  I like the idea of having mainstream merchants pay to put an appreciating asset in the pockets of mainstream consumers. I cannot think of a more powerful tool in cryptos journey 'across the chasm'  scresearch [9:37 AM]  and relative to a cash-back scheme, it has the advantage of attracting customers who can speculate and creates a more intimate connection (token that is part of a network that both customer and merchant are part of). It shares the property of involving up-front costs, but if customers have faith in the network, they want to acquire a token that might be worth more in the future.  rob [9:38 AM]  Absolutely. In the worst case the merchant has left a very good impression on a customer that never returns - which would be strange. in the best they do return and he/she has a customer for life at negligible cost.  scresearch [9:38 AM]  yeah, well put. And introduces a system that uses cryptocurrency as a rail but not necessarily a user experience  rob [9:38 AM]  I prefer the term save than speculate - but accept that this is semantics.  [9:38]  Right  scresearch [9:40 AM]  and I would imagine market research supports that customers probably tend to redeem their points at issuing merchants if the points aren't *universally* accepted as currency (different than a cashback program that a company like chase might run with retailers)  rob [9:40 AM]  In the first world ordinary people have no mechanism to save. ZIRP has killed the concept.  scresearch [9:41 AM]  they should invest it in crypto :slightly_smiling_face:  rob [9:42 AM]  Traditional loyalty has a huge interest in promoting the fact that this restrictive paradigm is successful. The only really successful loyalty scheme in existence, and the unused plastic in our wallets, proves that this is a weak proposition.  [9:43]  And by 'really successful loyalty scheme' I'm referring to Air Miles - which have real value to consumers because of..... drum roll please.... their portability.  [9:43]  !!!  Really helping me to step through the value proposition on offer...  RW.",False

To finalize the comparisons, this is different from a cc reward program too because in that, the merchant is effectively commodified. It doesn't cost him anything in the short-term or the long-term. But the loyalty is really with the cc, not the merchant.  rob [9:49 AM]  Right - Incent is about bringing that same proposition to everyone else. And when you do this, all sorts of other sectors open up that traditional loyalty couldn't reach.  [9:50]  Right.  scresearch [9:50 AM]  an interesting - is there an example of that last statement? (other sectors?)  rob [9:51 AM]  Although there is no reason why a CC couldn't integrate Incent. Imagine that, the old world banks distibuting crypto to the masses. How sweet would that be?!  [9:53]  Lots. An airline that wants to incentivise operational feedback from its employees. An online seller. A wholesaler working B2B. Any entity that wants to erect an ecosystem around preffered partners...  [9:57]  ...consumer surveys, mom+pop shops, writers...  [9:57]  you get the picture. Remove the infrastructure barriers and the accounting liability, and everyone can play.  [9:58]  So Matt, do you have what you need?  scresearch [9:58 AM]  interesting: "" Any entity that wants to erect an ecosystem around preffered partners""  [9:59]  but the ecosystem is the entire merchant network (unless they are enterprise level and define their own)  [9:59]  other than the last question, yes, really appreciate the one-on-one AMA :smiley: I'll email/post once our post goes up.  rob [10:01 AM]  Right. An entity can define what their eco-system see without undermining the integrity of the concept or the value of Incent to others whose business aims predicate a different degree of openness.  scresearch [10:01 AM]  wouldn't they need their own token then?  rob [10:02 AM]  No. Remember, its not about the token, that's just the fuel. Its about the value the token represents.  scresearch [10:03 AM]  but if the idea is that the value is exchangeable anywhere, how would y ou distinguish between value in different ecosystems  [10:04]  if merchants A - J want to reward customers for shopping at merchants A - J, how do they ensure the value of their rewards can't also be redeemed with merchant H, even if merchant H is on the network?  rob [10:05 AM]  Whether or not an entity decides to make the whole enchillada visible to their customers, the volume of the business they create still supports the secondary market. (edited)  [10:08]  From a business dev perspective, presenting commerce with a fait accompli (like 'this must be totally open') doesn't work. They have to be presented with options.  Remember, the more open they are in the configuration of their wallet, the more value the reward will have to their customers.  scresearch [10:08 AM]  by ""whole enchillada"" you mean all of their products available through token redemption  rob [10:09 AM]  To your specific point, if merchants A-C opt for a restrictive approach, they are likely to have their lunch eaten by more open minded merchants D-F, whose customer wallets allow them to see everything.  [10:10]  By whole enchillada, I mean everyone's products  [10:13]  Lets say merchant A only wants his customers to be able to see his goods and services in their wallet. Thats fair enough. Thats all his customers will see. Their assumption is likely to be that this is the extent of their rewards utility.  [10:15]  Meanwhile Merchant B is happy for his customers to see everything that everyone is offering for sale in their wallet. The value of their reward just went up meaningfully. They might well, as a result, redeem it elsewhere but they also know that they can get more of it from Merchant B.  scresearch [10:15 AM]  now I see what you're saying: the merchants contribute to the secondary market for the tokens  [10:16]  so Merchant A couldn't make the token not redeemable at Merchant B  [10:16]  but Merchant A could make more of their products available  rob [10:17 AM]  Right, so Merchant A is still contributing to the strength of the secondary market, every time somebody buys something from him - but our argument would be that by being restrictive, the value of the reward he is distributing to his customers is way less than Merchant B, who is likely to be rewarded with greater repeat custom from a greater customer base - because of their openness.  scresearch [10:18 AM]  (also, do you have KYC for your customers? I know loyalty programs do help give merchants data about their customers--and an avenue for outreach. Will that be a part of this?)  rob [10:18 AM]  So we give everyone the optionality and let the market do the rest.  [10:19]  KYC for merchants.

Buy pressure from new merchants will place increased demand on a scarce resource, so as more businesses come on board, customers and investors will see the value of their Incent rise.  ICOO will enable the community to trade these tokens on OpenLedger while the ICO is still live. In this way, ICOO will help the Incent crowdfund reach its target by buying tokens for BTC to trade against other currencies on OpenLedger. ICOO will also be providing advertising services to ensure Incent’s crowdfund is a success!

So they need Incent on-hand to send out, which they will then replenish when the funds arrive from the merchant.

Finally we replenish our reserve of BTC once cash settlement arrives from the merchant. This is our transaction cycle, which leaves the consumer with digital value, the secondary market with new demand for Incent and us made whole by the merchant issuer and ready to go again; rinse and repeat.  To your first point, Incent really starts to make sense as a reward if it appreciates in value over time. This is achieved through focusing the combined, ongoing, demand of merchant partners onto the secondary market of the asset which has no other significant economic forces acting on it.  Were we to use bitcoin, there are too many other demand and supply impulses at play, to ensure that the demand of our merchant partners had the impact we would wish it too.  To your final point, I cannot provide you with specific partner names yet because nothing is inked-in and I do not want to compromise active conversations; I'm sure you appreciate this. What I can say is that commercial interest is significant here in Australia, in UK and the US, particularly with commercial entities seeking to build or protect an eco-system that binds in their commercial partners.  There's more info on the site and if you join our slack channel we can have a more detailed conversation. For the time being, thanks for your interest in our project.  RW.",False

Total supply will be determined by the amount of Incent sold during our forthcoming ICO. On completion of the ICO, 2 x the amount of Incent sold will be mined into existence. This will be the total supply of Incent.  Half of this total will be distributed to ICO buyers. The other half will be held in reserve to facilitate execution of our Primary Brokerage function. In material terms this will guarantee market liquidity and stability. Specifically it will ensure:  1. Near instant settlement with consumers, on reward issuance and merchants, on redemption. 2. That all new demand is promptly fed into the secondary market, bringing circulation back into balance. 3. That the market can be supported at any time, to the advantage of all holders of Incent.

It's the first blockchain-based universal loyalty programme that is backed by merchants. This actually completely changes the economics of loyalty from the traditional loyalty sector - will post some articles about this in due course. Essentially, though, it means that customers are rewarded with something that is genuinely rewarding: points that increase in value all the time, and can be held as an investment or spent with merchants as required. It's a bit like the difference between central banks printing fiat money (regular rewards, which are just issued by businesses and redeemed when required) and gold (which has limited supply and has to be bought). We think this is a really exciting concept for merchants, customers and investors because it totally changes the goal posts for the loyalty sector.",False

We've built all the infrastructure that you will need as the merchant, to configure, monitor and optimize your program by product, range or inventory.  We just install a simple plug-in at your p-o-s, and your customers get their reward delivered to a wallet, near instantly, at the moment of transaction and its represented to them as value in the local currency of their choice. The only information you'll need from them is a contact email or cell phone number, so its very low drag for you and them.  Every time somebody makes a purchase from you, their cell buzzes and they follow the link to claim their reward value - which has all the benefits of crypto thereafter.  Also, embedded in their wallet app will be all the products and services you want to market to them, which they can pay or part for with their reward value. You'll have established a permanent digital link with them that they are motivated to open - so you'll be able to slash your SEO spend too.  And all of a sudden all your customers are owners and users of crypto without necessarily knowing it. But as is usually the case, once they see how much better it is, they'll want more of it and they'll come and spend more with you as a result",False

As part of our mandate to support market integrity through market-making and to enable merchants to issue and redeem Incent in good order, BitScan will be maintaining a Reserve of bitcoin and Incent. Ultimately, the reason for this is very simple:  Fiat payments from merchants are subject to a lag, whilst cryptocurrency payments need to be settled instantly at the point-of sale.   The Reserve will allow us to 'arbitrage' funds at the point of purchase, sending customers their Incent immediately  Thus BitScan must have the capacity to remit funds immediately to the customer and merchant to avoid the unacceptable delays that would otherwise be involved.  On issuance: When a customer makes a purchase with a credit card and the merchant’s PoS instructs BitScan to send Incent to their account, this needs to happen immediately for the commercial impact of the reward to be maximised; whereas the fiat settlement funds, sent by the merchant after the fact to pay for the Incent issued, take 2-4 days to process. BitScan therefore needs a reserve of Incent to send to the customer as soon as the instruction is received. BitScan also needs a reserve of BTC which is deployed in response to new Incent issuance, to buy the corresponding amount of Incent at market rates. This has the impact of driving demand and rebalancing circulation of Incent. Finally, when cash funds are received to BitScan’s bank they are converted to replenish the Reserve with BTC - and the cycle repeats.  On redemption: When a customer pays a merchant with Incent, BitScan processes both order and transaction, settling with the merchant in cash and subsequently selling the Incent received at market rates to replenish the Reserve. Of note, any redemption for a product or service attracting a discount for Incent triggers a new issuance cycle which ensures that net demand always trumps net supply.  Maintenance of a reserve is therefore critical, as it enables BitScan to acts as a market-maker and assure liquidity, while promoting enduring appreciation of the asset through maintenance of stable circulation. We recognise that such a model is unusual in the cryptocurrency world, where issuance is typically algorithmic and large pre-mines are viewed with scepticism. However, mining new Incent on a pre-set schedule would take no account of variances in demand for the token following product launch. A pre-set schedule that makes no allowances for market conditions risks placing supply pressure on price, with the resultant price volatility undermining our objective of a stable and liquid digital asset whose value appreciates steadily.  Rather than being a liability for Incent, we therefore consider the presence of a reserve and market-maker essential for Incent to have enduring value to consumers, merchants and anyone holding it as a store of value.  In recognition of and in order to reward the additional trust that this facet of our offering represents, profit deriving from market making operations will be shared 50/50 with the Incent holding community, in the form of a dividend distributed on a pro-rata basis, on the first day of every other (even) month.  Reserve tokens, bitcoin and cash will be held in secure, offline accounts, with only an operating balance of crypto held on-exchange as required to perform this critical market-making function.",False

Over the past two-and-a-half years since Incent’s launch, loyalty has emerged as a major use case for blockchain technology, offering efficiencies and entirely new business models. It is an open secret that conventional consumer loyalty is broken, with most rewards schemes offering little value for customers and retailers alike.  Incent offers a means for ordinary consumers to save and build wealth as they go about their day-to-day spending – turning their crypto rewards into a meaningful nest egg at a time when millennials and the younger generations are struggling with debt and lack of opportunity as never before.   Flagship product launch  Incent’s flagship product is a platform with a built-in wallet that plugs into bank accounts and other services, seamlessly distributing rewards against spending and other user activity. The product enables users to receive tailored rewards from retailers, while businesses can learn more about their customers’ spending habits, allowing ordinary shoppers to monetise a valuable resource: their data.  Incent’s waiting list is currently live, with full launch scheduled for July 2019. Consumers will be rewarded in Incent tokens, bought from the open market, on every spend they make. To sign up to the waiting list or find out more, visit www.incent.com.     In 2018 Incent launched its Ingage technology, which uses drop-codes to enable audiences to access rewards in real-time. A successful trial was conducted with eSports company Gfinity and is currently in further development.  Frictionless tech  Incent’s advantages are built on two key technologies.  1. Blockchain. As a token hosted on the Waves platform, Incent can be transferred, traded or held independently of any third parties – unlike conventional rewards, which are carefully controlled by their issuing companies. (For everyday users, the AUSTRAC-registered and patent-pending Incent platform offers a simple and convenient way to access their rewards.)  2. Incent’s custom-built InSync technology offers users the ability to sync their bank accounts in a similar way to mainstream accounting software and mobile phone banking apps. The upshot is that issuance of rewards against purchases can be absolutely seamless, with crypto points automatically credited to the customer’s Incent account.

Strange name, you do understand people will call your coin incest right?  I still remember the phase about a year and a half ago when ICO's were trying to get 80-100 at a go. Look at the latest ICO announcements, everyone wants at least 10000BTC, 30k max ... I mean $5.000.000 for what? Sorry for this criticism, I must admit at least you show your faces here (?). I just have a special relationship with ICOs. Think. If it's hard to make, it'll take forever to do. If it's easy to make, why didn't you do it for free and sell the tech afterwards, or just give it away for free as one guy once did? ...",False
