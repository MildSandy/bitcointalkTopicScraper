Firstly, we are not totally blockchain related, albeit we make use of blockchain technology for making ICO possible, and that we have future plan to marry up blockchain with ecommerce. This, in all honestly makes me worried that our ICO will not be well perceived  bybte crypto communities, possibly being deemed not sexy enough.  However, after speaking to our blockchain specialists, including Pranav Burnwal, who is the Region Head of Blockchain Education Network (an NGO) and Justin Leung of OKEX, we were encouraged by the fact that we are already better than 90% of the ICO's out there, which are at best only remains at conceptual stage with no MVP (minimum viable product). Worse: many of them dont even have a hard cap and valuation are well over the moon. Worst: some of them are even scammy, which is exactly why they can outspend everyone (since they have very little other costs). For example, a recent air travel related payment solution on blockchain, whose ads are everywhere until recently.  So afterall, we are more confident now, despite there's still some iffiness felt, but we will know soon since our ICO presale starts tomorrow. Oh well, there are still some reasons for optimism since how many can boast the following reasons to potential backers:   Why Us? Here are our 10 Reasons!  1.      We are a Good and Committed Team. •        The management team has over 20 years of experience in global ecommerce. •        Half of the company, including all top management, are company shareholders. As they say, money is where the heart is.  2.      We have Solid and Impressive Tractions. •        Reached nearly 2MUSD monthly sales within 1st year of operation. •        Presence in more than 20 countries, and more under development.  3.      We are in a Sizable and yet Fast-growing Market. •        Current market size of just refurbished phones alone is 20BN USD, destined to exceed 30BN USD in 2020. •        Double digital percentage growth year-on-year on refurbished electronics market. Cross-border ecommerce too.  4.      We have a Clear Path to Scale Future Heights •        We will evolve into a Hybrid B2B/B2C refurbished electronics marketplace from our current direct B2C model with emphasis on phones mainly. •        We will test the concept of marrying up blockchain and ecommerce, and could go for a next mega ICO round.  5.      We have Clear Missions and Visions. •        To exceed 1BN USD revenue within 5 years and become the market leader in refurbished electronics •        To encourage recycling and help the world go green.  6.

Special ‘Guanxi’ makes this happen. •        -We have full suite of ecommerce solutions, including global logistics solutions, e-Marketing, ERP/ecommerce integration and etc, to ensure sustainability and scalability.  7.      We give you Credibility and Transparency. •        Our team of credible advisors tell you about our credibility. •        Eccommerce itself is very much a transparent business with readily traffic figures and complete sales trails.  8.

We give you Potentially Great Returns. •        Refer to our whitepaper for a full returns analysis and projection. Returns would even be higher if we received your full support.  10.   We are Always Learning and We Never Give Up. •        The former is demonstrated by the fact that while blockchain and ICO is new to us, we quickly rise to its challenges and organise this campaign; The latter? We will not stop asking for your support in order to realise our dream and share the fruits together. •        So, Please Support Us!  PS.

The past five years saw a 65% yearly growth rate in mobile phone use within the continent, which, for perspective, is double the global annual average. That accounts for some 960 million mobile subscriptions in the continent. At present, the African smartphone market is also growing twice as much as Asia’s, with recent forecasts indicating as much as 300 million users by 2020.  The dramatic growth in smartphone adoption has consequently driven smartphone sales up, with more than 200 million units shipped in 2016 — more than a 10% increase from the previous year’s figures. The reason? Smartphones are proving to be a more cost-effective communications alternative to traditional fixed-line phones. A primary driver to adoption is internet access, traditionally achieved only in Africa via a personal computer.  Environmental and economic barriers such as warfare, natural disasters, and the low income of its populations have made stringing up phone wires nearly impossible across Africa. In contrast, erecting masts for mobile networks have proven to be more economically viable. And as the average selling price (ASP) continues to plummet in response to increased demand, millions more are expected to be smartphone subscribers by the end of the decade.  Nigeria’s Smartphone Market Has the Best Prospects for Growth  In general, Africa’s major economies have experienced a dramatic intensity in smartphone penetration in recent years. In particular, South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt and Kenya have had rapidly expanding smartphone markets in the last five years. But of them all, Nigeria has experienced the most growth regarding penetration rate (averaging at 81%) and increase in mobile subscribers, which reached 150 million this year.  This 150 million figure accounts for around 35% of the country’s current population and roughly 15% of Africa’s total mobile subscriptions as of 2017. Concerning market potential, Nigeria has 62.2 million more internet subscribers and 52.1 million more users than Egypt, as well as 65.3 million and 110.78 internet and mobile users than Kenya, respectively. If current trends continue, shipments of new smartphones to Nigeria are expected to increase as much as 60% in 2020, effectively making Nigeria the largest smartphone market in Africa, and one with the most potential as a growing market for GSM phones.  Barriers to Penetration and Price as the Primary Adoption Factor  Despite the unprecedented growth of the smartphone market in Africa, there are various barriers to smartphone adoption in the continent, such as the lack of electricity and a relative dearth of telecom infrastructures in general. But perhaps the most significant barrier is poverty, which has a direct impact on the purchasing power of Africa’s populations. Nigeria, for one, and despite its booming economy, is still rife with low-income households, mirroring the trend across the entire region.  This explains a few things: 1) the marginal market share of brand-new iPhones in Africa; 2) the popularity of lower-priced brands like Samsung; 3) price becoming even more significant as a factor when purchasing phones. As a recent Quartz article remarked, “Price competitiveness has become a key issue in many African markets… To grow significantly in these markets, vendors have to be able to address the continent’s large low-income population by providing phones that are priced very competitively.”  Forecast: Continued Growth for Online Retail and Immense Market Potential for Used Phones  Online retail has also experienced a boom in Nigeria and other countries in Africa, a response, in part, to the growth of internet subscribers. Jumia, Nigeria’s largest online retailer, reports that the increase in demand has driven their ASPs down, from $216 in 2014 to just $117 this year. The company also notes that its sales grew by 394% over the same period.  Given all these, there appear to be significant market opportunities for used smartphone retailers in Nigeria in particular, and Africa in general, specifically in the following ways:  · As mobile telecom infrastructure grows, the market share of online smartphone retailers is set to increase;  · As price continues to dominate purchase considerations, demand for cheaper but feature-rich GSM alternatives will continue to rise;  · Refurbished iPhone retailers can cater to the current gap in Apple product sales, and could compete with ASPs of established retailers;  · Used phone retailers can also sell refurbished versions of popular brands in the region, like Samsung, which currently ranks first as the most traded phone in Africa;  · Africa’s second-hand market is virtually untapped despite the demand and the infrastructure being present, meaning immense revenue potential for initial traders in the market.  In particular, Nigeria’s current market conditions make it the most viable market for used smartphones in Africa.
