The platform includes a wallet for you to manage your identity and personal data as well as a marketplace where you can sell your information and activity to digital marketers.  The team is filled with blockchain experts and has already formed partnerships with the Swiss government. Although VALID is yet available, it’s a piece of the already established product, Procivis.  Risks     Unclear revenue model. As a non-profit, VALID is not motivated to make a significant amount of money or increase the token value. In fact, part of the token allocations is slotted to keep prices under control. (-4)     Empty Github. The Github repository has barely any commits with the last bit of activity almost two weeks ago. The project should have more active development. (-2)     No product yet. Any project without a working product and users is inherently risky. (-2)  Growth Potential     Strong team. The team is 24 members and advisors strong with expertise in a range of relevant fields. (+5)     Sold out pre-sale. Selling out the pre-sale is a solid sign that there are others that stand by the vision of the project and believe in the team. (+4)     Government partnerships.

(+6)  Disposition VALID receives an average score of 7 out of 10. Even though the idea seems valuable, as a non-profit, it doesn’t look as if the team is motivated to increase the value of the token.

The backbone of VALID is Procivis AG, a company that is working on government-trusted digital identity solutions since 2016. Providing real trusted identities has been our focus ever since. That’s why the Swiss Canton of Schaffhausen is also running a pilot project with us (see in detail).  Furthermore, Procivis has a full pipeline of international projects that will be announced in due course.  The marketplace is only one aspect of the VALID ecosystem. Besides of being able to sell our aggregated data, you can also use VALID to securely and seamlessly authenticate yourself.  Another aspect is: With the GDPR regulation coming, every company that is active in the EU has to hand over all the data they collect of you in a machine-readable form, if requested to do so. That means from May 2018 on every person in the EU can own and use their data in their own way. (in detail analysis of GDPR)  VALID will provide the tool, with just a few clicks, for users to request their data from corporations that are processing and collecting it, thereby allowing them to resell onwards.",False

Our current client decided not to use this blockchain functionality currently for the pilot, since the project is in a very early stage. Data protection is a serious topic in Switzerland and therefore the client wanted to be able to control the pilot environment for now.  As with every new technology institutions first need to gather experience to gain confidence for next steps.  With VALID’s solution we are also working on a approach where the data stays on your device and the timestamped hash of it (as a claim of validity) is on the blockchain.

The marketplace is one of the aspects and it's optional to monetize your own data.  Through the GDPR regulation the services also have to provide your data in a machine readable format. Which will make it easier in the future i.e. to import your collected data to your VALID wallet.  For further reading our legal analyst Krzysztof Adam Gorski has written an interesting piece about ""the winners and losers of GDPR"": https://blog.valid.global/the-winners-and-losers-of-gdpr-be86f2179cac  The other two aspects of VALID wallet are: 1) Authentication (as stated correctly in your first statement) and 2) Safeguard: The state-of-the-art encryption to protect your data.   Regarding ""who would be interested"": There are several use cases. As Krzysztof writes in his very first sentence ""Personal data is the commodity of the 21st century."" or as the World Economic Forum calls it ""a new asset class"" (source) you can think of how much our data is valued by i.e. marketers. Another use case could also be your anonymized data for surveys and research. With all your data that you create every second of the day and you as the beneficiary if this data gets used, there might even be the case of a ""digital basic income"" in the future: https://blog.valid.global/claim-your-digital-basic-income-cdf3f1d84c7",False
