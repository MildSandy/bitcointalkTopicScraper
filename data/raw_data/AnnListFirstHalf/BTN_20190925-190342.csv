To facilitate transactions of data and of their proprietary BTRN token, and to host smart contracts between data providers (our users) and data customers.  To reduce the significant investment in infrastructure Biotron decided to seek a partnership with an existing blockchain solution. The sheer volume of transactions and smart contracts (required to provide customers with Biotron’s analytics products) meant that solutions such as Ethereum, Multichain, Waves, and Ark, would not be sufficient. Of these blockchains, only Ethereum is capable of handling smart contracts in limited amounts. However, their transactions are expensive and the blockchain is notoriously slow.  “When deciding on a blockchain, we needed to think about how our analytics could be easily assimilated into an organisations’ existing ecosystem too.” – Pavol Magic, CEO  Biotron sought a partner with an organisation that was just as business focussed as their data analytics’ solution. One that understands how they are using analytics to drive business decision making; and in turn, how businesses will use those analytics.

The result will be the same. Of course, you will attract a lot of users. At the same time, the price of tokens will fall dramatically. If 35% of tokens will be sold 6/7 (for simplicity of calculation we will take such a very good sales result), then the remaining 5% of unsold tokens will be transferred to the fund for attracting users. Then it will be no longer 25%, but 30% of tokens. Exactly the same amount as will be sold to investors. This already means a fall in the price of tokens by half.  Since you have not yet made a final decision on some issues, I suggest also consider this option: Reduce this fund to attract users to 5% of tokens and hold a bounty company for these funds. Transfer 20% of tokens for sale to investors. Then for sale there will be 55% of tokens.
