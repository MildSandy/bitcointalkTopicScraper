The value proposition for institutions to purchase STACS for its utility is the need to stake STACS in order to participate in the network. Institutions will be able to run nodes and validate transactions. This in itself, by way of staking will lead to a lower velocity coupled with high demand due to the incentives gained by staking.  Also, please see this message from the GBX CEO, Kurt Looyens. ""Dynamics of institutional sign up are clearly (and logically) different from our retail set up. The process takes longer and has a lot more depth. Having said that, we are making progress. All developments on the side of GSX and the STACS protocol are an obvious support.

We have some interesting developments that will further enhance the user experience in the pipeline, and as always, our community will be the first to know. We champion our core values of institutional-grade standards, the fact we are licensed and regulated, coupled with the safety of our clients assets as a top priority, through our insured, multi-sig, cold wallet operations. All those elements are key to a strong foundation for our long-term success, but our focus must now be on user adoption and experience, watch for updates concerning this endeavour soon.  Our community, as part of our journey, have offered tremendous support to the GBX, and wider GSX Group. They have shared our content, registered accounts, visited our stands at events and even visited our offices (i’m looking at you, @Wtiger1 & @Sozmax!), we want our community to share in the success of the GBX, at every step of our progress. We also want to continue to grow our community, which we can do through our referrals programme (https://gbx.gi/referral-rewards-programme/), if you support our efforts, you can do so while gaining STACS rewards in return, and together we can build an exchange for the future.  Here are some key features since my last update, plus a few words from me on the future of STACS and the GSX Group (http://gsxgroup.gi/) ecosystem:  GBX-DAX listed Five Stablecoins - PAX, DAI, USDC, GUSD, TUSD  As I mentioned above, we are diligently working on providing our users with top-tier digital assets, and now we have listed some of the biggest stablecoins in the market. Stablecoins are fast becoming a highlight within the token economy, you can read more about our listings here (https://gbx.gi/news/gbx-dax-to-list-five-stablecoins/).  GSX-Group Developments and the STACS token  Since the creation of our Telegram group for GBX, our companies under GSX Group have gone from strength to strength. You may have noticed that I have talked more about areas outside of GBX, such as GSX and the STACS Network. The GSX Group, as a whole, is on the brink of some major advancements, and the STACS token, our utility token that fuels that Group ecosystem, plays a significant role in those advancements. More will be revealed when the timing is right, but I wanted to give you all a short update on some of the areas in which GSX Group has developed in recent months. I know markets are tough, and the stacs token price has been under pressure - but we see an expansion of the utility over the next few months as we build out our STACS network.  The Gibraltar Stock Exchange  Today, GSX (http://gsx.gi/) provides technical listing in debt and funds, traditional avenues which have begun to gain real traction; with our value and speed to market we are seeing much higher levels of engagement from the larger institutional players (we recently admitted a $55 bln debt program from Morgan Stanley). However, we firmly see that the future lies in the tokenisation of securities, or smart securities as we call them. In order to develop our own digital exchange, the team within our tech subsidiary Hashstacs have been working literally 24/7 to prepare the STACS technology for roll out.   I’ve mentioned before on the successful launch of a ‘demo bond (https://www.gsx.gi/article/9465/the-gibraltar-stock-exchange-gsx-uses-new-blockchain-protocol-to-deploy-demo-bond)’ on the STACS Network, we were pleased with the initial results, and we will be further developing GSX to become one of the first stock exchanges to offer digital securities in the world, more on this soon (we hope to announce something in the next week or so!)  Juno Services  Our fund administrator, Juno Services (http://juno.gi/) has seen rapid growth with a large number of client take-ons. We see Juno as a vital part of our eco-system whereby we can open companies, on board asset managers, provide immediate banking facilities in Gibraltar and of course, provide administration services to fund managers. This forms an important part of our ‘turn-key’ solution for clients, particularly as we look at facilitating ETF issuers seeking a digital solution.  HashStacs Inc.  Our technology subsidiary, Hashstacs Inc. (http://hashstacs.io/) has been working hard to develop the STACS Network and has been actively engaged with exchanges and investment banks to build out the Securities Trading Asset Classification Settlement (STACS) Network, which we believe will transform capital markets. Our dedicated team of 40+ developers have been working around the clock to prepare the technology for a full roll out. We will begin to make some strategic announcements over the next few weeks and months. Please make sure you see our STACS lite paper (https://stacs.io/images/stacslitepaper.pdf) which tells you why we think what we have built is so awesome!   Fort Capital  Fort Capital was acquired by the GSX Group this month and is a UK FCA licensed (MiFID) dealer broker. Fort is regulated to provide both arranging and dealing services to professional and retail customers for a wide range of regulated products.  Within all these companies under the GSX Group (http://gsxgroup.gi/) umbrella, the STACS (http://stacs.io/) token will become a key part of payments, unlocking discounts, rewards, early access and a host of other opportunities within each company, enhancing the tokens utility for everyone.   To give you an example of why we believe our model is so unique? Take an asset manager who wants to issue a tokenised ETF?  Subject to regulatory approval, here’s an example of  how we see what we can do:  1) Incorporate the company and set up the fund  (we do that in Juno!)  2) Administer the fund and set up the required functions (we do that in Juno!)  3) Act as licensed registrar (yes…..we do that in Juno!)  4) Open a bank account for the fund (we can do that…..)  5) Programme the smart contract using STACS (GSX will do that)  6) List the tokenised fund units on our exchange (GSX will do that)  7) Distribute the fund through our UK broker dealer (Fort Capital)  A turn-key solution for the tokenisation of an ETF! How cool is that?   GSX Group — Blockchain in Financial Services Event  We continue to push the GSX Group’s offering, hosting our own events, this time during the Asia Crypto Week, in Hong Kong. You can read more about the event, and our Executive Director Ben Soh speaking, here (https://gbx.gi/news/gsx-group%E2%80%8A-%E2%80%8Ablockchain-in-financial-services-event/).  That concludes our rather lengthy fortnightly message, I hope you have gleaned an insight into the incredible potential of our roadmap for the GSX Group, as we build a future of blockchain powered finance.

My schedule often means there aren't enough hours in the day, but I make it a point to keep you informed and take stock of the progress we have made. It is important to me that our community is kept up-to-date and a part of our journey towards a new era of blockchain powered finance.  Here is a breakdown of some of the recent happenings since my last message, plus a reflection on some of the recent events that have transpired in other countries, making news headlines. I want to emphasise the reasons why we operate the way we do, and how we have established ourselves for the long-term. Let’s get started:   1. GBX-DAX Lists Stellar (XLM)  The GBX has landed another huge opportunity for our users, with the listing of Stellar’s XLM token. The distributed payment network, Stellar, is a pioneer for user adoption in blockchain and providing a low-cost payments method to the world. You can read more about the listing, and trading pairs here:  https://gbx.gi/news/gbx-dax-goes-stellar-xlm-listing/   2. My Reflection on Security  On my travels, at events and conferences, I’m often asked why GBX? Why do licenses and regulation matter? Why is it easier to open an account on other exchanges, rather than GBX?  The recent events in Canada and New Zealand are a backdrop for my usual answer to those questions and should serve as a warning to those worried about the security of their fiat and digital assets. If you’re not worried about your digital assets, maybe you should be? Let’s look back to the incorporation of GBX - it’s a diligent process to get licensed, having to demonstrate to the regulator that we met the nine DLT principles:  I. A DLT Provider must conduct its business with honesty and integrity.  II. A DLT Provider must pay due regard to the interests and needs of each and all its customers and must communicate with its customers in a way which is fair, clear and not misleading.   III. A DLT Provider must maintain adequate financial and non-financial resources.  IV. A DLT Provider must manage and control its business effectively, and conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence; including having proper regard to risks to its business and customers.  V. A DLT Provider must have effective arrangements in place for the protection of client assets and money when it is responsible for them.  VI. A DLT Provider must have effective corporate governance arrangements.   VII. A DLT Provider must ensure that all systems and security access protocols are maintained to appropriate high standards.  VIII. A DLT Provider must have systems in place to prevent, detect and disclose financial crime risks such as money laundering and terrorist financing.  IX. A DLT Provider must be resilient and must develop contingency plans for the orderly and solvent wind down of its business.  One of the critical considerations is the security of client assets (Principle five). We had to demonstrate to the regulator and consistently show that we adhere to Principle five, ensuring our clients' assets are secure.  Here at GBX, we do everything in our power to secure our clients’ digital assets.  Firstly, almost all our assets are in deep cold-storage - permanently offline, extremely (on the verge of impossible) difficult to hack. Additionally, our deep cold-storage is multi-jurisdictional, meaning any event in one jurisdiction does not affect the other. Within our procedures, we operate a multi-sig system, with different levels of approval. We are even insured against theft. All those safeguards combined indicate how passionate we are about the security of our clients' assets. A single person should never have complete control over a company’s assets, especially clients’ assets. Our licenses and regulatory oversight makes us robust and institutional-grade, for the betterment of our clients. We have to comply with the highest levels and therefore operate at the highest levels.  An example of the highest level of regulation that we comply with - The Anti-Money Laundering Directive 5 (AMLD5) comes out in the EU in July 2019 - we’re already compliant.  An update to the Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA)  comes into effect in July 2019, GBX already complies with its standards.  At GBX, and as a wider GSX Group, we believe that the protection of our clients’ assets goes above everything. With what we've witnessed recently, and in the past, to those who hold assets in other exchanges, our advice would be to ask yourself the following questions:  Is the exchange regulated? Does it comply with AML regulations? Could they launder money?  Does the exchange operate deep cold-storage? If so, is it wholly in cold-storage or partially? What procedures do they follow to ensure the safety of your assets? Do they have multi-sig procedures in place? Are the controllers fit and proper? Does the exchange have the financial resources required to stay open? Does the exchange have third-party insurance to cover any loss of assets due to theft or other network events?  You may think this doesn’t affect you, but it could.  Warren Buffett once said: “You only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.”  Unfortunately, in my view, we will likely witness, under current market conditions, further evidence of companies going to the wall. We will see who is wearing swimwear. I commented back in 2018 that it was the year of the regulator. I think there is evidence that 2019 will be the year of regulatory enforcement.  We’ve said from the start that GBX is institutional-grade, and by that, we meant you would have that institutional-grade security for your assets.  We wear swimming trunks.  At the very least, you can gain confidence that your assets are safe. That is how I answer the questions I get asked. Yes, we do require more detail than other exchanges for you to open your account, and the application process could put those people off. However, at the end of the day, we do it for the right reasons, while striving to improve the process, without compromise.  My message to you all as we look ahead this year is, you wouldn’t leave your cash under the mattress, you shouldn’t leave your assets unsecured. Trust in GBX, and trust in the passion behind our process, it may not be the easiest, but it’s certainly one of the safest.  3. GSX Group Attends the Paris Fintech Forum  I was offered the chance to participate in a panel discussion at the Paris Fintech Forum, it was a great atmosphere and the perfect opportunity to connect with thought leaders in the emerging tokenised securities space. You can see what happened at the event, and the GSX Group attendance here:  https://gbx.gi/news/gsx-group-attends-the-paris-fintech-forum/  4. Happy Chinese New Year  This Chinese New Year is the year of the pig, a symbol of prosperity and wealth within Chinese culture. We have many significant milestones to reach this year, and we look forward to the challenges they bring and the success that will follow in achieving them. The GSX Group wishes everyone that celebrates chunjie (春节) a happy new year and good fortune for 2019.  That’s all for now. As always I want to thank our community for your continual support. Together we can bring about greater adoption, redefine the standards surrounding digital assets, and transform the traditional capital markets with innovative technology. We have the experience to execute it.  Until next time!     Nick Cowan  CEO - GSX Group    As always, if you have any questions about GBX, please feel free to join the Official Telegram Group!",False

There have been some exciting announcements for the GBX-DAX, which I’m sure many of you are already aware of, thanks to our brilliant AmaZix team and GBX Community Manager! It is impressive to witness the steady growth of GBX, which we are building for long-term success. Every day we make new improvements, bringing new additions to strengthen our product offerings and services. We always welcome the feedback of our community, and we know many of you are as passionate about our journey as we are. Here are some of the latest developments over the past two weeks:  1. EOS & TRX List on the GBX-DAX  The GBX has hit the ground running for 2019, with an aggressive expansion of our tokens and trading pairs on the GBX-DAX. We have, this week, listed TRON’s TRX, which needs no introduction from me, preceded by EOS the week before, and not to forget XRP the week prior to that.

Because GBX' utility token is STACS.  Utility of the STACS Token:  1. VPs do not need to pay any fee to use the STACS Protocol, but will be required to stake STACS Tokens to use the Native and Global STACS.  2.

We will pick up again on 11th January next year.  It has been a full-throttle year for the whole of the GSX-Group, and particularly the GBX. We have hit many personal and professional targets as a company and team. That team has grown significantly across the Group, many of those here in Gibraltar. We have reached important milestones, broken boundaries, and built new pathways toward greater blockchain adoption.  It has been an adventurous journey so far and we relish the opportunities and challenges that 2019 will bring, including STACS Protocol, while continuing to build on our fintech ecosystem, supporting a new era in blockchain powered finance.  So here are the latest developments since my last message, followed by a round-up of 2018 — a reminder of the tremendous progress we have made since the start of the year.  1. STACS Update: Whitepaper & Litepaper now live  The technical Whitepaper for the STACS Protocol and an accompanying Litepaper have been published on the stacs.io website. The Whitepaper details our intentions for the STACS Protocol and the technology behind the unique hybrid blockchain system we have developed. You can read the Whitepaper in more depth here:  https://stacs.io/images/stacswhitepaper.pdf   2. New Insurance Policy for the GBX   Some exciting news this week for our community and the industry as a whole. Digital assets on the GBX-DAX are now insured, including both hot and cold wallets. The insurance coverage is in partnership with Callaghan Insurance and is an important step forward for the security of our users’ assets. This news will instil further confidence amongst our users, underlining our continued commitment to the highest standards of governance and due diligence as a regulated digital asset exchange. You can read the full announcement here:  https://gbx.gi/news/gbx-introduces-new-crypto-insurance-policy-callaghan-insurance/   3. GSX Group Joins The Millbrook Accord  During the Blockchain South Leadership Summit 2018, the Millbrook Accord was formed — a working group that helps promote the development of an industry standard for security tokens. Members of the Millbrook Accord, including the GSX Group as a founding member, will work together to provide solutions to aid the adoption of security tokens and tokenised securities. You can find out more about the Millbrook Accord here:  https://gbx.gi/news/gsx-group-joins-millbrook-accord-founding-member/  4. Round-Up: 2018  February 2018, which feels a lifetime ago now, saw the commencement of our token sale. It was a period of hard graft and late nights, but the goal of raising $27 Million was the beginning of our journey to build a world-leading fintech ecosystem. I’m so proud of what we have accomplished in just one year.  After the sale, we launched the GBX-GRID, building an institutional-grade token sale platform that championed a framework of good governance, brought over from the Gibraltar Stock Exchange (GSX). The GBX-DAX followed shortly after, a robust Digital Asset Exchange committed to redefining the user experience through a trusted trading platform. We continued to grow our Sponsor Firm network (currently includes 23 Sponsor Firms across the globe), and our user base has seen a steady and consistent rise in AML/KYC cleared participants.  One of the most notable events of the year, and certainly the most significant, was the DLT Licence awarded to GBX by our regulator the Gibraltar Financial Services Commision (GFSC). The GBX now is the first regulated Digital Asset Exchange and Token Sale Platform, to be owned by a regulated stock exchange. Our position gifts us the unique opportunity to make a real impact in bridging the gap between the blockchain industry and the traditional finance sector. We have recently begun the next steps toward changing the capital markets industry through the STACS Protocol.  Never taking our eye off the GBX, we have introduced multi-fiat onboarding capabilities, while carefully evaluating all tokens and other digital assets that are brought onto the GBX ecosystem. We have also insured those digital assets, as mentioned at the beginning of my message, with the goal of providing a secure, smooth, and reliable trading experience for all.  So that is all for now. We have had a brilliant year, and I hope that like myself, you are as excited for what lies ahead for the GBX and the wider GSX Group. I would like to thank our entire community for your continued support, from those who have been with us from the start to our newest members. I wish all of you an enjoyable holiday period, we will continue to work diligently in our efforts and I’ll see you all again in 2019.  Nick Cowan  CEO - GSX Group",False

As announced recently, the GSX Group has entered into a joint venture with the Hong Kong publicly listed company, Chong Sing Fintech Holdings Limited, and blockchain development company, Prime Fintech Co. Ltd, establishing Hashstacs Inc. to assist in the development of blockchain technologies.  Hashstacs Inc. is developing the Securities Trading Asset Classification Settlement (STACS) Protocol which will play a pivotal role, creating a unique public/permissioned hybrid global blockchain that will support the issuance, trading, clearing, and settling of digital securities. It will provide a scalable ledger network layer that seamlessly stacks on top of existing financial institutions and enables the tokenisation of the complete financial industry with zero inertia. The hybrid architecture maintains enterprise autonomy, while utilising revolutionary blockchain technology to create tangible and accelerated digitised financial services, adhering to the strictest regulatory standards.  Following my trips to Asia, UK, and New York, I can tell you that the response from everyone has been incredible. I am pleased, therefore, to publish our technical whitepaper which details the protocol technology, as well as the staking and rewards mechanisms that will form a vital part of the STACS token utility. You can find and download the whitepaper here https://stacs.io  Regarding the Gibraltar Stock Exchange (GSX), we remain focused on becoming one of the early tokenised securities exchanges, and of course, the GSX will adopt and use the STACS Protocol. We are working closely with our regulator, the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC), to ensure it is fully compliant with regulations, and we are also communicating with external regulators and partners to establish a global standard. Being a revolutionary change in the way markets work, this is a highly complex proposition given the regulatory and legal environment – but we are excited and optimistic about the challenge and will keep you updated regularly on developments as we progress into next year.

For those who have RKT in IDEX before the token swap, we have credited into their own Ethereum wallet the equivalent of STACS.  For community members who have bought RKT on IDEX after the token swap on 23rd November, and are enquiring about the swap, please email support@gbx.gi (together with details of the trades/transactions history records) where the team will assess the issue and deal with the matter on a case by case basis. We will verify all available records and if the situation merits, we will absorb the ETH cost incurred in such deals, and acquire back the affected RKT. This is only valid for IDEX RKTETH trades after the token swap, on 23rd November only.  In this case, users who were supposed to have STACS due to their valid RKT balances on IDEX before the token swap, get them. And innocent users who didn't know about the token swap but bought RKT using ETH, get covered back with their ETH spent.

As some of you may already be aware, we have seen some significant developments and changes to our business. Before I go through those updates, I would like to extend my gratitude and thanks to our community for their continued support. We’re in the business of changing the landscape of the financial world, and as we grow and develop in that endeavour, it is fantastic to see so many of you join us on this journey.  So, on to the big news! The Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange (GBX) has been granted its DLT licence by our regulator, the Gibraltar Financial Services Commision (GFSC). We are now fully regulated, and the only Stock Exchange to own a regulated Digital Asset Exchange.  But that’s not the only good news for our Community. Here is a roundup of our recent updates:  1. GBX DLT Licence  On November 21st, the GBX began operating as a fully regulated entity under the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) licence from the GFSC. We have always maintained an institutional-grade platform, built on transparency, good governance, and best practices, and we have been rewarded for those efforts with a DLT licence.  You can read the full announcement here:  https://gbx.gi/news/gibraltar-blockchain-exchange-now-licensed-gibraltar-financial-services-commission-gfsc/   2. STACS Token Update  There has been a lot of interest in our upgrade from RKT to STACS as the GBX’s utility token. Our course has always set out to transform the capital markets with blockchain technology, the latest initiative is another step toward that goal. I recently updated you on the STACS Protocol and its incredible potential, and we wanted to make sure our community would share in our future success with the STACS Protocol as well as the GBX. Here is an update on the STACS token:  https://gbx.gi/news/introducing-stacs-token/   3. New Fiat Onboarding and Pairs  More great news for our DAX users. We have extended our Fiat onboarding capabilities to include British Pounds (GBP) and Euros (EUR) alongside our current US Dollar (USD) offering. We are committed to providing the best user experience, and these new Fiat options make it easier than ever to get involved in crypto trading, overcoming the usual barriers to entry. You can learn more about what this means for our users here:   https://gbx.gi/news/gbx-announces-new-fiat-onboarding-options-gbp-eur/     4. Consensus Invest 2018  I have just returned from New York City having attended Consensus Invest 2018. It was an excellent opportunity to network and promote the work of the GBX as a newly regulated exchange, the STACS Protocol and the broader GSX Group ecosystem. It was interesting to see more institutional participation, and the discussions and debates focusing on greater institutional adoption of the blockchain. You can find out more about the event here:  https://gbx.gi/news/gbx-consensus-invest-2018-new-york/  5. BIC Workshop Success  The GSX Group Blockchain Innovation Centre (BIC) hosted the first professional Blockchain Educational Workshop in Gibraltar. In collaboration with London Blockchain Labs (LBL) and held at the University of Gibraltar, the workshop was attended by 100 local professionals for a full day's agenda on the fundamentals of blockchain technology. The day was a huge success and a fantastic experience for those in attendance. The BIC will be hosting more educational events in 2019.

BlockShow Asia & the GSX Group Networking event  The GSX Group returned to exhibit at the BlockShow, after attending their first successful event in Singapore. Similar to last year there was a great atmosphere, with the GSX Group hosting a Cocktails and networking evening during the conference, promoting the STACS Protocol. You can find out more here:  https://gbx.gi/news/blockshow-asia-gsx-group-networking-event/  That’s the roundup for this fortnightly message. Some huge news that continues to boost our progress and has validated all the hard work done by the team. Their dedication and passion have been rewarded with a DLT licence, but our work continues. We operate at the highest standards, and we aim to continue providing the best user experiences and professional services.  Nick Cowan CEO - GBX",False

Our new technology subsidiary, Hashstacs Inc, has developed the STACS protocol which will help create a global leading digital asset platform for the capital markets of the future. A venue where regulated incumbents such as investment banks, exchanges such as GSX and broker-dealers will capitalise on the tremendous potential of tokenised securities including STOs by providing issuers with access to a global liquidity pool within a regulated environment. The proprietary technology, highlighted in recent communications, will encompass the development of the STACS protocol, the integration of the STACS Enterprise Wallet and the implementation of trading platform services.  Welcome to the STACS Token   I am very excited to share this news with you.  As I mentioned in my recent Hashstacs message, not only will GBX’s utility token continue to benefit from the ever-expanding use within the GSX eco-system, which will include GBX, GSX, Juno, as well as other business lines – but it will also be the token which drives the utility within the STACS protocol.  Let me explain.  To make sure our utility token is at the heart of everything we do and with the STACS Protocol coming soon, it is time to create a pathway to the STACS protocol for all our token holders.  Welcome to the STACS Token.   The STACS Token is the GSX Group’s new utility token.  STACS has the SAME utility aspects as RKT, therefore, Sponsor fees, listing fees and trading fees will be paid for in STACS Tokens and all of the current membership aspects of RKT will be enjoyed by STACS holders in exactly the same way.     The really exciting added utility of the STACS Token will be the reward and staking mechanisms on the STACS Protocol; I will keep you posted in the next few weeks with more details.  As from today, RKT will cease to be the driving force in our eco-system, the new STACS Token will take its place.  The details  RKT will cease to serve in its current form from today. The STACS Token, an upgraded ERC20 token, has replaced RKT as the utility token of our eco-system.   Today (23rd November 2018) at the first block after 03:00 UTC, we have started allocating STACS Tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, GRID and DAX wallets to all RKT holders. STACS Tokens are being distributed on a 1 to 1 basis, for example, if you have 10,000 RKT in your Ethereum/GBX Grid/GBX DAX wallet, you will have 10,000 RKTs AND 10,000 STACS Tokens. We are also working with our partners Quoine too to do the same.   We have informed CMC, Coingecko, Quoine, IDEX and Etherscan about the change of GBX’s utility token.  We will enable trading of the STACS Token on the DAX once balances are confirmed.  We expect this to be within 6 hours.  This has been one of the most exciting updates I have had the pleasure of sharing with you.  The continued development of the STACS protocol, the GSX Group eco-system, and the launch of our new utility token; STACS.

This update covers the following:   - The development of the GSX as a tokenised securities exchange.  - The development of the underlying technology we have named the STACS Protocol.  - The strategy to offer STACS as a global network of exchanges, broker-dealers, investment banks, and financial institutions.  - The implications for RKT holders.   The GSX Group has been working hard to expand its ecosystem to further develop and maximise the use of RKT. As described in our original RKT white paper, we saw the ecosystem expanding via a phased approach which can be summarised as follows:   Phase 1 - Build the GBX as a licensed and regulated token sale platform and secondary cryptocurrency exchange which provides a multi fiat-crypto marketplace, whereby primary and secondary tokens can be traded in a trusted environment. Despite challenges along the way, including having to change our technology solution, we have managed to hit our milestones. Both the GRID and the DAX are open. All listing and sponsor fees are payable in RKT. We also offer benefits to holders including reduced trading fees and referral program rewards.   Phase 2 - Build the GSX as one of the world’s first tokenised securities exchanges providing a digital platform for Security Tokens to be launched and traded. As a Stock Exchange, we see incredible opportunities to disrupt the existing traditional securities processes, thus reducing the speed and cost of capital and opening up markets to a whole new universe of investors. RKT is also going to be used to pay fees within the GSX.   Phase 3 - Build out the rest of the GSX Group to provide our client base with ongoing solutions. We have successfully acquired two services companies, positioning Juno Services as the largest fund administration company in Gibraltar. We have seen a rapidly growing client base choosing Juno to provide fund admin services, particularly crypto funds, where we can also facilitate banking relationships here in Gibraltar. In addition to Juno, we are also close to completing an acquisition of a UK-licensed dealer-broker which provides FX (Foreign Exchange), derivative, and CFD services.   To explain Phase 2 in more detail, as we looked at the underlying technology that would facilitate the move to a digital securities exchange, we had originally considered a private chain which the GSX would have used as its own, to allow buyers and sellers to trade digital securities.  However, we considered this highly restrictive for our clients’ access to liquidity and essentially we would simply be building a new legacy system to replace our old legacy system.  We also discovered, through extensive discussions, that a large number of exchanges, investment banks, broker-dealers, and asset managers were all wrestling with the same question. The general consensus was that the public ledgers have some way to go to be fit for purpose and that there was no single solution that could deliver the complexity of digital securities trading and settlement.   Therefore, the GSX Group came up with the vision of the STACS Protocol - the Securities Trading Asset Classification Settlement Protocol - which is being developed by our new joint venture, Hashstacs Inc..  STACS, we believe, will transform the way capital markets operate, intersecting between global traditional capital markets and crypto finance. The grand vision of the STACS Protocol is to become a global leading Digital Asset platform for the capital markets of the future. A global network where regulated incumbents such as investment banks, exchanges such as the GSX, and broker-dealers will capitalise on the tremendous potential of tokenised securities, including STOs.   These Verified Partners will provide issuers with a location agnostic, global infrastructure, to issue in the jurisdiction(s) of their choice.  The STACS network is also a collaborative effort for issuers to access a global pool of capital and liquidity.  Regulators will be equipped with the tools to fulfil automated regulatory reporting. The approach is proactive, not reactive.   The STACS Protocol will bring an integrated platform and tools, from issuance to settlement, in an open, collaborative and inclusive environment.  The proprietary technology, highlighted in recent communications, will encompass the development of the STACS Protocol, the integration of the STACS enterprise wallet, and the implementation of trading platform services.   We see numerous benefits that tokenised securities provide:  1. Improved Liquidity (Democratising illiquid assets)               2. Lower cost of transactions (Removing the middleman)       3. Fractional ownership (e.g. Stradivarius violin, the Shard,…)   4. Faster trade execution and settlement (fewer intermediaries)  5. Greater security (less potential manipulation)                              6. Global free market exposure (24/7 global pool of capital)               7. Lower issuance fee (Tokenisation-as-a-Service)                            8. Easy to track (via DLT)                                               9. Applicable to all Asset Class (Equity, Debt, Oil, Gold, Fine Art...)  10. Compliance built in (Asset interoperability: frictionless)                 11. Regulated (Accountability and credibility)                          12. New financing models (Never possible before)         RKT Implications   The STACS Protocol provides good news for RKT holders.   Not only will RKT Holders continue to benefit from the ever-expanding utility within the GSX Group ecosystem – which will include the GBX, the GSX, as well as other business lines – but RKT will also be the token which drives the utility within the STACS Protocol. We will provide further details in our technical white paper which will be released in the coming weeks.  I remain more excited than ever about the future of the GSX Group, the future of the STACS Protocol, and most importantly the future of RKT/STACS.   We will ensure that we keep the TG channel up-to-date with all announcements as they happen over the next few months.  Nick Cowan CEO - GSX Group",False

The GBX continues to grow and every week we’re seeing an increase in new referrals from our GBX Rewards programme and new tokens applying for both the GRID and the Exchange.  Over the past two weeks, I’ve been in meetings in London and Asia, introducing the Global Securities Protocol to interested parties. The response so far has been phenomenal and we will soon be able to share more information with you.  Time for the update:  CGRID tokens distributed and now listed on the DAX  After CGRID’s successful token sale on the GBX GRID, all tokens have now been distributed to all those that participated. CGRID is now also listed on the DAX and available to trade as a CGRID/ETH pair. It’s great to see the transition from primary to secondary listings happen, a reminder of the complete ecosystem the GBX offers issuers. You can find out more about CGRID’s listing here:  https://gbx.gi/news/cgrid-token-sale-distribution-and-gbx-dax-listing/?utm_source=telegram&utm_medium=socia  2. ICNQ token sale live on the GRID  Iconiq Holding’s exclusive GBX token sale is currently live on the GRID. The team at Iconiq, who is a Sponsor Firm within the GBX network, decided to run their ICNQ sale on the GRID. We wish them the best of luck for their token sale. Patrick Lowry, the CEO of Iconiq Holdings held an AMA here on TG, so feel free to scroll up and find out more.  https://platform.gbx.gi/grid/icnq  3. Gibraltar Week events in London  Fintech and Financial Services events with Gibraltar Government  Last week Her Majesty’s Government of Gibraltar hosted two events for the fintech and financial services sector. A fintech and crypto funds breakfast, held in the RAC Club and a financial service lunch in the Library at the Guildhall in London. Both events were packed houses as people continue to recognise Gibraltar as a leading jurisdiction for DLT and financial services, and I was fortunate enough to sit on a panel and share our thoughts on the future of virtual assets.  https://gbx.gi/news/gsx-at-gibraltar-week-events-in-london/?utm_source=telegram&utm_medium=social  Gibraltar International Fintech Forum London  Gibfin held its first event in London last week, a great turn out, with more than 400 people attending a full day of industry-leading speakers from Gibraltar and around the world. The forum was opened by the Chief Minister, Fabian Picardo and saw the Hon. Albert Isola, Minister for Commerce address the attendees at the event. I also presented, updating everyone on GBX and our plans for GSX and the GSP.  https://gbx.gi/news/gsx-at-gibraltar-international-fintech-forum-in-london/?utm_source=telegram&utm_medium=social  Sponsor Firm Summit in London  It really was a fully packed week in London last week, as we also held our first Sponsor Firm Summit in London. 24 representatives from our Sponsor Firm network attended the day, which was filled with industry insights and open discussion regarding the GBX ecosystem and the industry as a whole. Once again I would like to thank everyone who attended, including some who flew in from North America and even from as far as Australia. A hugely productive day and a reminder of just how global the GBX network really is. A number of actions have come out of the summit as we push to grow the GBX.  https://gbx.gi/news/gbx-london-sponsor-firm-summit/?utm_source=telegram&utm_medium=social  4. GSP gathers momentum globally  The Global Securities Protocol journey has well and truly started. Both last week in London and this week in Asia, I’ve been meeting with interested parties to discuss our view for the future of capital markets. We see a massive shift for exchanges and financial services in the future. I believe things will be very different in a relatively short period of time and the GSP can help with that evolution. Blockchain has given us an opportunity to radically change the markets, and tokenised securities is on the tip of everyone’s tongue currently. As I said on stage at Gibfin London, “we’re not trying to reinvent the wheel, just make it spin faster”.  Keep an eye out for more information coming soon.  5. Rewards Programme usage is growing  I’m happy to tell you that since we announced our GBX Rewards programme we’ve seen so many of you start sharing the GBX with friends and family. This is still just the beginning of our Rewards programme, but it’s so great to see our community continue to support the GBX. If you haven’t started using the programme yet, you can find more information here:  https://gbx.gi/referral-rewards-programme/   6. Upcoming events  It’s non stop for the team as we continue to promote the GBX and the wider GSX Group across the globe. I’m delighted to say that next week we will be in Lisbon, Portugal as part of Web Summit followed by Consensus Invest in New York at the end of the month. If you are planning on attending either of these events, make sure you reach out as the team is always happy to meet members of our community.  That’s it for today, I’ll be heading back to Europe shortly, but as always, there is always more to do and thankfully the team and I are all 100% committed to continuing the success of the GBX.

We have been hiring to strengthen our already incredible team, focussing on the GBX business development network in London and Singapore. Our work on the Global Securities Protocol (GSP) is also making significant progress.  We continue to travel extensively meeting with our Sponsors, potential Sponsors, industry experts and project leaders. Many commentators on the global conference network note the current bearish sentiment that the sector is experiencing and although there are many questions and uncertainties in the short term, this is counterbalanced by a feeling that in the long run there is clear vision and optimism. Bridging that ‘canyon of doubt’, navigating the obstacles in our way requires energy, talent, creative thinking and some risk-taking too! What we also believe is that the global exchange scene 2 years from now will be very different to what we see today.  The Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange (GBX) has continued to grow and develop. It is a testament to the robust platforms we have established, here is what has been happening since last we connected:   1 - GBX Rewards Programme Goes Live  Our GBX rewards programme is now live, each GBX account holder will find their unique referral link and code in their account profile page. Sharing this code online helps you gain rewards. For every person who completes registration for a GBX account using that link, both the referrer and the referral will receive rewards! It is our way of giving back to our community and saying thanks for your support. You can read more about the rewards programme here:  https://gbx.gi/news/announcing-the-gbx-rewards-programme/    2 - BLZ Live on the GBX-DAX  The team at Bluzelle and all of us here are at the GBX are excited to see their token, BLZ, now live and available to trade on the Digital Asset Exchange (GBX-DAX).

You can find out more about this blockchain veteran project, and the trading pairs available here:  https://gbx.gi/news/bluzelle-to-be-listed-on-the-gbx-dax/     3 - GBX-DAX to List IOST  Another popular token has made its way to the GBX-DAX, brought to GBX by the Sponsor Firm ICOmain.io. IOST will begin trading on the GBX-DAX on Oct 22 08:00:00 UTC, you can find out more about the listing details and the IOST project here:  https://gbx.gi/news/iost-listed-gbx-dax/    4 - GBX-GRID, The ASMX Token Sale  The Sponsor Firm Kession Capital have brought their first token sale to the GBX-GRID.

Some of the GBX team joined the Government of Gibraltar (HMGOG) and The Gibraltar - Israel Chamber of Commerce (Gibrael), on a trade visit to Tel Aviv.  https://gbx.gi/news/gibrael-gibraltar-day-delegation-tel-aviv/  Kurt Looyens, the GBX Business Development Manager, spoke on stage at the Blockchain Solutions Forum in Barcelona, whilst Philip Young, GSX Group Marketing Director took part in a panel on regulation.  https://gbx.gi/news/gsx-group-blockchain-solutions-forum-barcelona/  Targ Patience, our Group Chief Compliance Officer participated on a panel at a Regtech Conference in London. You can find out more from the event here:  https://gbx.gi/news/gsx-group-regtech-summit/   8 - Upcoming events  We often get asked the question “what is Gibraltar doing to raise its global profile and compete with other jurisdictions?” Quite a lot as it happens. For example, we have an exciting set of events ahead of us, including next week, 4 days in London dedicated to Gibraltar.  The week commences with the Gibraltar Financial Services Lunch being hosted by the Government of Gibraltar, followed by a series of more private and public sector get-togethers involving both the UK and Gibraltar financial services communities, and also GibFin London on the 24th October. The GBX are the headline sponsors of the GibFin conference, hosted in the QEII Centre, Westminster. If you would like to attend, you can find more information about the event here (https://www.gibfinlondon.com/). We will finish the week with a London based Sponsor Firm Summit, where we will discuss and debate how we can continue to improve our token deal flow and community   Thereafter I shall be joining the GBX team in Asia to attend the Hong Kong FinTech Week, the world's first cross-border fintech event. If you would like to arrange to meet up with someone from the team you can e-mail info@gbx.gi  Finally, at the GSX Group, we strive to constantly push the boundaries, getting involved with debates on increasing standards for the blockchain industry, meeting the community and pioneering toward a new era in blockchain powered finance and I will always keep you updated on these areas that myself and the team are working diligently towards. So that is the round up for this FORTnightly message, as always thank you for your continued support.   Keep on ROCKing everyone!  Nick Cowan CEO - GSX Group",False

First of all, on the team`s behalf, I want to thank you for the feedback as it`s important to stay on the same page with the community&GBX users. Hence, I want to assure you that the team is continuously working to make the platform successful and isn`t cheating its contributors. Also, may I wonder where did you hear that GBX is selling tokens to private investors?  Projects which apply to launch their token sales via the GBX platform and which expect their token to list for secondary market trading on the GBX cryptocurrency exchange must also appoint a Sponsor Firm. Sponsor Firms are responsible for guiding listings to market and helping to meet continuing obligations.  Actually, each Sponsor will stake a fixed amount of Rock Tokens (to be held in GBX escrow) for 12 months, equivalent to 0.5% of the total tokens issued through each token sale that they are sponsoring and which are admitted to trading on GBX. Innovative fee and staking mechanisms will help ensure Sponsors have a shared ethos to grow GBX with responsibility and accountability. So, in simple words, Sponsor firms pay fees in RKT.  Just in case you didn't know here is the list of the RKT utility cases:  (a) settling of the GBX application fee (""Application Fee""), listing fees (“Listing Fees”) and Sponsor fees (“Sponsor Fees”) on GBX; (b) staking by Sponsors on GBX (has been removed); (c) settling trading fees (“Trading Fees”) on the GBX Market; (d) medium to pay fees in the GBX Ecosystem including corporate services, fund services, business solutions, and e-money services; (e) GBX Blockchain Innovation Centre campaigns, rewards for GBX Blockchain Innovation Centre campaigns and other incentives. It is also planned to provide: (f) membership to GBX, with privileged account benefits including potential discounts; (g) priority access to token sales; and (h) other potential incentives and voting rights on select community initiatives and developments;  The team also has plans going forward to implement other possible utility separate to the above. So, stay tuned and feel free to engage with us in the main Community Group: https://t.me/GBXCommunity Let us know if you still have any concerns and we would be glad to clarify them for you🙂",False

Our work with the Global Securities Protocol (GSP), a subject that I touched upon in my last update, is particularly relevant.  The GSP  project is our technology subsidiary that is looking to bring together the advancements of blockchain and tokenised securities with the traditional financial world. It aims to radically transform the capital markets with Distributed Ledger Technology. Members of our senior executive team shall this weekend be returning from a global summit in New Zealand, where we shared ideas with some of the world’s other leading figures in the token securities world on how best  to drive the industry forward. Recent announcements believe that the value of blockchain technology, when aligned with security tokens, will reach 10% of global GDP - roughly $8 trillion -  within the next 6 years. Think about that for a moment, and consider where we are now. With an international effort that is collaborative, not competitive, there is no limit to what can be achieved. These are exciting times.  I look forward to sharing further developments on how the GSP matters to you, our Community,  as soon as possible.   In the meantime, we have been hard at work as always at the GBX, delivering on our planned roadmap to provide an institutional-grade ecosystem for the crypto space. Here is what we have been up to recently:  1. DAX Listing Announcement: Bluzelle  We are very excited that Bluzelle has come to list on the GBX-DAX, and amongst other pairings, utilise our fiat-onboarding capabilities with USD. You can learn more about Bluzelle and their work, plus the details of their listing here:  https://gbx.gi/news/bluzelle-to-be-listed-on-the-gbx-dax/  2. Referral Programme Roll-out  The final touches are being made to our GBX Rewards Programme, and the roll-out has commenced so you can now begin referring your friends!

Sponsor Firm Summit Asia  The GBX team held a Summit for our Sponsor Firms based in (and near) Asia. I delivered a presentation on the latest developments across the GSX Group, and we discussed and debated the rules and processes of the GBX-GRID and GBX-DAX, to ensure we are always providing the most robust and supportive services. You can gain an overview of the summit here:  https://gbx.gi/news/gsx-at-singapore-blockchain-week/  4. CrowdVilla Token Sale Concluded  The Crowdvilla token sale on the GBX-GRID was concluded. Due to the endeavours of Crowdvilla management team, they were able to reach the hard cap by selling to property owners who share their vision. Due to the paper works involved, the completion of their sale will take a few more months. You can read more about the sale conclusion here:  https://gbx.gi/news/crowdvilla-token-sale-concluded/  5. GSX Group Travels to Hanoi/Malaysia  After my visit to Asia, the team continued the GSX Group roadshow, talking about our latest initiative the Global Securities Protocol.

In my last FORTnightly message I touched upon the emergence of security tokens. We see this as the next evolutionary step for our industry; establishing more products, markets and opportunities for broader participation and adoption. I've previously shared the work we have been doing behind the scenes at the GSX Group towards this goal, and I am excited to let you know about our latest endeavours.  1. My Trip to Asia and The GSP Protocol  The meetings and events during my time in Singapore have been focused on communicating our technology solution, which we believe is required to support tokenised securities through good governance, best practices and the highest regulatory standards. We have called the solution the Global Securities Protocol (GSP).   We aim to use the GSP to transform capital markets with blockchain technology, bringing together other stock exchanges, investment banks and qualified institutions to utilise the GSP, creating more avenues for issuers to gain access to the blockchain powered finance of tokenised securities. Naturally, RKT will play a pivotal role in the GSP, which will have public access and transparency. A protocol designed specifically for tokenised securities, open to all. More detailed information will be announced shortly.  2. Atlantic NeoTechnologies joins the Sponsor Firm Network  Please join me in welcoming our latest Sponsor Firm, Atlantic NeoTechnologies (ANT), to our incredible community of token advisory experts. ANT is part of a Group with extensive experience in international banking, investment advice and asset management. You can read more about ANT's approval status as a Sponsor Firm here:  https://gbx.gi/news/atlantic-neotechnologies-joins-the-sponsor-firm-network/?utm_source=telegram&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=ceomessage   3. Sponsor Summit: Singapore  As part of GBX’s commitment to our Sponsor Firms,  we maintain a continuous two-way relationship, open to dialogue and feedback. Holding Sponsor Summits is a great way to bring our community of Sponsor Firms together, and provide a platform for discussion and debate. Through these summits, we collaborate and improve on areas such as the token issuer admission process, or redefining the listing and Sponsor rules.   4. Infinitus Token Sale Concluded  Congratulations to the team at Infinitus for selling 92.89% of their tokens! It’s great to see innovative projects get the funding they need to provide solutions through the blockchain. You can find out more about the Infinitus project here:  https://infinitustoken.io/    5. Token Sales Live on the GRID  Just a reminder, we have two token sales on the GBX-GRID. Both the Õpet and the Crowdvilla sales are currently live, and you can view the details here:  https://grid.gbx.gi/?utm_source=telegram&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=ceomessage      Here is a quick snapshot of the projects:  Crowdvilla is a community-focused, blockchain, non-profit organisation that provides a platform for users to share holiday homes around the world.  https://gbx.gi/crowdvilla-faq/?utm_source=telegram&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=ceomessage    Õpet is a foundation project building a blockchain to store the educational admission data of all students. In order to ensure data is accurately collected at the source, Õpet is also developing a mobile application chatbot to expand students' horizons.  https://gbx.gi/opet-faq/?utm_source=telegram&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=ceomessage  6. Referral Programme  We are still working behind the scenes, making sure that when we roll out our referral programme, it rewards ROCK token holders for helping to grow and expand our amazing community. It is our way of saying thank you for all the support and encouragement. We want it to be perfect! We’ll be announcing its roll-out shortly, so keep a look out!  7. The GBX-DAX App  The GBX-DAX app is now available for all Android users. Our new App will give our users mobility and the freedom to trade from their phones anytime, anywhere. Managing your DAX portfolio, or making trades, will now be even more accessible than ever before.  https://gbx.gi/dax-mobile-app/?utm_source=telegram&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=ceomessage  8. Trading Fees now in effect  As part of our DAX upgrade this week, our new trading fee structure is now in effect. It’s more great news for RKT holders, as you can now reduce your trading fees by holding 10,000 RKT in your account. You can find the full information regarding the DAX trading fees in the link below:  https://exchange.gbx.gi/v1/common/allAccessFile/readForAll?fileUrl=46  That’s all for the moment. Lots of exciting things coming out very soon as I head back to Gibraltar to continue our work on the GSX Group ecosystem.

We ignore the naysayers and, regardless of market conditions, look to the future with increasing confidence. There are a number of reasons why, that I‘d like to share with you.   The demand for higher standards is now greater than ever before and comes from every corner: governments, regulators, industry, and general consumers. As a result standards, accountability and transparency are improving.  There is of course still work to do on a global level but players such as GBX, in supportive jurisdictions like Gibraltar, continue to take bold steps to help move the industry forward, to increase confidence. The GBX-GRID (token sale platform) and our GBX-DAX (Digital Asset Exchange) are venues where today token issuers, buyers, and sellers can go and be treated honestly and fairly.   Furthermore, the emergence of security tokens (securities issued in token form onto blockchains) are the beginning of the next evolutionary step for our industry: to create new products, new markets, widen participation and liquidity, enhance the delivery of service in capital markets, and improve the risk profile of the market’s infrastructure.   From our meetings with many people in the industry, including more recently at conferences in London and Singapore, we believe that many are overwhelmed with information on this subject but at the same time, hungry for knowledge and eager for a regulatory compliant solution.   Just as we are doing for utility tokens, we at GBX are playing a significant role in providing global leadership on security tokens within the GSX Group. Providing clarity, consistency and certainty on this matter is truly one of the main themes to watch out for now and into 2019. We are eager to share with you our plans soon and we wish for all our ROCKers to join us on this important step in our journey.  In the meantime I have some fantastic updates to share, including some great upcoming announcements, so let's get to it ROCKers!   Welcoming CCMC to the Sponsor Firm Network  Our global network continues to grow, strengthening our offering for the GBX. Their experience as blockchain venture capital investors brings additional strength to the network.  It’s a pleasure to welcome Martin and the CMCC team to the GBX.  https://gbx.gi/news/cmcc-global-joins-the-gbx-sponsor-firm-community/?utm_source=telegram   New GBX-DAX Listings  Very soon we will be announcing new additions to our exchange, the GBX-DAX. Since launch, the feedback on the exchange has been great, but we know that you would like to see more developments so the team has been working hard on this. We can’t wait to share this with you, and we’re sure you won’t be disappointed when we do.   https://exchange.gbx.gi/?utm_source=telegram  CGRID Sold Out On GBX-GRID  Another success story for the GBX-GRID (our token sale platform) was the completed sell out of CGRID in the first hour of their Early Access period. The phenomenal timing is another example of one of the prime benefits those holding RKT receive: that first mover advantage. Congratulations to the Carbon Grid team for their successful token raise!

In Gibraltar and Asia, the teams have been hard at work as always and the new HQ is becoming a hive of activity as the business comes together under one roof. I would like to share with you some of great work and the progress the team at GBX have made in the last two weeks.     1. Blockchain Assets Capital become the 19th Sponsor Firm  We welcome the boutique investment and advisory firm Blockchain Assets Capital (BAC), based in Australia, to our Sponsor Firm network. The continual growth of our global network shows the continued belief in the GBX Ecosystem.

BIC & Blockchain: Back To Basics  The GSX Group Blockchain Innovation Centre and Digital Asset Management (DAM) co-hosted a meetup at the Sunborn Hotel in Gibraltar. The event was titled Blockchain: Back To Basics and was designed to support the growing blockchain economy here on The Rock. The Meetup was a huge success with over 100 people in attendance from firms offering support services for the DLT and blockchain industry in Gibraltar. It’s been great to see the positive feedback from the event and we’ll be hosting more educational meetups and workshops going forward.

This of course can be for different reasons but I would think in this case with RKT is that the Sellers are washing out to the Hodlers and as more holders come to the table than sellers naturally the volume will drop. I do not have a crystal ball and just offer my thoughts as I see it. Hodlers portfolio's will usually outperform sellers longer term and as I said as we approach a turning markets the hodlers should be very well rewarded with their holdings of Rock tokens and indeed happy. This is my opinion only but I see this happening broadly across this token space right now! ,False

While Europe has been engrossed with an unprecedented heatwave, here at the GBX we’ve been hard at work. Let’s kick off with the news.  As you are aware, the GBX Digital Asset Exchange is now live and open to the public. In our first two weeks we have been really pleased with the account opening procedures, deposit and withdrawal processes as well as the feedback from the community.  On the back of that significant milestone, I am thrilled to share further developments over the last couple of weeks.  1. New tokens on the GBX GRID As you may have seen, the GRID is filling up fast:  The Õpet Foundation’s token issuance has been admitted to launch on the GBX. The Õpet token, OPET, will be available for sale, supported by Sponsor Firm Venture Capital Network (VCN).  https://medium.com/@Gibraltar.Blockchain.Exchange/%C3%B5pet-admitted-to-the-gbx-grid-38e14cef2e45  The Singapore-based Sponsor Firm Venture Capital Network (VCN) has successfully submitted a new token issuer, Infinitus, and their token INF to the GBX GRID. For more information about the Infinitus Project, please visit:  https://gbx.gi/news/infinitus-token-sale-admitted-for-launch-on-gbx-grid/  Crowdvilla announced the start of the their token sale on the 6th August on the GRID. The initial Early Access Pre-Sale phase ends on August 31 with 30% bonus. There is a 14 day cooling off period before the contribution can be made, so make sure you register your interest before the 16th August to take advantage of the early access bonus. You can find more information here:  https://medium.com/@Gibraltar.Blockchain.Exchange/crowdvilla-token-sale-announcement-4e7e29c8c4ab  2. The Sponsor Firm Community Grows The Sponsor Firm network has gained a Gibraltar and UK based addition to the continually growing community. Ramparts have been approved to become the 18th Sponsor Firm offering more opportunities for token issuers to launch from the GBX-GRID. You can find out more here:  https://medium.com/@Gibraltar.Blockchain.Exchange/ramparts-approved-as-gbx-sponsor-firm-16fbe2d0ac30  3. T2T Lists On The Digital Asset Exchange (DAX) After Traceto.io had their successful token sale on the GBX GRID, the T2T token is now listed on the GBX Digital Asset Exchange. T2T faced tough market conditions, but this is a company that has a great product (which we use) and the utility the token provides will only grow. T2T will be the first of many tokens launched from the GBX GRID that are then available to participants through our exchange.  You can register to trade on the GBX Digital Asset Exchange here:  https://platform.gbx.gi/register  4. Remember, Zero Trading Fees till the 14th September. I just want to remind everyone, if you haven’t already signed up, you have one week left to make sure you benefit from Zero Trading Fees on the Digital Asset Exchange until the 14th September. Remember the cut off date is the 17th August.  5. The GBX Plan I have set the management team of GBX a number of objectives over the next 6 months:  to increase the amount of tokens on the Grid To grow the number of secondary tokens trading on the DAX To grow the Sponsor network To grow the User base To increase liquidity on the DAX  Below I list some of the initiatives we currently have or are implementing.  a) Early Access  For the GBX GRID, RKT plays an integral role, for both Sponsor Firm fees and Issuer staking. It also allows holders (with 10,000 RKT or more) to gain early access to the new token sales on the platform. But that’s not all.  b) Reduced Trading Fees  Both individuals and corporate account holders can reduce their trading fees by holding RKT. If you’re holding enough RKT, you can reduce your fees further, with discounted rates starting when you hold just 10,000 RKT in your account, all the way down to ZERO fees if you hold an amount of RKT we will announce shortly.  c) Native mobile apps launching shortly  The mobile app for both Android and iOS is currently under development and reaching its final stages of testing. Once it's ready you won't be disappointed.  d) The GBX Referral Programme  Soon we shall be announcing an exciting referral programme for the GBX Digital Asset Exchange. This will be a way for us to continue to grow and reward our community of GBX DAX users and RKT holders, and we can't wait to share more details with you as soon as possible!  e) Secondary Tokens  We have been working closely with our Sponsors to onboard secondary tokens - let me say we have some incredible secondary tokens lined up to list on GBX DAX (hint, they are world-famous and you have probably heard of all of them!)  f) Adding more deposit channels  We will grow our banking network and payment providers over the next few months and we will also add additional fiat currencies to the DAX over the next few weeks.  g) Continual upgrades of our trading platform to be expected  We have received lots of useful feedback from you regarding the DAX, and we are reviewing it all. We are also building some great institutional relationships for the DAX, we are unable to disclose any information at this time. We are looking at improving our API and have an upgraded release coming soon. We have our list and we will work hard to deliver a great platform and great trading products, so stay tuned for that in the next few weeks  h) Marketing  After the recent announcement of our new Chief Operating Officer, Phil Walker coming on board, I mentioned a little while ago that we would be rolling out user acquisition and retention marketing strategies, based on the most optimal campaigns used by the online gaming industry. The GBX Marketing Committee is working hard on the plan and we will see this being rolled out over the next few months, but I am really excited about what the team have produced so far.  Round Up  Meanwhile, not only are we are hard at work on GBX - we are also burning the candle at both ends, to deliver the GSX Tokenised Securities Exchange plan - it is going to be truly game changing. And RKT will be key to this platform…..but that’s for another day.  There’s still plenty of work to be done, but I am so proud of what the team has achieved to date and look forward to sharing the journey with you as we continue to move forward, building the entire GSX Group Ecosystem. I have always tried to hire people smarter than me and then empower them to make a difference. With this team I have outdone myself! Our team is the best!! They are smart, they work hard and they push the boundaries of what is possible. It’s everything I look for.  Embrace risk - don’t be afraid of failure - get on with it! Have fun. Our values:  Integrity - Respect - Reputation.  Remember, the ROCK token is the fuel for the entire GSX Ecosystem!  Keep on ROCKing!  Nick Cowan CEO - GBX",False

The GBX Digital Asset Exchange Is LIVE.  The 23rd of July marked one of the most important days for GBX as a business. The GBX Digital Asset Exchange is open to the public. After going through the KYC process, individuals and institutions will be able to trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, and our own Rock Token (RKT) with the US Dollar. We have opened with fiat onboarding making it easier for our users to get started on our institutional-grade platform. Additionally, against BTC and ETH, there are other crypto pairs that you can trade including BCH, ETC and LTC.  This launch is the biggest milestone for the GBX so far and one that has taken countless hours of incredible work from the team, demonstrating how much we can achieve together. Not forgetting the amazing support from our community, and as a thank you, we have launched with zero trading fees until the 14th September 2018, as long as you are signed up by the 17th August 2018! Don’t miss out.   Details of our exclusive trading competition will be announced soon, so stay tuned ROCKers!

We’ve had an incredible 2 weeks, but there is still so much we want to do. As you all know the Exchange is live and we’re loving the feedback the community is giving us so far. Don’t stop as each piece of feedback helps us to continue the development of both the GRID and the Digital Asset Exchange.  I’m signing off for now and remember, keep on ROCKing everyone!

CGRID & CrowdVilla on the GBX GRID  It’s been busy for the GBX GRID recently. We’ve had two new tokens admitted to the GRID and things are ramping up. I know you all want to see more tokens make it to the GRID and it’s something that everyone is working towards. Our Sponsor Firm network continues to grow and as the network grows, the experience and reach across the globe is evident to see.

Here’s an update for you on what’s been going on and what’s coming up:  1) Razlin approved as the latest Sponsor Firm.  It’s a great pleasure to welcome Razlin to the Sponsor Firm network. Their experience in emerging markets and investment advisory will continue to help us bridge the gap between traditional and new finance options for companies. Razlin, based in London, is our thirteenth SF to join the network. We’re all looking forward to see what they bring to the GRID.  https://medium.com/@Gibraltar.Blockchain.Exchange/razlin-joins-the-sponsor-firm-network-26f9d34a863a  2) Always on the road.  Over the last 2 weeks the team have been back out on the road, attending events and sharing the latest updates on the GSX Group’s journey to date. The first of these events was in Warsaw, Poland, where Philip Young, Marketing and Business Development Director was invited to speak at the Europe Blockchain Summit.  Find out more here:  https://medium.com/@Gibraltar.Blockchain.Exchange/gbx-at-the-europe-blockchain-summit-warsaw-53ceeded2bf1  Targ Patience, GSX Group’s Chief Compliance Officer, was invited to take part in a panel discussion at the RegTech Summit Europe in London.

We thank you all for the support!  The first token sale on the GBX GRID has come to an end earlier than anticipated. It’s been an incredible journey for the Traceto.io team and we’re so happy to see how well they have done, selling out their public sale in what has been a challenging environment. Well done!  I caught up with Chye Kit, CEO from Traceto.io earlier this week for a quick video call. Watch the video here:  https://youtu.be/chA0yLhxITw  5) The GBX GRID  We have a new listing approved!

The Soft Launch has been great. It’s been fantastic to have our platform in the hands of the real people who are going to be using it going forward. The feedback has been great so far and we have so many possible new features from you our community, that we’ll be working hard to decide how to roll these out.  If you didn’t make it to the soft launch, don’t worry. I’ll have good news for you soon and I’m sure you won’t be disappointed.  7) Lastly, we are planning to host a special AMA from our new offices in Gibraltar very soon!

The Digital Asset Exchange Soft Launch The soft launch is now underway and 300 retail and institutional participants are now online using the Exchange. It’s just the beginning and the feedback has been great so far. So many innovative ideas and new developments for us to process and consider. The soft launch will be running for about another 2 weeks and we encourage you to collect your feedback and get in touch. For those of you that have provided us with comments and feedback, thank you so much. Your input is really important to us and will help us to keep developing the exchange with what you want.  2. Two new Sponsor Firms joined the network It’s a pleasure to welcome Lightbulb Capital to our Sponsor Firm network. Based in SIngapore and Hong Kong, their knowledge and experience continues to grow the Sponsor Firm network in Asia. Matthew and Dan focus on creating long-term sustainable businesses helping token issuers throughout the entire token sale process. https://medium.com/@Gibraltar.Blockchain.Exchange/new-sponsor-firm-lightbulb-capital-digital-40f65cbc4847 Pegasus Fintech have been approved as the first North American Sponsor Firm. With decades of experience, the team at Pegasus supports the growth of token issuers’ businesses. As our 12th Sponsor to join the network it’s clear to see the talent joining the team and opening up a whole new region. https://medium.com/@Gibraltar.Blockchain.Exchange/pegasus-fintech-approved-as-first-north-american-gbx-sponsor-firm-5c501a5639ca  3. It’s been another busy two weeks for events Last week I was invited to speak at the European Commerce Registers Forum (ECRF). It  was an interesting event to see how technology, specifically blockchain, is having an impact on the sector. https://medium.com/@Gibraltar.Blockchain.Exchange/european-commerce-registers-forum-gibraltar-d4560e60c67e Philip Young was in Dublin earlier this week for Money Conf. Another big name conference from the Web Summit team. https://medium.com/@Gibraltar.Blockchain.Exchange/gbx-at-moneyconf-event-dublin-ireland-edfee10dac0b I joined the team at the Startup Grind Europe conference in the Central Hall in Westminster, London. We hosted a breakout session panel titled, “Gibraltar: The Crypto Harbour for Fintech and Blockchain” alongside Paul Astengo, Senior Executive Gibraltar Finance and Co-Chair of the DLT Working Group and George Mcdonaugh, CEO of KR1. https://medium.com/@Gibraltar.Blockchain.Exchange/gbx-at-startup-grind-europe-london-6522d50e5cc6  4. Still out on the road The next two weeks seem just as busy for the team. We have some events coming up and we want to make sure you know where we are, hopefully so you can come down and meet the team. On the 21st June we’re in Warsaw, Poland for the BlockchainNext event where Philip Young has been invited to speak. 27-28th June the team will be in Amsterdam for the Global Blockchain Expo event. If you’re attending make sure you let us know and arrange to meet up with the team on location. We’re always happy to meet FORTs from our community. Keep up with all the latest on our events on our website: https://gbx.gi/#events  5. Traceto.io public sale is under way. Just a quick reminder that the Traceto.io public sale is currently underway. The sale is running smoothly, with 89% sold, and if you’re a KYC cleared account holder on the GBX GRID all you need to do is login and you’ll be ready to contribute. For everything you need to know about the T2T sale, check out the link below: https://medium.com/@Gibraltar.Blockchain.Exchange/everything-you-need-to-know-about-traceto-ios-token-sale-on-the-gbx-grid-updated-cc3ab85392fe  6. STRYKZ Update Unfortunately, as many of you will know, the STRYKZ sale is no longer happening on the GBX GRID. Stryking is a German company and it came to our attention that BaFin (the German financial services regulator) has taken a recent stance in respect of overseas crypto platforms, the long and the short of which means that, in order for there to be certainty in respect of the regulatory position, it is well advised to seek confirmation from BaFin that the token in question is not a regulated financial instrument. It should be pointed out that Stryking acting on its own in its token sale faced no such risks. The advice was therefore that using the GBX Grid to launch their token required this clearance, a process that would have probably taken a few weeks. Although we were confident that Stryking could undertake the necessary steps to achieve this, with Stryking's desire to launch the token sale during the World Cup period which is upon us, it was clear that the timing was not going to work.  The GBX, in agreement with Stryking, therefore elected to withdraw from the token sale to unquestionably ensure adherence to German financial product legislation. While we are disappointed that the STRYKZ token sale will no longer take place on the GBX Grid, we will continue to collaborate with the Stryking team as their exciting project develops.  In a perfect world we would have spotted this before but we didn’t - and no-one else did - it’s tough to be aware of all of the pitfalls without stepping into some of them. Our job at GBX and my job as CEO is to deal with these issues as they emerge - identify the problem, ascertain the risks and make the right decision in the best interests of our stakeholders - Issuers, buyers, sponsors and RKT holders - then put in a process to stop it happening in the future. We spotted the issue - we immediately dealt with it. We learn from this. We move on, stronger. Remember everyone, keep on ROCKing!  Nick Cowan  CEO - GSX Group",False

I know I say this every week, but once again, I can’t believe two weeks have been and gone already. There is so much going on at the moment and as always our community of FORTs continue to show their incredible support and enthusiasm for the GBX project.  Without further ado, let’s get stuck in to the good stuff.  1. A big welcome to the new additions to the team   We’ve been busy building our team and today it’s a great pleasure to be able to introduce you to the latest team members to join us on our journey. I’m sure you’ll all join me in giving them a warm welcome.  Chief Operating Officer – Phil Walker Before joining GSX, Phil had a long career as global lead within operations and marketing for a major global online gaming group. Latterly he was a Managing Director for Ladbrokes Coral.  Group Chief Compliance Officer – Targ Patience Targ has extensive experience as a senior regulator officer and consultant.  Firms that he has worked with include Citigroup Global Markets, London Clearing House Clearnet, Goldman Sachs and KPMG.  Head of Exchange and Listings Authorisation Team – Daniel Torres Daniel’s international business career has spanned regulated financial, crypto and technology sectors , as well  business start ups. His work has taken him across South America, Africa and Europe and we welcome him to Gibraltar.  Head of Customer Relations  – Dionissis Daoussis Dion’s 15 year career as a customer services team leader and supervisor with some of the world’s leading online gaming businesses, makes him ideally suited to create for us a new paradigm in customer services.  2. Blockchain Worx joins the GBX Sponsor Firm network  The 10th Sponsor Firm to be approved in our Network is Blockchain Worx. It’s a great pleasure to welcome the team from the Singapore based company. They provide a range of ancillary solutions including an Anti-Money Laundering Transaction Monitoring system, a Securities Tokenisation platform and an Enterprise Blockchain Innovation Centre to token issuers. That’s not all, as part of their continued growth they are opening an office in Dubai soon, with more offices in Europe already planned.  https://medium.com/@Gibraltar.Blockchain.Exchange/blockchain-worx-joins-the-sponsor-firm-network-c93c0b9b712c  3. Traceto.io public sale coming soon  There’s so much going on at the moment that I wanted to make sure that none of us forget or miss out on the upcoming public sale of T2T, the Traceto.io token sale. The sale starts on the 8th June, that’s next monday.  If you haven’t already done so, make sure you’ve registered and gone through the KYC process on the GBX Grid so as you can take part in the sale. You can get started here https://platform.gbx.gi/register.  Everything you need to know about the T2T sale can be found here - https://medium.com/@Gibraltar.Blockchain.Exchange/everything-you-need-to-know-about-traceto-ios-token-sale-on-the-gbx-grid-updated-cc3ab85392fe  4. STRYKZ is the next token sale on the GBX Grid  It’s great to see the GBX Grid coming to life, and it’s only the beginning. STRYKZ is the next token to be approved and make it to the grid. Stryking is tokenising fantasy sports, with Football Stars, it's live flagship fantasy football competition platform, already creating waves within the football community. The team recently picked up 2 awards at pitch events and the team are working hard across the world getting ready for their upcoming sale, which is scheduled to open to the public during the FIFA World Cup.  https://medium.com/@Gibraltar.Blockchain.Exchange/stryking-to-launch-their-strkyz-token-through-the-gbx-grid-473e48a182df  5. GBX Digital Asset Exchange Soft Launch  It’s with huge excitement that today I can tell you that our GBX Digital Asset Exchange will be opening its doors for a soft launch and exclusive early access next week. I know that this is the news we’ve all been waiting for and the whole team has been working around the clock to make this a reality. The Soft Launch will only be available to 300 retail and select institutional participants. The selection process will be simple, the first 100 people to sign up will get guaranteed exclusive early access and then the next 200 will be selected from all other applicants. Please note: You must already be a KYC cleared GBX account holder.  Keep watching this space carefully as we will be sharing the link to register very soon, together with providing further details on the selection process and potential rewards that we’ll be offering successful participants.  6. Our strategic partnership with Quoine  GBX anticipated that it would take more time to develop its own technology – instead we have made significant progress and will roll out our own interface and trading system ahead of schedule, and reinforces our commitment to a strong relationship with Quoine as we see major strategic opportunities working together including: connecting to the deep liquidity offered on the Worldbook/Liquid platform, and offering dual listing opportunities to our issuers and accessing investors in different geographies.  —  We have more news coming early next week so keep an eye out everyone. Things are definitely heating up and the team are doing an incredible job around the clock to keep us moving in the right direction.  Remember everyone, keep on ROCKing!

Another two weeks have been and gone, it’s incredible how fast time flies. As always we have been hard at work, not just here in Gibraltar, but on the global stage. There were a few key events I want to focus on in this update.  Sponsor Firm Summit  The GBX held its inaugural Sponsor Firm Summit in Gibraltar on the 09/10th May. It was a fantastic event where our Sponsor Firms from all corners of the globe flew to Gibraltar to come together for a two day event. We kicked off with an amazing sunset reception for 100 at the Rock’s highest wine-bar at 450 mts (which can only be accessed by cable car), where the Hon. Albert Isola, Minister for Commerce - HM Government of Gibraltar, welcomed the sponsor firms to Gibraltar. As well as the Minister, Gibraltar PLC turned out in their masses to give our Sponsors a true Gibraltar welcome including representatives from the banking, accountancy and audit, legal sectors and Gibraltar Finance.  See local TV coverage here:  https://www.gbc.gi/news/gbx-hosts-first-sponsor-firm-summit  Having spent my career in London and Tokyo, it never ceases to amaze me how fortunate we are to work in such an awesome place where we have a Government so committed to supporting the fintech space that they can take time out to welcome our friends. If you haven’t come to Gib…..you MUST!  Day 2 was down to business with an all day training session for the sponsors working through the processes on the GBX Grid, the vetting and listing process, marketing and communication strategies and most importantly, bringing the global network together. It’s great to see our Sponsors explore ways that they can leverage each other’s skills and work together to create a truly epic eco-system that can only help token issuers who choose to use the Grid. I can’t wait for the next Summit where I expect double the number!!  https://gbx.gi/news/gbx-sponsor-summit-gibraltar/  TGV Co-organised Event   The GBX team in Asia co-organised another brilliant event with the team from True Global Ventures (TGV). Dusan and his team produce great events that steer away from the traditional model and create a centre for thought leadership and discussion in the space. David Wang, GBX Executive Director (Asia) participated in a panel; ‘The Past, the Present and the Future of Private Markets.’  https://gbx.gi/news/gbx-co-organises-tgv-event-hong-kong/  Consensus: NYC  If you haven’t heard of Consensus, where have you been this week? it is one of the major events of the year for all things blockchain and crypto. Philip Young, Marketing and Business Development Director for the GBX, (whom some of you have met) flew to New York to attend the event. Phil has been updating us about his trip, you can read more here. https://gbx.gi/news/consensus-day-1%e2%80%8a-%e2%80%8aa-quick-update-new-york-city/  https://gbx.gi/news/day-2%e2%80%8a-%e2%80%8athe-crypto-community-together-manhattan/  Token Summit  In true GBX fashion, there was no time to waste in New York City for Philip Young. Back-to-Back opportunities in the city that never sleeps meant that Phil went straight to Token Summit after Consensus. Luckily for us, Phil is a conference veteran and had more than enough energy to hit the ground running before he jets back home to Europe.  https://medium.com/@Gibraltar.Blockchain.Exchange/token-summit-iii-conference-new-york-city-ef68c835d66b  Techinasia 2018, Singapore  It has been a conference heavy couple of weeks and the GBX has not let up on its push to share our vision with the world. It’s not just about the GBX, but also Gibraltar as a jurisdiction. The interest in Gibraltar as a fintech hub is staggering across the globe. The team in Asia, including Andrew Pal, our Chief Strategy Officer (APAC), made their way to Tech In Asia event, where Executive Director, Ben Soh spoke on a panel about regulation and its effects.   https://gbx.gi/news/gbx-singapore-attending-tech-asia-2018/",False

Hey Rockers!   Another busy fortnight – we have had waves of visitors coming to Gibraltar to check out the crypto harbour – ICO issuers interested in joining the Grid, Sponsor candidates, secondary token issuers looking at joining the GBX for trading, tokenised securities issuers keen to know about our plans for GSX later this year and license applicants looking to set up here – it’s so exciting to see the place we call home participating on the crypto global platform within an existing regulatory framework. I have said for a long-time that I see 2018 being the year of the regulator – and my attitude hasn’t changed. Investor protection concerns will drive regulators to continue to take action and in Gibraltar we will see shortly the introduction of token sale regulations as well as enhanced controls for secondary exchanges – all of which we welcome!   Moving on - here’s some of our recent developments that I wanted to share with you in this update:   1. T2T Update We have an update for all those eager to get involved in the Traceto.io token sale, with the details of the sale process and the new date of 21st May 2018 08:15:00 (UTC) for those early access ROCKers! We are excited to get the first GBX Grid token sale underway, you can find out more about the sale here:   https://medium.com/@Gibraltar.Blockchain.Exchange/everything-you-need-to-know-about-traceto-ios-token-sale-on-the-gbx-grid-updated-cc3ab85392fe   2. VFS Acquisition Juno Services Group, part of the GSX Group, has acquired the Gibraltar based fund administrator Vista Fund Services (VFS). This acquisition builds on our comprehensive service offering and strengthens our ecosystem supporting the crypto industry.   Acquiring VFS further solidifies Juno’s position as the largest fund administrator in Gibraltar, bringing more experienced and dedicated team members into our Group.   You can read about the acquisition here.   https://www.gsx.gi/article/9463/vista-fund-services-acquired-by-gsx-group   3. Sponsor Firm Announcement The GBX Grid is continuing to build our Sponsor Firm network to provide more opportunities for token issuers to get launched and listed through GBX. We have recently announced a wave of new Sponsor Firms including some well-established names in the crypto community all of whom have some interesting projects in the pipeline for launching on the GBX Grid. Our Sponsors have also been paying us Application fees and Approval fees – all of which are paid in RKT – so the utility is now in full use, which is really exciting.   We are now up to nine approved GBX Sponsors all of whom can see the unique benefits of what the GBX Grid provides for Token issuers:   A Mark of Prestige - Only quality tokens make the Grid.  Ready Participants - A Large pool of AML/KYC cleared token sale participants from approved jurisdictions.   Risk Mitigation - Collects contributions from participants and handles the distribution of the tokens thereafter.   Maximum Exposure - Focused attention due to maximum of 9 slots on the Grid.   Value Add - Access to the GSX group ecosystem   Exchange Access - Fast track to listing on the GBX Exchange for secondary trading.   I would like to welcome on board AmaZix, Rockchain and VCN as our latest quality Sponsor Firms.   You can read about these latest Sponsor Firms here: AmaZix https://gbx.gi/news/amazix-joins-gbx-sponsor-firm-network/   Rockchain: https://gbx.gi/news/rockchain-joins-gbx-sponsor-firm-network/   VCN: https://gbx.gi/news/venture-capital-network-joins-gbx-grid-sponsor-firm/   4. Sponsor Firm Summit With the rapid growth of our Sponsor Firm network we are having our inaugural Sponsor Firm Summit in Gibraltar on the 9th & 10th May. This is the first event of its kind and brings together our Sponsors and the GBX team to discuss the operational process of the GBX Grid, as well as plans for the future.   5. KPMG Gibraltar eGaming Summit We were pleased to be invited to speak at the eGaming summit sponsored by KPMG. Our Group CFO, Adrian Hogg spoke on “Commercial Applications for the Blockchain/ Crypto Funds”. I was invited to participate on a panel titled “Gibraltar’s Proposition for FinTech” chaired by Sian Jones from the GFSC. It was a fantastic discussion where we spoke about Gibraltar being a hub for fintech innovation. A big thank-you to KPMG for the invitation!   —- As I mentioned in my last update, the GBX team in Asia continue to work 24/7 on getting our technology ready and I hope to make an important announcement in my next update!! Sit tight and keep the faith.   That’s it for this week. I want to thank you all again for being such an important part of this journey with us. Our team are always available for any questions you may have and I can’t wait to share more with you in the coming weeks.  Remember everyone, keep on ROCKing!  Nick Cowan CEO - GSX Group",False

We glad to hear interest. We can explain why do we think GBX will be better then Coinbase, Bitfinex, Binance, Kucoin and all the other exchanges. A couple of factors to bear in mind - firstly we have a very unique proposition given we are a rules based exchange offering a Token Sales Platform and Digital asset exchange with Sponsors with robust rules and secondly the mission of the GBX is to establish a marketplace for utility tokens and cryptocurrencies operating within Gibraltar’s regulatory framework, providing issuers access to a wider community of token buyers, and to create a high standard for entry and a controlled environment with rules for admission and trading, with ongoing obligations and standards of conduct, under the GBX Rules. Please, look at the following video (it might be useful): http://www.gbc.gi/news/gbx-announces-rock-token-sale  The GBX aims to be the world’s first licensed and regulated token sale platform and digital asset exchange, operated by a European Union regulated stock exchange.  Using a sponsor and rules-based system, the GBX will apply to be licensed by the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (“GFSC”) under the Financial Services (Distributed Ledger Technology Providers) Regulations 2017 (“DLT Regulations”), which came into operation on 1 January 2018 in Gibraltar.  More specifically, GBX is expected to be: (a) a global listing and token sales springboard for utility tokens that have satisfied a strict due diligence process and admission process set out in the “GBX Rules”; and  (b) a high-quality digital asset exchange, including a marketplace where issuers of utility tokens, traders and investors can participate with confidence and trust in a platform where the tokens listed have been subjected to an institutional grade approval process.",False

It’s already been two weeks since my last message and so much has been going on. The team have been incredibly busy as always, but I wanted to take this time to give you all an update.  The GBX Grid is now live. [/b] Our Token Launch Centre is now up and running. This is a huge step in the right direction and means we’re ready to ROCK and roll. There is a pipeline of Listing Applications coming in, and we are working hard to review them with the help of our Sponsor Firms.  We’re rolling out new features over the course of this month, but I’m happy to announce that anyone with a verified account can now make deposits to their account, in ETH or in RKT, and we’ll be letting you know soon about BTC deposits too.  As many of you know, the inaugural approved token sale on the GBX Grid, Traceto.io was delayed.  Unfortunate circumstances internally at Traceto.io lead to them taking an executive decision to delay their public sale and to come back at a later date. We have every confidence they are going to come back stronger than ever.  But there’s still so much going on and so much to look forward to.  2. Sponsor Firm Network  Our sponsor firm network is continuing to expand. We have some announcements coming in the next few days about the new SFs that are joining our ecosystem. With new Sponsor Firms will come new token sales and that’s great news for everybody.  These new additions continue to show us, and the world, that Gibraltar is a natural home for this emerging industry.  We’ll be sharing more news about our new SFs very soon.  3. Conferences  The team have been busy once again with events and conferences around the world.  Philip Young and Daniel Evans attended Fintech World Euro Summit London, Blue Chip ICO’s Road Show as the main event sponsors to present the GBX and to take part in a panel about the future of token sales and how standards could be raised in the industry.   https://www.gsx.gi/article/9460/gibraltar-stock-exchange-at-level39-202-fintech-conference  In Asia, it was non-stop as the team took part in Taiwan Blockchain Festival, organised by Blockcity, in Taipei, Taiwan. Ben Soh, Executive Director spoke at the event and the interest in the GBX and Gibraltar was incredible.  https://medium.com/@Gibraltar.Blockchain.Exchange/gbx-team-on-the-panel-at-blockcitys-taiwan-blockchain-festival-58c237c20984  Today, Ben Soh, GBX Executive Director, is speaking at the Singapore Decentralize event. If you’re attending, let us know and make sure you find the team at the event.  https://www.decentralize.sg/#speakers  The GBX team will be heading to London’s Olympia for the Blockchain Expo Global 2018. Philip Young will be speaking on the 2nd day of the event. If you’re attending, keep an eye out for the team and make sure you say hi.   https://blockchain-expo.com/global/  4. Heading to Asia  Later this month I’ll be travelling to Singapore and Japan to continue working with our technology partners QUOINE as we further the development of the GBX Systems. We’re finalising the integration of the GBX Exchange.  I know some of you were asking about the next AMA (Ask Me Anything) and we will be looking at organising one from Japan, so keep your eyes peeled for that.  5. The GSX Group - Blockchain Innovation Centre  We think that building a community requires support from those involved, and to that end we’re ramping up the BIC. The new website is now online (www.bic.gi) and we will be announcing some new events very soon. It’s been so encouraging to see so many people and companies from within the industry in Gibraltar, and internationally, looking to partner with us to develop the community as a whole. It’s going to be a fantastic asset for Gibraltar.  6. Looking to the future  This journey of ours has been moving so fast that sometimes it’s good for us to look back and reflect on just how far we’ve come in such a short space of time. It’s been an incredible journey, but there’s still so much ahead of us.  It really is an exciting time as we grow the GSX Group family, with the development and roll out of new features on the GBX Grid, the upcoming GBX Exchange, new Sponsor Firms coming onboard and our community driven BIC which will be announcing all new educational and community focused events.  The whole team, across the globe, from Gibraltar, Europe and London, through to Hong Kong and Japan, are working hard to keep building the Crypto Harbour to make it the natural home for this emerging industry.  If you have any questions, our community team is here to help. Make sure you’re following us on our online channels so as you don’t miss the latest news and announcements coming soon.  Remember everyone, keep on ROCKing!   Nick Cowan CEO - GSX Group  You can also read the update in our ANN Channel here: https://t.me/GBXannouncements/196",False

Please see this message for details of our plans moving forward:   Nick’s Fortnightly Message to all FORTs (Friends of Rock Token).  Hi Rockers,  I have some exciting news for you all.   I’ll be writing a fortnightly newsletter from now on to keep you up to date with all the latest developments from the GSX Group. That includes the Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange, the Gibraltar Stock Exchange, our new company service provider Juno, the Blockchain Innovation Centre in Gibraltar and of course, all things Rock Token!  Yes, it’s a lot of news and everything is moving so quickly at the moment, that’s why it’s so important to me that everyone in our community knows what’s happening.  It’s as busy as ever at the GSX Group offices. We’re preparing the launch of the GBX platform but this hasn’t stopped the team from travelling around the world and attending some incredible events to promote GBX:   1) The GSX BIC partners with Startup Grind Gibraltar, powered by Google for Entrepreneurs  Excited to announce our first formal partnership for the Blockchain Innovation Centre in Gibraltar. The announcement was made at Startup Grind Gibraltar’s 1 year anniversary.   2) Gibraltar Finance and GBX private cocktail receptions in Hong Kong and Singapore  A fantastic welcome in Singapore and Hong Kong in conjunction with Gibraltar Finance and the Hon. Albert Isola, Minister for Commerce.   > Read the full article https://gbx.gi/news/private-cocktail-reception-hong-kong-singapore/  3) GBX invited to be Judge and Co-Organiser of Global Blockchain Competition   What an honour to be asked to be an integral part of the blockchain community on a global scale.   > Read the full article https://gbx.gi/news/gbx-judge-co-organiser-global-blockchain-competition/   4) Cryptocurrency World Expo Berlin  Philip Young, Marketing Director for GBX spoke to the blockchain community in Berlin.    That’s not all.   5) We also attended Money 2020 in Singapore and Token 2049 in Hong Kong.   But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. It’s been a big month in terms of announcements and developments. These are some of our highlights:  6) First sponsor firms announced  Our first three sponsor firms were announced -KR1, Kession and Broctagon - an integral part of the continued development of our ecosystem. We have more applications in the pipeline, with some exciting partnerships to share with you soon.  > Read the full article https://gbx.gi/news/introducing-first-gbx-sponsor-firms/   —-   7) The GBX Grid Token Sale Platform  Our Token Sale platform is almost ready! See it at https://grid.gbx.gi/  We have already published our Token Sale Rules at https://gbx.gi/documents/. They include everything you need to know about our requirements for token launches.  GBX Grid will be rolled out over the next few weeks in a series of releases. Withdrawals have been enabled as many of you will have seen by being able to withdraw RKT.   Deposits will be enabled in less than two weeks time after which Sponsors will be able to upload the relevant information for the Token Sales.   Thus, you will be seeing gradual roll-out of features over the next 4 weeks, so stay tuned as our first batch of Sponsors and Token Sales come online!  The GBX Trading Exchange  As you all know, we have been working hard with Quoine to get our trading technology ready. We expect to roll this out during April.   Our GBX Exchange Rules are ready and have been published today.  In summary  In terms of business, we are extremely optimistic.  We have a healthy number of Sponsors applying, all of whom have a backlog of ICOs. GBX also receives a large number of enquiries daily, which we can now pass on to our Sponsors.   The next few months are sure to be hard work, but the support from our community, sponsors and stakeholders has and continues to be overwhelming.   Remember everyone, keep on ROCKing!

Every single token sale will have its price peg and cutoff time for having the necessary token balance. At that moment, if you have at least that minimum balance, then you will qualify for the Early Access. This will be announced within each token sale's details It should only be open for RKT holders. --- The Early Access Sale is available to GBX account holders with GBX account balances of at least 1000 USD worth of Rock Token (RKT) before the sale, at 11:00:00 SGT (03:00:00 UTC) on 4th April. Due to time constraints for new account holders who may not be able to obtain RKT in time, for this specific T2T sale, we are also allowing account holders who prefund their accounts with at least 1000 USD worth of ETH to qualify for the Early Access Sale. For account holders who use RKT to participate in the sale, they will be using the RKT to T2T rate. For account holders with only ETH, the ETH to T2T rate will be used instead. GBX undertakes to convert the received ETH in the Early Access Sale from such accounts to RKT for Traceto. --- The platform will be launched in April. --- The GBX aims to be the world’s leading token sale and cryptocurrency exchange which is licensed under a specifically created regime for DLT businesses. It also intends to be the first platform and exchange of its kind run by and according to the principles of a regulated stock exchange. It is also the only platform of its kind to form part of a much larger fintech ecosystem and financing pathway plan.",False

First, the user needs to authenticate his or her wallet address for the withdrawal.

GBX is a subsidiary of the EU-regulated Gibraltar Stock Exchange (GSX).  Launching in 2018, GBX vision encompasses:  (a)    a token sale / ICO platform for utility tokens that satisfy admission rules and a strict due diligence process; (b)    a high-quality digital asset exchange, listing tokens that meet an institutional grade approval process, and (c)     a fully tokenised stock exchange providing a path from initial token sale to funding via traditional bond markets or equity issuances.  The GBX team completed its global roadshow, sharing the message of both its Exchange, and the work of Gibraltar as one of the first jurisdictions to support the new crypto-economy.  At the beginning of January 2018, the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC) introduced a new license regime, and is now one of the first jurisdictions in the world to provide regulatory certainty for companies utilizing Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). DLT Regulations (GFSC).  The GBX will apply for a DLT Provider’s license from the GFSC.  The GBX team is also excited to introduce plans for the RockToken (RKT) serving its ecosystem in three primary ways:  1.  Signal community membership and shared buy-in in the overall vision 2.  Deliver a premium experience for certain users and traders corresponding to their comfort with the industry 3.  Incentivize and reward community members for upholding GBX values of transparency  Please watch out for further news on GBX and the RockToken.
