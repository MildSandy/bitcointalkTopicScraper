But it is what it is.   Recently, the in Telegram chat focused on calling BookiePro a platform within the Peerplays platform.  Which is interesting.  The BOS system can handle more than just sports data and so it is supposed that skinning for ESports is potentially a focus...  Just talk now...but Jonathan mentioned that the past year was unexpected and with the opening of a public community repo, 2 month cycles for dev work might be on the books once we move through the current launch.  Things to think about or not.  But adding a summary every once in awhile on this thread surely won't hurt things...I think...; )",False

The code has been released to the witnesses ( https://github.com/peerplays-network/peerplays/releases ) and should be fully integrated by February 18thish.  After that, it is just a matter of ""Oracle Setup, data proxy linkages, a bit of testing...shouldn't be any show stoppers..."" according to Senter from Telegram (he's a good guy and knows what he is talking about).  So what we're looking at now is movement of code to mainnet.  We won't have live betting outside of a play token to begin with because regulations would leave some people exposed...so they are taking the route that others have taken.  They will release/advertise a free version and whomever wants to find the real money version will.  But that will take some time.  PPY betting will be set up shortly after the BookiePro launch (estimate about first or second week of March) and then BTC betting as soon as we get the sidechain.  I wish we had more information on that but we don't.  We also have two new exchanges within the past few weeks - IDAX and EXrates.

What does this mean?  It means that Peerplays successfully forked over to support the BookiePro code.  I'm going to quote Senter from the Telegram chat from the last several days...      Senter Reinhardt: 💥💥💥💥 BUT(!) I encourage you to give things a day or two to settle. We are currently checking with exchanges to make sure all is well and none of them are hooked to the wrong fork. We are also working to make sure the person who runs the peerplaysdb block explorer tweaks it to get it following the new network fork. It's currently on the old fork.  I think it would be a good idea to leave your PPY where they are as far as exchanges are concerned until they report in that all is well. LiveCoin has been offline for weeks now, so no issue there. I think RuDex/Bitshares is probably fine since RuDex is run by the same folks who run the BlckChnd Witness for us. They should be fully up to date.  The new exchanges we're checking in with. I'll let you know as soon as I know things are solid. No harm in trading on them but for the time being I wouldn't move PPY in or out of them until we make sure all is well.   Senter Reinhardt: Small update for everyone...  In the end everyone pulled through and we have all witnesses on board with the new upgrade to Peerplays. Peerplays mainnet has now been smoothly chugging for about 12 hours and in the end we got a full 100% participation. I was worried about EducatedWarrior there for a bit but in the end he came through.  Also, Jesta, who was an original Peerplays witness but left the team a while back... upgraded/updated the peerplaysdb.com block explorer so that's up and running and fully sync'd to the new chain. Some of you may know Jesta from the larger graphene world. If you talk to him, thank him for all the support he's given to Peerplays.  Finally, we're still working on getting reports back from the exchanges so I still encourage you to not move your PPY on/off exchanges until further notice. Shouldn't take long I'd guess. Well, except for Livecoin... We'll continue to work that.  Anyway, it's been a great day. This is a HUGE milestone for Peerplays. Next step is to get BOS running on mainnet. Super cool.  So...we have the code hardforked.  Now the witnesses are working on integrating data feeds through BOS and hopefully we have a functioning product in the first couple of weeks of March.  BookiePro will launch with a play token for legal reasons but the community is anticipating a fork of the code to enable PPY betting.  The Sidechain has been scheduled for Q2 launch and then we'll have BTC betting on the Peerplays Blockchain!

In December of 2017, eXeBlock had entered into an agreement to deliver four Dapps to the Peerplays Blockchain Standards Association over the next two years. The recent transaction shows that PBSA did not receive delivery of the Dapps that were expected. Instead, eXeBlock opted to divest of its coding assets, specifically the 5050Labs and BTC Sidechain Dapps, and a new blockchain codebase they called XChain. In support of eXeBlocks new direction, when eXeBlock expressed its interest in divesting, it was in PBSA’s best interest to make an offer, which eXeBlock accepted.  [Snip]  PBSA, with the acquisition of the two Dapps, anticipates after a public peer review of the code to have those features available to the mainnet of Peerplays in Q2 of this year.  https://steemit.com/peerplays/@peerplays/an-update-from-pbsa-mutual-termination-of-agreement-with-exeblock  This is pretty great news all around.

Currently we are on v. 0.1.7  However, the update for the wallet was really just an emergency patch because all resources were focusing on BookiePro.  BookiePro, incidentally, operates with a more dynamic apinode approach that will be integrated into the wallet eventually but, for now, Peerplays resources are dedicated towards inventing BOS and Sidechain functionality on a DPOS chain...specifically for BookiePro and which might prove useful for future dapps.  The wallet still could experience downtime but that could also be fixed if we had a larger witness/BP pool...which right now is on the wishlist because the price just doesn't pay the bills. It's one of those things.  Peerplays is a general platform that is right now being very specific in their development.  Take that as you will...-thumbsup-  So yeah.

The Bookie website will go live during Q1 2018, ahead of the launch of the Bookie betting exchange app, which will follow later in the year. The website will allow users to download the Bookie app and connect with other members of the Bookie community.  Bookie will be the world’s first truly decentralized betting exchange, offering users a revolutionary new platform built upon absolute transparency by leveraging the power of the Peerplays blockchain.  As part of the agreement, Vegas Kings will also build the Bookie affiliate website, which will allow fully decentralized, on-chain marketing for Bookie.  Vegas Kings was selected for its extensive experience within the gaming sector, having spent more than 20 years working with clients including Betfair, Ladbrokes and BoyleSports.  PBSA president Jonathan Baha’i said: “To bring the vision of provable fairness to life, we needed to engage a world-class digital agency that shares our drive to create truly game-changing products. In Vegas Kings we have found exactly that.  “This project is not typical, and it demands not just igaming expertise but also a willingness to adapt to technologies that are at the cutting edge of the sector. We are confident that the final Bookie website will serve as an important step in our mission to redefine the very nature of betting exchanges.”  Vegas Kings CEO Ashley Adir added: “We have worked with many of the most successful brands in gaming over the past two decades, so we can recognize truly innovative products with the potential to shake up the whole sector.  “With this in mind, we are delighted to be involved with Bookie from the beginning.

Just go to Peerplays.com and sign for the newsletter.  They show up once a month and usually get summarized in the Telegram channel.  I'll go ahead and copy/paste the December version, which gives insight to Bookie -  Quote News From the Bunker: December to Remember Edition This is the time of year we remember and reflect on the previous 11 months, read about and make our own ""Best of 2017"" lists, and look forward to 2018. And if you're lucky (or unlucky?), make a snowman or two.  It's been an amazing year of growth and innovation for PBSA and the Peerplays blockchain. Working together, PBSA and the wider Peerplays community have developed and implemented new ways of using blockchain technology. Importantly, we've mapped out a route for the Peerplays blockchain and all of its partners & stakeholders to achieve great things in 2018 and beyond.  Keep scrolling for updates on the new Peerplays website, profit share payout, another team announcement, Beyond Bitcoin, and a comprehensive progress report on Bookie.  Peerplays.com Relaunched on November 30th Redesigning and relaunching the Peerplays website was an important project for the PBSA, and one we did not take lightly. Though our focus has been and continues to be on the Bookie app, we recognized that there was room for improvement at peerplays.com and wanted to create a better user experience.    Click to visit the new Peerplays.com As an example, all documentation is now easy to find on our Resources page. All official communications like the Peerplays and Bookie newsletters, along with Peerplays bulletins and other relevant industry news, will be kept on the News page.  In the coming months we will introduce a new Bookie website as well. And just as it was with Peerplays.com, we will not lose sight of our goals. PPY Had its First Ever Profit Share Payout  On November 4th, 2017 at 16:00 GMT, the Peerplays blockchain paid out its first profit share to PPY token holders. Make no mistake, this was no minor event. Also referred to as a rake, the payout wasn’t just the first such occurrence on the Peerplays blockchain, it was the first payout on any blockchain.  We recently tweeted out a great community article from Taconator, and we highly recommend reading that piece for a technical but accessible breakdown of how the rake works. For a VERY technical breakdown, please check out the Peerplays profit sharing documentation here.  The key takeaway is that a rake fee is automatically deducted from money staked on the Peerplays blockchain. In short, the more bets that are placed, the more rake that is allocated to PPY holders. Until Bookie and 50-50 are launched, the profit share will be generated by Helmbet RPS. So grab your preferred Rock, Paper or Scissor and head on over to www.helmbet.com for a PPY challenge with friend and foe alike.  Our Team Keeps Growing, Growing, Growing Last month, we introduced the two newest members of the PBSA team. But last month is old news, and we’d now like to welcome Jim Gill who has taken on Project Manager duties for Bookie. We’re excited for the leadership and experience Jim has already started bringing to PBSA - please join us in welcoming him to the Bunker!  The need for a new Project Manager arose when Karen Keyes was promoted to Operations Manager, where she now oversees all activity for PBSA, Peerplays, and Bookie. Congratulations, Karen!  In addition to these moves, we're looking to build out our team even further. Recruitment is currently underway for the following positions, which can be viewed on LinkedIn:  Intermediate Full Stack Developer Partnership Manager & Analyst These positions offer the opportunity to work in a fast-paced, blockchain focused, startup environment. It doesn't get more exciting than this!   Bookie Year-End Update Looking back at 2017, it’s hard to pick just one thread from the many that make up Peerplays’ growth. But we thought it would be worth giving a bit more insight into the development of Bookie these past 12 months. It’s something we at PBSA get to see up close every day, but which, by necessity, we have not been able to share in similar detail with you all (yet).  Jan: Bookie UI URD finalized & development begins (React/Redux/Electron); Feb: On-chain betting exchange development begins (C++); Mar: Specification of Witness-side Oracle completed & development begins (Python), Apr: Alpha testing of the Bookie UI; Binary markets implemented; May: First iteration of On-chain betting exchange complete; Bookie APIs built-out (Javascript); Jun: QA of On-chain betting exchange, Implementation of single-market exposure; Jul: Bookie UI integration with the On-chain betting exchange; Aug: Ternary+ markets implemented; account features implemented (transaction history, fund management, global settings); Sep: Implementation of In-Play betting; Implementation of multi-market exposure; Oct: Automated creation and management of Events and Markets implemented; Nov: Manual Intervention code implemented; Integration of data feeds starts; Dec: Final skinning of UI; On-boarding content developed; Well, that tells some of the story! Feels like just yesterday that we started writing that URD...    Looking ahead to 2018, PBSA has a seemingly endless list of tasks to get Bookie into the hands of people all over the world. We’ll mention just a few of these so as not to spoil your appetite before the holiday dinners start:  Beta-testing of Bookie (planned for late January, but more news as it comes) Implementation of automated grading/settling Continuing work on the on-chain Referral Program Development of an all-new Bookie website Release of technical documentation As you can see, the excitement is never ending in the Bunker, and Bookie is a major part of that. We can't wait to show the world what provably fair sports betting looks like!  Reminder About the Bounty Program If it's not on your radar yet, we put out a bounty for the Peerplays Core Wallet, through which we want to compile and build the wallet for the Windows/Linux/macOS operating systems.  Send an email to bounty@pbsa.info if you want to participate in this bounty.  More bounty opportunities involving the Peerplays blockchain are on the horizon. Stay tuned to our Twitter and Steemit feeds, among others.  Happy Holidays from PBSA! Whatever you celebrate, we truly hope you have a wonderful and safe holiday season. Thanks for being such a big part of our story in 2017, and we look forward to an even better 2018.  - The PBSA Team  ",False

The previous 30 days included the playing of the first decentralized app (DApp) on the main network called Helmbet which is a classic rock-paper-scissors game published by Pacatum. During that time, 21 tournaments were played for a total prize of 25.5 PPY. 3% of that prize (0.765 PPY) was collected as a rake by the blockchain. 0.76481 PPY, was shared with 679 stakeholder accounts in proportion to their holdings of the core token, PPY. The remainder of the 3% (0.00019 PPY) was too small to distribute with the available numerical precision of the blockchain and is being retained for the next sharing on December 4, 2017.  Details of the Rake Sharing The process of how the Peerplays blockchain shares rakes with stakeholders has previously been described by the Peerplays Blockchain Standards Association (PBSA) in fairly technical manner. The process effectively goes through three phases: (1) collection of the rake by the blockchain, (2) allocation of the rake to stakeholders, and (3) paying out the allocation.  Collection of the Rake When a tournament has successfully concluded, a portion of the prize is collected as a rake by the blockchain. This amounts to 3% of the prize as the blockchain is currently configured. The rake is set set aside until the next periodic allocation cycle.  Allocation of the Rake The allocation cycle is currently configured to occur once every hour. At this time, the blockchain checks to see whether the available rake is greater than a minimum threshold before proceeding. If the threshold is exceeded, then the available rake is allocated to stakeholders in proportion of their stake relative to all others at this moment in time. (Whether the account held any PPY before or after this moment is irrelevant. What matters is what the account holds when this allocation cycle occurs. During this first month, there were 720 allocation cycles.) If an account’s allocation falls below the minimum precision that can be measured for that asset by the blockchain (e.g. 0.00001 for PPY), then that allocation is effectively zero.  To reiterate, whether any particular account receives an allocation during a particular cycle depends on:  (a) the amount of rake collected since the prior allocation;  (b) the proportion of stake held by the account when this allocation cycle occurs; and,  (c) whether that allocation exceeds the minimum precision that can be measured for that asset by the blockchain (e.g. 0.00001 for PPY).  This allocation is internally aggregated by the blockchain with the account’s other “pending payouts” until the next payout cycle.  Paying Out the Allocation The payout cycle is currently configured to occur once every 30 days. At this time, the blockchain distributes the pending payouts to every account that has been allocated since the prior payout cycle.  Next Rake Sharing Although the next distribution of rakes will occur on December 4, 2017, the reader should be reminded that the sharing of rakes occurs every hour that a rake is collected and from every DApp that is integrated with the blockchain.  https://steemit.com/peerplays/@taconator/peerplays-blockchain-distributes-first-rakes-to-stakeholders",False

I signed off from the internet for the most part in the last several weeks...mostly due to personal reasons.  I am sure that by now, you have noticed that Pacatum pushed an update and they are continuing work to improve the dapp.  But likely there won't be much interest in it until BTC betting is implemented which hopefully occurs by the end of the year. Because I and others have little interest in betting more than a few tenths of a Peerplays token just to gamble on an admittedly cool rendition of rock/paper/scissors. And to mention a bit more on that, in case anyone was interested, Eight was actually supposed to be a slew of Eight minigames.  But it got stalled because the code required to ensure that third party devs could stipulate a small percentage for their effort is a bit more complicated then they anticipated.  So all resources are on Bookie and they'll revisit enabling third party access afterwards. Which makes sense.  Bookie is the one that will grab attention.  There is other news.  But a community member has risen on Telegram that is much better at updates then I am.  I fully recommend subscribing to the Telegram channel if you haven't yet.  Senter fills in the blanks between the two week newsletters (which I hope you are signed up for!) and podcast airings.  I will mention something that was posted by Jonathan and I haven't seen specifically discouraged to speak of.  He presented ExeBlock/Peerplays in front of institutional investors at a meetup hosted by Pi Financial.      There is a lot of behind the scenes shuffling going on and as far as I can tell, we are waiting for BTC integration in helmbet/Peerplays wallet, the Exeblock roadmap (for the uninitiated, a private company headed by principle Peerplays designer Jonathan Baha'i, dedicated to creating Dapps for Peerplays), and ultimately, the simultaneous release of the Pro Bookie Dapp and Casual Mobile Bookie App.  Most of this will be spaced out over weeks/months heading into the end of Q1 2018.  So if the thread goes dormant for awhile, I wouldn't sweat it.  Join the Telegram channel for nonchalant updates...: )",False

Also, here are a few things that happened yesterday for those who don't get a chance to follow the Telegram.  1. Countdown for ""HelmBet"", the RPS game with Unity 3D, has been posted.  2. Testnet for Eight seems to be going live.  Link to the Peerplays Bulletin - http://www.peerplays.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Peerplays-Public-Testnet.pdf  Text for those who would rather not click -  Quote Peerplays is managed by block signing “witness” node operators who have been elected by PPY token holders to ensure the successful operation and maintenance of the blockchain.  From the https://github.com/PBSA/peerplays-core-gui/releases wallet, PPY token holders can vote (and also remove their votes) for individual Peerplays witness node operators by selectingthe vote tab and entering a witness account name.  This link contains a list of the Peerplays accounts that are registered to operate witness nodes. Witness account names: https:/ /peerplaysdb.com/witnesses.  To continue to achieve the highest standards of software security for the Peerplays blockchain, PBSA strongly suggests that all Peerplays witness node operators immediately begin to participate in a parallel public “testnet”blockchain(s).  Independent software developers may create, distribute and support front - end applications that “plug-in” and communicate directly with the Peerplays blockchain, using API libraries written in languages such as Javascript, Python, andUnity to name a few. These developers may choose to support “testreleases” of such front-end apps by contributing a compiled version(s) for public beta testing on the Peerplays public testnet(s).  The distribution of testnet core token(ie.“PPYTEST”) maybe managed by self-selected individuals or groups within the Peerplays witness community, while the remainder of the codebase for the testnet mirrors the live Peerplays Blockchain.  This information about how to operate a graphene public testnet may be modified to support Peerplays-graphene.  Self-selected individuals or groups within the Peerplays witness community may then choose to operate a private faucet(1, 2) to deliver PPYTEST tokens from the parallel public testnet to independent software developers or associated parties to support their use of the public testnet.",False

Currently, Eight (Dapp infrastructure and RPS) and Bookie (decentralized sports betting) are the expected releases this year with Sweeps (Decentralized Lotto) due sometime early next year.  There is some interesting news that was released today on the Telegram channel though...  Quote eXeBlock’s President and CEO Jonathan Baha’i was the founder and principal designer of PeerPlays, a leading blockchain technology or DAPP designed to be used widely throughout in the gaming industry.  Alexei Dulub, lead front-end programmer in the development of PeerPlays, will be a key member of eXeBlock’s senior management team.  eXeBlock employs a team of blockchain programmers currently developing two innovative blockchain DAPPs.  eXeBlock will release proof of concept and white papers outlining the operating parameters of the first DAPP by the end of the calendar year, and the second in the first half of next year.  Specifics relating to the DAPP’s purpose, market potential and operating protocols will remain confidential until the white paper release date.  Further, eXeBlock has plans to launch a minimum of two blockchain based DAPP each year. Link to Canadian Press Release  Essentially, a private company is dedicated to producing more Dapps which means there might be more in the pipeline then what I listed above...which is pretty awesome.  Here is a link to Jonathan's Steemit post on the topic - https://steemit.com/peerplays/@jonathan.bahai/my-new-roll-as-ceo-of-exeblock-and-what-it-means-for-peerplays  It does kind of seem like things are moving slowly but I think that they are getting the infrastructure ready (which doesn't really require a ton of updates) and things are getting ready to start popping.  Pretty exciting!  Edit to Add - Quote from: Moht on August 21, 2017, 09:23:48 PM I'm not sure about dividends... I do not even see a location in the wallet where this may show up.  Don't quote me but I am pretty sure that the dividend code is inherent within the blockchain which means that dividends will just automatically show up and be found as a wallet transaction wherever that is listed.  I don't there is a dedicated space...unless you are talking about dividends from crypto other than PPY (like BTC and whatever else gets voted on).  If that is what you are referring to then I think there will be a wallet upgrade when that functionality is ready (which was mentioned to be Q4 of this year...probably/hopefully around Bookie release).  But that is my presumption/guess. I don't actually know.",False

I'm running to be a witness for Peerplays! I have sent out my campaign to reddit and steemit, but I thought y'all would like to know about my witness node as well.     If you want to take a look at my full campaign post, please go to https://steemit.com/@jburr-witness. The first post is my original campaign notice. I won't go into full detail here, but I will highlight the things that make me different from other witnesses.  1. Profit sharing: I will be sharing 5% of the ppy earned through the ""sweeps"" app (a lottery-like app that will be supported on the Peerplays blockchain).  Entries into this lottery will be based on the voting power that is directed toward my witness.  The more you vote for me, the greater chance you have of winning! No other Peerplays witness is doing this, and as far as I know, neither are they for steemit!  2. Escrow: I will escrow 60% of my ppy for 6 months from when it is generated to ensure that I will not flood the market. The more PPY held from exchanges, the more that each and every ppy is worth, so in effect this is making you profit as well!  3. I have enlisted a support team to make sure my witness is running 24/7 365. I realize that I cannot singlehandedly be looking after my witness all day everyday forever, and so I have gotten a support staff on-board that will be able to deal with any technical problems as soon as they occur. This should prevent anything more than the occasional couple of missed blocks.  Every problem will be dealt with promptly and transparently.      If you have any other questions, please let me know and I will try to answer them.  And if you want to know how to vote, please see another steemit post of mine https://steemit.com/peerplays/@jburr-witness/current-voting-status-how-many-lottery-tickets-would-you-get. Included in this post is a detailed report of the current votes in favor of jburr-witness, so that you can get a feel for how much your ppy stake will comprise of the current voting power.

I have no problem with waiting two, five, or even ten years for a project I'm invested in to develop, launch, or fail so long as I and other investors are kept up to date. Plenty of project updates?  Really?  Where?  White paper, where?  I see video content and blog only reinterating a ""pricing"" problem in the current market. Please provide a link to your latest updates (not the six month old one you provided, which says nothing about the progress you've made).  Just a simple statement like ""Team making great progress on blockchain software."" is better than nothing.  Lack of regular and pertinent updates, specifically on the progress of a project, will be one of numerous reasons why the feds will eventually impose tough regulations on ICOs.",False

I am a newbie.  The fact of the matter is that I'm into this project for twice as much as I intended.  I bought into the ICO near the end of Tier 2 when there was a serious backlog of Bitcoin transactions.  I got FOMO and doubled down hoping my initial buy-in would be refunded during the 12-hour grace period that was to follow the end of crowdfunding.  Instead the deadline was extended and I'm in for twice as much $$ as intended.    I was attracted to crypto for the transparency and audibility of it.  The alt-coin community seems to embrace it too.  The lack of communication since the end of crowdfunding implies a lack of transparency with this project. I don't think this token release is hours, or even days away.  Since I made my ""donations"" to this project nothing has gone as stated.  Crowdfunding did not end when, or as promised, there have been two missed delivery dates for the token release and really weak communication through obscure channels during all of it.

I'd like to offer my .02 (for what it's worth), from someone who's been skeptical of ICOs; but also from a fairly early investor in both BitCoin ($110) & Ethereum ($5).....  PeerPlays seemed to have a good plan in place, quality developers committed, and a timeline with specific dates outlines.  So, in that sense, the checks and balances appeared to be there.    When it comes to all ICOs in general, one of the biggest concerns/risks (if not, THE biggest) is actual launch.... (1) Will it actually take place at all (2) Will it take place on schedule as promised.    Of course a 7-day delay is going to raise concerns with investors, especially when the delay wasn't actually announced until the day of the proposed launch.  Limited communication from the creators will also lead to added concerns.   Others have noted that some launch delays are somewhat ""normal"".   But, IMO, it's worth noting that ICO's are a fairly new concept in the eyes of many investors, as well as potential investors.  Therefore, I'm not entirely sure it's been fully established as to what's ""normal"" when it comes to ICOs (successful ones, reputable ones, or otherwise).  The sample size is limited (when it comes to long term success)  In the end, nothing is going to change the fact that when someone invests in an ICO, they entrusting their money with the people initiating the offering; and they're trusting those people to meet their promises.  Most investors would assume that a team of quality developers should be able to accurately forecast (give or take a few days) when a launch will take place (based on many factors)  It's only natural that several delays in the promised launch date, will lead to; (1) less confidence in the people who initiated that particular offering   (2) less confidence that their money is in good hands (3) less confidence in the overall ICO market in the future (due to the lack of recourse investors have if the creators don't follow through).    As I said, I'm not sure if anyone can confidently state as to what is (or isn't) ""normal"".  In the end, I truly believe precedents are being set, for better or for worse.  When it comes to Peer Plays, I hope a good one is being set; and that there are no further delays.  ",False

They are just concerned that their money is in safe hands; and concerned that the ICO timetables actually mean something.  It should be noted that good communication is not only important, it's an absolutely necessity if investors are to accept launch delays for reasons of development (it's the reason these projects have marketing/PR people).  Communication is even more vital in the ICOs market compared to institutional venture capital or IPOs with underwriters.     The Peerplays blockchain was released last night, and it is producing blocks and running fine. This is encouraging news and should ease people's concerns (does mine), that is assuming investors are aware of this news.  Without communication, FUD is inevitable when timetables are just ignored or changed.       Only the command line version has been released. They said the GUI should be released soon (probably today), and that they simply had a small bug to fix in it. I'm sure many investors are hoping its released today.  Most have no reason to believe it won't be (aside from the ""after 6/7"" update to the launch date of 6/1) .   @redwbl - For someone that likes to come across as ""investing in the ICO"", you sure do like to spread a lot of FUD about Peerplays. How does spreading FUD seem like a good idea if you did indeed invest in the ICO? Take a step back and think about how FUD can harm your investment. . When it comes to the release delay, I don't think anyone can say very much that will negatively effect their investment (or the future demand for the cyrpto), particularly anything that could effect it anymore than a delay itself would.  I don't see how it could when the Crpyto hasn't even hit the market.   I think you are most likely a shill, and this post is a waste of my time, but.. Posts with updates of the project development aren't a waste of time (regardless of whether or not it's in a response to a troll).    I also don't think minor delays will negatively effect PPY as much after it's actually launched.     Peerplays has a good team behind it. Of course.  This is one of the reasons people did invest.  Without good developers, many ICO's are ignored, especially by this community.  This is also a reason people why there are delays with no updates.     Making announcements and press releases may not be one of their strengths, but they are good where it matters most (development) Sure, development is where it matters most, more so when it's actually launched.   While announcements and press releases regarding the launch date may be easy for you (and other devs) to write off as less-important, it's unrealistic to assume that a large percentage of investors will see it the same way.   Ignoring announcements and updates (esp. when it comes to launch delays) creates the FUD (that you were speaking about) on it's own.     The community can carry the torch as far as advertising and PR It is more important that they focus on development, seeing as though there are a few competing projects. Myself (and other investors) can appreciate the importance for good development.  I find re-assuring that development is being worked on as diligently as you say it is.   However, you can't ignore that being the first-to-market, meet timetables, and investor confidence an important aspect when it comes to the competition.  You can't ignore that fact that a proper blend/balance between business and tech is needed for something like this to be successful. [/quote]",False

I find this to be a discouraging message when it comes to expanding crpyto marketplace; and even broadening the idea of ICOs.    Sure, there are successful ICOs, unsuccessful ICOs, and even total scam ICOs.   The greater number of successful ICO's (while minimizing the number of large scam ICOs), the more the world will embrace the benefits of crpytos.  Stating that an ICO like PeerPlays (which as you pointed out, has a good dev team behind it) could just as easily never launch, is not a good message to convey.    It's human nature, and completely inevitable that most investors will expect things to happen as promised on the timetable, particularly the launch.  That will never change (as much as devs would like it to).  This is even most true when talking about the non-institutional money that is invested in ICOs.    IMO, if all investors are to expect long development delays, it won't positively effect the ICO market as a whole.   Even more, investors getting used to ICOs w/ good devs backing them, never even launching (ie: being scams) will destroy the ICO market.  At the very least, it will negatively effect new money brought into the global crypto market globally;  as a result, discouraging the world from investing in the countless number of promising devs that the crypto space has to offer.  Stating that investors should be happy that their investments isn't a total loss is not a sentiment this community should be embracing.  ",False

Not ONE SINGLE member of the peerplays team has ANY experience of the sports betting or gambling sector (at least the guys at Gnosis actually ran Fairlay for a years to get their feet wet). How has that not caused red-flags to every single investor in this? It is alarmingly stupid. Do you guys know that the majority of all gambling turnover comes from Chinese market and the majority of this is based upon slot games. The turnover is vast and we already see the Chinese government taking a very keen interest in BTC to stop capital flight. Peerplays tells you that they are aimed at the ""global"" market but every market is different and has different tastes and in China even having the wrong colours on your website for gambling will put people off because superstition and tradition is still far more important to people than the technology platform they are using.  Regarding the European market, first of all its regulated harder than any other jurisdiction in the world and no doubt each gambling commission will start to draft their own licensing laws in tandem with their local governments regarding the policing of this space. As we see with all other non-licensed gambling companies they have their IP's black listed, blocked and fines imposed. Unless Peerplays adheres to that licensing structure they also will face that situation and as sad as it sounds to decentralised zealots the ISP's are centralised, regulated and government controlled. This brings me on to my next point: marketing.  Where the hell is Peerplays marketing plan? Clearly its hype and word of mouth. That didn't get a single gambling company anywhere. The average cost to get a foothold in the UK gambling market is circa $25m a year on a budget so dream on etc... The two main approaches are affiliates and using sponsorship. Affiliation on this peerplays platform is impossible so some other service companies will have to build CRM's to facilitate this, in a smart way, on top of the platform but that goes against the whole decentralisation ethos. Regarding sponsorship, if you look at the whole of the English Premier League you will see vast swathes of team shirts with Asian betting sponsors. The reason for this is because of the succes of this league in Asian countries. It is the most watched league on Earth. This gives you marketing access to huge numbers of potential customers but most importantly it gives your brand integrity which is fundamental to access to Asian customers. Some people will argue, rightly, that provably fair gambling is the best thing for integrity but human beings dont work like this en masse (look at Trump being president). In order to sponsor such a team for your brand you legally have to have a UK gaming license so pretty much mass marketing is impossible for peerplay to the worlds biggest market of customers of sportsbetting.  Concerning the US, well there is a reason why every single sports book from 5Dimes to Betcris, that offers bitcoin, is hiding in Costa Rica with indictment charges from the US federal government so i think we are clear about the US standpoint. Look at the mess that is Daily Fantasy here in the US to understand those complexities and then having to route your FIAT through the US payment system if you do actually want to convert, er no thanks. There's a reason Big Joe on the corner is taking your bets.  I'm sure most people will disagree with me because you are all gambling experts by pulling quotes off the internet that gambling is ""booming"" and im sure i will be wrong on various things but I see hardly any sensical and experienced debate for this past and second (seriously dubious from my perspective regarding the ICO structure also) ICO but a debate is something i want to stimulate. I agree the bitshares exchange and other similar technologies will be a disruptor but i wouldn't be investing in an energy company my local bar man just started.

That is in the OP.  Whether or not they have any experience in sports betting or the gambling sector, their experience does not preclude past interest in the industry nor does it suggest that they are incapable of it.  In fact, I live in an area where Native American casino's are all the rage (one just sprung up and a few more are slated in the next few years).  They are profitable and their owners, the respective Tribes, arguably knew nothing about the gambling sector prior to becoming profitable.  So I am unsure that the resumes one should be interested in should be focused solely on sports betting and gambling.  In fact, I would prefer to see massive experience in tech because this is new and different ground that relies on tech.  Quote How has that not caused red-flags to every single investor in this? It is alarmingly stupid. Do you guys know that the majority of all gambling turnover comes from Chinese market and the majority of this is based upon slot games.  If you would like to debate, then please provide numbers.  As far as I know, the sports betting estimations I have seen are exclusive of slot machines and thusly that argument doesn't mean anything.  Slots in US casino's are also huge and take up a large portion of casino real estate in brick and mortars.  But no one here is talking about them because they're irrelevant for the purpose of Peerplays.  Quote The turnover is vast and we already see the Chinese government taking a very keen interest in BTC to stop capital flight.  True.  But are they prepared to handle decentralization?  Westerners can already communicate with them via WeChat and upcoming decentralization efforts will increase that, despite their efforts (Maidsafe comes to mind but there are others).  The Chinese can also still buy BTC.  I am unsure why you brought this up.  If anything, Peerplays incentivizes enduser participation because the Chinese government cannot enforce the laws in every other country when decentralized behavior is occurring. Hence, it doesn't matter.  Let them stop nodes.  Others will spring up and nodes in countries that they have no jurisdiction will remain.  Quote Peerplays tells you that they are aimed at the ""global"" market but every market is different and has different tastes and in China even having the wrong colours on your website for gambling will put people off because superstition and tradition is still far more important to people than the technology platform they are using.  Interesting point and one I am familiar with...but I also don't think it is of the import that it needs to be considered here...for many reasons that would result us in getting into a cultural discussion that centers on Theology/Non secular societies.    Quote Regarding the European market, first of all its regulated harder than any other jurisdiction in the world and no doubt each gambling commission will start to draft their own licensing laws in tandem with their local governments regarding the policing of this space. As we see with all other non-licensed gambling companies they have their IP's black listed, blocked and fines imposed. Unless Peerplays adheres to that licensing structure they also will face that situation and as sad as it sounds to decentralised zealots the ISP's are centralised, regulated and government controlled.  This is an argument that I have seen before when discussing the decentralized nature of communication and dissent.  I've never heard the term zealot before but it should be considered that BTC itself still hasn't been shut out of the global audience.  There really hasn't been a 'non licensed gambling company' that was decentralized and black listed.  We're in uncharted waters here and the laws regarding crypto currencies as it pertains to gambling are still unclear.  Many laws preventing gambling, at least in the US, prevent centralized institutions from participation (meaning it is actually legal to gamble in the US online)...meaning that I can't get a credit card company or bank to support it.  As much as technicalities are a pain in the ass, they are relevant - and in this case, there is nothing stopping me as a US citizen from using BTC to gamble.  In fact, the 2006 law that many people point to in order to prove that gambling is illegal in the US is mostly misinterpreted.  It's a law that prevents banks from moving funds from a source where illegal betting may have occurred.  In addition, all of the laws in the US focus on servers located in the US.  This is a very long and convoluted topic, as you can see, but to save having to write a few more paragraphs at this point, I'll mention that current laws aren't centered upon the individual (except maybe a few state laws and the worst case of individual prosecution that I have heard about was a $500 fine for an individual who won more than $100K in North Dakota) and don't even come close to mentioning crypto currencies.  The mess regarding Daily Fantasy is precisely predicated on the fact that it is not mentioned in the legislation...which is why technicality of law is important.  Quote Where the hell is Peerplays marketing plan? Clearly its hype and word of mouth. That didn't get a single gambling company anywhere.  Maybe they want to work before they talk more.  Many of the wildly successful crypto ICO's (I'm looking at 15 minute sellouts here) still have nothing to show and aren't functional.  Speculative only.  I'll leave this point to speak for itself.  Quote I'm sure most people will disagree with me because you are all gambling experts by pulling quotes off the internet that gambling is ""booming""  No need to be condescending.  I think that the biggest thing I have noticed is that people don't take the time to read more.  I am sure many do but the idea of this project spans through multiple discussion forums and projects.  I had no idea that the BTStalk forums were so active when this thread was first posted.  Just the simple fact alone that the founders originated their is grounds to extrapolate that they are not in it for the quick anything and that the project is anything but something that should be considewred solely speculative.  Even if not, there are many other indications.  While I will agree that I am not an expert on gambling or even crypto currency; I will concede that point; I don't think that there isn't enough information here.  They have been transparent weekly through the BTCTalks and have searchable reputations.  Whether Peerplays works or not?  I don't know.  But I really like the idea of Eight being released in August as a means to display the Unity engine and allow dev API access.  Then we have Bookie being released.  Peerplays, from what I have observed, has moved in a few different directions with the intention of releasing multiple aspects while others start defining what rhetoric they will use for their project announcements.",False

Professional gambling syndicates that drive the global pricing market through asia and exchanges like Betfair use armies of quants, monte-carlo & markhov chain simulations to predict the best inferred probabilities of the market. The three largest gambling syndicates in the world rake in around £100m a year in profits. The knowledge they bring to the market trickles down through all the brands and pricing offered by every book. This is soccer gambling. To under estimate the complexities surrounding this operationally is a huge mistake. 2. The largest turnover area for sportsbetting globally is through live-betting, so this is making an in-game bet. This may not be how US bettors see the market but Bet365, the largest sportsbetting operator in the world ($1.8bn turnover in 2016) makes 75% of their profit during live betting. In order to facilitate live betting using decentralised blockchain will be impossible, the reason being that you need to use realtime data to run these markets efficiently and with integrity. In order to collect this data that drives 100% of all in-play betting across ALL sportsbetting brands globally you need scouted data from inside the stadium. Three companies pay tens of millions to sports associations to have this data to sell to the gambling industry officially. IMG and Sportradar, for example, have $100m contracts with ATP (tennis) and NBA (Basketball) for this very reason. They in-turn resell this data to sport betting companies to use in their automated, trading algorithmic betting engines. This speed and integrity of data is not available to scrape on the every day web, especially for tennis. The companies are forbidden from selling any data to gambling companies that have no licenses. The only betting markets that could be driven by peerplays would be non-live events, which may be ok for the US market, but is useless for a global market, especially in Asia and Europe, that expect to be offered live markets and events to bet on. The argument will come back that oracles will be used to push this level of data but its impossible to parse all this data real-time without the help of the official data resellers. 3. China has the worlds biggest gambling market, you just need to google it. Its obvious. All of this market is online. When i refer to slots i refer to online slots and all the gambling i refer to is in regards to online. 4. In Asia many gamblers use agents because as sad as it sounds, gambling is scourge on most Asian societies, especially in China. Gambling is related in China to superstition, fortune and luck. Many agents facilitate credit down to their end users to bypass the need for constant payments and the biggest guys that bet as VIP's (massive turnover) also use the credit system. They have and agreed limit and will normally settle on that threshold every Monday. Bitcoin sportsbooks have definitely been a great new avenue to cut out some of the agents - mainly Japanese market - but the unformalised structure in China (generally run by triads) is deeply embedded in the culture and society. As i mentioned technology needs to be able to localise its product to fit certain markets - as any brand, for any product needs to. Time after time European operators, who are much more sophisticated technologically and operationally have tried to take on China but failed every time because they do not understand the culture and localisation needed to adapt to this market. There are currently 3000 sportsbook brands in China and in order for peerplays to make any global impression it needs to take this market seriously and not just really solely on tech. 5. I think many backers of Peerplays are potentially from markets where the gambling market is hidden or immature for online. I would regard the US and Canada as prime examples. In contrast to European users the experience of gambling online will feel archaic but when you look at Betfair, which is essentially its self a technology company that focuses on gambling they are already looking at blockchain technologies. Don't take for granted that these huge sportsbetting companies that have to handle 100k's transactions and bets per minute are in the dark about technology. Bet365, for example, is now entirely built on Erlang (the same language Whatsapp uses) to give customers all over the world the exact same QoS. They are all working on projects and with partners that are looking at centralised blockchains, like Ripple etc. Bet365 reinvests circa $20m - $30m a year back into their IT infrastructure. 6. I question the structure of the ICO but i feel the developers of Peerplay are probably genuinely trying to have an honest stab at this market but i think their approach is naive in regards to operations, regulations / legalities (we are even yet to see what the US gov will say about ICO's actually being legal themselves yet - Ontario has already said anything not-capped sub $5m could be problematic legally) and the complexities of a global sports betting market. 7. Peerplays could be a great technological accelerator platform for many sports betting companies, i agree. Graphene looks to be a great blockchain to help accelerate the scalability of small operators who are languishing on poor and out dated platforms but they haven't identified this as an aim. As previously mentioned many existing gambling companies are already looking at non coin based ledgers already. 8. These are my opinions, i do not know about any telegram chat room. I generally only use the gambling forums here where i try to explain gambling, probabilities and highlight how bad the current crop of bitcoin platforms are. I know there is certainly vast room for improvement for betting for crpyto users, i just don't agree that DAPPS are the way forward for this space. I do though think the Gnosis solution is a much better business structure. Their white paper, members of their team and experience would give me a much stronger sentiment that they will succeed to some extent.",False

Re: Live betting  Speed Concerns: dPoS is a highly efficient consensus algorithm. dPoS blockchains have irreversible transactions after 60 seconds (with 30 witnesses and 3 seconds per block). This amount of time is sufficiently fast enough to enable a lot (majority?) of bets that can be conceived for live betting. In slower sports such as Baseball or American Football, pretty much any conceivable live bets would be possible.  Data Feed Concerns: I think that you understate the availability of free live statistics for sporting events on the internet which can be sourced from non-gambling related websites. Sure, the data will not be as instant or detailed as the data that the live sports betting giants have access to, but it will be possible nonetheless to have a ""dumbed down"" live betting market.  Market Share Concerns: Even though implementing live betting will certainly be hard (or in your words- impossible), there is still quite a big gambling market outside of live sports betting. The Bookie dApp covers only one facet of the gambling industry. 1% of a trillion dollar industry can still make a lot of money for Peerplays shareholders. I'm not only talking about non-live sports betting, but also regular sports betting, prediction markets, casino games, and slots. I think you are focusing too much on sports betting, which does indeed pigeon hole the project if that is all they planned to implement. But I think their plans are much bigger than only sports betting.  Re: Slots  You seem to be under the misconception that slot games are impossible to concept on a decentralized peer to peer blockchain. I think that you are wrong. Effectively, for a slots game all you would need is your own blockchain (or sidechain), and a cryptographic protocol to autonomously generate random numbers, autonomously ""police"" the game, and autonomously control the house's bank roll. Modern-day slot machines are in essence just fancy RNGs. I will explain how a peer to peer slot game could work. A similar system can be utilized to implement any game of chance you could conceive (casino card games, slots, etc.)  Leverage a network of Masternodes (or delegates) to generate random numbers. Each of them puts up collateral so they have something at stake to participate honestly for a percentage of what the house wins over the long term. The more Masternodes (or delegates) that are included on the generation of one random number results in the random number being more secure (more likely to be random) and less efficiently generated, and the less number of Masternodes (or delegates) that are included on the generation of one random number results in the random number being less secure (less likely to be random) but more efficiently generated. A happy medium can be found through beta testing as far as security versus efficiency.  As long as one participant that participates in the generation of any one certain random number is honest, then the number generated will be truly and provably random. This can be done using multiple very basic and studied cryptographic protocols, such as the ones proposed here: https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/412/verify-product-without-revealing-multipliers/10553  Split the total supply of the blockchain in two parts, one part will be autonomously controlled by peers in the network on behalf of the house, and the other part will be distributed to shareholders and gamblers. This creates a bankroll that is autonomously controlled for the house, and tokens that investors can invest in and gamblers can buy to gamble with.  Let's take for example a very simple slots game whose jackpot has 0.032% chance of hitting (5 reels with 5 symbol with 1 line), then we can expect to hit the jackpot in the long run once every 3125 spins. Generally, top tier jackpots are somewhere around 90% to 95% percent of the amount of spins it will take on average to hit them, so, let's say we pay out 95%  of the total spins it takes to hit the jackpot of the long run for every 1 coin wagered (or 2967.80 coins). Now that we know the odds of winning the jackpot, and the amount we will payout if the jackpot is hit, we can now calculate our EV (expected value from each spin as the house):  99.968% of the time the house wins the user's bet amount of 1 coin. 0.032% of the time the gambler wins the jackpot winning 2966.80 coins (the 2967.80 coin jackpot, minus 1 coin he wagered to win it)  The house's EV = [99.968% (chance of winning)  * 1 coin (profit if the house win)] + [0.032% (chance of losing) * -2966.80 coins  (profit if the house loses)] 0.99968 -  0.949376 = The houses EV from each 1 coin spin = 0.050304 per coin wagered  This equates to a house edge of 5.0304%. Thus, following the Kelly Criterion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion), the house should never risk more than 5.0304% of our bankroll for every spin the gamblers do. Delegates will continuously publish price feeds of the Peerplay token value (or a Peerplay sidechain) as in Bitshares, and the median price feed is used to then calculate the max bet. After every spin, this max bet is continuously calculated and updated.  Say the autonomously controlled house bankroll is worth $1,000,000 and each coin is worth $1. Following the kelly criterion for optimal bankroll growth, the max win should be 5.0304% of our bankroll- or $50,304. Since 1 spin can possibly 2966.8x the gambler's money, the max bet would be $50,304 divided by 2966.8 which equates to a 16.95564244303627 coin max bet. To account for blockchain confirmation and network propagation delays, the max bet can be further reduced to stay on the safe side.  Once the autonomously controlled house bankroll grows above $1,000,000, gamblers/shareholders that own the other $1,000,000 half of the coin supply can vote what happens with the profits. They can choose for the profit to be paid in dividends to gamblers/investors, or for the surplus to be added to the autonomous house bankroll which results in the allowance of slowly increasing the maximum bet. There are benefits to both choices. In the former, profits made by the house are immediately paid out to investors/gamblers. With the latter, profits can increase over time as the maximum bet increases and whales come along to utilize the increasing maximum bet limits.  In summary... slot games, card gambling games, etc, are all possible in a decentralized peer to peer manner. I think that it is the intention that after Bookie is released, Peerplays will go after other gambling markets since sports betting is only one facet of a bigger overall industry.  Re: Marketing  You argue that since Peerplays doesn't have a huge marketing budget it will go no where. However, you failed to deduce that cryptocurrencies (or DACs) work differently from centralized privately controlled companies. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, NEM, and Litecoin have generated >$1 billion evaluations with no marketing budget. The answer is simple... cryptocurrencies are marketed by word of mouth and the network effect. By allowing people to invest in a cryptocurrency or DAC, they are then sure to at least tell a few people about their investment. One of these people invest themselves and tell three of their friends. This network effect grows parabolically as more people hear about it and invest, or when gamblers share how little house edge there is, how the games are provably fair, and how they don't have to worry about shady centralized/offshore gambling companies (many of which have took the money and ran or operated on fractional reserves and eventually imploded.)  Furthermore, once the media starts picking up and investing in the cryptocurrency or DAC themselves, this parabolic curve intensifies. Once Peerplays has a working product, assuming it is the first to market in the cryptocurrency industry, then I venture to say it will get a lot of attention from gambling-oriented media.  Re: Gambling Industry Experience  It is more important that the Peerplays DEVELOPMENT team have the technological chops to implement their ideas. The business part will figure itself out through community involvement and user feedback. I'm sure they have general business experience anyways, and with enough time spent researching any industry is digestible. There are a lot of great minds around, and as long as the developers digest and consider what is brought to their attention, then I think there are no problems there.  Re: The Chinese Market  I think that you bring up a good point about the Chinese market and their superstitions. Similar to Bitshares, since Peerplays is built on Graphene tech, different front ends will be fairly easy to implement. So, a frontend in Chinese with all of the proper colors and such won't be too hard. Did you know that Bitshares and Graphene tech is pretty popular in China compared to most other ALT coins? I expect some of this popularity to trickle down to Peerplays. bitCNY historically has a higher market cap and daily volume than bitUSD by a long shot (for instance- today bitCNY has $608k volume and bitUSD only has $208k.) Also the Chinese account for a large amount of activity and volume in Bitshares. For instance, today China accounts for about $23 million of Bitshares' $38.8 million total volume. Bitshares is one of the most popular ALT coins in China, if not THE most popular one. The Chinese subforum on Bitsharestalk has 38,749 Posts in 3471 Topics... I am sure a decent amount of the Chinese Bitshares community invested in the ICO and will have incentive to garner local interest.",False

Today, as you noted in price, the project would be coming into the market with a launched blockchain and a very solid roadmap this year at $30m which by todays standards places the project at #34 on Coinmarketcap.  Regardless this does bring us in at less than where we left off in the market to give us room for growth considering we have now had six months of further development on top of that.  This is fairly reasonable for something this far along in development and about to launch into production.  As for your other commentaries about most for devs and angels seems a bit exaggerated. About 33% is from people who initially funded the prototype in our presale, and 16% is to founders which are locked up for a year. Doesn't constitute most.  Aside from all of these things. This is a profit sharing blockchain. The first ever. Holding a PPY token means getting a basket of the most used crypto currencies out there be it BTC, ETH, DASH, or BitUSD.

But lol, this is quite MISLEADING for new buyers. They think the past ico was sold for 2 and 3 dollars and now its only 5$. So its possible to buy. But in reality the price already pumped up to 41 dollar when their OWN exchange halted. I think they had it all planned to pumped to price up before freeze the exchange so they can profit from the 2nd ico for the public. If you read the whole thread people were suprise the price went to $41 and right after it get freeze. Someone bought over 60 btc at the end. Dont you guys think one of the members could just pump the price up before freezing and strike millions with 2nd ICO?  Yes thats possible. All the 1 million token are increase 10x. So there will be 10million  tokens. But they say maximum 9million. I wonder where the 1 million tokens went since the tokens increase 10x  So previous price of 1 token on the exchange was $41 Since its all User-Issued Assets (UIA) the whole 1million token its change 10x to 10million, so the price will be in reality 1 token will be 10 new tokens, each of $4.10 but i guess they upgrade it to $5 they need to make money from the end pump at least. I meant, which idiot will buy 60 btc when the btc price was $600 and not complain here why the exchange is freezing. He bought 3k coins means with the 2nd ICO he will have 30k new coins.

Only 2.5x the pre sale. Seems reasonable but if you know the price is already 25x of there pre sale its too risky.  Seems a good project but shady to freeze the price at peak without announcing.

So what they are doing is 10xing everyones holdings who bought on the first crowd fund who paid 2 to 3.00 a coin. The people paying 5.00 a coin will not get a 10x on the 2nd crowd fund of the coin. So the president i talked to confirmed it. So basically if you bought in the first ico you get a nice deal the people who are buying now are paying like 50 bucks a coin because you wont get a 10x inflation like the first round. So this is imo a rip off for the 2nd round buyers. He thinks its ok to boost the ico pric eto around 50 bucks cause they closed it at 41 on market cap that has nothing to do with a ico price. They are going to have 10 millions and who knows who these 4 million dollar private investors are they can easily flood the market with peer plays and destroy the price of it. Maybe they hold and it stays around 5.00 but I doubt it. This 5.00 price is a rip off.

If it got halted that is not new investors problem. So if it got halted at 41 they should be 4.10 cents if they want to follow the market cap. Not 5.00 and tell people they are paying for a 41 million market cap. The people buying into this ico are being over charged. An ico is about getting it cheaper before it hits the market. Not the market price when it was really high. So if there is no lock out period for the 4 million from private investors ( who remain anonymous no proof of other investors) they can flood the market with peerplays and sell all of their shares and destroy the price and buy back at a lower price. I just don't think they will get many more investors in this ico. I been wrong before but this is very fishy to me. But gl with it I do hope it works out for everyone as I have heard the co founder is well known and respected person in the crypto community. So we will see but I am just going to wait for it to hit the market and expect the 4 million dollar investors to sell off and I can get it much cheaper. I do like the idea of it.

Had we gotten included in the exchanges, at the time of our snapshot anyone who had their Peerplays on any of those exchanges would have lost them. History has proven time and again that when it came to sharedrops and the like exchanges are unreliable vehicles.  Our first priority is to protecting peerplays holders, and so by offering a blockchain token on the best decentralized exchange available, it provided the best of both worlds. Despite not being at any of those exchanges, Peerplays still did very respectable volume for what little was available for trade in the market. Not only due to the very low supply, but due to most wanting to hold and not sell Peerplays.  The Peerplays blockchain launches May 30th 2017, and there is no indication that exchanges will not seek out adding Peerplays official blockchain token to their exchanges for trade.  Hope this helps clarify why the idea of having the previously traded token on other exchanges was not conducive to the security of Peerplays holders.  Also hope this further clarifies that the future is not equal to the past, and there is nothing stopping exchanges like Poloniex or Bittrex from trading Peerplays in the future.",False

That should be made very clear!  The requirement for sending BTC from a BTC wallet that you control the private key to is important.  For one, if you don't control it then someone else does.  If you send BTC from an exchange, then the exchange you sent from owns your Peerplays...because they have the private key to the wallet that you were using.  And often times, the address is just one of many inside of the wallet that they are using.  This means that there is no way to prove that you or someone else sent the BTC for Peerplays.  For two, and I am assuming here, but in order to claim the Peerplays bought in the crowdsale, you will just input your private key into the Peerplays Blockchain when it launches at the end of May.   Your private key is your proof and the method for claiming. There is no need to ever post it or give it to anyone! But you need it.  And you need to know how to find it and use it.

What my question is and that I'm hoping someone can help me answer is on the homepage of Peerplays.com it has the ""become your own bookie"" verbiage. If I wanted to start taking sports bets from my friends in real life and use Peerplays as a means to do this how would I go about doing this? Is there a need for high volume transactions? For example if I had 5 friends who wanted to bet the World Series game 7 tonight but all 5 players wanted to take the Cubs do I need to set my own lines and find 5 people to take the Indians or does it build off of other online bookies to cover the spread?

Last week, they announced their new Peerplays website where anyone can join to see the latest updates on the Peerplays project. This week Jonathon is happy to announce that new additions have been made since the launch of the new site. He urges everyone to visit the site and see the new impovements and additions.  He also brings the following updates:      Peerplays vs eth markets now open on bitshares dex     Michael is unable to attend hangouts because he is traveling the world! He is currently working with partners in Hongkong and solidify some of the partnerships in the Eastern markets.     They are preparing for next round of ICO     There are No updates on testnet this week because many elements of game are ready to be pushed out, but not yet all of them. If testnet was updated this week, people would know the game but would be unable to play it. Maybe next week or the week after!     Peerplays currently has another group of devs working on the wallet for trading within the peerplays network. Look for more updates on this in the coming weeks.

Earlier in this thread an update was also given:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1462351.msg16231472#msg16231472  Quote from: CryptoPrometheus on September 13, 2016, 02:46:06 AM Quote from: cryptodv on September 13, 2016, 02:24:19 AM Just to get this clear, the share drop is now after the 17th?  The SNAPSHOT of the BTS blockchain happens on a random block between midnight UTC on Sepember 1st and midnight UTC on September 16th. (The exact block can only be known based on a simple calculation that gets performed after the last block before midnight is signed on the 15th.)  The SHAREDROP happens when the Peerplays blockchain is launched, towards the end of this year. A sharedrop is when the snapshotted addresses/accounts are integrated into the Genesis block of the new Peerplays blockchain. The people who controlled the BTS held in those addresses/accounts can then use the same private keys from their BitShares accounts to unlock their new Peerplays tokens on the Peerplays blockchain.  Hope this helps to clarify your question.  UPDATE 9/17  According to the calculation given in the original announcement, the snapshot will be applied to BitShares block number 9,291,600  Which was produced at 2016-09-02 16:37 (UTC)  Which means that any BTS that you had in your wallet on this date and time will be counted towards the sharedrop.",False

Yes I read this, but I don't get the idea of what's it about in general   I bought some Peerplays tokens during the second stage of ICO. Then I registered on Freedom Ledger and got this memo: ""freedom-ledger issued 250 PEERPLAYS to ..."". So the question is does this SHAREDROP affect me in any way?

But the total supply is not like other coins.  1 million total is not very much.  That and there is a month between the testnet and the auction.  Time enough for the project to get hyped, if hype is justified.  I think it will be interesting.  I am also thinking that there might be money diverted elsewhere when the auction goes live.  ZCash launches on the 28th of October and if I am not mistaken, that is pretty close to the Peerplays auction commencement.  ZCash will likely be huge and in competition with a relatively small crypto niche (attention wise).  That is likely a relevant factor to consider when fashioning expectations.  Not that I am a fan of constructing expectations at all.",False

Here is a preview of this exciting game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIS_aA4lrc.  Peerplays is a high speed gaming blockchain which is capable of supporting tournaments and in-game marketplaces for all types of server-side games. Here is the Explainer video for Peerplays: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoMFA2SnBZs.  After months of negotiations, Neil Haran, owner of Rawbots, and Bunkerchain Labs Inc., custodian for the Peerplays project, have arrived at a Joint Venture Agreement for the integration of Rawbots with Peerplays.  Neil will incorporate Rawbots into Peerplays, making it the first graphics intensive multiplayer sandbox game that will utilize both the marketplace and tournament features of the Peerplays blockchain. Rawbots players will be able to create and sell in-game items using the Peerplays blockchain, and will also be able to enter into tournaments where they could win huge jackpots by facing off against their peers. Bunkerchain Labs inc. will continue to develop the blockchain software required for the integration of these features through the Peerplays API.  The agreement came into effect on September 16th, with Neil Haran receiving 5000 PEERPLAYS tokens and $10k in Bitcoin from BunkerChain Labs inc. to pay for the integration of Rawbots into Peerplays. Neil will maintain 100% ownership of Rawbots, while Bunkerchain Labs Inc. will remain dedicated to the development of the Peerplays blockchain. Additionally, a legally binding Covenant Not to Sue was signed by both parties, to guarantee that no litigation would result from the grievances publicly mentioned on numerous occasions during the past 3 weeks. This Covenant also prohibits either party from discussing any of the details of these grievances.  But perhaps the best news of all - Rawbots, as a flagship game, will also be a working template for other games to integrate with Peerplays in the future, thus accelerating the process of onboarding new games and introducing a whole new means of generating crypto-based revenues to the gaming industry.",False

What this means is, I would help with strategic decisions to grow the company, find business/gaming partners (upon the launch of the first game) and find key projects to incorporate into peerplays (such as Rawbots).  To that end, while it isn't my role, I have expertise in coding as well and have offered to help with coding several times (I can provide numerous amounts of proof here). I approached Bunkerchain labs in the fall of 2015 to build out peerplays. Jonathan and I discussed my ideas over facebook in great detail (over several months), including me providing documents, a simple prototype of the first game (simply to describe the idea - using peerjs) and answers to myriad of questions to help flesh the ideas out. Throughout the project I've helped in many areas (ones that I've been given a chance to help with), including interviews, helping promote peerplays etc. This being said, my expertise is in game development, and as such I'm the CGO of peerplays.  However at the present time, due to legal reasons, I cannot say much more. But I will say this. I have not received one cent from the company, not in the form of money or in peerplays tokens. Absolutely Nothing. All of the funds are being controlled by bunkerchainlabs. My goal is to get our internal matters resolved as soon as possible and in an amicable way. I care deeply about every single investor here and I'm hopeful that we will eventually resolve things.  Best wishes, Neil",False

I've conducted a preliminary investigation into peerplays by getting answers from few of the team members over linkedin - Jonathan Baha'i, Neil Haran, Edward Hall  I've chosen to remain anonymous, however any of the above can rat me out, and some of you who know me, may derive my real bitcointalk account from that.

I also find you to be an incredibly dishonest and very unlikable person.  Neil, after speaking with Jonathan, I have a strong gut feeling you were completely ripped off here.

This would help clear things out for a lot of us who've simply had to go by your incredibly cryptic posts. You owe us this.

Or a rebuttal to this Neil? This to me seems like there's no other explanation except for one of you is lying.  Jonathan:  However, since that time he has not contributed anything to the project, despite his recent claims to the contrary.  Proof?  There are several interviews with Neil's name and quotes from him. He's been a key part in the promotion of Peerplays. Has he simply refused to do work? Neil, Jonathan please <insert proof here>.  Jonathan:  At this time I can only say that Neil is only one guy in a huge industry. The way things are progressing, we are finding no shortage of doors being made available to us.  This reads as if you're saying ""We don't need Neil at the present time, that's one reason for him being gone"".  Then more truth comes out as I call out Jonathan on his lies.  Jonathan:  Neil did approach me last year with some broad ideas about building games on Ethereum, but thats where it ended.  After my collegues and I designed the complete Peerplays gaming platform on Graphene without any input from him whatsoever.  Neil claims this:  I approached Bunkerchain labs in the fall of 2015 to build out peerplays. Jonathan and I discussed my ideas over facebook in great detail (over several months), including me providing documents, a simple prototype of the first game (simply to describe the idea - using peerjs) and answers to myriad of questions to help flesh the ideas out.  So are you claiming that you both discussed things relating to peerplays, but using the ethereum platform, and therefore it isn't the same thing as using graphene? Once again, there's enough contradiction here with me inserting another <insert proof here>. Because your statement simply implies that after your *seemingly* in-depth discussions with Neil, you understood his ideas to merely incorporate it within the graphene blockchain. Once again, proof here would be good.   he claimed he could bring large investors to the project and so we agreed to list him as a team member in May. However, once the crowdsale began, he changed his story and told us that we first must build a ""polished product"" before he would be willing to introduce us to anyone.  So he claimed he could bring in large investors in may? But that is when the crowdsale began (from my drunken recollection), and ""once the crowdsale began he changed his story and told us that we first must build a ""polished product"" before he would be willing to introduce us to anyone."" So he was upfront with you from almost the very beginning. But wait. He only asked to be on the project in May. Quite confusing. Someone's definitely lying.  Jonathan:  We almost cut him from the team at that time, but then he began to express interest in integrating his game called Rawbots into the Peerplays platform.  So you almost cut him from the team because he was upfront with you about needing a polished product from the very beginning. I have worked for some of the biggest tech firms in the industry, and I have never seen an acquisition/merger/partnership deal go well without a launched product and have a decent user base. Sounds like Neil, who's had over a decade of gaming experience and is the only qualified gaming person on the team, gave you sound advice and you were going to cut him over that.  Jacob:  My concern wasn't that you couldn't find another gaming guy, it was that no investor or gaming contact will touch this company if there's a lawsuit of any kind.  Jonathan:  Hi Jacob.. so just to answer your last question.. ""we have contingencies in place to deal with that.""  What contingency plans? running off with developer funds and moving to costa rica?  Jonathan:  Now just to be clear - the entire project, every single document, prototype, every piece of code, every article and social platform, literally everything was created by us. This is why his claims are so absurd. At this stage, we have chosen not to respond to his threats and rumours because we are not interested in having a public showdown with him. But to be frank, he has about as much chance of succeeding in a lawsuit as you or I would have claiming we invented Google.  Seems like you're of the opinion that you can steal someone's intellectual property without any recourse from the law. Once again, request for <facebook chat history>.  I propose creating an open discussion whereby the claims that Jonathan made to me privately, bad mouthing Neil and he goes into a very defensive scared turtle mode. Which made me suspicious. Who is Jonathan protecting here? Himself or Neil? He's already slandered Neil in almost every capacity here, hoping that I would lobby for his cause. Then he starts bargaining with me:  Jonathan  You are welcome to do as you wish with your own tokens, but it is unclear to me exactly what you hope to achieve by launching some sort of public which hunt like you are suggesting. Do you feel that you have not yet received the opportunity to gain from your initial donation? Last I checked, Peerplays was up 7 or 8 times the initial price. I don't see where creating unnecessary drama would be helpful in any way.  Peerplays did go up and I'm still underwater on it. What difference does it make? I'm after the truth, changing the subject to convince me not to share damaging material after you're clearly being deceitful, seems quite suspect.  Jonathan:  I would only ask that you please respect my wishes, as well as Neils wishes, as well as the promise you made, and try to find some other way to be productive.  Now he acts as if Neil's his buddy and he's looking out for him.  I asked Jonathan both these questions:  1)Are you defending this lawsuit with crowdfunding money? 2) Could we make the budget transparent to all of us investors?  Both went unanswered, so I was left with no choice but to post our conversations.  Conclusion: Jonathan, your own statements seem quite contradictory, which leads me to assume you're the one lying. But we'll never know because your ""buddy"" Neil seems to be keeping his mouth shut (at least to me). Neil, do yourself a HUGE FAVOR and post your facebook chat history online. Let us have an open discussion as to what happened. What is your motivation to be silent? Jonathan's done everything to throw you under the bus, not just with me, but probably others as well (like Jocuserious). Proof talks, post your proof now or shut the fuck up forever.   from: Jocuserious on September 12, 2016, 07:39:03 PM I see nothing in the transcripts that indicate anything beyond a dev disagreement of which Neil seems to be at fault.  I can't really take someone seriously who has said that he will retain a lawyer and then doesn't trust his lawyer to handle things.  It's just unprofessional.    The more important post in the previous page, for me, is Dan's.  Looking forward to the 26th.  Jocuserious, I read your request for transparency and Dan and Neil both posted. I didn't find anything wrong with Neil's post, in fact: it was quite professional given the situation. Are you posting this sheep nonsense in the hopes other sheep will follow? Perhaps you should pay careful attention to the facts rather than continue mud-slinging at the wrong direction. I understand that your peerplays tokens are at stake, but it may be better use of your time to try and uncover the truth rather than act like every single pump and dumper here, solely looking out for #1. The value of peerplays tokens will be stronger as a result of these discussions, not weaker. Remove the element of surprise from the value and it stabalizes. We were on a downward spiral for the past 3 weeks now and that would have continued until the 26th if I hadn't stepped up.  One love.",False

Many of these things occurred over the course of months, as I understand it, and as such there is plenty of missing context.  For instance,  Quote So he claimed he could bring in large investors in may? But that is when the crowdsale began (from my drunken recollection), and ""once the crowdsale began he changed his story and told us that we first must build a ""polished product"" before he would be willing to introduce us to anyone."" So he was upfront with you from almost the very beginning. But wait. He only asked to be on the project in May. Quite confusing. Someone's definitely lying.  Demanding a polished product sounds like he is waiting for work to be done (as in codework) rather than contributing to it.  It would seem to be a fair assumption that at this point, he had to have known that Dan's company was going to be contracted for the creation of this 'polished product' because that is what Dan said in his very first post in this thread.  Further, not only is that a valid assumption, but a timeline for the creation of that 'polished product' was given and that time has yet to pass - in fact, the initial part of release is slated for two weeks from now - very much in line with what we were told at the beginning.  Further, from what I can tell, Neil has claimed that it was his idea.  Well...everyone has ideas.  You don't get credit for discussing an idea - you get credit for producing the reality of an idea.  I don't see where Neil can claim this if he is not one of the people working on Dan's team.  Which makes the following quote untenable -  Quote Seems like you're of the opinion that you can steal someone's intellectual property without any recourse from the law. Once again, request for <facebook chat history>.  It's not like Peerplays is stealing Rawbots.  In fact, I would think that Neil saw Peerplays as a means to get Rawbots off the ground.  He has been pushing for it for years and thinks that it could be on level with minecraft according to the following article (which was written in 2013) -  Quote It could possibly be the next big thing since Minecraft, according to Neil Haran, CEO of Team Rawbots. http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/05/multiplayer_sandbox_title_rawbots_coming_to_wii_u_if_kickstarter_goal_is_met  Depending on the timeline on when Peerplays was started and when Neil was brought on board, I would say that the motivation for appropriating the platform is pretty strong and that indicates potentially, to me, that Neil was never interested in doing anything but implementing Rawbots on technology that he knew he wasn't going to write. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I literally see nothing that makes me think that the core product, as planned from the beginning, is not going to be delivered.  What I do see is a dev squabble that seems to be originating mostly from one direction, from an individual whose motives towards Peerplays are potentially not aligned with what the rest of the team have been doing.  I also think that if Neil believed that he had a case then his lawyers would have handled everything.  Going around behind the scenes and threatening to make things public sounds like an attempt at extortion. He has lost all credibility with me and I find that unfortunate for the team.  He was right on one thing though, Peerplays did experience it's first hiccup and it wasn't because he wasn't aware of the bounties when irresponsibly implying that Jonathon was moving tokens around haphazardly - which in and of itself should be a serious red flag regarding Neil's credibility.  Quote Hi everyone,  At the present time, the peerplays founding team has faced its first bit of a bump in the road. Not to worry, Jonathan and I will figure things out, but in the meantime, Jonathan (freedom-ledger), don't issue anymore peerplays tokens.  http://cryptofresh.com/a/PEERPLAYS  Shows a supply of 203,930 PEERPLAYS (Why over the 200k alotted? You'll have to explain that one to me). Let's immediately stop the issuing of any more tokens until we figure things out.

I did not join the company in May, both Jonathan and I discussed the technology from October 3rd, 2015 all the way up till launch. On January 26th, 2016, we both were thinking up domain names and he landed on peerplays.com, and we discussed equity stake 4 days later. Most of what Jonathan has talked about in his private chats with Jacob have been non-factual. I can prove all of it, but I've agreed not to. I also never discussed doing anything on Ethereum with Jonathan, all of my conversations were about graphene (and early on I referred to it as bitshares technology). Ethereum was mentioned in one of the documents I shared with Jonathan very early on, as I was trying to build a version of this platform before approaching Bunkerchainlabs. I had even considered using technology by maidsafe prior to graphene.  Jacob, I appreciate the support, please drop this right now. This isn't helpful for Peerplays. And stop asking about the facebook chat history. It isn't going to happen. Also, not everything you're stating is factual either. Especially about misappropriation of funds. No matter what disagreements Jonathan and I are having, I will say this to his testament - Jonathan would never take people's money and run. In fact, no one from that entire team would do such a thing. I have the utmost respect for Dan and his abilities as a programmer, which is why I made several attempts to try and code with him and be part of that side of development. This is a well known fact within the team. They were even talking about flying me down so that I could sit down with Dan and learn more about how the code works. What happened here is much more a disagreement of things than anything. I know it has been blown out of proportion, but that's the problem with witch hunts. Please stop this now.     Ryan, since you've made numerous references to complete conjecture, without even the slightest shred of evidence, and made claims that are not even remotely factual, I know you're not really meant to be taken seriously. Nevertheless I'd say the feeling's mutual. Please do not respond to me publicly or privately as you've been ignored.

That leads me to believe that someone wants just to make hype about PP, in style, look at us how much money we give just for logo, but reward will stay in their team, its organised like that, and it was happening before, it's just nothing new, but is old trick, and cliche. You can see that by - how much logo contest with big price reward had succes, nothing, just 200 votes, and 50 designs of which 12 designs was mine. Second symptomatic thing is, that 12 of 50 designs are mine, and neither one of them is not even in runner up, and according just to overall look, just mine are professional work, all others are made in photoshop which is not logo making software, or copied.  This lead me to believe that someone carefully selected logo design, to make sure that no forign designer enter in the run for price. In the end logo that is chosen is not better that current logo that PP has, so nothing is achieved.  So overall, this contest was fake. sorry i must say this, but everything points to that.",False

If you claim that your designs are so good, please show an example of some of your work.  Many of the 144 designs were terrible, but i do agree with the crowd favorite, as that is one i voted for as well.  I also like the team's choice rubix cube design pending a few modifications.  It is great that the final decision was the team's to make, rather than risk ruining the token by potentially choosing an image that could destroy the coin's image.  I was worried about that.  The one thing i will agree with is that the prize money was very generous and the contest probably could have been done for $500.

In October, Peerplays will do an auction style offering for the remaining 500k tokens.  There will only ever be 1 million tokens with no inflation.    They had to be purchased from the Peerplays website in bundles of 10 tokens (first tier 100k were $2 per token, 2nd tier were 100k @ $3 per token), then you created a ticket, and the team would send your tokens to your openledger/freedomledger BTS account.

In this update, we announced the Logo contest, and explained the status of the DAO proposal. We also explained that for the next 2 weeks we would be working hard to finish the Profit Sharing module to publish in our public GitHub repository on Friday July 1st.  This is happening on schedule, including a major press release followed by a written synopsis of the feature.  For the past two weeks we have also been finalizing plans for everything we will be rolling out this summer, including additional contests and an advertising referral program. We are keeping an eye on the Logo contest and I assure you that we will not be adopting any Logo for Peerplays that does not meet a strict standard of excellence. The $1250 is essentially a bounty for the Logo, and we will not pay that bounty until we have a satisfactory design.  I do not blame you for being impatient, but please understand that we are undertaking quite a feat of engineering on the development side, and none of our dev team are regular forum dwellers. That said, Dan Notestein (our lead blockchain dev) did make an short appearance on this thread a couple days ago. His bitcointalk ID is ""dannote"".  We have a news and update site that is at least as extensive as any other crypto project I have seen, and we will continue to publish updates as often as they are available. I am also speaking with the dev team to see about the possibility of giving regular development updates, even though they would likely be just a brief overview, it would perhaps give everyone something to chew on.  As far as community interaction, we will be opening a slack channel towards the middle of next month (July), and we always try to answer PMs in a timely manner. Personally, I am looking forward to getting to know many of you in the future, and I apologize that I have not been able to answer every single form question for the last week. We are focused on delivering a highly advanced product in a relatively short period of time, and there is much work to be done.

There are many groups actively developing and promoting BitShares in different ways:  SVK and xeroc develop and support tools for the users (web wallets, python api tools, docs, etc).  BitShares Munich group (led by Chris and Kencode) develop and support an android/ios mobile wallet. They also are integrating BitShares into point-of-sales systems. They've also expressed plans to update the web wallet to support stealth transactions (blinded and stealth transactions are currently only supported in the command-line interface wallet).  OpenLedger, led by Ronny, supports a number of gateways for selling popular crypto and fiat assets on the decentralized exchange and they are constantly adding new ones.  Roadscape develops and supports the block explorer, www.cryptofresh.com. Transwiser provides a gateway for CNY and a couple of cryptocurrencies as well.  BlockTrades.us (my company) runs a shapeshift-like service that supports popular cryptocurrencies. We manage a ""blockchain maintenance worker"" that adds new features at the blockchain layer and we also make fixes when necessary (I'm happy to say there haven't been any significant bugs at this level for quite a while). We're currently working on adding a feature to allow UIAs (user-issued assets) to pay ""dividends"" to their holders. We've also hired a new web guy to improve the web wallet in areas of most interest to us (i.e. bridge functionality and gateways) and I'm in the process of hiring another C++ guy now.  There's also a couple of other groups working on mobile wallets and fiat-tracking assets for several different countries.  Cryptonomex, led by Stan, still works tirelessly to promote BitShares and is constantly seeking new partners to join our ecosystem.  Please note this is by no means a complete list of the groups working to build up the BitShares ecosystem, this is just some of the ones I know reasonably well.",False

I need ""50 reputation"" for this. Therefore I will write it as a new answer.      I don't know as much about Serpent, but it appears to have the same goals and purpose as Solidity, but is meant to be similar to Python (and therefore be great for Python devs.) This, along with the range of clients, also showcases the dedication that Ethereum has to being appealing to a wide range of developers, not just Javascript developers.  The range of clients at Ethereum in Go, C++, Python, JavaScript, Java and other languages is a support disaster. Right now it may work OK, but once Ethereum attracts a critical mass there will be 1 (or maybe 2) clients which will be used by 99% of the users. Otherwise, it's just not feasible.  You also say that Ethereum is trying to appeal a wide range of developers. Lisk tends to focus on the JavaScript group, it's just a fact that this is a huge crowd already. Lisk removes friction, it's very hard to get developers for a platform. If they now need to learn a new language (besides the whole blockchain concepts) attracting them will be even more difficult. Lisk is all about staying lean, efficient and focused.  Btw. JS is extremely powerful: asmjs.org, pyjs.org etc.      Above only covers Smart Contracts for Etheruem; what about the more fully-encompassing ""Dapp""?  Here is the difference between Lisk and Ethereum. Ethereum is doing smart contracts which are all saved on one blockchain. If you want to develop a dapp in Ethereum you need to connect the functionalities of several smart contracts.  In Lisk you get a complete package. You don't develop single smart contracts. You build an entire application which is running on its own blockchain. It's like you develop a new crypto-currency platform with an extended feature-set, the platform itself is already finished and provided by our Lisk SDK. As a developer you just need to implement the necessary new features on top of the already existing platform.      So, for Lisk to be implying that Javascript developers cannot create Dapp for Ethereum is a bit misleading. They can absolutely use primarily Javascript for the Dapp and then Solidity (which is so close to Javascript) for smart contracts.  We never said that JavaScript developers cannot create dapps for Ethereum. Of course they can, but they need to learn a new language first. This is like you would say a plumber cannot paint walls.  At Ethereum they can use JavaScript for the dapp front end, and Solidity for the dapp back end. It's not like they are using JavaScript ""for the [complete] dapp"" as you said. No, only for the front end.      The difference is that Lisk is entirely Javascript (and node.js) through and through, Ethereum has a large number clients in different languages[2], has two custom-written languages for smart contracts, and still allows for Javascript where you need it most (the UI).  Yes, we tend to focus on one technology. Focus is key.  Your statement that Ethereum ""allows for JavaScript where you need it most (the UI)"", is really only the case for Ethereum. JavaScript is globally accepted for many different tasks on the front and back end (e.g. NodeJS). Not just for ""the UI"". You are making JavaScript smaller as it is, only to get more arguments for Solidity.      Javascript numbers are....not the greatest or most reliable. Especially when we are dealing with a crypto-currency, you really want your numbers to be on point. Basically JS uses floating point which means some things get approximated and digits get lost in certain cases.  We are only using integers at Lisk. For big numbers we are using bignumber.js. It's not about the language you choose, it's about your coding skills. If you know what you are doing JavaScript is entirely fine. However, yes this is a weakness. But a weakness which is manageable.      Javascript uses weak dynamic typing. If you are not careful, you can pass strings instead of numbers.  Honestly, if you are building a serious project you should at least get this thing right. Otherwise, every JavaScript project would fail according to your argument.      Lisk has ""rules"" that they ask contract developers have to follow to avoid breaking consensus.  Yep. It seems Ethereum has these ""rules"" directly embedded into their compiler, at Lisk developers just have to follow them. The biggest difference here is, if they do a mistake and the consensus is broken, then the dapp needs a hard fork. But Lisk itself is entirely fine, because the dapp is only running in a sidechain.  This is a huge security advantage. If a dapp fails, the Lisk network doesn't even hiccup. However, if one smart contract fails at Ethereum, it can mean game over for Ethereum.      Disadvantages of Solidity  Other disadvantages may be that it's a very young language and therefore unproven. Also there is very little documentation available, and even less developers know this language.      On the blockchain  You are mixing up different things now. You download the Bitcoin client also from an HTTP link. However it ""cannot be corrupted, can be audited, cannot be changed, can reach consensus"". That means all these important properties you mention are also valid for Lisk. If you change a dapp code, your node will end up on a fork. Same as if you change the Bitcoin code.  The HTTP link is only the way to distribute a dapp source code. Later on we will integrate decentralized storage methods (e.g. IPFS), so the distribution itself can be decentralized as well.  However, the distribution model doesn't define if an application is centralized or decentralized. Or do you say that every crypto-currency on the market is centralized? Because you download the clients from a centralized location? If yes, then how can Ethereum dapps even be decentralized, if the network itself is centralized?  Your line of arguments is wrong here. Another important fact is, that this method allows Lisk to scale massively easier than Ethereum. Besides the huge advantages our sidechains already bring to the table.      I don't know much about Crypti, but they did have a presale and they did get a decent amount of money (at least $200k USD) but I can't find the exact figures because everything has been wiped. Nothing came of Crypti. Literally. So...that's scary. The lack of transparency, also scary.  We are not associated with Crypti anymore. However, saying that everything is wiped and that there is no transparency is a huge lie. There are over 600 pages on Bitcointalk (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=654463) and dozens of blog posts (https://blog.crypti.me) which contain ALL information.  Additionally, if you say that ""nothing came of Crypti"" then you are completely wrong. Crypti developed a working dapp platform, the huge success of Lisk is proving this. The only thing which just didn't work at Crypti was marketing. That means nobody knows about Crypti. There was also a big lack of leadership at Crypti.      So I guess the main difference I want to point out between Ethereum and Lisk here is that Lisk is two guys who rebranded a previous coin that had a presale and delivered nothing while Ethereum has Vitalik Buterin, a large team of well-known, community-engaged, crazy talented developers, and a large community of developers creating Dapp and third-party wallets and hardware wallets and all sorts of amazing stuff. I mean, look at Augur, Slock.it, and ConsenSys alone. It's crazy!  Yes, I'm glad that those two guys at Google never started their company because there were so many great search engines back then with hundreds of employees.  Don't understand me wrong, I like Ethereum and the whole team/movement behind it. I'm a big supporter. But you are just refusing innovation at this point of time. You are comparing a 2 years old platform (Ethereum) with 18M in fundings, with a not even launched platform (Lisk) with no access to the funding as of yet. That's kind of silly.      Another key difference is Ethereum has the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit Swiss organization and Lisk has....an unknown foundation / company associated with it.  Everyone at Lisk knows that we are in the process of creating a legal entity in Germany, most probably as a gGmbH. This is also a non-profit organisation structure.      One final note: Lisk really likes to claim they have partnerships with big names. First it was ShapeShift. Now it is Microsoft. They loooove to use that partnership word. In reality, they were just using the Shifty button, not really a partnership.  We had a technologic partnership with ShapeShift. It was a big mis-understanding at that time. They already fixed that mistake.  All in all, I would like to say that your points are quite weak. You didn't point out the biggest weaknesses of Lisk. In my opinion this is sidechain security. That means small dapps probably won't have a chance long-term to attract enough nodes to secure them.  For this I suspect that there will be special dapps, who will run smaller dapps in a SaaS way. Until we implemented a sidechain forging marketplace, finding sidechain forgers is also quite a difficult task. However, these are all just starting problems. Everything is solvable. At the end of the day Lisk is just software which is actively developed.  It's important to mention that Lisk just gets started and we are already making big changes. At this point of time it's just to early to evaluate Lisk and the team (us) behind it. You should just wait for a year before making a final conclusion. All arguments right now just look like you are afraid. Personally, I think there is far more than enough room for Ethereum and Lisk. In the end we are solving the ""problems"" very differently and are attracting different niches.  I hope that Ethereum and Lisk can work together in the future in order to solve important problems within the dapp and blockchain industry. I say it again, we are in this ""game"" together.  http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/2104/how-does-lisk-differ-from-ethereum/3176#3176",False

My thinking is IF the DAO accepts the proposal and some of the auction tokens are given to the DAO (once again I am only speculating)...that would be a good thing for current holders of Peerplay tokens because there will be less available for the Auction (thus possible higher value for each token) AND the float will be less when the token starts trading in the open market (because The DAO will not be selling their tokens anytime soon).

We finally concluded that integrating financial incentives through blockchain technology would be the future of gaming, and in April of this year, the inEarth company was officially dissolved. This has allowed me to turn my focus on the development of the core features of the Peerplays blockchain, with the aim of creating an architecture which will enable an entire ecosystem to be built around it.  If you are looking for an example of some of my previous work, one of my personal favorite games that we developed is called Rawbots: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Rawbots.  Rawbots lets players build their robot/machines similar to legos, program their robots and then engage in epic battles against other people's robots. One idea we have been floating around recently is the notion of using Rawbots as a prototype proof-of-concept in order to demonstrate some of the features that the Peerplays decentralized marketplace will offer to MMO games, like the ability for players to buy and sell their awesome Rawbots which they have built from scratch.  That said, here are copies of Rawbots for mac and windows if you want to check it out (linux is experimental):  Windows: Dropbox - https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/38744980/rawbots_windows_0_1_4.zip Google Drive - https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B42Wtrlp8xi9VGQ4VGxqSVNYN2s Torrent - https://kat.cr/rawbots-windows-0-1-4-t12391367.html  Mac: Dropbox - https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/38744980/rawbots_1.4_mac.zip  Linux (may or may not work): Yandex (folder) - https://yadi.sk/d/W906cTEK6-ERw/Rawbots%20Latest/Linux  There are quite a few tutorials on YouTube, but here are a couple: Beginner tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yH_2Tqm2RQk Intermediate tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ysu0XDOFjw  This is just one small example of the many things we have in the works for this project in the near future. I am putting together an outline that I hope to release next week which should give a good high level overview of how the ecosystem will be organized in terms of gaming development.  Quote from: SwedishGirl on June 09, 2016, 12:01:25 PM Any interviews or videos with Neil Haran speaking about the project? His linkedin says the following about peerplays ""Bringing provably fair MMO gaming to a new decentralized internet."" MMO is actually a term reserved for different type of games and is not used for gambling/sports betting etc. Would love to hear what the man has to say about all this.  Hi SwedishGirl, MMO stands for “Massive Multiplayer Online” gaming, which simply refers to any game which is able to support a large number of concurrent users within the same ecosystem/world. It can be applied to poker, sports betting, League of Legends, or any other of the thousands of popular social games.

This means that new on-chain game ideas can be discussed and voted on by Peerplays holders.

If you purchased the tokens and they haven't been confirmed sent then they are still there.  It's a slightly complicated process compared to other crypto ICO's but one that you should dedicate some time to follow through on.  First, you need to set up an account on freedom ledger.  Save your account info as you make it.  If it failed the first time, clear your browser history and start over.  Then watch this video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVqRusKco6A ) to learn how to back up your account.  Watch Part Two to learn how to find and back up your private keys.  Keep them safe and ideally backed up at more than one location.  Once you have the saved info, go back to peerplays (where you bought the tokens) and open a ticket found under the contributors tab (I think).  That is where you communicate the invoice number in the confirmation email and your freedomledger username.  If there is any other question, I am sure that you can use the chat function on the peerplays website to gain further help.  Good luck!",False

BitShares (built on Graphene) is a blockchain with built-in smart contracts that enable a Decentralized Asset Exchange, Shareholder Governance, a referral system, and many other cool DAC/DAO features. Think Polonex or BIttrex, but 100% on a blockchain and governed by shareholder voting.  Freedom Ledger and Open Ledger are web hosted GUI wallets that display the data from the BitShares blockchain. Unlike other web wallets like blockchain.info or Coinbase (and centralized exchanges like Poloniex or Bittrex), your private keys for your tokens are not stored on Freedom Ledger or Open Ledger's servers, but rather directly in your browser. This is truly decentralized and much more secure for you, but also makes it Extremely Important to back up your private keys, because if you delete your browser cache, they are lost forever.  In terms of user-friendliness, both Freedom Ledger and Open Ledger are simply clones of the ""generic"" BitShares GUI that was built by the BitShares devs. There are so many features to BitShares (they really jam packed it), that for now the generic UI is complicated for those who are not familiar with its many capabilities. However, the BitShares blockchain is open source and so anyone could create a more user friendly GUI if they wanted to, but for now we have this slightly less user friendly version.     This is correct. Peerplays is built on Graphene as the back end - but will have its own GUI designed by gamers. The Peerplays tokens on Freedom Ledger (BitShares) are only placeholders until the Peerplays blockchain is launched.",False

A phase ends as soon as all Peerplays tokens allocated to that phase are sold out.  First phase of 100,000 tokens for just $2 per token has already ended, all sold out.  We are now in the second phase with another 100,000 tokens supply for $3  per token (still a bargain) and I noticed it's selling VERY quickly and at this rate will be sold out in less than 10 days.  The third phase will be an auction-style sale of 500,000 tokens that will start one month before mainnet launches, I believe that's going to be around November this year IIRC.  Exciting times!

All Peerplays users must register an account name on the blockchain, which is where their balances are kept. This makes it more intuitive to use, rather than users having to send funds to a long string of random letters and numbers.  Now, every time someone places a wager and plays a game on Peerplays, their funds are locked up by a smart contract. Part of the funds are deducted as a fee, and the rest are released to the winner of the game. The fees all go into a ""profit sharing"" virtual account which is controlled by another smart contract which distributes all the contents of this virtual account (at regular intervals) into the individual accounts which are holding Peerplays core tokens. This distribution is done according to the percentage held by each, just like a company would distribute earnings to shareholders as dividends.  Peerplays core tokens can be used for wagering, but also Gateway tokens for other crypotocurrencies like BTC and ETH, as well as fiat gateway tokens can be used for wagering. This means that profit sharing payouts will take the form of many different cryptocurrency tokens, each of which can traded on the internal DEX (see www.freedomledger.com for an example of the DEX technology Peerplays is using), or transferred to an external Exchange which supports them.  Peerplays core tokens will therefore have an intrinsic value beyond just the purely speculative value that every other crypto token has at this time. Anyone who holds Peerplays will get a portion of the gambling revenues earned by the network. Just as an analogy, you might think of it like purchasing shares in an online casino, only there is no centralized authority who is in charge of distributing the profits to the shareholders - it is all done trustlessly by the blockchain.",False

Graphene is the consensus technology on which BitShares is also built.  According to the whitepaper, Waves is being built upon the Proof-of-stake protocol used by NXT. Aside from various incompatibilities at a technical level, the NXT protocol has nowhere near the block confirmation speed or throughput capacity to handle the features that Peerplays is assembling.  Also, Graphene is already fully developed and proven. If you like, go to www.freedomledger.com and check out the BitShares platform and see an example of this technology at work. Point by point and quite literally, every single feature that Waves hopes to accomplish (according to their whitepaper) has already been achieved and is fully operational on Graphene. I do not say this to ""put down"" the Waves project in any way, I am just stating simple fact. Graphene is not an easy technology for most people to to wrap their minds around, and it is quite understandable if you have not yet done this comparison yourself. By way of courtesy, if you tell me exactly what you believe Waves could do for Peerplays that Graphene cannot, I can try to help to clarify the details for you.",False

The Peerplays network has two different gaming models- trustless ""on-chain"" gaming, in which games are programmed directly into the native blockchain code, and ""server-side"" gaming, on which games can be played on hosted servers.  Peerplays is not trying to get existing casinos to switch their back-end. Casino card games will be programmed directly into the native blockchain code, so there is no need for any 3rd party service at all. Actually, Peerplays will be directly competing against these casinos. Because of this, the question should be asked ""What will Peerplays offer users that existing casinos cannot?"" One a glaringly obvious answer is that players can keep 100% of their winnings in a cryptographically secured account which cannot be accessed by any outside agency or authority. I will leave it to the reader to analyze the implications of this statement.  For server-side gaming, the option for adding Peerplays to the back-end will appeal mostly to existing gaming websites that do not currently offer wagering. Peerplays will allow them to outsource the liability for operating a gambling server, because no wagering would actually be happening on their server, but rather across a distributed network with nodes around the world. Essentially, Peerplays server-side model allows players to register and wager on a game, and elect a 3rd party (the gaming company) to report the winner to Peerplays. Another example for third party integration is existing eSports gaming websites, who can simply add Peerplays as a wagering option for their users by integrating with Peerplays through the blockchain API, offering their users the same benefits as addressed in the paragraph above.  Fees charged by Peerplays for server-side gaming will be set at a competitive rate to reflect the value of the service that Peerplays is providing to the hosting company - namely the ability to outsource the wager payment processing and the tournament management and bracketing. These companies will naturally be able to charge their own fee (built into the blockchain contract) for playing their games, offsetting whatever minor fee they are charged by Peerplays and creating a net gain for them.  Finally something we have not yet discussed in detail is Sports Betting. Here is a quick preview, from the DAO proposal we published yesterday:  ""For sports “bookmaking”, on-chain smart contracts automate the entire process, but to settle a particular book or bracket the bracket creator must pre-select a neutral 3rd party (a specialized business, a multi-sig consortium, or even a chosen friend in a private fantasy league) to publish accurate game and player statistics to the blockchain.""  The implications of this are quite staggering. Peerplays will make the publishing of accurate statistics a business opportunity in and of itself. In this case, the notion of needing 100% decentralized oracles for this task would be overkill. Because of free market competition, centralized businesses are perfectly capable of handling this, and there are plenty of safeguard measures if you want more security, like taking the median of [ x ] number of feeds, or simply choosing a service that offers ""insurance"" in the event of accidental mis-published information. What this means, in a nutshell, is that in addition to everything else, Peerplays will be able to tap the single largest source of gambling revenue in the world - sports betting.",False

Then the auction style crowdfund will really decide if the market cap goes up or down from here. My estimation is that there will be a lot of hype until then so things might get a bit wild.

A few things to consider that I hope will help clarify some of your questions:  It seems we have published more content and specific information about how our blockchain will operate than nearly every other ICO in the last year. Perhaps being too organized and putting forth the detailed plans for an actual blockchain is working against us here? With most ICOs I have seen, they give you nearly nothing and leave you to fill in the blanks with your imagination and speculations.  We have also made ourselves available through several channels for live discussion. Anyone is welcome to ask questions directly via our live help on peerplays.com, or stop by the Mumble hangout every Friday morning at 10 am EST for a live Q&A session with myself and Michael. We also have 3 active forum threads, social media pages, a news and updates website, and you can email us at powerup @ peerplays.com.  What links are not working specifically? Would you please provide URLs so we can investigate? Appreciate the help. We don't want people getting broken links either.  I would argue that many people are not used to a well budgeted and planned out project that doesn't attempt to pump millions of dollars from people out of speculation. We want to maximize the value of what we bring to the market, and make our early supporters happy. Most of the feedback we have gotten about the format we have taken has been positive. Yesterday someone made a comment that our level of organization would seem to show we are not just another ICO looking to get rich on the front end before delivering anything. I believe it has given many of our early contributors a lot of confidence. We know the format is not familiar, but it enables us to stay efficient and keep on target with our milestones leading up to what is going to be much more heavily promoted crowdfunding event later this year.  We plan to start a slack channel in the future, but at this stage are focused on executing our current plans and don't want to be distracted by needing to maintain a space like that. We have several marketing initiatives ramping up in the next few weeks, and once those are underway we will turn our attention to setting up additional channels for community involvement. In the mean time, as I mentioned above there are several ways to interact with us, and we are generally quick to respond in all of them.",False

In our assessment however, we believe that at least 60% should go to profit share, and the intervals should occur daily.  This will mean that someone who is holding a Peerplays core network token for a day, could receive all the profit shares in relation to their holding that day, and then choose to trade it following this. We anticipate this is going to create a constant buy pressure on a daily basis and will avoid typical pump and dump scenarios the likes of which we see happen in typical publicly traded companies where the Ex-Dividend Days are 90 days and create a buy pressure once every quarter.  Note however, that this is a DAC, and that all Peerplays core network token holders will be able to vote on matters relating to fee schedules and the timing of releases of funds in order to maintain and manage the Peerplays network for optimal profitability.  This is why in our whitepaper we cannot give specifics in this regard. What I am stating here is only an opinion and it will ultimately be up to the Peerplays core network token holders to decide.  In regards to your Bitshares question, ultimately it will be used as a Decentralized Exchange were you can trade your holdings from Peerplays. The various currencies will simply collect in your wallet as you indicated and you can then do with them as you wish. So if your wallet had X amount of Peerplays core network token, as they remained there you would see balances of ETH, BTC, DASH, bitUSD and whatever other tokens used in game play accumulate in your wallet daily.

I cannot speak to 'clear scam' assertions, as this is far beyond the scope of this announcement thread. However, someone losing 960 btc doing margin trading on Polonex is hardly evidence of something being scam. It's only evidence of someone making bad trading decisions, assuming a trollbox comment can be considered even evidence of anything for that matter.  Issues with the lead developer from Bitshares in a particular perspective regarding what has transpired with him and his team in the past are certainly nothing new. I disagree with it, but that is irrelevant here.  Reading the whitepaper, it's seen that we are utilizing the same blockchain engine that Bitshares uses to build Peerplays. Regardless of perspectives on the founders of Bitshares, what is clear is the proven performance of this engine that has been used in real world application in the Bitshares Decentralized Exchange.  Looking at our team, it's clear that we are not part of the team that created Bitshares. They are quite busy with STEEM. Anyone can read our whitepaper there if they like. (https://steemit.com/peerplays/@peerplays/peerplays-whitepaper)  So based on this cursory assessment of Peerplays, the 'very suspecious' assertions seem to be misplaced.  This does raise an interesting topic however which we are continually challenged with. The Peerplays network is very unique from any kind of 'coin' offering made in the past, which makes it a bit of a challenge for people who look at this and fit it into the same old box they have been fitting crypto into for years now.  The profit sharing mechanism of the Peerplays network (see the section titled 'Profit Sharing' in the whitepaper for details) means that a Peerplays core network token holder is not going to hold value in only the core token, but every transaction taking place on the network will be proportionally distributed to them as well as a profit share.  This means with every wager made, every jackpot won, every game played, if the players decide to play with ETH, Peerplays core network token holders are getting a share of that ETH. If they choose to play with BTC, same deal. On a typical day, the Peerplays core network token holder could see BTC, ETH, DOGE, LTC, DASH, bitUSD, bitCNY, bitEUR, and perhaps even some others filling up in their wallets.  Most importantly, this is all controlled by Smart Contracts on the blockchain, which guarantees every transaction occurs according to those rules. Being a decentralized autonomous coop (DAC) it will be completely up to the holders of the Peerplays core network token to decide as to how much of this fee share will go to the holders. We assert a majority of it will, while the remaining will go towards the progress of the DAC along with jackpot prizes. Again this is all outlined in our whitepaper.  The point is however, this new dynamic makes assessing the value of the Peerplays core network token very different from the typical coin launch/marketcap/speculation. Sure it has those things.. but..

What this means is that we are now looking to hire Language Ambassadors who can represent Peerplays to their own countries and interact with communities in their language on a regular basis. We need people who will:  - Answer questions people have on forums and social media  - Translate and post the regular Peerplays development updates in both social media and the forums in their own language  - Promote to places where their language is spoken  - Post an OP announcing the Peerplays project and their role as ambassador in their country in all the forums they are members of, including outreach to forums outside of the crypto space, like gaming and gambling forums.  - A one-time translation of the Peerplays crowdsale landing page text, as well as text from 2 or 3 short videos explaining the checkout process (videos are being made right now). All the text from the page and videos will be given to the ambassador as a text document.  - Ambassador must be willing to give their first and last name, and social media and forum contact links, to be displayed on the Peerplays website so foreign visitors know who to contact as their ambassador.   We are offering a weekly retainer which will be a combination of tokens and BTC.  Currently we are seeking for the following languages:  French Spanish Chinese Japanese  If you are active in social networks with another language not mentioned that you think will totally love Peerplays, then feel free to contact us so we can consider it.  We will look to provide additional perks and benefits to our ambassadors going forward, and are always seeking to develop long term relationships with good people.

The crowdfund is happening in two stages, and what is being developed is unlike anything that has been made before. The Peerplays core token holders of the Peerplays network are going to continually receive profit shares of all fees within the network. This means a Peerplays core token holder would see their daily balance of ETH, BTC, DASH, and whatever other approved crypto-currencies that are used within the platform continue to accumulate in their account daily based on their % holding of the network tokens. This is all built into the blockchain.  The network has numerous opportunities to generate new revenue streams available to the market sector it serves, and on top of that whatever happens on the blockchain profits the Peerplays core token holders DIRECTLY. While the speculative market cap price is certainly going to be there, the Peerplays core token holders are likely not to care one way or another, because just having their token is bringing them in actual BTC, ETH, DASH, DOGE, bitUSD, bitEUR and more daily out of every single wager, tournament, translation to the tune of at least 60% of the total fee rate. Details are in the whitepaper which we have made available in a PDF, but was first release on the blockchain last week here to make it time stamped and immutable: https://steemit.com/peerplays/@peerplays/peerplays-whitepaper  The pricing of this crowdfund was based specifically on a well budgeted plan incorporating not just development, but well rounded advertising, promotion, legal, and administrative requirements to onboard adoption with the marketplace beyond crypto.  Our funding tokens are meant for early stage supporters who recognize the strength of our team and our current tech and plans. As we move forward we are going to be providing more updates. We are very thankful to all our early supporters who are taking part in bringing blockchain into a very high volume and profitable sector that is begging for this solution.  When we have our auction style crowdfund, it will be following a working public prototype. The price at that point is going to be significantly different. By then a few months of ongoing advertising, promotion, and partnership announcements will make this project extremely attractive in this $50 billion + a year industry that needs the blockchain solution with the speed and capacity which we are developing. We have no doubt that this is going to bring Bitcoin adoption far beyond it's current reach and create a massive new liquid market.  We could have followed suit with everyone else and done a regular crowdfund that raised millions out of speculation and then proceeded, but we prefer to keep the early stages on budget and surgical in our execution prior to the network becoming pubic.  We reported at the Beyond Bitcoin hangout on Friday that we would be releasing more detailed timelines in the coming week, so stay tuned for that. We haven't really started up our promotional campaign for this crowdfund yet because we wanted to give everyone in bitcointalk/bitsharestalk a chance to participate. Blockchain is no longer just in this domain (bitcoin/crypto), and huge industries are watching for solutions just like Peerplays that are backed by teams with solid fundamentals.  So those are just a few of my thoughts on price while trying to stay awake at 4am.  I have posted my contact details. You can message me on Facebook or on Linkedin or even here if you would like to discuss the details of this awesome project further. I really would prefer to see the benefits of Peerplays in the hands of crypto enthusiasts and not industry titans. I encourage everyone to read the materials we have provided, or listen to us talk about it last week at the hangout: https://soundcloud.com/beyond-bitcoin-hangouts/e153-2016-05-6-fuzzy-friends-peerplays-lauch-party-steem-openpos  Have a great day!",False

A bit about my background:  I've been in video game development since 2002. Been in social gaming since practically its existence. I've been looking at bitcoin since when it was trading at a dollar (never bought any then though) and always believed in decentralization and blockchain.  Here's a talk I did back in 2011 for the bitcoin show (I didn't really know Bruce, he asked me to do a talk so I did because I fully believed in blockchain tech): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPKoRJ3vPZY  Today I'm an activist, completely focused on the decentralization movement and technologies associated with it. I'm new on bitcointalk.org and the forums, but I'm not new to this space.  Here's a long talk I recently did for the SAFE network: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akWGc5b6iZc  Another project I am helping is FollowMyVote (also based on the bitshares blockchain), which is a project focused on bringing elections online in a provably fair way. https://followmyvote.com/ambassadors/ -------------  Now that that bit is out of the way, I truly believe that we're embarking upon a game changer in MMO gaming (for asynchronous games) in Peerplays. What we are building is not without its challenges, as we are attempting to connect a huge number of peers in a large mesh, all playing in a provably fair way and generating a very large number of transactions per second. That said, the blockchain consensus mechanism called Graphene is quite a feat of engineering in itself, and appears to be one of the best current options as a potential framework for such a system. To keep our goals manageable, development will be oriented towards simple on-chain games first, and progressing towards greater levels of feature complexity as the project unfolds.  Anyhow, that's a little of my background and qualifications. As I mentioned above, I am quite busy and I have little time to frequent online forums, but I wanted to come here to let everyone know am confident in our business development and communication team to continue to answer any of your questions at this stage. My involvement in this project will be ongoing, and you will definitely hear more from me in the weeks and months ahead!  Thank You,  Neil Haran",False

This model allows the network to financially benefit from the trustless arbitration of each tournament and thus prevents Peerplays from having to act as a “house” and bet against its users.  Every time a fee is collected, the blockchain automatically splits it into a virtual account governed by a smart contract which distributes the fees in three directions. The largest percentage is distributed at regular intervals into the accounts of Peerplays core token holders as profit sharing. This means that core token holders receive a portion of every jackpot paid in any of the certified wagering instruments, along with a portion of the rest of the network fees. Another term for the core tokens is Fee-Backed Assets or FBAs, because they entitle the holder to a portion of the fees collected by the network.[8] The next portion is directed towards blockchain maintenance, such as for paying block producers and fixing bugs. And the third portion is sent to the Mega-Jackpot virtual accumulation account (outlined in the next section). All of these fees and percentages are determined by the elected Peerplays Committee members, who are voted for by the Peerplays token holders.   More information on this process can be found in our whitepaper: https://steemit.com/peerplays/@peerplays/peerplays-whitepaper",False

I've provided free technical consulting to the PeerPlays management team for the past several months with the understanding that they would contract with my own cryptocurrency company, BlockTrades, to help develop the software if they were successful in raising funding for the project.  I operate two companies: SynaptiCAD (http://www.syncad.com) which is a US-based developer of electronic design software that has operated for many years and more recently, BlockTrades (http://blocktrades.us), a Cayman Island's-based company which specializes in cryptocurrency software and operates a crypto-to-crypto ""instant exchange"" platform which is well-known in the BitShares community.  It's fairly dated at this point, but there's a small bio about my experience prior to getting involved in cryptocurrency here: http://www.syncad.com/manateam.htm  I got involved in cryptocurrency somewhat by chance: SynaptiCAD was contracting to help out on an engineering software contract headed up by Dan Larimer of BitShares notoriety at his previous employer. When Dan left that company to begin work on BitShares, he hired me and later contracted to bring on more of SynaptiCAD's staff to assist in the development for BitShares. Among other work there, we developed the peer-to-peer networking code for BitShares 1.0 that was later re-used in the Graphene toolkit that powers both BitShares 2.0 and STEEM. To my knowledge, this is the fastest operating blockchain (currently operating with 3s blocks although the original design goal was 10s blocks).  I very rarely post on bitcointalk as I'm not a prolific poster, as you can see from my posting history, but I have been posting for several years on bitsharestalk.org (almost since it began I guess) as dannotestein.

Sorry for the confusion - I have just added a note to the OP to reflect this.  The official budget and milestones for ongoing development will be released in the next week. BunkerChain Labs is overseeing the completion of the project and will release the funds to the Peerplays dev team as milestones are completed. The dev team was chosen for their long history of reliability on project delivery, both within and outside the crypto space. The company SynaptiCAD has developed software for many years and BlockTrades was part of the core development team for Graphene (BitShares), the decentralized blockchain consensus technology that has both the fastest block production times and the highest throughput capacity. They are now leading the development of Peerplays which is built using Graphene.  If you have any additional questions, feel free to contact Bunkerchain Labs or sent me a PM.",False

We ran into a few technical issues with our funding platform however that only became apparent after we started.  We had an intermitent issue with the email server we were using. We have since taken measures to fix this and have resent out payment confirmations to everyone who paid in, but still have their orders marked 'pending'.  Because some people were not getting their email confirmations this lead to a fair amount of confusion because essential instructions on token delivery were contained in those emails.  We have also noticed some are submitting orders and then not completing their payment process. We are using coinbase API interface that allows you to pay either directly with your coinbase account or bitcoin. It gives you 15 minutes to send something to chain to confirm your payment, after that you need to start your payment process over again. Some seemed to find this process confusing.  With these issues we are going to generate more content dedicated to our contribution process to make it easier for everyone.  In the meantime people have taken advantage of our live support and ticketing system to get their issues resolved with our help. Some have taken advantage of being able to reach us directly to get direct information on the project.  Also, we launched while our designer was still not finished our offer site. There is still some more tweaking, but if you go to www.peerplays.com you can now see our developer mockup we are working with in development of Peerplays that illustrates just some of the features.  That's all for now... this launch was really for those paying attention to take advantage of the low starting price. Now over the coming week we will be rolling out new announcements and updates.

You welcome to PM any of us on bitSharestalk.org, or go to the BitShares forums and ask around the community if you need further verification of our identities or involvement in the project. My handle is @CryptoPrometheus, Jonathan is @BunkerChainLabs, Dan is @dannotestein and Fabian is @xeroc.  If you are unaware of BitShares, we average over $100,000 daily trading volume and have been in the top 10 on coinmarketcap since 2014.    Also, if you would like to listen to us interacting in a Live Q & A session with longstanding members of the Bitshares community, including the founder and lead developer of BitShares, we had a conference call yesterday morning with about 30 people. Here is the podcast of that call: https://soundcloud.com/beyond-bitcoin-hangouts/e153-2016-05-6-fuzzy-friends-peerplays-lauch-party-steem-openpos  I suspect that some of your apprehension comes from the fact that Jonathan and my bitcointalk IDs are brand new, which is understandable. Neither of us have been active in the bitcoin community until now. I hope this clarifies any confusion.",False

The first ever global betting exchange:  http://bookie.exchange/images/Bookie-Sports-Betting-Logo.png   ====================================================================== Original Post from May 5th 2016 below   What is Peerplays?   The World’s First Decentralized Tournament Management and Wagering Platform Built Entirely on the Blockchain    http://www.peerplays.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/peerplays-video-intro.png    Guaranteed Provably Fair Gaming Peerplays’ provably fair gaming system is 100% open source and built directly onto the blockchain. You never have to worry about cheaters or unfair house odds, because all games take place between real players are matched with each other through a series of on-chain smart contracts. On Peerplays, you can place wagers and win huge jackpots by using these very same smart contracts.   Lightning Fast Speed and Network Capacity Peerplays is built on Graphene, the fastest decentralized blockchain technology in the world. Graphene has been successfully tested to handle over 100,000 transactions per second with average block times of under 3 seconds.   On-Chain Games Casino card games are adjudicated by smart contracts as part of the native blockchain code, and Peerplays’ player matching algorithm creates a trustless on-chain gaming environment. Since Graphene is incredibly fast, it allows for the broadcast and revealing of blinded proofs at the frequency necessary to facilitate real-time gameplay.   Fee-Backed Assets The core tokens of Peerplays are integrated into a fee-sharing program called Fee Backed Assets or “FBA”. This means the blockchain automatically distributes a percentage of the fees from every jackpot for every game on the entire network to the holders of Peerplays core tokens.   Digital Asset Exchange You can create your own tokens, buy and sell gateway tokens for popular cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, wager with price-stable SmartCoins from the BitShares platform from a growing number of reputable gateway services. You also have the opportunity to provide your own profitable gateway services for in-game assets from all your favorite RPGs.   Stakeholder Voting Peerplays leverages the power of stakeholder voting to resolve consensus issues in a fair and democratic way. All network parameters, from fee schedules to block intervals and transaction sizes, can be fine tuned by elected delegates chosen by you and fellow stakeholders.   Blockchain Guaranteed Referral Program The Peerplays blockchain automatically pays you a percentage of the revenue earned by each new account you refer for the lifetime of that account. This means you earn “kickbacks” from everyone you refer. Gaming partners can earn even more by getting all their users to sign up for a Peerplays account.   Mega-Jackpots The Peerplays blockchain can sponsor large tournament jackpots by allocating a small percentage of every network fee into a smart contract-secured virtual account called the Mega-Jackpot Fund. Mega-Jackpot tournament events are automatically scheduled, and then funds are unlocked by the smart contract and instantly transferred to the tournament winners.   PowerUp Points You can earn PowerUp tokens every time you play in a Peerplays tournament. They are the player rewards points of the Peerplays network, and are distributed according to win-loss records and amounts wagered, among other factors. PowerUp is the only token accepted as the buy-in fee for Mega-Jackpot tournaments, so they will be in high demand during Mega-Jackpot sign up periods. They are tradeable on the digital asset exchange.   Gaming Partner Support As a gaming partner, you can connect your server through the Peerplays API and take advantage of the decentralized network for processing wagers and jackpots. You can also customize tournament structures, fee schedules, and fund collection & distribution methods in order to maximize your profit potential. Whether you are a game publisher, advertiser, tournament host or vendor, if you plug into Peerplays you will gain shared access to the entire network of users while still enjoying the freedom of operating your own independent website.
