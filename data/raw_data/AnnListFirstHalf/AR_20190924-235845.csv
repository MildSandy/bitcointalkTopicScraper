Risks     Teams are build from recent graduates that lack experience in corporate governance, but nevertheless, have a good education and you can see that their Github is active and project main net will be launched in June. -1     Competition in this segment is rather fierce. -1     The token sale of the project went nine months and thus has a wide spread of pricing during various stages, which in turn makes it risky to enter into ICO. -1.5  Growth Factors     Data storing is a big market and the product has a competitive edge on its competitors. +1     Active Github and Mainnet launch June 8. +3     Confirmed partnerships and strong advisers. +1     Low cap ($8.7 million), which is both assuring and reasonable. It also sets the project up for significcant growth potential. +2     Brand awareness is solid; the Telegram group has 24,000 members. +2     There is a high demand for this project from the community and it seems that the private round is oversubscribed. The project employs PoC (proof of care) for investors who want to participate in the crowdsale, which implies that there will be an unmet demand during the ICO. This could offset negative risks of a wide price spread between token sale stages. +1.5  Disposition The project generates a two-fold opinion. On one hand, the team is rather young and inexperienced. On the other hand, they have good advisers and partners and plan to launch a working product in June. Although the space is full of competitors, the product has a competitive edge and market is still huge with significant growth potential. However, due to long token sale cycles, Arweave has a wide range of prices during different token sale stages. However, early indicators suggest the project is oversubscribed, which means high demand. This, in conjunction with a hard cap of $8.7 million, give Arweave a rating of 7 out of 10.

The major difference is that miners can only mine blocks for which they have an accessible copy of the 'recall' block (which is pseudo-randomly chosen from the set of all previous blocks). In practice this means that the amount of time miners can directly participate in the hashing competition (PoW) part of Archain mining is directly proportional to the amount of the weave that they locally store, or can access. Another effect of this is that the hashing competitions themselves will be between smaller groups of miners, leading to a lower 'difficulty'.  Thanks, Sam Archain Team",False

We are active on slack  Quote from: kewisnacks on August 20, 2017, 06:42:32 AM Hi,  I have a spin on the previous question, which is more efficiency-centric:  Let's say Alice and Bob both submits an URL to be archived, either at the same time or at different times with no incremental content change. Will the network check if content already exist and inform the user or will both Alice and Bob have their content archived redundantly and both be charged the transaction fee?  I'm asking this because there can be ""news-worthy"" events and many users could archive the same content, but this provides no additional value to the data stored on the blockweave.   We would disagree with you slightly that repeatedly archiving the same page adds no value. By repeatedly taking copies of the same page, the page is subject to greater scrutiny, in that changes are picked up in a much more granular way.  This means that these news worthy events you describe are simply subject to higher scrutiny in archain because of it, a result we think is favourable.  Quote from: bambarmia on August 20, 2017, 08:36:49 PM I will join this project, but only after they appear on exchanges. The price will be much lower comparing to ICO.  The problem of all this ICO -s is that just few of them succeeded.    We're sorry to hear that!

One of the things we are most excited about, however, is the potential for people to create special interest archiving 'groups'. These groups would all contribute a small amount of ARC and run an ADT node in the Archain network that automatically archives webpages relating to a given topic. Because of the flexibility of Archain ADT nodes, they could even take manual submissions on a web frontend, check whether the contents are related to the interests of the 'team', and archive it if appropriate.  In this way, groups that are interested in funding the archiving of information about a topic they think is important could be linked with people that want to archive certain web pages for free. The key to these archiving groups, however, is flexibility: The Archain ADT allows their nodes (which decide what the group should archive) can be programmed simply and completely arbitrarily.  @willdono: Glad you like the sound of PoA mining!

Had few questions that seem to be addressed in this thread (like total supply of ARC etc). Sttill have few questions/assumptions, please let me know if those are correct:  - I understand that someone who has a wallet and submits a archive request does not need to store the weave. Only the ledger which grows about 13MB per year. Is that correct?  - Actual archive data is stored in the weave which has no size limit but due to the decentralised nature the miners need not store the entire weave themselves, rather 'some' blocks from the weave. The more 'rare' blocks they store, the more incentive they have. Is that correct?  - The 'text' portion of the webpage is entirely stored in weave while media (documents, images, videos) are hashed in weave and the original media remains offchain. As long as the original media is available on local storage, it can be accessed via weave. (However the question is: does the media need to remain available in that particular machine from where it was archived or it can be replicated to other miner machines to make it easier to preserve?)  - The weave works like a P2P system where nobody has a complete copy of the entire weave but everyone has access to the whole data collectively. In that case is there any chance that some part of the weave becomes inaccessible if those blocks are destroyed or go offline for unknown duration (just like P2P peers getting stuck at 98% because there are no seeds)?

We will be in touch regarding French translation.  @eXpl0sive: Your comments are pretty much spot on. Thanks for taking the time to read in depth about the project! We know there is quite a lot of detail to get through. I will address each of your points in turn.     Yes. All a 'full' client or miner needs to do to join the network is download the last sync block, and the TX stubs from that block to the present block (the sync block 'period' will change over time, but the total download required will stay comparatively minute).   Actual archive data is stored in the weave which has no size limit but due to the decentralised nature the miners need not store the entire weave themselves, rather 'some' blocks from the weave. The more 'rare' blocks they store, the more incentive they have. Is that correct?  Yes. The only clarification I would make is that the more blocks a miner has, the more likely they are to be able to mine the next block. However, not all blocks will be equally stored in the network, so miners are incentivised to store blocks that few other miners are storing (as this lets them compete in the PoW part of the PoA system among a smaller group of miners).   The 'text' portion of the webpage is entirely stored in weave while media (documents, images, videos) are hashed in weave and the original media remains offchain. As long as the original media is available on local storage, it can be accessed via weave. (However the question is: does the media need to remain available in that particular machine from where it was archived or it can be replicated to other miner machines to make it easier to preserve?)  The media can be included on the weave, but owing to the price, we don't expect people to do this often. The files associated with the hashes can be stored anywhere, and 're-united' with the data on the weave later. We anticipate that if the Archain is successful, 10 - 20 years from now sites will pop up where people can offer rewards for the original media that matches a hash stored on the weave, allowing them to completely re-construct pages they find particularly important.   The weave works like a P2P system where nobody has a complete copy of the entire weave but everyone has access to the whole data collectively. In that case is there any chance that some part of the weave becomes inaccessible if those blocks are destroyed or go offline for unknown duration (just like P2P peers getting stuck at 98% because there are no seeds)?  It is possible, but the incentive for someone to find a block that appears 'lost' becomes extraordinary. It would grant the holder the soul ability to mine a new block that requires that old block, guaranteeing the associated rewards. Then, once the new block is found, in order to be accepted and verified by the network the miner needs to distribute the recall block as well as the new block. As the recall block is 'rare', many of these miners will store copies of it. Subsequently, over time, these storage imbalances will 'level out'.   The way I see it in a nutshell, Archain is the decentralised version of Archive.org Wayback Machine, with better accessibility.  This certainly covers a good part of the project's functionality. I would add that it also does decentralised verification of the content prior to archiving (unlike archive.org), as well as arbitrary permanent data storage for a fee ('Permanence as a Service').

First, the cost of storing a document will be proportionate to the size of that document -- for both 'verified' web pages and 'unverified' files. We do not envisage a daily block size limit.  Support for webpages that load their main content through Javascript is still under review at the moment. These pages (after their contents is loaded) could always be archived in their 'unverified' form, but may not be verifiable (with all their content loaded) when the network first launches. This is something we will look at in the first few major updates to the Archain web-scaper post-launch. One of the methods we are exploring is similar to the way Google partially evaluates some Javascript in order to make dynamic sites indexable.  Videos are a difficult area for Archain, owing to their size. While it will always be possible to upload unverified videos to the network, this will likely prove prohibitively expensive for most situations (given the permanent nature of Archain storage). Instead, however, we aim to support replacing videos in webpages with hashes of videos, in a similar way to the method described for images and other multimedia objects in the whitepaper. This will allow users to 're-unite' videos that have been stored off the chain, with the web pages that have been stored on it. In this way, as long as the video is stored somewhere that it is accessible later, it can be proved to have belonged to the archived web page, at the time of archiving, after the fact (for only the cost of storing the hash itself).  We have not considered a 'Content Approver' role, as this could potentially lead to systemic censorship. Data getting onto the weave, however, is dependent on being accepted by the miners. The system has been designed in such a way that if the community decided to, they could build their own 'content approval' nodes, which miners could choose to consult before accepting transactions. These could simply be typical Archain Developer Toolkit apps (discussed on the website and in the whitepaper).  Finally, we have an experimental anti-virus system (built atop SamAV, utilising ClamAV malware definitions) that can be optionally used to scan incoming transactions for dubious contents. Please note that this feature is 'experimental' at this stage and may not make it into the first release (hence its absence from the whitepaper).  I hope this is helpful. Please don't hesitate to let us know if you have any further comments or questions.  Thanks, Archain Team",False

Arweave is a brand new internet in a massively scalable blockchain.  It is a global, permanent hard drive on a new kind of blockchain Arweave was previously known as Archain.   Meet the Blockweave   The blockweave is an evolved blockchain that offers permanent data storage and can grow to colossal sizes by efficiently self-organising its data across many machines.  Unlike its predecessors, Arweave allows this sharding to occur flexibly and dynamically to adapt to shifting requirements of the network, without losing its guarantees of redundancy and verifiability. Additionally, Arweave’s novel Proof of Access algorithm replaces the high energy usage of typical blockchains with useful storage of data.   Proof of Access    Arweave achieves its feats of vast scalability by requiring miners to only hold the previous block in the system and a set of randomly chosen old blocks. Each time a block is mined, a new ‘recall’ block is chosen. Only those that hold the recall block can successfully mine the next block.  Miners are rewarded in proportion to the amount of the blockweave that they store. Miners are encouraged to store the parts of the blockweave that other miners do not, as this proportionally increases their chance at receiving a block reward. Additionally, the Proof of Access system replaces much of the high energy expenditure associated with traditional cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin) with information storage.  Overall, Proof of Access creates a new kind of blockchain that is spectacularly scalable and energy efficient.  Long Term Mission    Humanity has always attempted to store important information for long periods of time. For lone individuals this is an extraordinarily difficult and costly affair.  By taking advantage of the globally cooperative nature of blockweave mining, the Arweave creates large economies of scale on the cost and complexity of permanent data storage. By providing a cheap and permanent data storage mechanism and an easy interface for developers to interact with, the Arweave will attract vast quantities of valuable and important information.  Over time, this verified store of information will grow in value as copies elsewhere are lost. We anticipate that as the utility of this information store grows, use of the Arweave will snowball. Read the whitepaper here  Arweave’s Functionality   Enabling a New Internet    Arweave provides a new serverless internet infrastructure, one based on decentralisation and the permanent availability of pages.  Because of the blockweave data structure, each page on the Arweave is cryptographically linked to every other page, making its modification or loss impossible.  Massively Scalable    Due to the innovative new technologies upon which the network is based, Arweave is the first cryptocurrency that can reach internet scale.  By allowing Arweave to be spread across many computers, a network is created that is as secure and verifiable as all of its predecessors, but can flexibly scale to provide the amount of storage the network requires.  A Platform for Permanent Apps    Arweave has been built from the ground up as a platform for a new class of permanence based, decentralised applications.  The Arweave makes permanent data storage available to any developer, in any programming language, through a simple HTTP interface. Arweave storage can be seamlessly integrated into apps, both old and new. What It Can Do   Decentralised applications made using the Arweave's simple API can solve problems that were previously untenable.  Arweave achieves profound data reliability by building economies of scale in the organisation of data storage. It is extraordinarily difficult for an individual or organisation to build a permanent data storage system, but on a planetary scale, using financial incentives, the task becomes achievable and affordable.  Below are just a handful of the kind of apps that can be built using the Arweave's developer toolkit. If you are interested in building an Arweave app, check out our Github, blog, and our dedicated community Discord server.  A Permanent Internet Archive    As well as providing an entirely new internet infrastructure, the Arweave supports archiving pages found on the traditional internet. This allows users to secure valuable pages on a decentralised network beyond the control of any one organisation or group. This is made possible through a web browser extension that allows users to mirror pages found on the traditional internet in their current form on the Arweave for just a few pence and a single click.  Once stored on the Arweave, these pages, in the exact form in which they were archived, can be retrieved at any time by its users. Ultimately, by providing a method of permanent and verifiable information storage Arweave strives to ensure internet freedom from undue censorship far into the future.  Watch the video | Check out the alpha  Cloud Storage for a One-Time Fee    Backup your personal file in a permanent and decentralised storage cloud, and pay only for what you use. Check out the alpha  Legal Document Storage    Arweave allows verifiable private contract storage, allowing anybody to prove the contents of a legal document at any time. This will disrupt legal archiving, empowering lawyers to cut paper waste and join the decentralised age.  Not only will the Arweave revolutionise legal document storage in the future, but companies are already using the Arweave for financial compliance and verification purposes.  Ensuring Personal Legacy    By providing true information permanence for the first time, the Arweave allows everyone to ensure their digital legacy. The indefinite preservation of digitised memorabilia will allow anyone to communicate their life's journey to grandchildren and generations to come.  Permanent and Verifiable Science    The Arweave project is working with academic partners to provide permanent and verified storage of scientific data and results. By providing a permanent and public scientific publishing platform Arweave will fuel a virtuous cycle of Academic transparency and legitimacy, as well as preserving an apocalypse-proof library of science.  Publish Freely, Publish Permanently    Arweave allows permanent publishing of news articles, blogposts, and social media, on a network hosted by the writer’s peers.  Publishing on the Arweave is serverless and administration free, while maintaining the visual form and style the authors prefer. The Arweave ensures freedom of expression for decades to come for writers across the globe.  Verifiable Democracy    Arweave allows for open, verifiable and free elections, ensured by the power of cryptography. By enabling pseudonymous votes, Arweave elections remain anonymous but allow all citizens to verify the legitimacy of a democratic vote. Furthermore, every vote in an Arweave election is cryptographically entangled with every other vote in every other election, ensuring that no single party can subvert their results.

Is it similar to XRB, IOTA or Byteball's tangle data structure? The whitepaper doesn't explain much on how it achieves consensus.  Hi,  Thank you for the feedback. We do try and explain how our blockweave implements true scaling in the whitepaper, but if it wasn't clear, then perhaps we can do better. To quickly summarise: the blockweave incentives even distribution of the data because a randomly selected old block is required in the mining of each new block. In this way, mining can only efficiently be achieved by storing   a) the whole blockweave (this is what we expect people to do early on)  or, if storing the whole blockweave is not feasible  b) storing the bits of the blockweave that are least stored by everybody else.  In this way, as the blockweave becomes too large to store in one place, the best strategy for each miner individually results in an even spread of the stored data across the group.

Hi,  You will recieve your public/private key immediately, and will be able to use your wallet on the testnet as soon as it is live.  Obviously, tokens wont be available for full use until the genesis block is released.

I was guessing correct that the blocks will be saved over the nodes randomly with some redundancy. How many copies for redundancy do you expect?,False

The simple answer is 'enough'. The longer answer is that the incentives to store blocks increase dramatically as the number of copies of the blocks decreases. At the start, we expect that most miners will hold most blocks, then over time the proportion of the weave held by each miner will slowly decrease.  While its hard to predict what the behaviour of the network will be in the long term, the algorithm has been designed such that the miners are always selfishly encouraged to provide a good coverage of all the blocks.
