VAULT Vault ensures each individual file is first encrypted and then sliced into 5 different portions or shards. Each of these file portions is then encrypted again and stored separately on 5 third-party cloud storage providers (such as Amazon, Google Drive and Box). The encryption algorithm also determines a storage format that ensures storage node redundancy and 24/7/365 operational reliability. Each file is stored in a granular, distributed format across 5 independent cloud storage providers, using 6 encryption keys per file. Importantly, all encryption keys are only stored on the user’s personal devices and offline back-up system. No encryption keys are stored in the cloud.  SENTRY Sentry's private permission blockchain engine offers much more than simply monitoring user access and tracking all file- sharing activities. It offers encrypted communications for email and chat. It offers offline key back-up, digital leak protection, threat analysis, data geo-fencing and user quarantining for network administrators. It offers enterprise-level, group-level, user-level and file-level security permission management. Most important of all, it offers an open-source security and storage platform that can be integrated into third party software products for industry-wide security solutions.  Decentralized platforms based on blockchain-only file storage (eg: Sia, Storj, Filecoin) typically expose 1% of the potential attack surface to hackers compared to centralized storage systems. However, Cryptyk's hybrid blockchain has two rings of decentralization, translating to a miniscule attack surface < 1% of blockchain-only networks, and < 0.01% of conventional centralized networks.",False

The pre-sale round for accredited investors commences on February 08, 2018 at 5pm UTC. The pre-sale round is priced at a 20% discounted price of 10 cents per CTK token.  The public sale round for non-accredited investors commences on March 08, 2018 at 5pm UTC, and is priced at 12.5 cents a token. Note that only 750 million tokens will ever be created and released into the market.  Cryptyk has developed a revolutionary new approach to cyber-security and cloud storage. Instead of trying to prevent data security breaches, Cryptyk assumes hacks are inevitable and makes files effectively 'safe to hack'. The ultimate goal is to take the profit out of hacking and the risk out of the cloud.  Cryptyk's new Hybrid Blockchain Technology is based on the integration of encrypted decentralized file storage with blockchain auditing and monitoring. This hybrid solution is passively immune to external, viral and operational security threats, and also allows network administrators to protect against potential internal and surveillance threats. It is the first complete cyber-security and cloud storage solution from a single vendor, and dramatically reduces the cost of cyber-security for all business and enterprise.  ""We are building the world's most secure cloud security and storage system"", said Cryptyk CEO, Dr. Adam Weigold. ""but more importantly we are also creating a whole new crypto-economy and ecosystem for the cyber-security market"" he added.  At the heart of the Cryptyk platform is the Cryptyk Token (CTK), which drives an open-source cyber-security ecosystem consisting of 3rd party app developers, strategic enterprise customers, crypto-currency miners and investors. The Cryptyk Token is a true utility token that offers scalable benefits to all participants. Long term growth in CTK value will be directly driven by customer adoption and product use, rather than short-term market sentiment. Consequently, utility tokens offer investors greater potential for long term growth and less market volatility compared to the more common security tokens. Token sale participants are investing directly in a product and its self-propagating ecosystem, rather than buying equity in the company.  The funds raised in USD, Bitcoin and Ethereum will be used by Cryptyk Inc. for product development and sales. A minimum raise of US$3 million is required to deploy the crypto-currency ecosystem with a maximum raise capped at US$25 million.  The Cryptyk Team comprises of veteran cyber security, cloud storage and blockchain experts. The founders include CEO, Dr. Adam Weigold, a quantum physicist and veteran of 6 tech startups, and CTO, Raghu Kotha, a well-known white-hat hacker, cyber security expert, and former director of security at Silicon Valley Bank.

Our goal is to disrupt the trillion dollar cyber security industry. As you are no doubt aware, cyber security is a massive problem for pretty much all enterprises and the current solutions are fragmented. Often an enterprise will require 3-4 different software solutions to achieve their security goals: CASBs, Firewalls, Anti-Virus, Encryption, etc...  Cryptyk's solution is an all-in-one package that achieves outstanding results at less than half the cost of traditional multi-vendor solutions and many times faster than blockchain storage such as Sia, Storj, and Filecoin. Our security attack vectors are tiny compared to existing solutions. We are building the most secure cyber security and storage platform on the market. Period.  As you identified, we are also seeking to build a cyber-security ecosystem. We will incentivize potential clients (to adopt the software), strategic alliance partners (to work with us in creating synergistic pan-platform solutions), and 3rd party developers (to build apps and software to augment our core system).  With this in mind we think that our impact on the market will be significant and we look forward to building a community of like-minded cyber security professionals.  It sounds like we could be looking forward to your involvement too?   Best Team Cryptyk",False
