All of the data is indexed and transcribed on the EMR side  appropriate CPT and ICDN9 (10) codes entered on the procedure and diagnosis levels so all you need as a working interface to send and receive data. So the workflow might be that during the visit physician places an order for the MRI breast cancer screening - when the procedure is performed and then transcribed ordering physician typically receives some kind of message within EMR with results; at this moment it is supper easy to grab that image and send it to a third party via HL7 interface for analysis - typically that will be another order (billable or not billable) placed within an EMR - the question is how usable are the results from the legal standpoint and how they will be transcribed. No One stops me as physician to consult a psychic about patients diagnosis but legally I can't treat patients based on that From the patient's prospective that is slightly easier - solution can be integrated into the patient portal as a second opinion module and images that are available on this portal can be submitted for analysis. However that opens up a huge can of worms from the legal and customer service prospective in the scenario if the results will differ from physician diagnosys .... However - in the hospital world it is all about profits and knowing that majority of them operate on very thin budget if that solution can be used to cut some of the costs that will really fly ,True

We reduce the total supply of tokens from 36,000,000 to 14,400,000. 2. The total amount of tokens available for sale is decreased to 12,000,000 (new hard-cap), instead of 30,000,000 earlier. 3. The total amount of tokens of the team, partners and advisers is the same - 20% (2 400 000) out of 12 000 000. 4. Soft-cap remains the same - 10,000,000 tokens. 5. The cost of the first 10,000,000 tokens is $0.95 per token, the next million is $1.05 per token, the last million is $1.25 per token. 6. We extend the ICO period for a week, until April 8th. This is done due to the latest drops in the cryptocurrency, and the decrease in business activity of ICO investors.  Changing the key ICO conditions significantly increases the attractiveness of the SKCH token.  Hurry to take part in our ICO. There are about 5,000,000 tokens left for sale.",True

Part one is a wallet allowing you to purchase and manage skycoin. Part two is a method of sending medical data - either through gathering data manually by person or physician, filling out surveys, or electronically through some agreed format. This would allow a person to create their own personal profile of medical data, that can be used or shared as the owner, the person, wishes. If this data is utilized in training an AI, that person gets paid in skycoin. Thirdly, a method of submitting data, most likely a photograph, to be analyzed by an AI. This would allow for a personal and immediate screening method, that would be charged an appropriate amount of skycoin.  This is all still very young but I would think that a working app of at least the first two parts would be a huge asset.

Stay tuned for updates in our Twitter and Facebook groups! Quote from: dort on January 22, 2018, 04:18:04 PM Hello everyone! I would like to clarify one point from the position of the medical data provider: will the downloaded information be used only once or an unlimited number of times? The dataset provided can be used as many times as needed. Let me describe this situation: Once you have uploaded your dataset you can set the price (in skycoin), which will be paid to you for each use of your dataset. When an AI developer uses your dataset to train his AI you kinda sign a smart contract. So for every use of the AI the dataset provider receives a royalty. If you update your dataset the AI developers can re-train their AI, using the updated version of your dataset, but you are free to increase the royalty as your dataset provides more possibilities for AI training. In this case, the developers of AI can stay with the previous version of your dataset and pay the first royalty, or re-train their AI and pay a new royalty. Quote from: polonium84 on January 22, 2018, 05:22:05 PM I was told that in SkyConstructor you can build a neural network from ready blocks. So the question arose, what are these blocks and who will do them for this module? These blocks will be provided by our developers. Quote from: robinzzon on January 22, 2018, 08:31:45 PM Friends, do you think that if the neural network establishes the wrong diagnosis, will its developer be punished for this somehow or will his rating in the system be reduced? Well, first of all, we should say, that neural networks are not the thing, that should establish a diagnosis. It is used as an expert system, but the doctor has the last word. And talking about your question - if a ANN will provide wrong results its rating will be reduced.",True

Quote from: borch2aw on January 07, 2018, 06:01:58 PM i need a little help. i bought sch tokens a couple weeks ago and i think i bought them straight from gdax (i think) which ive been told you are not supposed to buy ico tokens straight from exchange. but! none the less, when i log into skychain, it shows my balance of tokens that i bought and it says when ico is finished, the tokens will go to erc20 wallet. can anyone help me understand what exactly i should do? like what steps i should take to secure my tokens. thank you!! any help will be greatly appreciated!!  Dear borch2aw, just log into your account and open ""Token balance"" tab. There is a field called ""Provide the address you want to receive your SCHs to:"" Just provide your erc20 wallet and the tokens will be sent to your ERC20 wallet within 10 days after Main Sale (ICO) ends. Quote from: EazyMe on December 31, 2017, 06:54:24 PM Hello It is not clear to me what the token will be used for in this platform ? Thanks for explaining  EazyMe Hey, EazyMe! The tokens used are SCH. When the project goes live they will be exchanged to Skycoin and 1SCH will be equal to 100 Skycoin. Quote from: acaciahill94 on December 31, 2017, 02:11:10 PM Greetings. I‚Äôve got the following question: will testing neural network on the platform be free?  I don't quite get you. If you want to know whether your neural network fits the requirements of the skychain platform, as far as I know, this process will be free. Quote from: Mat24 on December 31, 2017, 01:15:40 PM How many miners do you plan to attract for training neural networks in Skychain and how long will it take such a number of miners to train one neural network?

However, the development of the AI-in-medicine market is hindered by two major obstacles: It‚Äôs difficult to gain access to big data required for training medical neural networks, and there is no infrastructure enabling doctors and patients to access such networks.  Skychain can solve these problems and revolutionize the AI-in-medicine market! Skychain‚Äôs key components are its Data Marketplace and AI Marketplace.  The Skychain Data Marketplace is a closed loop that allows medical data providers to provide their data as a service, so that independent neural network developers can train their networks. The data providers won‚Äôt sell their data sets outright but will only provide them as a service. Neural network developers won‚Äôt be able to download their trained neural networks from the closed loop, which guarantees that data providers will get royalties for each use of any neural network trained on their data sets.  The Skychain AI Marketplace is the open loop that will enable doctors and patients to access an unlimited number of medical neural networks.  Skychain is going to unite the key parties, namely medical data providers, independent neural network developers, and users, into an open ecosystem. It‚Äôs a win-win situation for all the parties:  Data provides will make a profit by providing their data sets, and Skychain will create a medical data market that currently doesn‚Äôt exist. Neural network developers will train their neural networks on a huge amount of medical data and get very accurate, deep neural networks. Healthcare professionals will analyze their patients‚Äô test and examination results more quickly and more accurately thanks to a wide choice of accurate neural networks. Patients will benefit from the most accurate, high-quality diagnosis. Crypto miners will make a profit by providing their huge computational resources for neural network training and calculation. TOKEN PRE-SALE The Skychain project is going to pre-sale its tokens with a 50% discount from December 18, 2017, to January 7, 2018. Prior to the ICO, Skychain representatives will speak at eight or more major crypto conferences all over the world.  Most importantly, the Skychain project is based on existing approaches and technologies, and all the legal and regulatory issues have been worked out. So hopefully all Skychain token buyers will make a nice profit when the project is implemented.  http://skychain.global",True

Next, the developer uploads the neural network into a closed loop. The neural network's code should implement several typical methods, such as training, inference so that this neural network could be used in a closed-loop system. Next, the closed-loop starts the training process of the neural network using the full volume of data and keeps the neural network in protected storage. The neural networks remain available to consumers through the Inference method. 2. The developer himself trains the neural network on his computer in any way and simply connects it to Skychain for the purposes of inference. 3. The developer can train a neural network on his own dataset, using the distributed training system, provided by Skychain. In this case, the developer must implement several additional methods that will combine the neural network parameters after each iteration of the distributed learning process.  To sum it all up - the developer himself chooses the libraries, algorithms, etc. used and should simply implement a number of public methods in order for his neural network to be uploaded and used in the Skychain system.",True
