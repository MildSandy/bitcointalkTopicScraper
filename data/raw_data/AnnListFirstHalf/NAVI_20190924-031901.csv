The company has significant influence and local resources in China. It is involved in blockchain technology related investments and provides one-stop solution to blockchain projects.

Naviaddress is building partnerships with large address holders in delivery, e-retail and HoReCa businesses, such as Booking.com, DPD, and plan cooperation and integration with State Postal Services, AliExpress, Amazon, NinjaVan, etc. to share verified addresses with the platform.   With over 55% of NaviTokens sold so far, and aim to raise $20 million in total during ICO, there is enough traction to partner with some major players in China in delivery and e-retail, hospitality, transportation and urban planning. Once the addressing system is deployed on the blockchain, Naviaddress will enable 4 billion people in the world living without addresses to obtain and share digital postal delivery naviaddresses, verified by a transaction on the blockchain at almost no cost. Usage of naviaddresses will enable local governments to provide more citizens with essential services and create new markets for e-retailers and delivery businesses.",False

At the moment the Team is calculating the results. We will make an announcement about the funds raised during Phase I at 12:00 CET tomorrow.  We would like to acknowledge the fact that we had experienced an overwhelming interest since the beginning of our ICO. The flow of transactions was so high that the verification of your KYC resulted in the overdrive of the backend (the smartcontract checks KYC Yes/No). We were able to fix the issue and bring up the success rate of the transactions. We apologize for the stress and inconvenience and assure you that we are now fully equipped for Phase 2, which will start on March, 3rd, 15:00 CET.  Due to the difficulties with the smartcontract we have used transitional addresses. This means that we have raised money using several ethereumaddresses (as pointed out by members of our community), rest assured all contributions are kept and safeguarded at a secure address.  We would also like to remind you that today we will launch our blockchain beta 0.1 version!  Later today a post will be made with an explanation how to view our beta version. Reaching this milestone even before the ICO Phase II shows our commitment to the project and dedication of our developers. Needless to say we are very proud of this accomplishment!

The conversion of ETH/BTC to US$ to NVT will be done after the ICO closing using the data from https://www.cryptocompare.com/api/.   We will determine timestamps for each transaction (BlockTrail for BTC and Etherscan for ETH) during ICO. Then we will retrieve the average rates for BTC/US$ and ETH/US$ for those particular timestamps. These rates will be used to calculate amount of NVT allocated to every contributor.   NaviTokens will be distributed within 7 days after the ICO ends.   How does the Naviaddress token (NVT) function within the platform and why is it needed?   NaviToken is a utility token. Naviaddresses are exchanged for NaviTokens. Premium naviaddresses (1-5 digits) will be purchased by users. Custom naviaddresses (6-8 digits and more) will be paid by the platform. We are building freemium model.   We also plan to use tokens reserved for development of the platform and ecosystem around it in three major ways: 1) Incentivize local national partners to work with the platform by co-investing with them into JV - we will invest our tokens (5-10%< of overall development fund of the JV). Sell country/regional containers of premium naviaddresses (1 to 5 digits) for NaviTokens through auction to local partners (could be JV) with proven competence in the subscription business so that they will lease naviaddresses to local businesses for fiat and make money. The result of this transaction - all nominal price in tokens for sold naviaddresses will be burnt by the platform while the premium - a difference between market price and nominal price - will be retained by the platform as the revenue. Our current forecast shows that 150 million NavTokens will be burnt if the Platform sells 30 national containers of premium naviaddresses.   2) Incentivize big verified address holders (DHL, DPD, others) to share verified addresses with the platform. We will need NVTs to incentivize them to share.   3) Incentivize GIS experts to verify currently unverified addresses. As you see, we need to have a quite sizable ecosystem development fund. We intend to play long term.   We have published the smart-contract in our profile on GitHub. Check details: https://github.com/naviworld/navi-token/.

This has translated to a large amount of people subscribing for the Early Bird Whitelist. Early Birds are participants that showed their interest in NaviAddress at a very early stage. They will be allowed to participate during Phase 1, which starts March 1st, 3PM CET. Once Phase 1 is complete, we will calculate the remaining Phase 2 cap pro rata.  Because we believe in transparency, honesty and a strong community we will be sharing the current number of whitelist participants with you, making you part of our journey. Please note that the whitelist is still open for another 5 days at naviaddress.io/registration.  Everyone whitelisted after today will be eligible for Phase 2. This means that your cap is guaranteed.  Since we know you all love numbers as much as we do, let's cut to the chase: the number of Early Birds is 5309. This means that every Early Bird will be able to buy up to 37,671 NVT‚Äôs (1883 USD) during Phase 1. We are very glad to be able to welcome so many people to the project whilst we are still in our early days, we hope you will support us as we continue to grow over the next weeks. Feel free to spread the word. Specifically, keep an eye on our AMA with OhHeyMatty (Feb 28), and our GitHub. After all, the best marketing is a successful project.

ICO Complete :),"Dear Navi supporters,  We have received many questions on how NVTs shall be distributed among purchasers at our ICO stage that starts on March 1, 2018.  To address all that questions, we have developed and publish here a procedure on NVTs sale at ICO stage.  Procedure On the last day of the pre-ICO we will calculate and publish the amount of NVTs available for the ICO stage. We will also group the members of WL into 2 categories: ""early birds"" and the rest - based on the dates they've applied for registration. ""Early birds"" stands for all registered before February 25th 3pm CET.  Further placement of NVTs will go in 3 phases:   ‚Ä¢ Phase I starts on March 01st 3pm CET and goes for 24 hours - until March 2nd 3pm CET. Only ""early bird"" members are eligible for the Phase I. We will determine the pro-rata cap for this phase as the total amount of NVTs available for the ICO divided by the number of ""early birds"" members in the WL. Participants will be offered to acquire number of tokens limited by such cap. Thus ""early birds"" members are guaranteed to participate in token generation event unless all NVTs would be sold before the ICO start.   ‚Ä¢ Phase II starts on March 03rd 3pm CET and goes for 24 hours - until March 4th 3pm CET. All ""white-listed"" members are eligible for the Phase II. We will determine the pro-rata cap for this phase as the total amount of NVTs remained after the Phase I (out of total amount of NVT available for the ICO) divided by the number of all ""white-listed"" members. Participants will be offered to acquire number of tokens limited by such cap.   ‚Ä¢ Phase III - a ""gas war"" - starts on March 5th 3pm CET and goes till the end of ICO on March 31st 3pm CET. For this phase number of tokens left after Phase I & II will be offered to all members of WL. FIFO rule applied. No upper limits on the amount of NVT to acquire. The more gas provided to register transaction - the better chances to get as much as you want before others come.  Example: Let's assume that only 200M NVTs are available for the ICO as of March 1 3pm CET. Also assume that total WL is 10K people with 5K are ""early birds"". Phase I: Cap is set at 40K NVTs per person (200M NVTs / 5K ""early birds""). ""Early birds"" are offered to acquire as much as 40K NVTs @ US$0.05 or up to US$ 2000. Let's assume that 160M NVTs are acquired in this Phase. Phase II: Cap is set at 4K NVTs per person (40M NVTs / 10K ""white-listed""). ""White-listed"" are offered to acquire as much as 4K NVTs @ US$0.05 or up to US$ 200. Let's assume that 30M NVTs are acquired at this Phase II.  Phase III: 10M NVTs are still unsold. All ""white-listed"" members are free to acquire any amount of NVTs out of available pool by sending their contributions. We will monitor the subscription amounts based on the time stamps of transactions until all NVT got sold.  Thank you for your trust in Naviaddress project and our team!",False

Update on EARLY BIRDS whitelisting;  Dear community,  Today we wish to share great news with you and announce the number of 'Early Bird' Whitelists to this date. Early birds are those participants that subscribe to the whitelist before the 25th of February 3PM CET. So those who have not yet subscribed: it is still possible to become an 'Early Bird' if you subscribe before 25th of Feb 3PM CET.  The Early Birds are participants that showed their interest in Naviaddress at a very early stage will be the only ones allowed to participate during Phase 1. Pre-ICO participants are also 'Early Birds'.  Currently we have already received thousands of completed KYCs, but also have 1500 people who are still going through our KYC (as per 12:00 CET today). The totalling amount is roughly 5000 'Early Birds'. We are very glad to see the positive feedback from the community and the new connections we build every day.  The ICO will starts on March 01st 3PM CET. It is still possible to become an 'Early Bird' if you whitelist before the 25th of February 3PM CET. Thereafter, whitelisted participants are only eligible for phase 2. We will determine the individual cap (pro-rata) for phase 1 as the total amount of NVTs available for the ICO divided by the number of ""early birds"" members that have passed KYC. Thus ""early bird"" members are guaranteed to participate in the token generation event, and will have a larger individual cap than phase 2 participants. The phase 2 cap is again determind as the amount remaining divided by the total number of whitelisted participants.  Thank you for your trust in the Naviaddress project and our team!

More transactions with naviaddresses more NVTs are used. Velocity goes up. Since nominal value in NVT is burnt while total number of tokens is capped, the value of NVT should go up.                                                                                             In addition you will be able to buy premium naviaddresses (1-5 digits) from the platform and lend them for fiat. For example you can buy Navi 33.1 2345 (France, Paris) after ICO at 10 NVT at 5 cents per NVT (50 cents) and lend it to location dependent retail business for USD 10 per month. This translates into annual stream of USD 120. If you return this at 10% caprate, you will have USD 1200 intrinsic value for naviaddress.",False

Lack of addresses as a part of ID for 4 billion people in the world.

With online and shared economy getting globalised conventional language specific addressing systems becomes a hurdle for quick, transparent and cost-efficient transactions between buyers and sellers. Today, up to 20% and up to 80% of addresses in developed and developing countries respectively are not verified from the first time due to mistakes in address spelling, address verification and ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù navigation problems. Issues with address verification create billions of US dollar wastes in e-retail and delivery industries.

International tourists and expats remained inaccessible for local hotels, cafes and restaurants. This result in lost sales. Naviaddress will provide authentication and easy last mile navigation for local HoReCa and retail outlets due to only digits, no language-specific, digital address, which is easy to find, share and communicate.    Deployment of Naviaddress system on the blockchain will provide for the following: 1. People and businesses get the freedom and ability to create, obtain, own, lend and sell their digital addresses. We call them naviaddresses - unified digital IDs for any place or object in real and virtual worlds- and they have all features to become new global addressing standard. No more shall we be dependent on state and municipal agencies -blockchain technology has enabled us to provide you with a naviaddress, trustless and verified by a transaction. 2. Naviaddresses and rights to them will be stored in a decentralized way, detached from Naviaddress company and practically forever. 3. Naviaddress ownership registration in favour of a user with smart contracts application. 4. Issue and circulation of NaviToken that will be used as the only currency to buy/sell/lend naviaddresses as well as the incentive for building the ecosystem and provide services within it.

For us it is important to select our strategic partners with care and think of the long-term successful growth of the project.  Today we are happy to announce our strategic partnership with The Crypto Capital Group (CCG), - whom have also been early investors in projects such as WaBi, Qlink, APEX, Matrix, and several other projects. We feel confident they will be able to help us on several fronts including the ICO stage, partnerships, networking and more.  We often see that the incentives of both participants and the team of projects are aligned until the ICO stage - after which marketing and customer support is almost always let down. NaviAddress aims to do this differently and we wish to have a wide community support us. Therefore, we have made a decision and announce it here - we are reserving 200 M of NVTs for the crowd sale.  Check our website early next week! There will be some new information there. We are always looking forward to keeping you updated on our progress.

Here's why NVT are expected to go up in price: One of the way for that is to expand the number of partners using Naviaddress, like UBER or Booking.com (they are our partners already), to incentive the NVT circulation.  The other one is to burn tokens. We plan to sell 20-30 country and regional containers to local country partners. This may result in burning from 100 to 300 mln NVTs by 2021. All nominal price in tokens for sold naviaddresses will be BURNT by the platform while the premium - a diffrence between market price and nominal price will be retained by the platform as revenue.  Sell all premium country/regional containers of naviaddresses for Navitokens through auction.

To address all that questions, we have developed and publish here a procedure on NVTs sale at ICO stage.  Procedure: On the last day of the pre-ICO we will calculate and publish the amount of NVTs available for the ICO stage. We will also group the members of WL into 2 categories: ""early birds"" and the rest - based on the dates they've applied for registration. ""Early birds"" stands for all registered before February 25th 3pm CET.  Further placement of NVTs will go in 3 phases:   o Phase I starts on March 01st 3pm CET and goes for 24 hours - until March 2nd 3pm CET. Only ""early bird"" members are eligible for the Phase I. We will determine the pro-rata cap for this phase as the total amount of NVTs available for the ICO divided by the number of ""early birds"" members in the WL. Participants will be offered to acquire number of tokens limited by such cap. Thus ""early birds"" members are guaranteed to participate in token generation event unless all NVTs would be sold before the ICO start.   o Phase II starts on March 03rd 3pm CET and goes for 24 hours - until March 4th 3pm CET. All ""white-listed"" members are eligible for the Phase II. We will determine the pro-rata cap for this phase as the total amount of NVTs remained after the Phase I (out of total amount of NVT available for the ICO) divided by the number of all ""white-listed"" members. Participants will be offered to acquire number of tokens limited by such cap.   o Phase III - a ""gas war"" - starts on March 5th 3pm CET and goes till the end of ICO on March 31st 3pm CET. For this phase number of tokens left after Phase I & II will be offered to all members of WL. FIFO rule applied. No upper limits on the amount of NVT to acquire. The more gas provided to register transaction - the better chances to get as much as you want before others come.  Example: Let's assume that only 200M NVTs are available for the ICO as of March 1 3pm CET. Also assume that total WL is 10K people with 5K are ""early birds"". Phase I: Cap is set at 40K NVTs per person (200M NVTs / 5K ""early birds""). ""Early birds"" are offered to acquire as much as 40K NVTs @ US$0.05 or up to US$ 2000. Let's assume that 160M NVTs are acquired in this Phase. Phase II: Cap is set at 4K NVTs per person (40M NVTs / 10K ""white-listed""). ""White-listed"" are offered to acquire as much as 4K NVTs @ US$0.05 or up to US$ 200. Let's assume that 30M NVTs are acquired at this Phase II.  Phase III: 10M NVTs are still unsold. All ""white-listed"" members are free to acquire any amount of NVTs out of available pool by sending their contributions. We will monitor the subscription amounts based on the time stamps of transactions until all NVT got sold.  Thank you for your trust in Naviaddress project and our team!",False

ICO Complete :),"WEB - FACEBOOK - TWITTER - TELEGRAM - LINKEDIN - MEDIUM  Naviaddress is a blockchain infrastructure ID management software for any place and object NAVIADDRESS is a first global decentralized addressing system, which allows users to create random or unique digital address (Naviaddress) to any location as well as event worldwide.The patent pending technology encodes postal address and geotag into a digit address (called ‚Äúnaviaddress‚Äù) by creating a pin on the map and assigning a naviaddress. It allows to add comments or upload photos to make it easier to find, send naviaddress to friends, partners, taxi or delivery service. The platform allows to get free address to a location, objects, people via their smartphones in real and virtual reality.  Naviaddress platform serves as a solution to pain points in several areas: The last mile delivery problem: up to 20% of parcels are undelivered for the first time. Last mile delivery issues damage consumer experience. Leadership in the last mile delivery is the next step in creating competitive advantage in e-commerce market. The destination point/route communication as well as an authenticity of accommodation and services in HoReCa, Taxi and Transportation industries for international tourists and expats. The opportunity for common people to get and use a naviaddress which combines in one number an object (house, apartment, location, place of interest) or event, its postal/delivery address  and its geocoordinates.   The deployment of the addressing system onto the blockchain enables the Company to create and maintain a global decentralized database of verified and trusted postal/delivery and user generated addresses. With no dependency on single source and authority. The platform shall provide for regular acquisition, verification of addresses, turning them into naviaddresses with embedded metadata, provision of  naviaddresses to platform users. NaviaddressToken (NVT) will be used as proprietary value medium in  transactions with naviaddresses. It will provide for secure, fast and cost-effective transaction processing. NVT will serve as incentive for the platform promotion, adoption and further development.   OUR VISION  We proclaim that: Addresses must have a simple standard format throughout the world; Addresses can be created not only by governments but by any person or group; An address is much more than just a text line: it should also reflect a geo-position and a digital description of a location.  Our aim is to create a modern and easy-to-use international addressing system, which will give rise to a plethora of addresses: international addresses; unified addresses, easy to reference; flexible addresses; and, more importantly, addresses that are easy to obtain (accessible even to those individuals who would be living on an unnamed street or an unnumbered building).  THE NAVIADDRESS PLATFORM  The Naviaddress Platform is a decentralized software solution based on cutting edge blockchain technology. The main goal of the Naviaddress Platform is to create and develop a worldwide universal digital address solution. To allow this, Naviaddress is developing its own user incentive program based on NaviToken‚Ñ¢ tokens (NVT)(further discussed below). The Naviaddress Platform will promote the expansion of the System by issuing and sharing NVTs with Users who subscribe to any Naviaddress products, such as web and mobile applications, chat bots and so on. The Naviaddress Platform is gathering a community of geography experts and incentivizing creation and verification of world addresses. The main advantage of purchasing a NVT is the right to a naviaddress and the right to modify and update metadata related to such address. Information on such naviaddresses will be published and made available publicly on the Naviaddress System.  Main actors  Platform. The Naviaddress Platform is created and managed by the Naviaddress Platform Operator. Developer. Developers receive NVTs by creating new locations and extending the services and products. These activities are typically supported and rewarded by the Naviaddress Platform. Customer. Customers have the right to acquire rights to a naviaddress and publish this information within the System in the blockchain ledger. Every Platform member is eligible to exchange naviaddresses for NVTs. User. Individuals who use naviaddress applications and activities.   NaviTokenS‚Ñ¢  A NVT is a unit of defined value internal to the Platform that may be used by any of the actors outlined above in acquiring or exchanging rights to naviaddresses, services or any other thing within the Platform. NVTs could also be used to promote the System by awarding NVTs to Users for certain actions within the Naviaddress Platform: registration, invitation of others, creation of popular Custom naviaddresses and other activities. Ultimately, NVTs will be used to stimulate Platform promotion, adoption and development.
