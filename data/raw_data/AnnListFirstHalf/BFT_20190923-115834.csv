Sad you didn't capture my message, but maybe I am bad at expressing my thoughts. To me personally cryptos are provenly valuable, but for how many other people does that also count at this very specific point in time? Not too many. As a result the whims in the crypto market are much much harder than anywhere else. Hence, running a loan business with reliable collateral rates is extremely hard to do. When you have a house people are only willing to write off so much value because there is this damn house that they can walk into and sleep and live. With cryptos this is still very different. Many people tend to believe in it, but aren't really certain about it. If whales start manipulating crypto it can go much further down than the value of a ""provenly valuable physical"" asset. I am not saying that applies to you in specific, but it still does to the global majority of people. That's what we saw during this last crash wiping out almost 75% while I severely doubt that the value of a house could drop from $300,000 to $75,000 within just a few weeks.

Last weekend, our entire team gathered at our Vasilyevsky Island office.  Discussion topic: “How to ensure our ICO is successful and interesting for investors.”  1. First the product, then ICO!  We have decided that since our product is currently in testing, then we can surely introduce it to the public at the end of January:  · accept a deposit  · issue our first loan  · issue our first purpose loan  2. New platform service:  Only our Bonum platform has the world’s first purpose loan for Bitcoin, in addition to the non-purpose loans. This means that it becomes possible to attract more funds to cryptoeconomy, as well as to provide the borrower with crypto assets by installment.  3. Tokenomics:  Until today, our token has been marketed as a discount on loans or deposits. Now, the token holder is granted an opportunity to obtain additional income, which makes keeping it over the long term worthwhile.  As you know, with the Bonum platform, a loan with a reduced interest rate can be obtained, but in order to do so, you need to use one token per each dollar requested by the borrower.  Now token holders can lease their tokens and receive revenue directly (% of borrower’s savings, and not from the platform, otherwise it would be considered security).  Thus, we want to reduce the speculative sales of the token after the ICO is over. Holding tokens is beneficial both for investors, and those who wish to use our services.  The fewer tokens on the market, the greater the exchange value of the token. And the demand is supported by the number of loans issued via our platform.  Based on the information above, we’d like to announce the new roadmap  Q4 2017 — Start of the private presale, platform testing  Q1 2018 — Launch of the beta version of the platform, the first loan issued, ICO  Q2 2018 — Blockchain, smart contract testing  Q3 2018 —Security and performance testing, involving third-party auditors  Q4 2018 — Partner integration through an open API  2019 — Diversification and expansion of platform functionality, development of our own marketplace, active geographic expansion.

So, just simple example:  You have 10 000 BFT(or btc,eth, etc...) token like investment, and your fiat just hold in this token.  We offer you lending your 10 000 BFT(or btc,eth, etc...) wich cost 10k$. Token froze in cold wallet by our patform and we don`t touch him. Contract between you and platform remains in smart-contract.  And in 1 hour we send you (or u can receive fiat from our partners) 60% = 6k$ for 1 month for example. In the end of month you send us  back 6k$ + 1.8%(or less, if u lend btc + token BFT for discount), and your BFT (or btc,eth, etc...) is free.  If lending token or btc and price on market go up - you win If lending token or btc and price on market go down to hard(lost 38.2%), you dont need pay back.   What do you think about that? We need your opinion! -------  Dont miss your chance, from today until 25 nov, if you join our white-list, you can have + 35% bonus! Only 750 000 tokens will be distributed on Pre-ico.",False
