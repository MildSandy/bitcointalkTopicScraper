The explanation for the many comment by new members could be caused by a giveaway special via twitter. We didn't wanted the thread get filled by single posts, but actually we raised attention by many people who haven't been in touch with the bitcoin forum before. Let's not judge them for being interested and excited for this project, since we all share the same goal of combining sports and crypto for a more healthy and motivated society.  In addition to this, as my colleague beat-daniel just mentioned before, we developed multiple companies in the past to set up the ecosystem and are now launching BEAT as the last part to connect all parts of the ecosystem. If we wanted to do a scam project, we could have done this with a lot less investment (There are already 20 mid private equity invest in the companies). Of course, you should always be careful,  beware of scammers and ask if somethings unclear. But I think based on what we already said before, we're a serious business.  Anyway, we're always happy about serious questions about our project and want to use this plattform as well to answer. So, if you have any questions left, feel free to let us know.  ",False

Imagine an incorruptible safeguard for your health and fitness data that seamlessly connects you with all the institutions, companies and people that can help leverage it. BEAT is exactly this: a state-of-the-art blockchain platform that safekeeps your data and allows you to share it with sports sponsors, talent scouts, doctors, insurance companies and many more to unlock the vast potential hidden in your health and fitness data - one heartbeat at a time.   Who we are We are a network of companies, with one common goal: to embrace all sports participants and providers, and encourage people from all over the world to do more sports. We all know that increasing the amount of physical activity is good for us. Not only do sports and physical activities stimulate and sustain our health, sports also enhance our performance skills and increase our well-being. However, too few of us practice sports and exercise regularly and consistently.   BEAT Use Cases SPORTS SPONSORING - GYM By giving your employer and/or your insurance company access to your gym check-ins or in addition part of your activity and health data you get a discount from your gym recurring subscription fee. Sportspersons need to pay a fixed subscription fee for visiting gyms regularly. Gyms store the check-in data of sportspersons visiting. Gyms store activity and health data of digitally equipped devices of their visitors. Employers and Insurance Companies want to incentivize doing sports and stay healthy. Employers and Insurance Companies pay part of the subscription fee for regularly visiting the gym based on simple check-ins as approval for doing sports. Additional payments could be agreed on with access to further activity and health data.  SPORTS SPONSORING - EVERYONE All people doing sports with any kind of digitally equipped device capable of tracking sports activity will get rewarded with BEAT token in exchange for sharing anonymous activity and health data. MySports will be the first sponsor to demonstrate the endless possibilities available using the BEAT Blockchain with this sponsorship. Everyone is doing sports with any kind of digitally equipped device capable of tracking sports activity. The first real-world use case of BEAT will be sponsoring sportspersons. After the BEAT Blockchain has been established and is running MySports will offer a first BEAT Contract to every sportsperson in the BEAT Ecosystem to reward them for doing sports. Just for sharing anonymous activity and health data the sports person will receive BEAT token in exchange.  MEDICAL RESEARCH The BEAT Blockchain will help to improve clinical research quality. Blockchain technology could let people offer health records for research, without losing control over them. The BEAT Blockchain will solve some of health care’s major challenges, including: identity, privacy, data liquidity, care coordination and more. Doctors need to solve a major problem and share the problem with relevant data on the BEAT Blockchain. Other doctors see the shared data and the need for a solution on the BEAT Blockchain and decide to initiate a medical research study and document the necessary framework on the BEAT Blockchain. Together clinics and doctors gather input from worldwide participants and document it on the BEAT Blockchain. After enough input has been gathered part of the medical participants join together to finalize the initiated study and share the result on the BEAT Blockchain.  MEDICAL CARE The BEAT Blockchain provides a decentralized framework to share patient activity and health information across a range of applications and stakeholders. Benefits will be improved data integrity, decentralization, confidentiality and reduced transaction costs. Patients visit clinics and bring access to their own medical history data, stored on the BEAT Blockchain, with them. Clinics help the patient and store the results of the efforts on the BEAT Blockchain. Physiotherapists talk and work with the patient to reduce pain and restore health. They access the original patient data as well as the results from the clinic using the BEAT Blockchain and document their own progress on the BEAT Blockchain as well. Afterwards patients visit gyms to speed up their recovery, where the amount of visits and tracked activity and health data is stored on the Beat Blockchain.

We ""transformed"" our old client based software into the cloud, helped our customers to go ""digital"" as well, invented the ecosystem around it, launched several proofs of concept for services (marketing, financial, etc.) and commerce (for a start B2B with B2C following soon) and are ready to expand further than Germany, Austria and Switzerland with already some few customers around the borders.  While thinking about the future of our ecosystem some 2-3 years ago we were searching for something that could be ""the glue in the middle"". At first we thought that this could be our end-customer App NoExcuse, with our B2B-Software Magicline on one part of the ecosystem and the world population on the other side, added in with various forms of services and e-Commerce up and below the picture.  During further development of our business with our different companies, that are now part of SportAlliance, we finally thought as well about using blockchain technology for worldwide secure access and exchange of data and as a store of value. We were looking for something expandable for all further ideas we have in mind. I joined Magicline some 1,5 years ago and i am myself a Bitcoingeek since early 2011, mined some Bitcoins myself long ago and assume that i was one of the catalysators towards Blockchain technology in our companies.  The blockchain is the best technology for our ecosystem as we really need to have something as worldwide store of value AND to do transactions as well, not just for one company but for all partners that are interested in joining us using BEAT. In example we think it is a good idea if you are doing sports somewhere and have your own personal workout program that really fits best to you and you move away from your home town or just start to do workout somewhere else, that you have the opportunity to take your personal workout program with you. That's something that on first site has nothing to do with BEAT, but shows our need for something like Blockchain for the future of our whole business. If you think something like that further, you easily could see, that it is even possible to trade/sell workout programs for BEAT, even your own workout program could be sold inside our ecosystem for BEAT, that have been ""earned"" by other persons through sportive activities.  Quiet long answer for a short question, but maybe it helps you, why we decided to use the blockchain as our technology of choice for ""the glue in the middle"" of our ecosystem.  Cheers   Jens",False
