Chuck Courtney is a common liar.  He claims on the forge network's site that he ""Managed a fortune 500 for 6 years, and looking to create a truly accessibly and anonymous blockchain"" (mind you, he can't even get the grammar correctly).  In fact for the last six years he has been employed by Best Buy in Seattle area, where he manages a so called ""geek squad"", basically a bunch of uneducated bozos (like himself) that are good-for-nothing mock-ups of technology consultants in Best Buy's customer support.  He didn't manage any ""fortune 500"" at all as he claims.  As for the wallet application, they are using a very old version of bitcoin wallet source code.  And get that -- Chuck went on Fiverr to find someone to build the wallet application for MacOS for him.  His developers are unable to build the wallet application in-house, so that he goes to Fiverr to find someone to do it for him for $20.  The wallet for MacOS is still unavailable on theforgenet.com because Chuck is so dumb that he cannot explain on Fiverr that he needs an executable application built. The code for the wallet is here https://github.com/BeardFlux/wallet (at least until Chuck sees this post and removes the repository). You can judge by yourself whether they will be able to fulfill everything they promise on the roadmap, but the start is ""awesome"" already. I wouldn't bet a quarter on this ICO.",False

I have additional questions if you don't mind explaining.  1. DEX, I have not seen any DEX Q&A on this thread.  Puzzled though.  The DEX is what you claim, so I think you would be the best qualified person to explain what the feature is and how it would work.  After the explanation, people would be better informed to ask for further clarification or ask for different features.  2. PoS. I think 2-4 seem to be tied to PoS. So if I could write down my understanding of your plan:    Assumption: PoW phase has completed.  a. Acquire some FRG coins.  b. let some time elapse (4 hours minimum)  c. stakers can now start processing the transactions. (If this involves processing blocks, isn't this the same as mining?)  d. stakers can earn (accrue) 5%. (of the holding coin? of the transactions processed?  From your description, it maybe that miners (or stakers processing the transactions) are supposed to get the fee, but the network itself is getting the fee?     This is why asked how the 5% accrual is funded.  Are the stakers earning some kind of interest? or are they earning processing fee? (i.e. miners fee).     Eitherway, how can you guarantee the 5%?  e. the more stakers there are, the lower the transaction fee.     If there are more stakers, the 5% accrual fee decreases?  Will that 5% accrual remain constant?  Will the network be able to survive with consistently lowering fee?",False

So that our community can give us feedback on what they would like for us to implement (feature-wise) along with the standard layout of our DEX.  2) There will be no minimum amount for staking. Just a minimum of 4 hours before coins have matured enough to stake then from those coins that are staked 5% will be awarded once you are picked to process a transaction.  3) After PoW has completed then it will be up to the stakers to process transactions. So in order to receive the hashing power needed to process transactions there will need to be stakers and for those who are staking to receive 5% accrual there need to be transactions. It's a much more energy efficient way to process transactions.  4) The more that are involved the lower the fees will be. The network itself receives the fees and then they are kicked back into overall circulation. The fees are at the protocol level to defend against block bloating attacks.",False

I do understand where you are coming from when it comes to the valuation of ForgeNet but we did a good bit of ICO market research (other ICOs with close market caps and use cases versus value per token) prior to coming up with our initial value and we also believe that $1.00 overall is a pretty fair starting point given that there are many out currently that greatly exceed our market cap that are valued at much higher per token. Also, we are not just another anon coin. We believe that privacy and anonymity are basic features that everyone should receive.  As to your concern of development; we have these initial outlines and goals of what it is we would like to do and involve ourselves in (which are set to be totally completed within roughly a 12 month timeframe), but past that is where our community will come in and actually vote on our continued direction. We do not believe that the devs should be in total control of the direction a crypto goes. The community first and foremost should have the say.  I thank you for reaching out to us with your concerns and if you would like to discuss it further then feel free to keep it going here or you can join us over on telegram and you can talk to me or any of us devs. We enjoy the talk so there's never going to be an issue whether you agree or disagree!",False

Coins such as Phore, Shield, Colx, etc...  Just curious since the theme as I've come to notice it is new coins tend to release when their developers notice market movement for particular features. POS coins drove tons of POS copies. Same when MNs were first a big deal. Anno coins are doing great at the moment and so now here is another one...  Not trying to be difficult I am just genuinely curious to understand what in your mind will set you apart?  *To be clear all the things you listed that make your coin unique are already either implemented on existing coins or listed on their own roadmaps  Limiting to scrypt already seems like a hindrance. ICOs haven't been as popular in this area (anno coins). No premine/ICO is usually a more popular option due to the typical trend of immediate dump post ICO once any ICO coin first hits an exchange.

We don't want to just be thought of as another anonymous coin. That actually is not the direction we are trying to take at all. We want to be an inclusive network that offers anonymity. Anonymity is just a perk, not a selling point. Anonymous coins are a niche market and we refuse to cater to any specific niche. Our goal is to entice the entire cryptocurrency market with the benefits that all of the ""niche"" coins offer.  We don't want anybody to focus on the PoW portion. Like previously stated, it is nothing more than to jump start the network and we don't wish to treat it as anything greater.  Now to be completely honest with you on the latter part of your question. We are not focused on the value we can be sold for on exchange. We are focused on our adoption and application aspects. We do not want to be another ""Pump'n'Dump"" coin.

ForgeNet aims to bring users a complete cryptocurrency ecosystem. By that, we mean, the aim is to bring users a cryptocurrency that does not cater to any one niche group. We “cater” to the whole populace. We wish to be truly community driven. Past our initial roadmap we look to our community for the direction in which we should go. Usability, scalability, mobility, ease of use, quick transactions, low fees, and mobile staking are the first things we wish to bring to our community.  Scalability -    ForgetNet will initially offer a 2MB block size to deal with immediate scalability concerns. A 2MB block size helps with upfront adoption by the masses. Past that, scalability issues will be dealt with otherwise.    Our next answer to the scalability concern is with sidechains. Our sidechains will run parallel to our main blockchain and will only be in use when network traffic is high. Therefore, when congestion is high enough to trigger our sidechain protocol then a sidechain will be made during that time of congestion to mirror the main blockchain and to help deal with traffic with double the efficiency as the single main blockchain. Once the traffic has subsided then the sidechain protocol will end and no longer be in use.  Anonymity -    ForgeNet will be offering the Zerocoin Protocol for anonymity. The Zerocoin protocol, when a transaction is made, will send FRG into a pool and takes the form of a zerocoin. It anonymizes exchanges to and from the pool cryptographically and will be nothing more than an extension to the original ForgeNet Protocol and will have recorded the transactions within the ForgeNet blockchain.  A decentralized marketplace -    A community driven marketplace where anybody can come and either sell their items or purchase items from vendors. Where anonymity and safety of transaction are both equally important. All transactions will be done with FRG.    We want to offer vendors the opportunity to present their wares and to be able to take home a majority of the profit instead of having to pay horrendous vendor fees. A small, flat fee will be all that will be required. Vendors will be held accountable for their actions, both negative and positive. If too much negativity is placed on a specific vendor then they will be removed indefinitely. Removal request will be voted on by the community. The ForgeNet Team will only complete the action in accordance with the votes.    Buyers will be offered a wide, decentralized array of wares. We wish only to give the buyers a clean and responsive interface in which they can use to purchase whatever it is that they may need. Past the platform it is up to the community in how the marketplace will run. We will take certain measures to maintain a certain level of user security, but past that it will be between vendor and buyer.  A decentralized Exchange -    The ForgeNet decentralized exchange will be our direct answer to the issues that centralized exchanges present. Also, we aim to bring a streamlined user interface to our community. The need for a decentralized exchange comes from the very root concepts of cryptocurrencies. Peer to peer interaction. With a centralized exchange you now have a third party involved. With our decentralized exchange you will get a straightforward peer to peer interaction. The ForgeNet DEX will not require user information to begin trading, will not run on a single server but on multiple nodes across the globe, will not hold a user’s assets or funds, and will only insure the integrity of a transaction. The ForgeNet DEX will be nothing more than a place for consenting parties to come to for insurance that their transactions are fair, anonymous, and secure.  An all inclusive mobile app -    An app that makes mobile users just as prepared and just as efficient as PC users. The app will include: Personal Portfolio - To keep track of your FRG plus any and all other cryptocurrencies you may hold Mobile Wallet - To keep your FRG on the go Up-To-Date ForgeNet News - Keep up to date on everything ForgeNet; including, blockchain updates, upcoming polls, community events, and new partnerships Live Market Tracking - The ability to trade FRG from anywhere on the go with your cell phone  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Airdrops  Please refer to attached link for all airdrop information!  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2807885.msg28719111#msg28719111  Telegram Airdrop Alert Channel  https://t.me/ForgeNetAlerts   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Bounties (More to be added soon!)
