Signals aims to be a platform to connect data scientist and cryptotraders in order to design new strategies using tools such as crowd wisdom, machine learning, blockchain monitoring and more.  We are not just offering a Bot which will send you signals but a playground where you can develop and monetize skills, whether you are a data scientist or a regular cryptotrader without any coding knowledge, and we believe this will bring huge value to the community.  Signals‚Äô unique concept of three marketplaces - Data Marketplace, Indicators Marketplace and Strategies Marketplace - enables data scientists and developers community to build their own indicators in a Python-like language, upon datasets ranging from order books to data for sentiment analysis, and to exploit computational power and machine learning tools of Signals platform. All this to create building blocks that can be used as graphical components by cryptotraders in the Signals Visual Editor when composing their own automated strategies. Developers are provided with the necessary computational infrastructure and development toolset, and traders are shielded from implementation part and can focus fully on the logic of the strategies.  We are building this complex platform and it has to be said we are not building everything from scratch, but we already secured various partnerships with other successful blockchain solutions, providers of necessary infrastructure, data providers and machine learning development teams. To find out more, you can read about our partnerships with blockchain cloud computer iExec (https://goo.gl/x2XjuQ) and blockchain prediction market STOX (https://goo.gl/EsZUBB). What‚Äôs more, to store and preprocess big data in reasonable time, we closed a partnership with Foxconn‚Äôs data center SafeDX (https://goo.gl/6gznCX), which provides us with the infrastructure necessary for building the best trading platform on the market.",False

All this to create building blocks that can be used as graphical components by cryptotraders in the Signals Visual Editor when composing their own automated strategies. Developers are provided with the necessary computational infrastructure and development toolset, and traders are shielded from implementation part and can focus fully on the logic of the strategies.  We are building this complex platform and it has to be said we are not building everything from scratch, but we already secured various partnerships with other successful blockchain solutions, providers of necessary infrastructure, data providers and machine learning development teams. To find out more, you can read about our partnerships with blockchain cloud computer iExec (https://goo.gl/x2XjuQ) and blockchain prediction market STOX (https://goo.gl/EsZUBB).

For example, imagine the company is selling 50% of a total amount of 100 million tokens (hypothetically). Now imagine that due to tricky conditions of the market they are able to sell only 10% of those tokens for sale. This means that effectively they sell only 5% of tokens (10% of that 50% for sale). The rest is burned, so now we are in the situation that the company holds 50 million of tokens when the token sale participants hold only 5 million. This situation could create problems of trust within the community regarding the price of the token, which could be manipulated by the company. And of course, this wouldn‚Äôt happen if the company redistributed the unsold tokens among the token sale participants.",False

Other than what is currently there, I mean real trading. Thanks.  Pavel Nƒõmec: Hello, thank you for the question. From technical point of view adding live trading is quite easy step. We are already connected to the exchanges (downloading the trading data) and we are sending Telegram notifications to demonstrate strategies assembled by Signals team. Instead of sending the notifications, we need to send signals to your account on the cryptoexchange.  What is more complicated is legal framework for that and security audit of all systems which must be done before launch of this feature. At this point our development team focusing on creating Signals Language - which is programming tool where developers and programmers will be able to create their own trading strategies and offer them to other in Strategies Marketplace which you know from Signals Alpha. After we finish and publish this feature we want to do the security audit and after that the live trading feature will be launched.

We are not just offering a Bot which will send you signals but a playground where you can develop and monetize skills, whether you are a data scientist or a regular cryptotrader without any coding knowledge, and we believe this will bring huge value to the community.  Signals‚Äô unique concept of three marketplaces - Data Marketplace, Indicators Marketplace and Strategies Marketplace - enables data scientists and developers community to build their own indicators in a Python-like language, upon datasets ranging from order books to data for sentiment analysis, and to exploit computational power and machine learning tools of Signals platform. All this to create building blocks that can be used as graphical components by cryptotraders in the Signals Visual Editor when composing their own automated strategies. Developers are provided with the necessary computational infrastructure and development toolset, and traders are shielded from implementation part and can focus fully on the logic of the strategies.

Here are the reasons:  Our platform will allow anyone to create their own automated crypto trading strategy with the use of data science and machine learning - even without any coding skills. Signals mission is to connect data scientists with crypto community traders. You can select various indicators ranging from technical or sentiment analysis, media monitoring, crowd wisdom, machine learning, blockchain and much more.  There are no such things at Covesting or CoinDash for example. Those two projects have one overlap with Signals and that is the copytrading feature. At our Strategy Marketplace (public alpha has been released earlier in January for testing: http://app.signals.network) you can buy (or sell) successful automated strategies made by others on the platform or even 3rd party strategies/bots from other developer teams. On Covesting you copytrade other people‚Äôs trades, which means no automatization is involved.  Signals platform will be overall more complex and offer more possibilities for traders. I recommend you to read this great article made by our CEO where he explains all the features in details: https://blog.signals.network/signals-network-vs-competitors-4a4316163f28",False

We are not just offering a Bot which will send you signals but a playground where you can develop and monetize skills, whether you are a data scientist or a regular cryptotrader without any coding knowledge, and we believe this will bring huge value to the community.  Signals‚Äô unique concept of three marketplaces - Data Marketplace, Indicators Marketplace and Strategies Marketplace - enables data scientists and developers community to build their own indicators in a Python-like language, upon datasets ranging from order books to data for sentiment analysis, and to exploit computational power and machine learning tools of Signals platform. All this to create building blocks that can be used as graphical components by cryptotraders in the Signals Visual Editor when composing their own automated strategies. Developers are provided with the necessary computational infrastructure and development toolset, and traders are shielded from implementation part and can focus fully on the logic of the strategies.  We are building this complex platform and it has to be said we are not building everything from scratch, but we already secured various partnerships with other successful blockchain solutions, providers of necessary infrastructure, data providers and machine learning development teams. To find out more, you can read about our partnerships with blockchain cloud computer iExec (https://goo.gl/x2XjuQ) and blockchain prediction market STOX (https://goo.gl/EsZUBB). What‚Äôs more, to store and preprocess big data in reasonable time, we closed a partnership with Foxconn‚Äôs data center SafeDX (https://goo.gl/6gznCX), which provides us with the infrastructure necessary for building the best trading platform on the market.",False

In little over than two weeks we raised 1364.8 ETH. http://signals.network/token  Mainsale date: TBA (expected to happen in January).     https://i.imgur.com/lfQMgzT.png     What is the Signal Platform?  Signals network connects cryptotraders with data science developers. Signals will offer a simple UI for assembling indicators and creating signals to optimise profit on various cryptocurrency exchanges. It‚Äôs a place where you can build strategies from specific trading indicators, ranging from technical analysis to crowd wisdom insights, train it on historical data, and monetise your strategy by offering copytrading.   https://i.imgur.com/yTE6p06.png  SIGNALS TEAM   https://i.imgur.com/5TZyUMT.png     SGN TOKEN  Signal token is a currency powered by the Ethereum blockchain. All paid features available on the Signals Platform will be accessible exclusively through Signal tokens.  The business model of Signals Platform is based on two main revenue streams.  Firstly, Signals Platform charges a fee on each purchase in the Signals marketplaces. This includes:  Purchases of user-created indicators in the Indicator marketplace Purchases of data streams in the Data marketplace Renting of user-made strategies for copy trading in the Strategy marketplace.  The second revenue stream comes from the Signals cloud solution for deploying strategies. A subscription model will be implemented, with several tiers to choose from based on the amount of strategies used.  Signal tokens are also used as a reward for early contributors, best strategies and the most useful indicators. We know that support of the community is crucial for Signals Platform success that‚Äôs why we allocated 20% of all Signal tokens to early contributors in Signal Platform marketplaces.  Presale will happen on the 22nd of November 14:00 UTC, more information about the Token Sale can be found in whitepaper.   https://i.imgur.com/HSVMk0x.png     HOW SIGNALS WORK   https://i.imgur.com/V4dM148.png     ROADMAP  The Signals roadmap for years 2017 - 2019 is divided into six milestones. Each milestone consists of a certain number of features that will be implemented. Find more details in Signals WHITEPAPER.   https://i.imgur.com/Scs5Lgo.png    BOUNTY CAMPAIGN  Anyone who would like to support Signals prior to the token sale can earn and receive SGN tokens by completing bounty tasks. You can start collecting SGN tokens in our Bounty app now and we'll send them to your address once we close the token sale.

They offer it for tokens and we think that they are also valid projects and could be useful for traders. But there is a huge different between them and what Signals platfrom is all about.  We are building connection between data science community and crypto traders, through easy to use tool for assembling your own trading strategy, which you can then offer to others in the same way how those companies which you are talking about.  Although in non-blockchain world, there is Quantopian, a company which has very similar concept in a sense that it is possible to create a strategy and offer it to others, but it is platform only for Python developers and not for people without programming skills. As opposed to them we also provide integrated machine learning features like evolution algorithms for strategy optimization, deep learning for signals extraction or connection to data from predition markets which you can integrate into your strategy. You can find out more about Signals platform at our Whitepaper.   ",False

Yes, I think you have 23 tweets on the timeline. If it is allowed us to retweet them all, at possible price 1 SGN = 1 retweet = $0.25 to $0.36, well, then it looks not sustainable, but as they are token it looks possible. I think that you try to limit daily retweets as they did on bountyportals with 3 retweets a day maximum = 21 rtw a week. My thoughts go to the solution that we run all retweets daily as we want and we can, then after ico is finished we make clear count. You can not keep such promise of quarter of dollar per retweet, it has to be stake offered instead of token, then you will see at the end of the sales how many tokens to allocate to which bounty, and then convert stakes to tokens and distribute them to addresses where are the tokens customized. They say: ""We credit stakes and distribute the tokens!"". Possibly we can adjust and use tokens from other half if needed. Just now i have 20 tokens on my third account with over 1000 followers. It is more than $5 or 0.001 btc per day (retweeted almost all your 23 tweets), too good to be true! I think, your signals are too strong! We are simply not used on it!

What's next?  Big news: Signals at Intel Partner Connect Europe Conference in May, 2018.     What is the Signal Platform?  Signals network connects cryptotraders with data science developers. Signals will offer a simple UI for assembling indicators and creating signals to optimise profit on various cryptocurrency exchanges. It‚Äôs a place where you can build strategies from specific trading indicators, ranging from technical analysis to crowd wisdom insights, train it on historical data, and monetise your strategy by offering copytrading.     SIGNALS TEAM     PARTNERS      SGN TOKEN  Signal token is a currency powered by the Ethereum blockchain. All paid features available on the Signals Platform will be accessible exclusively through Signal tokens.  The business model of Signals Platform is based on two main revenue streams.  Firstly, Signals Platform charges a fee on each purchase in the Signals marketplaces. This includes:  Purchases of user-created indicators in the Indicator marketplace Purchases of data streams in the Data marketplace Renting of user-made strategies for copy trading in the Strategy marketplace.  The second revenue stream comes from the Signals cloud solution for deploying strategies. A subscription model will be implemented, with several tiers to choose from based on the amount of strategies used.  Signal tokens are also used as a reward for early contributors, best strategies and the most useful indicators. We know that support of the community is crucial for Signals Platform success that‚Äôs why we allocated 20% of all Signal tokens to early contributors in Signal Platform marketplaces. more information about the Token Sale can be found in whitepaper.        HOW SIGNALS WORK  IN THE PRESS  Yahoo Finance: Potential project to impact crypto investing in major ways Zero Hedge: Trading Strategies of the Future Cryptocurrency Investor Finance Magnates: 3 Tools All Serious Cryptocurrency Traders Must Include in Their Toolbox     ALPHA OF THE STRATEGY MARKETPLACE  In early January we published alpha of the Strategy Marketplace, which is one of the three main pillars of the Signals platform. The alpha version includes a notification bot by Cryptofox.io and will serve as a base for future inclusion of default Signals strategies, 3rd party strategies, and user-created strategies. Try the ALPHA and let us know what do you think.      ROADMAP  The Signals roadmap for years 2017 - 2019 is divided into six milestones. Each milestone consists of a certain number of features that will be implemented. Find more details in Signals WHITEPAPER.       BOUNTY CAMPAIGN  Anyone who would like to support Signals prior to the token sale can earn and receive SGN tokens by completing bounty tasks. You can start collecting SGN tokens in our Bounty app now and we'll send them to your address once we close the token sale.

There are some projects which enable users to program their own strategy, in Signals we provide set of visual tools which we call Signals strategy builder, so that even anyone without any programming skills can build their own strategy. On top of that, as we are aware of progress in blockchain industry, that is why Signals platform is beside providing classical technical indicators it is connecting to prediction markets enabling users creating unique types of strategies or connecting to decentralised supercomputers to enable complex ML based process of training strategies based on historical data.
