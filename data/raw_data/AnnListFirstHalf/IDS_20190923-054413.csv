But instead sell it with private sales.  As people mentioned earlier in this thread, how is the team planning on adding value to the token? There is not a clear plan in the whitepaper as far as I can see. This is important information for potential investors and it should be much clearer.  I agree with most of you that the idea and project seems interesting and that a lot of people could benefit from such a technology. It has great potential and will eradicate identity theft.  I do have a few concerns, especially the whole distribution paragraph. I remember that the private sale was not completed and that was the reason why the ICO was first postponed. Yet in the whitepaper it is not updated and a few sentences are confusing. Another concern for me is why the CEO, CTO and COO are earning so much money. If I were to start this company as the CEO I would only focus on paying my programmers/developers and perhaps maybe live off 30% of what the CEO is earning monthly. If they paid themselves a lot less money it would create the idea that they are working their asses off and spending the money more wisely.

This brings a completely new world of opportunities to the world of identification. Imagine that a dealer on eBay has to identify themselves to you before you transfer your money. You will be 99.9% sure that the person will not scam you, and if they do and get a bad rating, no one will ever deal with them on that ID again. The same with emails, if you have to identify yourself to send an email, would you ever send scam mails? USE CASE 2 Another example is solving the identity problem for car rentals on the blockchain. We know that a rental service needs to identify their customers to make sure they get their car back. That is why a customer must pick up the car during opening hours at the car rental service. With Biometrids, you can pick up the car anytime. Scan your face, let the company have the papers they need, and off you go. Combined with slock.it locking solutions based on IoT (Internet of Things) this could be a fundamental change in rental services 19 . USE CASE 3 When a carrier delivers a package to a person, that person needs to show their ID when accepting the delivery. Using Biometrids, you just need the same ID that bought the packages in order to pick up the packages, and then you are always sure that the person is in the ecosystem of Biometrids’ platform. USE CASE 4 We see more and more ICO platforms come to life. In order to secure people from scam ICOs, these platforms could adopt Biometrids and have founders, developers, and every other team member and advisor identify themselves through the platform. That would increase the security to these platforms, when they are ready to run ICOs. The need and incentive behind these use cases can be found in a 2017 report from ID2020 stating that the financial exclusion resulting from the lack of proper identity has created a shadow economy estimated to be approximately $10 trillion a year, worldwide. This makes it the world’s second-largest economy 20 .",False

This means that we need to work on our advertising / promotion. We are working on different things to find a solution for the next step. Due to this we might move our ICO into the new year. But we will update you all as soon as we have a straightforward plan.  We will not give up on the project. We know that our product could both help people and change the way we look at identity.

In my personal opinion, I think that one problem people/investors might've found is the project's roadmap. Investors want to feel safe in this volatile market, and considering how fast the cryptomarkets move, they want the development to go faster too, they are tired of promises because crypto has become like politics: lots of promises, few actual functional products. This industry is too competitive. Other projects might come up with the same idea and they could implement it faster, so the cost of opportunity of waiting lets say, 3 years, might be too high for some investors. That issue, coupled with the lack of proper exposure, is what might be troubling the fundraising for this project. So I do believe that a more aggresive development plan is needed for investors to deposit their trust (and money) into the project. I do understand that development comes in hand with macro factors that the team can't accelerate, but there has to be something to encourage participation.",False

Problem is that many crypto projects are way to ambitious, and cant deliver what they promiss. We put everything on the table from the start, and tell investors that it will take some time to develop into a full product. These things aren't build over night. But over openness seems to be the wrong approach maybe  We could make a more aggressive development plan, and afterward keep coming up with excuses for not reaching our goals in time.

It's about verifying identity so you can have trusted relationships with people. That's at least one of its many use cases.  In a small perspective, let's put this forum as an example. Think about all the scams we would be able to avoid if developers would need to verify their identities before being able to announce their projects here. It would be in their best interest to not scam people with the project because the moment they try to do it, investors can give those people bad reputation, kinda like the reputation you can get here in the forum. The flaw with the forum's reputation is that it's linked with your username/email so it only takes you to get another account to keep scamming people. The main difference with biometrids reputation is that it damages or benefits your unique identity worldwide. There's lot of scammy developers that release multiple coins, all of them pump and dump schemes, one after the other one, and people fall into this scams every time. This type of identification can filter out all these scam projects preventing the same people from doing repeated scams over and over again.

Things will take time. We believe in this technology, and it will for sure play a big part of the future. Both of blockchain and other aspects in life. We are not afraid of speaking about the pro and the cons. Because they are there. If we promissed people that the technology was 100% today, then we would be lying, and that is not any of our intensions with this. We are here to do a difference for the blockchain technology, not just to be pointed out as scammers or liars.  Regarding the hack. There are these things you should pass by to hack into the persons account on Biometrids platform. As the system is today.  1: You should know the person has an account. 2: You should have a 3D picture of the person. 3: You should have a 3D printer. 4: You should have the persons password.  It is much easier to unlock the phone, as long as it is your own face that you use to manipulate. Then you have everything you need with in reach. When it comes to getting another persons face in a 3D pucture it get much more complicated. Combine this with a password on top and its just like 2 factor authentication we know from websites today.

This could be government, facebook or some other 3rd party service. But that doesn't make the ID decentralised, because you need this ""middleman"".  By using your face, you can make the ID unique,(due to the uniqueness of your face.). This way you can make sure that people can't scam. We wlll also integrate a voting system to the platform. So if someone DO scam. Then every one can see, that this ID has been scamming. And since they cant make a new ID on the platform, unless they get a new face. Who wants to do scam? They will be excluded from the platform, because people know they might do another scam.  We will provide this to other services through our API, and in the later stages, we will implement nodes for fast identification. This means, that if you use a coin, with many confirmations. Stores dont have to worry about confirmations, if the person pay through the Biometrids ID. Then they can make sure, that the person is identified as a no scammer. The person can make payments in seconds, and with out waiting for confirmations, as long as it is through the Biometrids platform",False

So the hardware will set the limits. At the moment one of the main issues is, that you can take a picture of a person, and then login to the account (with some phones). We will avoid this, buy having 3d pictures. So people need to move around. Machinelearning, will help recognise the face when there is changes (wearing makeup, or you have a hat on etc.) And so on. It will use small references and skin to identify you. Be aware, that our first version, will NOT support all of these things from the start. But this is where we will build the platform.  When the developers of phones have a 100% secure way of using facial recognition, our goal is to keep the private key in the chain, with the face. And then you only need to use your face to login. No password to remember. (this is one the future things)  And yes, the face will be encrypted in the chain for ever. You cant delete the face again. Also you need a device, which supports facial recognition to use the platform. So its also a question of when the facial recognition is fully adopted.",False
