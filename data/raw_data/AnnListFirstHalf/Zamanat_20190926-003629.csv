Unlike other ride-hailing services, Uber and Lyft Zamanat uses end-to-end encryption to keep the communication between the users and drivers private. End-to-end encryption makes it almost impossible for a third party or even the Zamanat’s service provider to gain access to the users’ travel data. With Zamanat the users have the full authority to choose who can track their location. The users can allow friends and family to track them regardless of hailing a ride to have a companion on their side.  Zamanat uses a blockchain based user authentication. The cryptography based security system on the distributed network of blockchain makes the users’ credentials secure and tamper-proof.  With Zamanat we are also introducing Zamanat Token (ZMT). ZMT is an Ethereum based cryptocurrency token that can be used as a payment method on Zamanat. Zamanat will also support credit/debit cards, PayPal, and Stripe as payment methods.
