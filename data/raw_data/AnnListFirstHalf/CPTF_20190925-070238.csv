SEC looks at any tokens as securities. Even the majority of utility tokens fall under this category. Any ICO that plans to generate income to the investors will be a security ICO in SEC eyes. You need to check with local laws and regulations if you can take part in the ICO or not. However, like we've been asked before where we were going be registered and we've continually answered that it will happen more to the end of the ICO because international laws are changing every week. In fact, France has just allowed trading unlisted securities on blockchain platforms - https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/france-allows-trading-unlisted-securities-blockchain-platforms/  Who knows what's going to happen next week.

For example, just today bitcoin went up to 11700 usd and dropped to as low as 8500 usd. It doesn't look like everybody turned a profit on this drop and quite a few traders might have suffered. That is why it is wise to diversify and allocate not all but some of your crypto holdings in financial tools that are easier to forecast. And you will always be able to sell our coins and buy bitcoins at lower price moment.  Quote Also why would you pin your coin to markets that are already overheated (stocks and bonds)?  If you compare the traditional stock market to cryptomarket than on a contrary stocks look much ""colder"". We've looked through different stock and bond packages and some indexes like FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) have shown good predictable growth over a decade. And this is our proposition for crypto holders.  Quote Isthe coin backed by the short posititon on stocks and bonds? Maybe I am missing something.  Right now we don't have short positions backing in the plans. We understand what you are talking about and we might consider doing it though it deems to be risky. We will definitely listen to our token holders and try to implement their ideas about future products if they are possible and practical.",False

It is not a highly complicated tokenized assets platform. If you want to find an analog then look no further but at USDT  https://tether.to/   There is hardly anything strange about backing cryptocoin with different types of real-world assets.  If you want to invest in the shares of the companies which we offer you will only need to buy our supported coins. Our coins are not going to be any different from any other cryptocoins such as Ethereum or Bitcoin, therefore, you legalize the income from these operations like you normally would do with any other cryptocoin operation.  If you are talking about investment in CRTF tokens then you invest to get income from the commission we would earn from supporting the coins. All corresponding profit will be distributed to your Ethereum crypto wallet. You should legalize it as any other profit you earn with Ethereum investment.  You are free and welcome to invest any amount that is comfortable for you even as low as 0.001 ETH.  Thank you for your interest!",False

You can find an almost identical structure in Tether USDT project registered in Hong Kong.  2. CryptF is not a cryptofund. All assets bought are owned by our holding. These assets are in fact a guarantee of the coins and support coins liquidity. We will create a set of new cryptocoins correlated with the price of stocks. We are not creating a highly complex and legally questionable tokenized assets platform. All securities would be stored on our broker account with regular reports verified by the broker.  3. We are currently talking to a number of local NZ auditing and accounting firms. If we manage to show large growth and traction then reaching biggest accounting names would be one of our priorities.

I have financial background - thus your tread attracted my attention. And yes it was my first post here - you have to start by something    1. If assets are bought and hold by the holding company (what jurisdiction?)  how the ""guarantee"" will be structured? How the pricing correlation will be enforced? Can't find your business model on your site.  2. You still will be considered as collective investment scheme as the origin of your funding is the sale of tokens. Thus an important range of compliance/ALM and taxation questions emerges (15% NRWT). Have you checked with your bank at least how they will consider such source of funding? Wanted to know how you are ready to address those issues.  Hope you will manage to address such issues and could present clear plan for your model. Devil is always in details.  Cheers, BeReal12  ------------------- Important disclamer: I'm not associated with any past or ongoing ICO's  and expressing my sole and personal opinion. Most of the ICO will fail as they are not mature neither experienced neither professional and in most cases are pure marketing hypes. Thus an independent due diligence has to be done prior taking any supporting/investment decision. Turn on your brain and ask questions.",False

We are looking at a number of different jurisdictions. It can be mentioned above Hong Kong or Singapore, Switzerland, or possibly New Zealand. The final choice will be agreed upon with lawyers when we start registering.The international legal field is changing weekly. Like NZ has just changed it's position towards cryptocurrencies a week before. We will be following the relevant news and ask legal advice to choose the best location. Our development team is currently writing an algorithm that would adjust the price of the coins with the stock price in real-time.  2. Generally, we are in the same legal field as every other ICO. And we've written above that these are not collective investments as the token sale will not be linked with client stock exchange operations. We are not offering brokering services which on contrary is done by pretty much every tokenized asset platform. Therefore it limits legal risk to some degree. We are going through an extensive investigation of the taxation. This is done through consulting with accounting firms.  Thank you for your thorough questioning it is always great when potential investors don't take it for granted. We are open for discussion and if you think that you can offer us new ideas, please, email us at nz@cryptf.io",False

CRFT tokens that you buy during ICO give you right to participate in the company's income distribution. While income itself comes from the commission that we charge during coin operations. So our tokens and our coins are separate. In a nutshell, we earn on coins and share the profit with the token-holders.  CryptF tokens will be transferred to your ETH wallet, correct.  Meanwhile, our cryptocoins will be traded for anyone to buy on a regular crypto exchange.",False
