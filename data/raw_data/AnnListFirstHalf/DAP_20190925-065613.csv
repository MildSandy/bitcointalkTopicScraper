Throughout 2018 we have seen a couple of dApps which showed great potential and recorded an unprecedented popularity.  However, we strongly believe that 2019 can do better. We would actually go as far as to say that 2019 will be for dApps what 2018 was for ICOs.  Not many dApps know what is the recipe for success. It definitely lies in the MARKETING.   If a dApp has no idea how to conduct successful marketing campaigns on various crypto and non-crypto sources, the future is dim.  That's why we would kindly ask you to go over our article ""dApp marketing strategies for 2019"".",False

We at ICO SERVICE will be running their roadshows in ASIA in 6 locations and planning to raise just a little bit short of 1 Bln for our clients.  Well for starters, the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) market has grown very rapidly and has been a new avenue for blockchain based start-ups and projects to get the funding needed to launch their projects. As a matter of fact, data from coindesk indicate that ICOs raised more money in the first 3 months of 2018 than the whole of 2017. To put that into perspective, ICOs launched in 2018 have already blown past this figure, accumulating $6.3 billion in funding during the first quarter alone, that is, 118 percent of the total for 2017.  Over the past year, many initial coin offerings have generated so much buzz, but the degree of success have varied dramatically. Despite significant interest as investors test the waters in this new concept of funding, the landscape remains full of pitfalls. But don’t worry, because here at ICOSERVICE, we offer start-ups the needed help when it comes to marketing your ICOs and launching your projects as long as they are valid.  Normally, start-ups tend to conduct roadshows in a bid to market their ICOs. A roadshow is a good ICO marketing strategy. It’s an intense and effective way to rapidly gain exposure and link with local partners to gain credibility through network effect. So getting some solid advice from experts who have spent time in the marketing world is critical. ICO SERVICE comprises a team of experts with insights about conducting a proper ICO roadshow.  We will be running an ICO roadshow in Asia this month where we will visit 6 cities in 2 weeks. Start-ups that partner with us will have the opportunity to meet 150+ investors.
