It is a binary option that will expire at the price of 0 or 100%.

From Kay from back in December: We have an organic and inorganic (acquisitive growth) strategy planned for the next 3 years. Organic, we already reach a few thousand traders who are fed up of trading on archaic platforms both on the BO and FX side (read: spot and/or mt4/5). So they will migrate over quite readily. On top of this, we have already been approached by some so called ""super affiliates"" or IBs (introducing brokers) who control large communities of traders who wish to be early affiliates of the Spectre customer acquisition program. Thirdly, we have a $1.8m budget on pure customer acquisition spend via CPA payments + tokens (for specific IBs only). As for the inorganic growth, post ICO, depending on our raise we will purchase 1-2 brokerages (one of which is a market leader in 1 European country, looking to exit) resulting in us bolting on around 5-10,000 users pretty much from the get go. In light of this, our Year 1 forecasts are possibly conservative.   With regards to on-boarding, we will offer simple media assets that explain the switch-over and also do it for clients for a fee if required along with our upcoming partnership with a major exchange in the U.s.",False

Amount of dividends will be grow every month? Yes, tell me more about this investment and the rewards for it. I am the holder of Spectre tokens. How many tokens do I need and what kind of reward can I expect?  This total first distributable reward is 370.8 ETH (c. $254,000) and is available to SXDT holders. Of that amount, 6.1 ETH is from trading volumes generated by traders in Spectre’s first test-month, untl 25th of April, and the remainder 364.7 ETH, from the DALP based passive proprietary participation in the wider markets (already declared earlier this year). That 370.8 eth is then divided by all SXDT tokens 140,270,691 which comes out to  0.00000264346027923966 eth per token, or roughly $0.0018107845494252 per token.  You only need 1 token to collect dividends.

At start the price can be somewhat same as they are available now with little difference. In future low supply based tokens will reach at high caps and their value will be in two or three digits in fiat.  i'm sorry, i don't understand one thing. Why do you talk about ""burned SXUT""? If i remeber well, SXUT can be use to trade financial instruments on the spectre's platform. Maybe you mean ""use"" instead of ""burn""?  If not, can you explain me better?  Thank you!  There is a Buyback Program for the SXUT tokens.  Tokens acquired in the Buyback Program will be burned. You can read more about the Buyback program here: https://d1zzssn32v8b7a.cloudfront.net/media/spectre_token_buyback_v_2_1.pdf  Till now, i have not gone through this buyback program for SXUT, so on what basis you are going to pay the dividends and buyback for SXUT?

Literally everything about the post grinds my gears.  Well, if you buy something at almost 8x from pre-ico (5x from ico) within months of ico maybe you should expect a decline. Plus the whole crypto market had a bleed and this would have had a major effect on SXDT/SXUT price (look at the correlation between almost every coin and bitcoin on coinmarketcap). Nothing to do with Spectre, just your unfortunate decision.  I seem to remember their pre actual money platform looking pretty snazzy, I cant imagine thats turned to shit. Sure 'normies' coming to the platform would be great but you really want the active traders. People that are going to put real money into the platform.

The first dividends will be towards the end of April and, as stated time and time again,  you must register on the platform and go through KYC to be eligiable to collect dividends as the platform is closed to some places, meaning that you cannot collect dividends if you are in areas where the platform is not available to you to use. Once registration on the platform is live, you'll be able to go through KYC. For what is required for KYC, you'll need to contact team@spectre.ai and they can assist you with that. The platform is currently in a month long private beta real money stress stess. This is for the whole month of April.

In order to be eligible to collect dividends you'll need to register on the platform once it's live and go through KYC. Also note that owing to a tightening of the legal framework in certain restricted jurisdictions such as the United States this year, for those specifically wanting to pull dividends, KYC will be performed onsite using Jumio. The procuring of SXDT tokens by U.S citizens on exchanges is against the Spectre.ai terms and conditions and dividends will not be paid to U.S citizens.  hello, I am  EU  citizen.    I am  not USA.  When  will the platform go  trought  live?  I  will upload  the  documents  for KYC.  Then  can I  keep    spectre dividends token  in Myetherwallet  and  still collect dividends or  do I need  to move the coins to  the S.P.E.C.T.R.E.  platform?  Hello.  The platform is currently in a month long private beta real money stress test.  I believe the this beta is now full but you can email team@spectre.ai for more information if you want to participate.  To learn more about this beta, please read this article https://medium.com/teamspectreai/spectre-ai-to-launch-real-money-private-beta-reserve-your-place-d1bf3a70b996 If you are participating in this beta, please refer to this article for providing feedback https://medium.com/teamspectreai/private-beta-how-to-provide-feedback-742b3cb61d16  Once the platform goes live (not this private beta stress test), you'll be able to register on the platform, go through KYC, and register your eth wallet address you have your SXDT in for collecting dividends.  PLEASE DO NOT USE AN EXCHANGE WALLET.  Wallets such as MetaMask, Mist, MEW are fine. You do not need to keep your SXDT tokens on the platform to collect your dividends.

I am also wondering about the dividends. I have Spectre.ai tokens in my wallet, what elas should be done to get dividends? Am I too late for the first round of dividends?  When the dividend locker goes live around April 23 just make a new login to the portal, do KYC and enter your ETH address that holds your SXDT.  https://spectre.ai/  I wonder why you need to register at all, all holder addresses are known and distribution should be done without any KYC  As stated numerous times through out the ICO and since it's completion, the platform is not open to some places (including the US at this time) and dividends will not be paid to those in places where the platform is not open. This is why KYC is required for collecting dividends. This here goes over how to collect the dividends.

They have verbally advised the community their internal targets are much higher but don't want to share those with us. So that leaves a void and that void is filled by this type of debate. I do think as a community we have followed Kays approach and managed expectations but I do also think we've been too quick to shoot down people who have different views to the majority. I believe everyone has the same right to voice their opinions whether they are a short term investor or long term holder. I think we have been too risk adverse as a community and I for one am ready for us to enjoy the fact that we are going to receive life changing money and I'm comfortable in speculating on returns if spectre won't commit to a sharing their internal forecast. so instead of challenging Steve I would like to thank him for doing something for the community.

The spectre.ai trading platform, as you recall, was in alpha mode for over 3 months with thousands of traders who tested it in a virtual environment. Now, as we enter beta, traders will be able to also take demo money trades on the platform with Ethereum TestNet integration (Ropsten) as an extra option on top of the existing option of a virtual account with virtual ETH. This means they will be able to see when their trades are actually mined on the blockchain and the subsequent outcome (win or loss) with credit or debit of funds from their wallets!  Although the Spectre.ai beta is now live and can be accessed on www.spectre.ai, you will only be able to test it with actual trades on late Monday night GMT (1st, Jan 2018) onward, as the FX markets are currently closed on the weekend and will remain closed for New Year’s day holiday. Please note, as with any beta, bugs will surface and we will quash them over the coming 3 months ahead of our planned full-commercial-live launch in March end 2018. We look forward to your feedback as it will help us improve the platform.  https://medium.com/teamspectreai/spectre-ai-beta-out-7e0a62507b7c",False

The other 91.5 million created after the sale ended is what we need to break down and see what portions will be converted. You mentioned that management tokens will be converted after the conversion period so that eliminates them and the Pool/Reserve I'm sure works like management so if that's the case we need to account for around 27.5 million tokens remaining: Legal/Advisors 18.3 million, Bounties 9.2 million.  Do the Legal/Advisors's tokens work like management and convert after the 28 day period? We will need that info to figure this out.

They arrange sales between trader and stock seller for a small commission. That commission was their due for filling a role that only they could fulfill.  The ethical issues that arose from this system, though known to traders, were an unavoidable risk that had to be taken. Traders had no way to fulfill the role of a broker effectively unless they wished to take on both roles at once. This, coupled with the power of the broker, prevented the broker's place in the financial trading system to remain undisrupted for nearly the entirety of financial trading history.  SPECTRE, the shortened form of Speculative Tokenized Trading Exchange, is an innovative platform that has disrupted this facet of the financial market. SPECTRE is built upon Ethereum blockchain technology. This is important as it allows traders to use crypto wallets, rather than an account controlled by a broker, to invest. Ethereum takes the place of the broker and automates all the processes associated with the role. Brokers, in the traditional model, make profits off of the loss of traders; the Ethereum technology makes no such profit from the deposit of funds from cryptocurrencies into SPECTRE’s liquidity pool. This reduces the motivation and core reasons that broker fraud occurs within the financial market. The broker, within SPECTRE’s business model, is no longer necessary.

The platform was created by Neuchatel Ltd whose founders, SPECTRE CEO Karan “Kay” Khemani and COO Zisis Skoulouds, explicitly designed the platform to be disruptive and innovative. It’s two innovative features, Tokenized Balance Sheets and Dividends along with an adaptive trade platform, are their most disruptive ones. Both features aim to reduce broker fraud by removing the perpetrator of fraud-the broker-,protecting the trader through algorithms, and promoting transparency within the platform.  The main perpetrators of fraud within the financial trading market are brokers. They have complete control over the investments, and therefore capita, of the trader from the moment they invest. Brokers make money off of the losses of their traders which results in a broker-trader dynamic that encourages such practices as dishonestly reporting market prices, providing hyped strategies designed to burn accounts intro the ground, trading without permission upon the behalf of the trader, and hindering withdrawals. This unhealthy dynamic encourages a 70-90% industry loss ratio that creates distrust in the financial market.  https://coinidol.com/spectre-eliminates-fraud-with-broker-less-platform/",False

The weekly dividend is based off of trade volume and is paid in ETH. In order to receive that dividend, you would need to have your SPEC tokens on a wallet that you control. A personal MEW or any other ERC20 token wallet that you control. If you don't have it on a wallet you control then you will not receive the dividend. Say for an example you have your SPEC sitting on an exchange, the exchange would receive the ETH dividend as they control the wallet that it is sitting on.  The second type is a year dividend paid each January. This dividend is based on the excess ETH created each year in the liquidity pool. Each year a benchmark for growth of the liquidity pool will be set. If that benchmark is surpassed the excess ETH's will be distributed to the token holders and the Spectre team. This division will be 70% to the token holders and 30% to the team. This dividend is paid in ETH also.

The holders of the dividend-token obtain a 2% dividend stream paid at the end of the week (and a special dividend at the end of the year), while the utility-token holders receive higher payouts on the trading platform itself and a wider variety of assets inside the platform as well as participation in the token buy-back program.

This will grow our platform userbase, bringing much more value to the dividends paid to D tokens, and at the same time this growth will increase demand for U tokens to gain the trading platform benefits.

I should have waited for a formal response from the internal team.  Please forgive me for the misunderstanding.   The response from Spectre.ai legal  ""There is no downgrade to forecasts. Please note that there are hundreds of brokers that operate unregulated and their forecasts are unaffected by obtaining licenses or not. In fact because they are unregulated, they can offer more types of exotic contract types and leverage levels and actually see a gain in their market share. We have no intention of operating unregulated but note that the license we are going for is likely to be awarded in Q1 (first or 2nd month), not Q2 or Q4. The license grant is well before the platform even launches (we know because we have already started the process and all is well underway). In the very unlikely event the 'easy' jurisdiction where we are operating in, doesn't award the license, then we apply and obtain a Belize license. Failing that, then its simple, we operate unregulated following best practices. Please note, our forecasts are not reliant on obtaining licenses or not. However, our forecasts receive a 50% boost/upgrade if and when we obtain cftc/sec licenses but that process will take time (as with FCA). The reason behind the upgrade is owing to the sheer size of the U.S market. However this is not included in any of our 3 forecast scenarios (bear, base or bull). Our forecasts do not assume we obtain licenses and are not reliant on it. Please note ETX Binary is one of the best examples of an unregulated broker (ETX Capital is regulated by the FCA but ETX Binary is unregulated) that follows best practice but without any formal regulation. There are bucketshops that obtain regulation on offshore jurisdictions and operate within their ""legal remits"". Thanks.""",False

And I have regretted this very much. These binary ICO's are popping up every day. Newest I think binary.com So after investing I looked (to late) into this business and the potential.  You haven’t read our whitepaper so if possible, try and stop ranting and carefully read our responses. Binary.com is a centralised Binary broker raising money to continue their existing model and tokenise end of year profits to dividends. Our’s removes the broker completely out of the equation and replaces them with a decentralised, autonomous liquidity pool (DALP) and P2P model. This allows traders to trade a range of digital options, smart CFDs and traditional a-book trading. Not sure what makes you believe we are a binary broker – there are no deposits on our platform and no broker present.  We don’t offer binary options. The nature of our contracts covers binary outcomes as well, however these are Smart Options and Smart CFDs (ULC) and other contract types. Everything is governed by smart contracts which is the big difference which you clearly have missed.  THIS SPECTRE PLATFORM WILL NEVER WORK !! (of course they do not care, only if the ICO works)  It already works. The pool has grown, traders love it. Defamatory statements that are misleading will result in you being tracked down and sued for defamation. We are happy to escalate this.  1. They say they will apply for a EU license The 1st of January MIFID II will get in effect, meaning 95% of all EU countries will ban Binary Options. So this license is worthless. It can only be used in the EU. US, Canada, Brasil and many other countries and continents have already stated that offering Binary options is illegal. Binary Options are dead !>> clearly no real research was done or ignored  We have actually met with regulators including CySEC. Clearly your understanding of MIFID 2 is lacking as MIFID 2 is not actually even published. MIFID 2 doesn’t ban binary options. There is no information on that. Binary Options are not allowed to be marketed in select regions like Canada or Israel. However, as you can see digital options are big in the U.S as traded under CFTC regulated NADEX who has no plans to ban them. Binary.com which operates under a gaming license in Malta is actually one of the market leaders and will they be shut down by MIFID 2? Absolutely not. Is IQ Option being shut down by CySEC? They are one of the biggest binary players in Europe and operating well within the law. Again, we offer Smart Options (both all or nothing and digital options however our contracts are governed by smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, so there is no opportunity for financial fraud) and CFDs and traditional A-Book trading. You have clearly misunderstood what Spectre.ai does.  2. Financial statement is total guess work (or just pumped up for this ICO) All other Binary ICO companies have set out income and cost of running a binary platform. Running such a platform cost a lot of money (especially marketing) and this all going to be paid for with a 2% margin , get real !  Actually our 2% model on SOs and 2-20% of spread on CFDs works like a charm. It more than covers our cost base (we don’t have account managers like you do at the broker you work for) so our human-asset intensity is far lower.  Also don’t forget we hold d tokens that participate in volumes not only on the normal divvy but end of year special divvy as well. That flows through as operating income. We’re a tech company, not a financial broker. Ergo, our cost base mirrors the former, not latter. Login to our platform and you can see the total dividends paid out, growth in the liquidity pool since the alpha went live around 1.5 months is over 5k ethers, which validates all of our forecasts. Our win rate assumptions included. We have the data, not sure what you’re operating on.  They state a client value of 2500, this is absurd. Not even the largest Forex brokers have such a value. Traders putting 8 trades every day ?? They do not go on holliday or take a break or stop trading...? >> this team has no experience and is making up numbers  Again, as you haven’t read our white paper or gone into our detailed Forecasts model, you are not in a position to speak with any real authority. Nowhere is the LTV stated as $2,500. It is at $800-900 (page 14 Whitepaper), go to our Forecasts model as well and look at cell B72. With regards to holidays and breaks, yes actually we do factor that in, look at cell number B71. It assumes 110 days of trading (which is based on actual FX and DO data). So everything you have categorically said is false and misleading. Now yes, if you divide Gross Revs by the number of traders you get a net-volume per trader of around $2.4k (aka gross-ltv) however the LTV to us and token holders (net-ltv) is far lower owing to the mechanics of the DALP. Additionally, the LTV for FX traders is far higher than BO traders and our forecasts include a blend of both types of traders not ‘depleted binary option traders’. Many European FX brokerages have client LTVs of EUR 3,000 +. Some are at EUR 1,800 but the average is way higher. Most importantly, our data and assumptions on both net-LTVs and gross-LTVs are coming from one of the market leaders in Europe in binaries (volumes, win-rates, everything) so we have actual data verification behind our assumptions.   3. NO CONFLICTOF INTEREST ?? Spectre is no broker, but it sure as hell is a counter party of their traders! Traders loose and the company wins. If clients win, this Holy Grale (the liquidity pool) is going to get empty and this means no income for the company (or token holders) , so what is keeping them from rigging the platform ?  Based on this question it is clear that you don’t understand how the Ethereum block chain works, nor how immutable smart contracts interface with multi-sig wallets. We are not a counterparty to anything. Trader trade p2p or against the DALP. The Ethereum blockchain guarantees orcalised pricing so truer and fairer entries and only smart contracts control fund flows (not humans) after trade outcomes (wins, losses, close TP/SLs). It is theoretically impossible for us to extract funds from the liquidity pool (DALP). The only way spectre.ai’s wallet and d token holder wallets get paid are through volumes (not just losses; we are agnostic whether the client wins or loses). Again, loosely glancing over our whitepaper but not actually understanding what we do is going to result in false conclusions.  They say all brokers are scammers (which is true). But where do they get this winrate of 52% (needed for them to make a profit). This company has no experience in running a binary company, so these numbers come from other brokers (correct: scam brokers) And why is the win rate so low, because if the broker does not scam, the winrate will be much higher!  The win rate is actually 49.8% on binary options and we have this from one of the market leaders in Europe with trade data totalling over thousands trades and thousands of customers (sign an NDA with us and we can release that information in confidence, no problem). We build in a higher win-rate on our platform (52%) because our trading platform actually has good risk management features and emotion control algorithms that ensure clients don’t destroy their account within weeks of depositing. Our current win-rate on the spectre.ai dapp which has seen millions in volume go through it already is tracking close to 52-54%.  4. Make a choice , token holders or traders ! Spectre is promoting the platform to traders and pretending that they will offer all the tools to be a successful trader. This is great ! For the traders, but not for the shareholders (clients need to loose to make money) On the other side they promote ICO investors that they are going to offer a profitable trading platform, in which clients will loose on average 2500€ ..  Again, as you haven’t read our white paper or gone into our detailed Forecasts model, you are not in a position to speak with any real authority. Nowhere is the LTV stated as $2,500. It is at $800-900 (page 14 Whitepaper), go to our Forecasts model as well and look at cell B72. With regards to holidays and breaks, yes actually we do factor that in, look at cell number B71. It assumes 110 days of trading (which is based on actual FX and DO data). So everything you have categorically said is false and misleading. Now yes, if you divide Gross Revs by the number of traders you get a net-volume per trader of around $2.4k (aka gross-ltv) however the LTV to us and token holders (net-ltv) is far lower owing to the mechanics of the DALP.

Many European FX brokerages have client LTVs of EUR 3,000 +. Some are at EUR 1,800 but the average is way higher. Most importantly, our data and assumptions on both net-LTVs and gross-LTVs are coming from one of the market leaders in Europe in binaries (volumes, win-rates, everything) so we have actual data verification behind our assumptions.  Whether you like it or not, take a look at Oanda’s latest audited reports, 65-70% of traders even in a safe a-book environment lose money. It’s that simple. Of course the traders that are good and deserve to win should get paid and that’s exactly what we create a true and fair trading environment.  Also with regards to trading profits as a percentage of total Spectre.ai and token holder revenues, you have completely misunderstood how the Dapp store works and what adjacent fin-tech sectors/areas the DALP will connect to thus diversifying revenue streams.   So What is it ?What is your goal, make us rich or make traders rich !  To create the fairest and most transparent trading environment. Our technology means no deposits required, no brokers required, all prices independently verified. Those who win get paid, shareholders and Spectre.ai get paid on volumes (not just losses but both wins and losses) and Dapp store growth. Speaking in exclamation marks and screaming is not going to change our mission.  the only way both parties can profit if you are a REAL BROKER. A real broker earns on commissions, which means the more positions a traders opens the more commission you earn as a company and now you want the trader to win, as you will want him to place more trades Wink Great company to set out an ICO and not saying it is a scam, but they have no idea what they are doing and have no experience. (look at the team) and this platform will go bust on traders winning (thats what you want, right? )  This is what a real broker does: https://www.timesofisrael.com/fleeced-by-israeli-binary-options-firm-canadian-man-commits-suicide/  People like you belong behind bars guising as customers when actually you are a broker yourself. Had you made that clear earlier, it would make a lot more sense that you had a dog in the fight. We mean this in every professional sense; shame on you for being a broker and part of the problem and trying to attack a technology that actually creates a fair and transparent trading environment for traders. Read the whitepaper.   Spectre.ai Legal",False

So let's breakdown the FOOL's comments in turn to educate him. SPECTRE is not using binary options, they are the creators of ""SMART OPTIONS"" a totally new kind of trading asset imo. One of which should dominate this space for years to come. Binary Options agreed are DEAD, the rats nest of people who destroyed them in Israel has come to an end *** YAY *** as over 95% of the brokers come from there and if you don't know Israeli's well they are home bodies so not likely to leave and cause trouble away from home, not part of their nature. So odds are they will go back to looking for work selling second hand electronics at airports. Another thing to note is SPECTRE is no broker, they have created an autonomous DECENTRALIZED liquidity pool, do you not get that? That means you do not DEPOSIT to a BROKER = NO FRAUD!  Odds are you maybe be part of the very brokers being put out business by public opinion, the LAW and now even technology, prolly best to get over it, hands him the classified ads, search terms you might wish to look for on jobmonsters.com = Conman/@$$hole/IsraeliBrokeroutofwork/mentallyhandicappedjobs and the like. So  1) Again not Binary Options = SMART OPTIONS, also the SPECTRE platform works try using it as I have, will have a great future being able to trade all kinds of products and integrate education/risk management tools, easy to use interface/charting. It even has DAPP built in for future 3rd party connectivity options. The license they will get and ones they will apply for will likely be looked on favorably due to their connections to real fintech space players and the knowledge they bring to the table. There is good will here as they are looking to bring a corrupt industry to an end and usher in a new age of fairness for investors and traders alike. That is POWER, even if you are too short sighted to see it. Again these are NOT BINARY OPTIONS, those are DEAD, these are ""SMART OPTIONS"" decentralized blockchain based with a fair profit system for SPECTRE and Token holders of 2% which would anger any broker who would like to keep their 100% instead on clients losses, such as Binary.com, STOX, SPOTCHAIN and all the broker shills who are afraid of SPECTRE destroying their CENTRALIZED model boys club. Your ""Conflict of interest days are done, get ready for a DECENTRALIZED model that eats your lunch, bringing an end to the FRAUD/Manipulation and RISK to the trader.    2) 2% is not good enough? Remember the team members of SPECTRE have been around for years running a fair business model catering to traders, which they don't even really promote. I think this is due to their focus on the future and somewhat humble nature. They are not marketers trying to run hype and tell you how great they are at every turn, they are professionals who wish to make trading a better experience for all and they have the vision and team to bring this about. This is the warped thinking of somebody from the Israeli conman/binary options space. SPECTRE is not a BROKER you got that right, brokers are greedy dirt bags who wish to only take clients money, period! Now you sound very very familiar with this, to which my guess is you are with a broker in some way/shape/form. 2% has an exponential effect spread out over many users/transactions in time. I suggest you actually do more research on spectre.ai as they have all the breakdowns on the site for you. Or would you rather just make baseless fictional remarks in order to FUD them? My guess is the later...  3) Conflict of interest? All trading is a ZERO sum game period! Yes you will have losers, but if I had a choice of trading vs a DECENTRALIZED autonomous liquidity pool that takes 2% on volume VS a Broker taking 100% based on losses, well no need to think about this. CENTRALIZED = 100% gains for broker 100% losses/Manipulation/Conflict of Interest/FRAUD on your DEPOSIT to them, which you hope they will return to you vs DECENTRALIZED 2% per transaction and you hold onto your money as there is NO DEPOSIT required = LESS RISK to the trader. Add to the value that you are supporting the future with blockchain tech adding to the value with security/speed and a FRAUD free future both elegant in design and moral in vision.  4) Trader or Token holders? Really? The simple fact is most lose in trading, same in business too? So what is your point if the average loss is 2500 per individual, as in business does that mean nobody should take the risk anymore? Maybe we should all become communists and stop trying to capitalize on new technology and just all go back to working on basic living requirements, hold hands brothers! UNIT fight the dirty capitalists! Ahhhhh... No... Traders get a ""FAIR BATTLE GROUND"" of which the trading world has not seen and Token Holders get profits off the aggregate of the functionality of the DLP, simple/honest and straight forward.   So what is it!? I will tell you what it is .... The Dude Abides ... This is to say it will be and already is. Your stressed/deceptive/angry undertones are not lost on me. You are very likely one of those Israeli con men who pretended to be a broker, or have support them in the past. That is coming to an end. The DECENTRALIZED FAIR and advanced MODEL is going to put the CENTRALIZED brokers out of business. ""CENTRALIZED = Dialup"" and ""DECENTRALIZED = FiberOptics."" Brokers are angry because that 2% = no profits for them, or very very little. Only a fair minded group who is out provide a honest and long term business would think this way. Where con men who only see short term gains would think the other way. Also even commission structured trading has it's negatives such as churning by brokers or spreading. IG and Nadex screw their clients over imo and hey they even have CFTC licensing to allow this. You want a platform that is based on commission that has even lower odds of a trader being profitable, check them out! That platform is designed to screw traders as bad as the prime mortgage scam of 2007-8 was designed to steal wealth from middle america.

The pre-sale will be based on a queue and entry to the pre-sale will be on first-come first-served basis. This is to maximize distribution and avoid network congestion. The pre-sale will be conducted in a phased manner. Emails will be sent to investors on October 26th (for actual contributions starting on the 27th) asking them to login at a specified time period in order to see the contribution address. Investors will be able to participate only during their allocated time slots and they will be getting a 24 hours window to participate. The exact times will be published on the aforementioned emails sent on October 26th.  The pre-sale commences on the 27th of October and ends on the 5th of November. During the first 3 phases (each phase lasts 24 hours) all the people that white-listed their ETH address will be invited via email to a password protected area where they will be able to send their contributions. The 4th phase will start at the beginning of the 4th day and all people regardless of being white-listed or not, will be able to participate.

The first 100 million tokens (c. $15 million in value) purchased in the pre-sale will carry with them a 33% bonus. Any additional tokens purchased during the presale will be sold with a 22% bonus. This means that if someone contributes, for example, 1 ETH to purchase 2.000 Tokens (as per the token price) before the first 100 million tokens are sold, then they will end up with 2,000 tokens plus 660 tokens; so in total 2,660 tokens.

And I have regretted this very much. These binary ICO's are popping up every day. Newest I think binary.com So after investing I looked (to late) into this business and the potential.  You haven’t read our whitepaper so if possible, try and stop ranting and carefully read our responses. Binary.com is a centralised Binary broker raising money to continue their existing model and tokenise end of year profits to dividends. Our’s removes the broker completely out of the equation and replaces them with a decentralised, autonomous liquidity pool (DALP) and P2P model. This allows traders to trade a range of digital options, smart CFDs and traditional a-book trading. Not sure what makes you believe we are a binary broker – there are no deposits on our platform and no broker present.  We don’t offer binary options. The nature of our contracts covers binary outcomes as well, however these are Smart Options and Smart CFDs (ULC) and other contract types. Everything is governed by smart contracts which is the big difference which you clearly have missed.  THIS SPECTRE PLATFORM WILL NEVER WORK !! (of course they do not care, only if the ICO works)  It already works. The pool has grown, traders love it. Defamatory statements that are misleading will result in you being tracked down and sued for defamation. We are happy to escalate this.  1. They say they will apply for a EU license The 1st of January MIFID II will get in effect, meaning 95% of all EU countries will ban Binary Options. So this license is worthless. It can only be used in the EU. US, Canada, Brasil and many other countries and continents have already stated that offering Binary options is illegal. Binary Options are dead !>> clearly no real research was done or ignored  We have actually met with regulators including CySEC. Clearly your understanding of MIFID 2 is lacking as MIFID 2 is not actually even published. MIFID 2 doesn’t ban binary options. There is no information on that. Binary Options are not allowed to be marketed in select regions like Canada or Israel. However, as you can see digital options are big in the U.S as traded under CFTC regulated NADEX who has no plans to ban them. Binary.com which operates under a gaming license in Malta is actually one of the market leaders and will they be shut down by MIFID 2? Absolutely not. Is IQ Option being shut down by CySEC? They are one of the biggest binary players in Europe and operating well within the law. Again, we offer Smart Options (both all or nothing and digital options however our contracts are governed by smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, so there is no opportunity for financial fraud) and CFDs and traditional A-Book trading. You have clearly misunderstood what Spectre.ai does.  2. Financial statement is total guess work (or just pumped up for this ICO) All other Binary ICO companies have set out income and cost of running a binary platform. Running such a platform cost a lot of money (especially marketing) and this all going to be paid for with a 2% margin , get real !  Actually our 2% model on SOs and 2-20% of spread on CFDs works like a charm. It more than covers our cost base (we don’t have account managers like you do at the broker you work for) so our human-asset intensity is far lower.  Also don’t forget we hold d tokens that participate in volumes not only on the normal divvy but end of year special divvy as well. That flows through as operating income. We’re a tech company, not a financial broker. Ergo, our cost base mirrors the former, not latter. Login to our platform and you can see the total dividends paid out, growth in the liquidity pool since the alpha went live around 1.5 months is over 5k ethers, which validates all of our forecasts. Our win rate assumptions included. We have the data, not sure what you’re operating on.  They state a client value of 2500, this is absurd. Not even the largest Forex brokers have such a value. Traders putting 8 trades every day ?? They do not go on holliday or take a break or stop trading...? >> this team has no experience and is making up numbers  Again, as you haven’t read our white paper or gone into our detailed Forecasts model, you are not in a position to speak with any real authority. Nowhere is the LTV stated as $2,500. It is at $800-900 (page 14 Whitepaper), go to our Forecasts model as well and look at cell B72. With regards to holidays and breaks, yes actually we do factor that in, look at cell number B71. It assumes 110 days of trading (which is based on actual FX and DO data). So everything you have categorically said is false and misleading. Now yes, if you divide Gross Revs by the number of traders you get a net-volume per trader of around $2.4k (aka gross-ltv) however the LTV to us and token holders (net-ltv) is far lower owing to the mechanics of the DALP. Additionally, the LTV for FX traders is far higher than BO traders and our forecasts include a blend of both types of traders not ‘depleted binary option traders’. Many European FX brokerages have client LTVs of EUR 3,000 +. Some are at EUR 1,800 but the average is way higher. Most importantly, our data and assumptions on both net-LTVs and gross-LTVs are coming from one of the market leaders in Europe in binaries (volumes, win-rates, everything) so we have actual data verification behind our assumptions.   3. NO CONFLICTOF INTEREST ?? Spectre is no broker, but it sure as hell is a counter party of their traders! Traders loose and the company wins. If clients win, this Holy Grale (the liquidity pool) is going to get empty and this means no income for the company (or token holders) , so what is keeping them from rigging the platform ?  Based on this question it is clear that you don’t understand how the Ethereum block chain works, nor how immutable smart contracts interface with multi-sig wallets. We are not a counterparty to anything. Trader trade p2p or against the DALP. The Ethereum blockchain guarantees orcalised pricing so truer and fairer entries and only smart contracts control fund flows (not humans) after trade outcomes (wins, losses, close TP/SLs). It is theoretically impossible for us to extract funds from the liquidity pool (DALP). The only way spectre.ai’s wallet and d token holder wallets get paid are through volumes (not just losses; we are agnostic whether the client wins or loses). Again, loosely glancing over our whitepaper but not actually understanding what we do is going to result in false conclusions.  They say all brokers are scammers (which is true). But where do they get this winrate of 52% (needed for them to make a profit). This company has no experience in running a binary company, so these numbers come from other brokers (correct: scam brokers) And why is the win rate so low, because if the broker does not scam, the winrate will be much higher!  The win rate is actually 49.8% on binary options and we have this from one of the market leaders in Europe with trade data totalling over thousands trades and thousands of customers (sign an NDA with us and we can release that information in confidence, no problem). We build in a higher win-rate on our platform (52%) because our trading platform actually has good risk management features and emotion control algorithms that ensure clients don’t destroy their account within weeks of depositing. Our current win-rate on the spectre.ai dapp which has seen millions in volume go through it already is tracking close to 52-54%.  4. Make a choice , token holders or traders ! Spectre is promoting the platform to traders and pretending that they will offer all the tools to be a successful trader. This is great ! For the traders, but not for the shareholders (clients need to loose to make money) On the other side they promote ICO investors that they are going to offer a profitable trading platform, in which clients will loose on average 2500€ ..  Again, as you haven’t read our white paper or gone into our detailed Forecasts model, you are not in a position to speak with any real authority. Nowhere is the LTV stated as $2,500. It is at $800-900 (page 14 Whitepaper), go to our Forecasts model as well and look at cell B72. With regards to holidays and breaks, yes actually we do factor that in, look at cell number B71. It assumes 110 days of trading (which is based on actual FX and DO data). So everything you have categorically said is false and misleading. Now yes, if you divide Gross Revs by the number of traders you get a net-volume per trader of around $2.4k (aka gross-ltv) however the LTV to us and token holders (net-ltv) is far lower owing to the mechanics of the DALP. Additionally, the LTV for FX traders is far higher than BO traders and our forecasts include a blend of both types of traders not ‘depleted binary option traders’. Many European FX brokerages have client LTVs of EUR 3,000 +. Some are at EUR 1,800 but the average is way higher. Most importantly, our data and assumptions on both net-LTVs and gross-LTVs are coming from one of the market leaders in Europe in binaries (volumes, win-rates, everything) so we have actual data verification behind our assumptions.  Whether you like it or not, take a look at Oanda’s latest audited reports, 65-70% of traders even in a safe a-book environment lose money. It’s that simple. Of course the traders that are good and deserve to win should get paid and that’s exactly what we create a true and fair trading environment.  Also with regards to trading profits as a percentage of total Spectre.ai and token holder revenues, you have completely misunderstood how the Dapp store works and what adjacent fin-tech sectors/areas the DALP will connect to thus diversifying revenue streams.   So What is it ?What is your goal, make us rich or make traders rich !  To create the fairest and most transparent trading environment. Our technology means no deposits required, no brokers required, all prices independently verified. Those who win get paid, shareholders and Spectre.ai get paid on volumes (not just losses but both wins and losses) and Dapp store growth. Speaking in exclamation marks and screaming is not going to change our mission.  the only way both parties can profit if you are a REAL BROKER. A real broker earns on commissions, which means the more positions a traders opens the more commission you earn as a company and now you want the trader to win, as you will want him to place more trades Wink Great company to set out an ICO and not saying it is a scam, but they have no idea what they are doing and have no experience. (look at the team) and this platform will go bust on traders winning (thats what you want, right? )  This is what a real broker does: https://www.timesofisrael.com/fleeced-by-israeli-binary-options-firm-canadian-man-commits-suicide/  People like you belong behind bars guising as customers when actually you are a broker yourself. Had you made that clear earlier, it would make a lot more sense that you had a dog in the fight. We mean this in every professional sense; shame on you for being a broker and part of the problem and trying to attack a technology that actually creates a fair and transparent trading environment for traders. Read the whitepaper.   Spectre.ai Legal",False

And I have regretted this very much. These binary ICO's are popping up every day. Newest I think binary.com So after investing I looked (to late) into this business and the potential.  THIS SPECTRE PLATFORM WILL NEVER WORK !! (of course they do not care, only if the ICO works)  1.  They say they will apply for a EU license The 1st of January MIFID II will get in effect, meaning  95% of all EU countries will ban Binary Options. So this license is worthless. It can only be used in the EU. US, Canada, Brasil and many other countries and continents have already stated that offering Binary options is illegal. Binary Options are dead ! >> clearly no real research was done or ignored  2.  Financial statement is total guess work (or just pumped up for this ICO) All other Binary ICO companies have set out income and cost of running a binary platform. Running such a platform cost a lot of money (especially marketing) and this all going to be paid for with a 2% margin , get real ! They state a client value of 2500, this is absurd. Not even the largest Forex brokers have such a value. Traders putting 8 trades every day ?? They do not go on holliday or take a break or stop trading...? >> this team has no experience and is making up numbers  3.  NO CONFLICTOF INTEREST ?? Spectre is no broker, but it sure as hell is a counter party of their traders! Traders loose and the company wins. If clients win, this Holy Grale (the liquidity pool) is going to get empty and this means no income for the company (or token holders) , so what is keeping them from rigging the platform ?  They say all brokers are scammers (which is true). But where do they get this winrate of 52% (needed for them to make a profit). This company has no experience in running a binary company, so these numbers come from other brokers (correct: scam brokers) And why is the win rate so low, because if the broker does not scam, the winrate will be much higher!   4. Make a choice , token holders or traders ! Spectre is promoting the platform to traders and pretending that they will offer all the tools to be a successful trader. This is great ! For the traders, but not for the shareholders (clients need to loose to make money) On the other side they promote ICO investors that they are going to offer a profitable trading platform, in which clients will loose on average 2500€ ..  So What is it ?  What is your goal, make us rich or make traders rich ! the only way both parties can profit if you are a REAL BROKER. A real broker earns on commissions, which means the more positions a traders opens the more commission you earn as a company and now you want the trader to win, as you will want him to place more trades Great company to set out an ICO and not saying it is a scam, but they have no idea what they are doing and have no experience. (look at the team) and this platform will go bust on traders winning (thats what you want, right? )",False

The modifications are conducted to include more investors into the sale so that they do not feel they missed out and to expand the range over which the 33% pre-sale bonus would be applied (previously there was a 33% bonus on funds raised up to $10 million, this is now on funds raised up to $15m), thereby resulting in the total removal of the pre-sale hardcap of $10 million. The total ICO hardcap of $30 million remains unchanged.  Whitelisting and Pre-sale Process  · In order to participate in the pre-sale, investors must register on our whitelist. The purpose of the whitelist is two-fold. First, to give to as many members of the community as possible the opportunity to purchase our tokens. Second, to ensure that we’re selling only to qualified, serious investors with a long term view.  · The registration form for the SPECTRE.ai pre-sale can be found on our website.  · SPECTRE.ai’s pre-sale will be based on a queue and entry to the pre-sale will be on first-come first-served basis. This is to maximize distribution and avoid network congestion.  · The pre-sale will be conducted in a phased manner. Emails will be sent to investors on October 26th (for actual contributions starting on the 27th) asking them to login at a specified time period in order to see the contribution address. Investors will be able to participate only during their allocated time slots and they will be getting a 24 hours window to participate. The exact times will be published on the aforementioned emails sent on October 26th.  · The pre-sale commences on the 27th of October and ends on the 5th of November. During the first 3 phases (each phase lasts 24 hours) all the people that white-listed their ETH address will be invited via email to a password protected area where they will be able to send their contributions. The 4th phase will start at the beginning of the 4th day and all people regardless of being white-listed or not, will be able to participate. (The pre-sale contribution ETH address will be published in a password protected area. This method of password protection provides the maximum level of security as the user is required to log in before the protected token sale address is displayed. You will have to use the email id and password you have entered during the crowd sale registration process in order to view the token sale address.)  · By the 23rd of October, investors will have to have specified the exact amount of ETH they wish to contribute in the pre-sale registration form. If during the sale they attempt to send a transaction with more than 5% less or more than 20% more ETH than indicated in the pre-sale registration, then the transaction may be rejected and the ETH will be returned to the contributor. (Instructions on how to handle gas will be published in a tutorial closer to the pre-sale date).  · The minimum contribution amount for the pre-sale is 1 ETH. There is no maximum contribution amount. The first 100 million tokens (c. $15 million in value) purchased in the pre-sale will carry with them a 33% bonus. Any additional tokens purchased during the presale will be sold with a 22% bonus. This means that if someone contributes, for example, 1 ETH to purchase 2.000 Tokens (as per the token price) before the first 100 million tokens are sold, then they will end up with 2,000 tokens plus 660 tokens; so in total 2,660 tokens. If their contribution happens after 100 millions tokens have been sold, then they will end up with 2.000 tokens plus 440 tokens, so in total 2,440 tokens.  · Each white-listed investor will only be allowed to contribute once during the first 3 days of the Presale. If they miss their chance, then they will be able to participate again during the 4th phase.""",False

There are two tokens available: a dividend-token (SPEC-D) and a utility-token (SPEC-U).  Utility tokens receive higher payouts and a wider variety of assets inside the SPECTRE.ai platform (Please explain).// Example: Inside the SPECTRE trading platform, if non U-token holders get $75 when they win a $100 trade, the U-token holders would be earning $76-$80. U-token holders will be able to trade on assets (currency pairs like EURUSD) that non U-token holders will not be able to trade.  3% of fees generated (after payouts to dividend-token holders) will buy back utility tokens// correct""  But read the whole article.

Can I change sum of ETH in participation of presale if I already registered and whitelisted with certain amount?  Yes.  Please write to cto@spectre.ai to update your amount. By the 23rd of October, investors will have to have specified the exact amount of ETH they wish to contribute in the pre-sale registration form. If during the sale they attempt to send a transaction with less ETH than indicated in the pre-sale registration, then the transaction may be rejected and the ETH will be returned to the contributor.

This is based off of the amount of SPECD you hold on that wallet.  (Note only SPECD tokens holders receive a dividend.  SPECU token holders do not receive dividends.

One will be dividend based.  One will be a utility token.  The specifics will be available on the website in 3 or 4 days.  I have some highlights we can share with you now about the specifics.  Here is what was announced in telegram.  These are quotes from Kay our CEO.  Question: Kay thanks for the replies, I did not find any mention of two kind of tokens on your website, is it a latest change?  ""No problem Aamod, yes we have received a lot of feedback in the last week from both camps. Investors (big buyer groups) who want to invest in Spectre but fear changing regulations meaning that major exchanges like Kraken/poloniex wont be able to list our dividend token. So they want a utility token instead. We are creating it for them. For those investors who are more yield hungry, our dividend token will work out for them. This change has been approved by legal yesterday and we are updating all of our materials today/tomorrow.""  Question: Dividend means it's considered a security and will be under SEC rules for listing do you the necessary approvals?  ""Our Utility token and the company that issues that will fall subject to those rules and will be accepted by major U.S exchanges yes.   The dividend token will not be listed there but offshore.  (on smaller p2p exchanges and our onsite exchange)""  Question: Will the cap you trying to raise remain the same?  ""yes we do not need more than $30m to disrupt. ""  Question: I guess spectre will be the first to launch two tokens in one ico?  ""Augur and Steem.it have done more than 1 token per ICO please check.""  These questions the community and quotes from our CEO Kay.  Again the rest of the details will be on the website in 3 or 4 days.  Thank you all for your support and patience.      There are 2 types of dividends the SPEC token holder receives.  There will be some redundancy in my answer in an effort to make it as clear as possible.  One type is a monthly dividend based off of trade volume.  This dividend is paid in ETH.  In order to receive that dividend you would need to have your SPEC tokens on a wallet that you control.  A personal MEW or any other ERC20 token wallet that you control.  If you don't have it on a wallet you control then you will not receive the dividend.  Say for an example you have your SPEC sitting on an exchange, the exchange would receive the ETH dividend as they control the wallet that it is sitting on.  The second type is a year dividend paid each January.  This dividend is based on the excess ETH created each year in the liquidity pool.  Each year a benchmark for growth of the liquidity pool will be set.  If that benchmark is surpassed the excess ETH's will be distributed to the token holders and the Spectre team.  This division will be 70% to the token holders and 30% to the team.  This dividend is paid in ETH also.  In order to receive that dividend you would need to have your SPEC tokens on a wallet that you control.  A personal MEW or any other ERC20 token wallet that you control.  If you don't have it on a wallet you control then you will not receive the dividend.  Say for an example you have your SPEC sitting on an exchange, the exchange would receive the ETH dividend as they control the wallet that it is sitting on.  ""Note: the dividend-token is uniquely different from the utility-token"". Just in case they are not aware that there will be two classes of tokens.  I hope this answers your questions.  Please let us know if you need any more assistance.",False

The liquidity pool is initially funded by an ICO and tokens are distributed to the investors in return. When trading, all transactions are governed by smart contracts meaning that the broker is completely removed from this equation as well. The smart contracts pay out 2% dividends to ICO token holders and 2% to SPECTRE as a technology fee, each time the trader takes a trade. This is different to the traditional broker models where brokers mostly get paid on trader losses. A result of all the above is the creation of a fully transparent and fair trading environment with no conflict of interest between involved parties; a provable fair battleground where traders can fairly trade against the market without intervention.",False

But your counterpart in binary options is the binary option broker. You think they wish you win your trades, and they loose the money? No way, and they can in many ways put brakes on your winning trading.  What is different in SPECTRE is that your counterpart is the liquidity pool, and it gives rat's ass to if you win or loose your trade. If you win, it pays you automatically, no questions asked. If you loose, money goes to the liquidity pool. As to the prices at which you trade, SPECTRE can do nothing about them. Price feed comes from totally outside international sources, e.g. one of them is Oanda.  Don't worry about that liquidity pool runs out of money. Statistics show the cruel reality that that percentage of winning trades is much much lower than loosing trades.  Trading robots can give you hints to help you to analyze a situation, but it is only up to you to make the trade decision.

How can you sustain a 75-90% return just by guessing that the price will go one way or another? If you guess it goes up and the price goes up only by .1% your still right, but are going to get a 75% return? The money come from the liquidity, thus detracting from the whole network value. So if people do guess right, the network is worth less even tho your personal value went up. So if you achieve your goal(making smarter traders), then you company will be worthless.  Saddko above hit the nail on the head! Trading is a zero-sum-game. One trader’s wins are another’s losses. No one is re-inventing the wheel in SPECTRE. We are not a hedge fund telling traders if they invest, our platform will make them money. What we are doing is removing the broker out of the picture that intervenes disallowing traders to have a fair battleground against the wider market (i.e even stand a chance of making some profit). In our case, the broker is replaced by a decentralised liquidity pool that acts as counter party to most trades (where our algorithm does not match one trade against another traders). Out of 10 traders, when provided with a fair battleground, around 6-7 lose money because they cannot beat the market (Oanda, the world’s largest FX broker’s latest quarterly data supports this fact and the fact that its a billion dollar company lends support to the fact that SPECTRE’s liquidity pool will grow substantially as well, since we’re basically a decentralised Oanda but multi-asset-class).  In order to beat the market in digital options, you need to generate a win rate of around 57-58% as payouts upon wins are 75-80% on average. Those who invest the time and gain experience and are talented can do so and sustain win rates above this hurdle rate thereby generating capital growth over time. These traders will be rewarded from the liquidity pool and yes the pool shrinks after these payouts. However the masses cannot beat the market as data from millions and millions of trades over years shows. This means there is sustained liquidity pool growth over time of which a big portion is paid out to token holders as dividends. Network value on aggregate, ergo, increases.  Please follow this closely: Both SPECTRE and token holders receive revenues/dividends when traders trade; whether they lose or win is irrelevant. We are a technology platform that charges the liquidity pool a transaction fee. The network’s value is “worthless” if all traders win in the long run which is practically impossible. Statistics won’t change just because we obviate the broker. You are talking about tail end of the distribution events that have <.0000001% probability of happening. Sure, there are periods a few hours or days where the liquidity pool may be stagnant or decline but over time growth is going to continue upward, thereby increasing the networks value. And yes, if a trader loses by incorrectly predicting the direction of the market, they lose their capital investment for *that* trade, nothing more. It’s not like leveraged trading where you lose more than the amount invested. We have no trading robots, not sure where you gathered that from.  >  And your trading robot will advise them if they make a mistake? The same robot that controls the price points, trade access,  and the liquidity pool? It sounds like you replaced the brokers with an automated version.  This is inaccurate on many fronts. Firstly, the smart contracts that govern trade entry, exit and outcomes are oraclized. They are different from onboard SPECTRE AI that learns how the trader trades and gives them ‘soft-warnings’ protecting them from destroying their accounts or allowing amygdala hijacks to overtake their rational trading processes in their brain (you can look up the science of lizard brain trading and the destructive impact of cortisol during fight or flight responses during high-stress situations such as trading).  Our tools do not trade for traders, they just make them avoid easy pitfalls and instant account destruction; something traditional brokerages facilitate as they want to fleece clients immediately.  > And yes the name makes no sense.

I would imagine depending on the amount of coin holders which makes more sense for there to be less then more as a balanced relationship between token holders and traders using the platform is something to consider. Too many token holders = dilution of future returns... Hmmm have not seen how it is structured but the point is that Spectre management is taking 2% instead of 100% and it is based on volume instead of customer loses. Now if you wish to state that close to 20% goes to the liquidity pool and if most lose that it will be well funded in the future, well you are correct and who gets those funds or what happens to them as they build up? That is not a bad question and would need to be answered. There are a bunch of scenarios again depending on how they structure it. My bet is that it will go to the ICO token holders... #3 Don't compare them to Israeli scam brokers who will manipulate prices/trap people/trade on their behalf in order to lose their money and any number of despicable measures they have used to defraud binary option traders world wide. They are getting 2% paid on volume and the rest is paid to token holders/winning traders ect ect. If nothing else I will take the lesser of two evils, in this model at least the conflict of interest is all but eliminated and you no longer have brokers making a living purely off your misery in a river of disgusting sh*t that has plagued this asset class for far too long.  If you wish to accuse them of anything, accuse them in moving things in the right direction! Only a broker/israeli insider would feel that way. Going to suck for them losing their 100% of clients losses to people who take 2% based on volume... Which business model do you favor more as a trade and who the phuck would you trust!    ",False

A brief look at our team and their background on LinkedIn (along with the companies associated) will reveal that we are a serious financial technology company with a very public face, not only now but for years. Upon due diligence, ""spectrecoin"" appeared on our radar few months ago. As our product, which removes financial fraud out of a trading scenario by removing brokers, was in no way competing with ""spectrecoin"" and more importantly the fact that they were called ""spectrecoin"" as per their own website and literature including a New York Times article (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/business/dealbook/coin-digital-currency.html) that mentions them as ""spectrecoin"", the decision we took was to continue with our brand, ""spectre"". Spectre is an acronym for Speculative Tokenised Trading Exchange. It is not some ""cool"" name we plucked out of the air or with the view to ""piggyback"" on ""spectrecoin"". There are far bigger and more successful ICOs with very attractive names whose names one would consider hijacking before purposely targeting a small newly listed project. Clearly this was not our intention. Despite this, we had planned a reach-out to them and a new project ""spectre"" from Israel, shortly before our marketing began to let them know, at the end of this month (September). This was to inform them that our website would include a notice to all visitors that we are ""spectre"" and not spectrecoin.  Moreover, there are some accusations that the SPEC token is already taken and we haven't done any due diligence regarding this token name. We indeed came across SPEC token but found that it is inactive (https://gyazo.com/83e87619e11a9471dd44314d3328a55d ).  Also, the inactive one is not a ERC20 token. Our team had already initiated the process of getting this SPEC token name allocated to us. Needless to say, we have a range of differentiating 'backup' tickers given they are being mopped up quickly (note, even 'spectrecoin' as per ICO-age (https://gyazo.com/4d47b22ed7597c3c36f893701ea66e7c ) had decided to go with 'SPEC' but then had to change to 'XSPEC'). While the ticker is of secondary importance, please note that our brand is not. SPECTRE stands for Speculative Tokenised Trading Exchange and we will not be rebranding despite us being openly threatened. As for the some of the posts above, unfortunately the level of inaccuracy is high.  To start with, the structure of the indicated company is presented in a misleading way. This is the structure of a legitimate, professional company that acts as a cost centre in a corporate structure and has - As director the CEO of the company - As Secretary, a licenced and accredited company offering fiducieri services under the UK law, which is what the name itself indicates:  ""Fiduci - corp"" (UK) Services. Therefore having 110 clients, means that they are actually good at what they do.  As per the fact that there are 0 filings, this is a lie, as a simple search showcases this: https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/08245873/filing-history  Last but not least, there is nothing wrong with having the registrants of a domain hidden. www.spectreproject.io's registrants are hidden as well. In case of spectre.ai, for which we are doing the ICO, this is not hidden, for the purposes of transparency.  We hope this clarifies the situation. As a team we have a strong and transparent foundation and our goal is to eliminate broker fraud from the financial industry and bring transparency and fairness back into the forefront.    We urge spectrecoin to focus on delivering to their investors the targets they promised during their ICO rather than defaming and threatening projects that happen to have similar names and solve an entirely different problem.

Please direct all questions to Spectre.ai.team                SPECTRE is the world’s first broker-less financial trading platform with an embedded, decentralised liquidity pool. Like traditional trading, clients are trading against SPECTRE’s balance sheet (also known as the ‘liquidity pool’), however this pool is initially capitalised and owned by ICO (initial coin offering) investors. In other words, SPECTRE’s liquidity pool is owned by token holders who initially invest in the ICO and therefore own a part of SPECTRE’s profitability, into perpetuity. Tokens are publicly traded on all major crypto-currency exchanges and thus can be held by anyone.   In this broker-less model, SPECTRE’s liquidity pool is completely decentralised and the conflict of interest problem is eradicated (Exhibit B). The trading process at SPECTRE works as follows; the retail trader signs up to the website but deposits nothing. Instead they simply open a crypto-wallet on the website and send funds to that address (this process is verified and governed by the Ethereum blockchain and so, is trust-less and secure).  Major off-site crypto-wallets can be connected to this wallet as well. This ensures that funds cannot be accessed or handled by SPECTRE employees or anyone apart from the trader him/herself.     When a trader opens a trade (long or short) for a specified duration, the price of the asset they have wagered on, is monitored by a live, verifiable price feed from multiple audited financial sources such as Oanda. The eventual outcome (win or loss) is determined when the trade expires, by comparing the price of the underlying asset upon expiry, with that upon entry. If the trader has lost the trade, their wallet is automatically debited for the amount wagered and SPECTRE’s liquidity pool is credited, net of 2% trade fees which are paid directly to SPECTRE’s operational expenses and 2% dividend, which is paid out to SPECTRE’s dividend-token holders (not utility-token holders, who have a different set of rights as explained later).  The remaining 96% of the trader’s loss, goes directly to expanding SPECTRE’s liquidity pool. If, on the other hand, the trader won, he/she receives an instant 75% ROI (return on investment) and SPECTRE’s liquidity pool is debited for that amount. Again, in this instance where the trader has won their trade, a 2% operational fee is paid to SPECTRE and 2%, to the SPECTRE token holder as dividend. Token holders do not face any losses because of this pay-out to the winning trader. This way, SPECTRE and token holder profits are not driven just by losses but instead by overall volumes. Note that the payout can, in certain instances, be as high as 93%, depending on volumes in the system at the time. This entire process is governed by a smart contract built on the Ethereum blockchain and cannot be tampered with through human intervention.  The question arises; how can token holders in SPECTRE be comforted that it’s ability to pay dividends will remain and/or grow? This is described next, in the perpetual liquidity model.    As eluded to earlier, SPECTRE will have two types of tokens in issue; each separately traded on different exchanges, in order to be compliant with ever-changing regulations and cater to different types of investors. As for the dividend-token, SPECTRE pays out normal dividends and special dividends to dividend-token holders. Normal dividends, as described earlier, are paid as a 2% volume fee on trader’s wins or losses in the system, typically at the end of each month. Whether trades are generated on SPECTRE or other D-Apps connected to the liquidity pool, is not relevant from the token holder’s perspective. The more trades that are taken across the entire ecosystem, the more dividends that are paid out. So, a growing number of users on the platform (either directly on SPECTRE or other integrated D-Apps) will mathematically translate to higher volumes traded, resulting in perpetual growth in dividends to token holders. Special dividends, however, are paid out at the end of the year and only occur if SPECTRE’s liquidity pool (which directly grows when traders lose) has grown above a predetermined threshold. This threshold is detailed in the ‘Market Opportunity’ section later.  The average win rate of inexperienced traders is around 35-50%.6 Experienced traders, however, who spend time in learning technical or fundamental analysis in order to gain an edge and be able to beat the market, can at times obtain a 60-70% win rate, although emotions and greed tend to get the better of them, thus suppressing their win-rates below 60%, over time.7 Since SPECTRE’s liquidity pool pays out 75% on winning trades (and as high as 93% in certain conditions) but keeps 96% of all losses, traders on average need to maintain at-least a 57% win-rate in order to break-even. This is difficult for the masses to achieve and therefore, average win rates in the system are likely to hover under 48-53%, resulting in perpetual growth in SPECTRE’S liquidity pool and contractually, the size of special dividend payment to token holders (Exhibits C & F).  This makes the SPECTRE token an industry first, namely one that offers a perpetual dividend stream driven by various avenues of growth, albeit on a fixed token supply, meaning that the value of the token must increase over time, from a mathematical standpoint (Exhibit C). As for SPECTRe’s utility-token, this does not pay financial dividends, however, it gives vital in-platform privileges to traders which increases their chances of capital gain through time. These privileges are:  ▶ 1-5% higher trade pay outs ▶ All trade expiries on smart option contracts ▶ All assets (not just a few per asset class) ▶ All trade indicators (not just the ones found in the MVP) ▶ Exotic trade types (smart option contracts such as knock-in-knock-outs, barriers, ladders and more) ▶ Spectre Financial Education Academy (SpecED)  What further pushes the utility-token’s value over time is the token-buyback-program. SPECTRE’s team will be using 3% of fees generated on the system to purchase SPECTRE utility-tokens as part of a wider token-buyback-program. No more than 15% of outstanding supply will be purchased. (Exhibit C).   When comparing the SPECTRE model to the current, defunct broker model, which benefits only from client losses, does not pay dividends, is centralised and is deeply riddled with conflict of interest, it becomes evident which model offers the safest trading environment for traders.   Lastly, SPECTRE, despite its name, is not an exchange in the classic sense in that it’s liquidity pool acts as the counterparty to all trades. This, in our view, is advantageous when compared to traditional prediction markets on the blockchain as these have no liquidity pools and are dependent on a large volume of users in order for traders to be able to enter and exit trades in a highly liquid fashion. SPECTRE’s model, by comparison, works with as little as 1 user or millions of users. Over time, as the SPECTRE user-base crosses a few thousand active traders, it may be possible for the SPECTRE’s conditional liquidity model (CLM) algorithm to match most if not all trades perfectly and thus truly become an ‘exchange’ in the classic sense; until then, the perpetual liquidity model serves the purpose rather efficiently. We discuss this and balance sheet/liquidity pool protection, next.    SPECTRE sets a new standard for transparency in the retail trading industry; not least because it removes the broker out of the equation, but also because all traders can see the real-time value of SPECTRE’s liquidity pool and subsequent fluctuations therein along with pay-outs to tokens holders, at all times. Unlike most conventional trading platforms designed by technology companies like Spot Option (which powers 65% of all digital option trading platforms globally), Metaquotes Software Corp (creator of Mt4/Mt5, which is used by over 70% of all FX traders)8 which show little to no analytics depicting a traders win-rate, strengths, weaknesses and other important statistics, SPECTRE’s trading platform comes embedded with emotion control, risk management, trade setup identification, deep trader analytics, trader chat and on-board education to help traders gain an edge on the markets (Exhibit E).     As part of SPECTRE’s trader protection initiative, neither SPECTRE or any of its employees have access to the trader’s wallet (known onsite as the private escrow). Therefore, all withdrawals are instant, free of classic broker intervention tactics and paid out without any fees subtracted. As all transactions in SPECTRE are governed by Ethereum smart contracts resting on the public blockchain, no human intervention is possible. Owing to the aforementioned platform advantages along with the broker-less model SPECTRE introduces to the sector, the market opportunity for both traders and ICO investors alike, is rather significant. This is quantified in greater detail next.    The retail FX trading industry is worth around $81 trillion every year (or around $2-300bn per day in turnover).  This represents just c.3-6% of the wider FX trading market.9 It is served by a global 4 million strong retail trader user-base.10 As for the digital or binary options industry, this is estimated to be around $30bn per year in volumes (c. $2-3bn in deposits), served by an estimated 200,000 retail traders around the world.11 Owing to the increasing level of fraud, volumes in the industry are under attack at the time of writing.  SPECTRE upon launch will immediately tap and disrupt the latter. Owing to its structural advantages over the classic, defunct broker model, it is likely to gain significant market share and help increase the allure of digital options over the world. This itself can result in a shift; whereby classic FX traders enter the world of digital options (now ‘smart options’) as it offers a simpler, quicker and equally safe way of trading the financial markets.  However, the aim of SPECTRE’s management team is to enhance functionality over the medium-term, such that SPECTRE also allows the physical buying and selling of FX and equities, by accessing the global liquidity pool which, owing to continued progress by the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), will be repurposed for the blockchain where Ethereum can be used as a settlement layer. In other words, SPECTRE’s goal is to ultimately disrupt classic retail FX and equities trading where many brokers still trade actively against clients, but will first disrupt digital options, where broker fraud is holding the entire industry hostage and arresting the growth of what can be a multi-billion-dollar asset class.     In our dynamic forecasts model (which is accessible on www.spectre.ai), we provide three scenarios; the base case, bull case and bear case. The assumptions detailed in the base case will form the basis of the discussion here. This entails purchasing smaller brokerages looking to exit, two of which we have already run due-diligence on and received indicative fair valuation ranges for (c. $0.1-0.3m range cumulative). Partially owing to these bolt-on acquisitions, we forecast SPECTRE to capture 3,000 traders by the end of year 1. By year 5, we expect to have captured 45,900 traders, implying a digital options market share of around 23% on a volume basis. We forecast SPECTRE’s balance sheet or liquidity pool (after all fees and dividends paid to SPECTRE and dividend-token holders) to grow by 20% in year 1 to around $2.4m. By year 5, we forecast the pool to have grown to $10.5m (Exhibit F). It is worth noting should the management team decide to not pursue bolt-on acquisitions post ICO, then the focus will be on organic growth but this would mean that forecasts get pushed out by a year.   As for SPECTRE fees, which are set at 2% on all trades, we forecast fee income of $1.6m in year 1 and $24.2m by year 5. Our forecasts translate to a client life-time-value (LTV) of around $800-900, in-line with current brokerage data received. Once clients, in our view, see that SPECTRE is by far the safest way to trade digital options and FX, we forecast a dramatic rise in LTVs, although we have not modelled for this explicitly in our forecasts. It is worth noting that in addition to SPECTRE earning fee income by charging a 2% trade transaction fee, SPECTRE also receives a special dividend (along with token holders as highlighted earlier) at the end of each year. The mechanics of this are described next.  ▶ Dividends, Special Dividends and Token Buyback Program   We forecast combined dividends (eg. normal and special dividends) to dividend-token holders of $4.1m to be paid out in year 1 (or $0.06/token) translating to a projected token-yield of 41%. By year 5, we forecast total dividend payments per year to reach $64.2m (or $0.96/token), resulting in an annual 78% forecasted token-yield for ICO token investors. This compares to a paltry 1-5% dividend yield paid on tech stocks across the globe. As mentioned earlier, special dividends in the system are paid at the end of the year and only when the liquidity pool has experienced growth above a set threshold. If indeed pool growth exceeds pre-set, end-of-year targets at SPECTRE, any excess growth above these targets is going to be paid out at a 70/30 pari-passu basis to token holders and SPECTRE management, respectively. The benchmark level, also known as the hurdle rate, in terms of annual balance sheet growth, starts at 20% and expands to 50% over time. This means that should the SPECTRE liquidity pool grow more than 20%-50% in any given year, the excess growth in percentage will be paid out as special dividend.  As dividend-token supply will be strictly capped, this means that the absolute value of dividend per token may continue to rise, making the token itself a promising riskadjusted return investment opportunity, in our view. The SPECTRE team will also, from time to time, use 3% of SPECTRE fees/profits to buy back SPECTRE’s utility-tokens (no more than 15% of listed tokens). This further serves to increase utility-token price for holders, over time. At the time of writing (2017), the ICO-based fund-raising process may be in somewhat of a temporary bubble with many projects raising large amounts of funding but not having any working products or those that are generating return for shareholders. Tokens that pay out yield or whose engine is driven by the lucrative financial trading industry, give, in our view, token investors a certain degree of “bubble protection” in that the SPECTRE tokens are likely to outperform many others during volatile markets (Exhibit C).  As for pay-outs to traders trading on SPECTRE, we forecast a total of $30.9m paid out as wins in year 1 on the back of a somewhat conservative 52% win-rate assumption (data from major leading brokerages at present shows a 50% win-rate only). By year 5, this figure would have expanded to $472.6m. This underlines that despite SPECTRE’s liquidity pool and dividends to token holders forecasted to grow, substantial sums of money will be paid out to traders who can beat the market, in a provably fair and transparent manner.  We next discuss competition and its potential impact on our projected growth trajectory.    Existing brokerages that are powered by online trading platforms such as Spot Option, London listed Techfinancials, Tradesmarter and Panda tend to power the digital options market. None of these have decentralised liquidity pools or tokenized balance sheets as offered by SPECTRE. While CFTC regulated NADEX does allow for the exchange of offsetting digital/binary option trades by matching traders, liquidity issues do reduce the trading experience and funds are ultimately controlled by the broker. As for the FX market, Metaquotes Corporation offers most brokerages their MT4/MT5 based trading platforms which allow traders to access the global liquidity pool. None of these platforms, however, have any trader protection measures in place, as SPECTRE does (Exhibit G: Full competition matrix accessible on www.spectre.ai).   As for recently listed prediction market platforms such as Augur and Gnosis, these are exchanges that match bets on any market that users wish to add to the platform. Users are required to offer their own liquidity initially, in hope that other traders join and play. In our view, this is a less efficient and highly user-growth dependent model, when compared to SPECTRE. As these aren’t direct competitors, we have left them off the competition matrix in Exhibit G. Virtual asset platforms such as PRISM do have a digital element to them and are included under ‘exchanges’ in Exhibit G. In our view, SPECTRE knock-offs with slight variations will be built on the blockchain eventually, however, the size of the liquidity pool and quality of the trading platform will dictate who remains in pole position. SPECTRE’s first mover advantage and significantly ahead-of-the-curve trading platform should allow it to lead the pack, in our view.   However, since SPECTRE is disrupting the business models of many unscrupulous brokers, we do expect certain retaliation such as smear campaigns, DDOs attempts and other online measures. As a result, the group is spending significantly on state of the art online DDOS protection and other pre-emptive measures.   Innovation, in our view, is a key component of staying ahead as well. Therefore, as shown later in the roadmap, SPECTRE’s management team will be adding new asset classes; starting off with more currencies and later expanding to equities, commodities, bonds, sports (where applicable) and other non-random assets. Additionally, more trade types such as barrier trades, ladders and other exotic options will be added, thereby dramatically widening the scope of what is offered on the platform. We discuss this, along with execution and our roadmap, next.     SPECTRE is forecasted to complete its ICO in Q4 2017. In stage 1, SPECTRE (which is already live in alpha mode and can be tested by any trader in the world in demo money mode prior to the ICO), will be re-purposed and heavily security tested for the Ethereum blockchain with an estimated launch in end Q1 2018. It will debut as the world’s first broker-less financial trading platform with an embedded, decentralised liquidity pool focusing on currencies. If the ICO funding target is met, this will mean that upon launch, SPECTRE’s liquidity pool will be around $5,000,000 (if not higher, depending on potential token over-subscription by investors).     Stage 2 will commence in Q2 2018, whereby SPECTRE’s balance sheet would have expanded allowing for more asset and trade types to be added. Specifically, the management team will expand the array of currencies to trade on and add new nonrandom assets such as stocks, along with the addition of commodities such as gold, silver, platinum and others. In addition, after a feasibility study, SPECTRE is likely to add a new asset class known as ULC CFDs (unlevered and capped contracts for difference). This this is a hybrid between a smart option and traditional CFD. In tandem, the management will apply to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) of UK, with the view to acquire a European Union MIFID FCA broker/dealer license in London, UK.  Other regulatory regimes may be sought as well. This process will be incumbent on how quickly the FCA transitions from simply providing a blockchain-based developer sandbox to a detailed regulatory framework for blockchain based trading systems such as SPECTRE. The SPECTRE team is engineering the platform on the blockchain such that it can theoretically transmit all transaction metadata instantaneously to regulatory, purpose-built blockchains such as those being engineered by UCL and the London School of Economics under project BARAC (accessible on https://cryptoinsider.com/36-million-funding-towards-new-blockchain-projects-uk/) for reporting purposes.   Stage 3, to commence in Q3 2018, is dependent on the progress major investment banks have made as part of their own development of settlement layers for FX and equities contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. If they have progressed their technology to this stage, then SPECTRE’s management team will be able to repurpose the platform to connect with major liquidity providers, giving traders the ability to not only bet on the direction of markets (which they do in digital options) but also actually buy and sell the underlying, speculatively. This includes crypto-currency exchanges as well. Finally, we will give the ability for users to add new trade types and asset markets (including sports betting), not too dissimilar to Augur or Gnosis, the prediction market platforms, albeit with the large liquidity pool of SPECTRE, backing it.     During stage 4 which is Q1-Q2 2019, we will be able to not only introduce order matching capabilities (e.g. the system can find counterparty trades amongst traders themselves instead of making SPECTRE’s balance sheet the counterparty), but a D-App Store, which fosters open-source development of a range of financial and sports betting decentralised applications which ‘plug-in’ to the SPECTRE liquidity pool.   During all stages in the roadmap, the management team will be spending the funds required to ensure capacity constraints or security concerns do not compromise the trading experience (such as DDOS attacks). As for the deployment of ICO proceeds, 20- 50% (depending on funds raised) will go directly towards the tokenized liquidity pool, therefore capitalising SPECTRE with ample liquidity. The research and business development spend, on which the remainder of funds will be spent, will be conducted over  c. 3 year period and will cover the following line items:    ▶ TEAM   SPECTRE’s team consists of industry veterans, many of which who have direct research, trading and banking experience at J.P Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank. As for blockchain and cryptography know-how, the team has partnered with veterans in this space to help with the construction of smart contracts, platform re-purposing and token audit phases. As for education, most staff members are educated at the London School of Economics holding bachelors and masters degrees and our more senior, advisory board, consists of Harvard MBA graduates with direct fin-tech/ad-tech experience having started their own companies from scratch, straight through to IPO. Detailed profiles of the core management team can be accessed here: www.spectre.ai/team     ▶ REGULATION   SPECTRE’s team has carefully evaluated short and long term implications of its dividend-paying tokenised balance sheet model and expects the dividend-token to be treated as a security in most jurisdictions. Its utility-token, however, would not be treated as a security as it carries no financial rewards or rights. As a result, the two would be listed on different exchanges and issued by different corporate entities for legal reasons. Exchanges that welcome dividend-tokens would house SPECTRE’s dividend-tokens and the larger exchanges in the U.S who explicitly do not welcome dividend-tokens, would list SPECTRE’s utility-token.  As for the regulation of blockchain based financial trading platforms, major jurisdictions are still forming their official regulatory framework, guidelines and acts which will govern financial technology platforms on blockchains such as Ethereum. This process could take years and we do not believe that waiting until regulation ‘catches up’ is the wise option. After having carefully evaluated the domicile and regulatory license implications and costs of the following jurisdictions; Switzerland, Singapore, United Kingdom, Estonia, Gibraltar, BVI, Cayman, Cyprus, Malta and Vanuatu, we have decided to incorporate in BVI to conduct the ICO and perform SPECTRE operations without intervention or risk of shut-down. A license will be filed for immediately after the raise (with an estimated grant period of 12 weeks) such that when SPECTRE’s platform comes out of beta in early 2018, it is fully regulated. As mentioned earlier, the long-term intention is to obtain a regulatory investment and dealing license in an EU jurisdiction or preferably with the FCA, UK and therefore as and when a proper regulatory framework for blockchain-based financial trading platform governance is ready, SPECTRE’s team will apply for this and ‘on-shore’ SPECTREs operations.  While the SPECTRE token pre and public sale along with the platform, will not be open to U.S citizens, once the group has secured an FCA license, it will attempt to open a discussion with the SEC of the U.S such that like NADEX, it can obtain CFTC based financial regulation and open the tokens and platform for U.S investors as well.     ▶ RISKS While the management team takes all measures to reduce risk to a minimum, the following risks can impact the long-term viability of SPECTRE:   ▶ A very small SPECTRE balance sheet (under $200,000) owing to an undersubscribed ICO, could result in trade caps and trade volume caps being placed and slower user adoption and growth of the liquidity pool.     ▶ While highly improbable, sustained high win-rates by traders en masse, could deplete liquidity to an extent such that trade caps and trade volume caps need to be activated, to ensure SPECTRE’s balance sheet is protected. This has no direct impact on tokens, only that special dividends won’t be paid until it starts to grow again up and above the pre-set threshold targets.   ▶ While Ethereum’s smart contract features are well suited for SPECTRE’s balance sheet dividend pay-out model, viral growth in the platform could mean millions of transactions being processed on the public blockchain. This may result in delays to transaction processing (not trade outcomes, however, as this is based on trade entry and exit time stamps). Should this become a significant issue, the management along with token holders may decide on migrating to an Ethereum based side-chain in order to ensure smooth continuity of transactions.   ▶ While prior to ICO, SPECTRE’s entire code will be subject to multiple audits by reputable blockchain code auditors (and findings published on the website), errors may be overlooked resulting in system crashes and downtime.   ▶ SPECTRE significantly disrupts a large digital options and FX industry, rendering a lot of its platform providers and brokers irrelevant. This could result in competition driven DDOS attacks and smear campaigns. While the management will invest in state-of-the-art DDOS cloud-flare protection services to mitigate these attacks, there is always a risk that downtime could occur.   ▶ SPECTRE’s liquidity pool and trades are denominated in the Ether (ETH) currency. A sharp drop or rise in the value of ETH, relative to fiat currencies, could increase or decrease returns for traders on a currency translation basis. To mitigate against this, the SPECTRE management team will hold backup liquidity (as part of the primary liquidity pool) in U.S Dollar denominations in escrow accounts to ensure the value of the liquidity pool is protected against heavy gyrations in the price of Ethereum. As for FX translation risk on the trader’s side, frequent withdrawals can ‘lock-in’ favourable exchange rates, to a certain degree. Finally, the group will explore accessing APIs of services such as Tether (built on the OMNI protocol) to allow for fiat-currency denominated trading.
