If that happens market cap will rise tremendously and with it, all altcoins will rise also. So that makes TBT tokens at the moment, one of the best investment opportunities with very low risk as by investing even just 100$, they can turn into 10 000$ just for one year and what makes it even better is that we already have the first version of our product released and working wheres, there are other cryptocurrencies which have a lot bigger price and no product nor nothing to back it up.  So to sum the things up by taking into account the price for 1TBT is 0.008$ which is less than 1 cent this will put the project to an average market cap of 4 000 000$ which will rank us somewhere at the place of 600th in cryptocurrency ranking table. So even by just entering top 200 cryptocurrencies, you will have 25x ROI and, if we enter top 50 which is our target for 2018 you will have 150x ROI.

The supply stays the same - 500 000 000 TBT. For the bounty campaign, we will release our emergency supply which 10 000 000 TBT and the 5 000 000 TBT from the marketing supply.

For all the investors already purchased on the previous rates will be compensated immediately after the new rates are applied! Bounty subscribers will also transition to the new rates accordingly.
