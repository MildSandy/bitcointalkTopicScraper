New Hardware cryptocurrency wallet âš¡âš¡,"   I also give you a quote from whitepaper. One of the important problems associated with the management of cryptocurrencies and tokens is facilitating exchange, making it safe and rapid. There is not much attention paid to this question, however, there are those risks related to necessity to entrust financial assets and private information to a third party. XZEN wallet eliminates that problem by organizing an automatic decentralized exchange, which does not require the transfer of private data and which can be used directly by the client within inside wallet. It is planned to implement that decision through the integration of third-party reliable services, such as ShapeShift.  Quote from: Dasengineer on November 15, 2017, 06:20:32 PM I like how wallet made. Very nice design and indeed it looks very friendly. Looks much better then this 8bits trezors and ledgers. I think XZEN is the future of hardware wallets other ones is already past.  We are really glad that you like the design, but still here the main functionality of the device itself. But the design is good too   Thank you all for your opinions. It's good that you are with us in the same boat, guys.

A hardware wallet that you can use to manage and store cryptocurrencies. Not just that it can also store all kinds of bank cards. Moreover, I like that your mission is to make cryptocurrencies affordable for people. At the moment, cryptocurrencies are not understood fully by people from all walks of life. I think a lot of people are apprehensive about it. To have an app plus a hardware wallet and a wristband is certainly a big step up to a lot of other projects out there. I truly hope that this project will be a big success. Iâ€™ll definitely be following how this project will turn out.  You are right, now a crypto currency is available to a limited number of people. Many do not understand why and why it is needed. The purse from the XZEN team can change this. Thanks for the support.",False
