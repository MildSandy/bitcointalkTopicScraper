Sharpay development update: added email address verification, removed RenRen social network from direct sharing, fixed an error in merging Line accounts, fixed an error in updating system version, etc.  Even though we released different new functions not so long ago, we do not stop developing and improving our system. There are some changes and improvements we made.  1) Added email address verification. Now, every user needs to confirm his email address (by email or social network) after registration. If he has not confirmed his email address, he will get a message when he logs into Sharpay and he will not be able to use his account. We added the email address verification to prevent botnet and fake accounts.  In creating the email verification, we considered three different proposals and we finally picked the following. If a user registers an account by email, our system will display a message with a request to confirm his email address. System will show a link for resending confirmation email once a day. When the user logs in through his social network which uses the same email address, our system will confirm the email address automatically.  2) Removed Chinese social network RenRen from direct sharing. The popularity of RenRen has dropped significantly over the past few years, also it did not give much technical support to our Sharpay development. We have therefore deactivated and removed RenRen social network from our sharing buttons, and focus on WeChat and Weibo in the China market.  3) Fixed an error in merging Line accounts. If a user used Line to log into his account and that Line account was already connected to other Sharpay account, an error would occur and he could not log into his Sharpay account. We found the error and fixed the account merging function.  4) Fixed an error in updating system version. There was an error when updating our system version, the software failed to complete the update and remained in the update status. We had to urgently deploy a duplicate instance to restore the normal operation of our system.  5) Fixed User Guide for small screen sizes. After we released the new User Guide feature, we discovered that it would not display correctly in small screen sizes. The animation and description would slightly shift. We fixed the spacing and style values for all screen sizes.  6) Disabled the request of number of friends on Facebook. Due to the removal of Facebook access to users‚Äô friends, we have disabled the request of getting such data when users authorize and connect their Facebook accounts to Sharpay.  7) Created internal notification of incoming transactions. We created internal notification in our Admin panel for incoming transactions. The transactions are buying, depositing, withdrawing transactions.  In Sharing We Trust! Sharpay.io Team",False

Let us tell you some of the tasks we have completed.  1) Studied TON blockchain for integration. For the TON blockchain, we raised a node in Testnet that gives TON and its architecture, and we studied the possibilities of integration. We are considering to create our work-chain with proper transaction rules, we will test different blockchain platforms and choose the most suitable one. We will tell you more about the TON blockchain integration and its results in special news.  2) Studied and prepared the integration of BNB tokens of the Binance Chain. We aim to add more tokens for webmasters to reward users for sharing content. Binance has a very good documentation and a ready SDK for us to test our idea. It is very helpful for us to study to possibilities of rewarding users with BNB token and all tokens from Binance Chain. We will announce the progress and results in special news.  3) Improved Google Analytics to get detailed statistics on website activity. In order to gather detailed statistical data of websites which installed our Sharpay buttons, we have improved the Google Analytics (GA). We changed a little bit in our script, and GA will now get the website‚Äôs button activity when loading the script.  4) Refined UI and added more social networks in social network settings. In the social networks setting, we have improved the UI and added more popular social networks, for example, Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, Viber, etc. Webmasters can now select more favorite social networks for their own Sharpay buttons.  5) Improved social networks display order for direct share button installation. We have improved the order of social networks in the direct share button installation setting. Webmasters can review the order and how the buttons look like in the preview window.  6) Removed fee when withdrawing deposit nature tokens. Recently, we released the new wallet features, however, the withdrawal fee should not be included if users buy tokens from us or deposit tokens to his Sharpay account. We noticed this misunderstanding and corrected it by removing the fee in certain cases. 10% withdrawal fee is only applicable if users earn their tokens from sharing website content and completing bounty tasks.  7) Fixed Sharpay‚Äôs website display in Safari for iOS and MacOS. The widgets on our official website were not displayed correctly in Safari. We checked and fixed the JavaScript to change the style values.  8 ) Optimized the number of requests to CMC.

Sharpay.io is proud to announce that new smart direct share buttons with social media priority features are now available to all webmasters.  We analyzed and studied different sharing cases and sharing behavior. We found out that the sequence and the availability of different social networks directly influence user‚Äôs intention to share. If a user who reads interesting content sees his favorite social network in the first place among others in sharing buttons, the probability of sharing and the frequency of sharing increase.  We took this into account and made our Sharpay share buttons smart. We added the smart priority element on our direct share buttons. Now, if your website has installed Sharpay direct share buttons, the display order of different social networks will always be rebuilt in a row for each user of your site.  The smart direct share buttons work as follows:  1) First, we get and record user‚Äôs sharing data and behavior in our database, for example, user‚Äôs region, sharing history, social network preference.  2) Then, we use our social network priority functions to determine and re-sort the direct share buttons display order for each user.  3) We store the social network priority cache in localStorage to avoid making extra requests to our servers.  4) Every time the user interacts with any of our share buttons, our system will update the cache.

Recently, we have added a new feature to reward users for completing bounty tasks within the system (filling out a profile, connecting social network accounts, and others). We understood that the new way of earning token bonuses can be used for cheating. Therefore, we have updated an algorithm for calculating bonuses for user tasks in our activity monitoring system.  More than a month after the release of bounty tasks, everything was fine and worked as it should. But on July 1, the monitoring system sent a notification that one of the users received bonuses more than the limit. We raised the system logs for this user and began to analyze them. The analysis helped us restore all user actions and find out how he could get an additional bonus.  We would like to clarify the technical feature that is embedded in the system. Users are able to create accounts in Sharpay using social networks. For example, a user can create a Sharpay account via Facebook using his laptop, and also create another account via Telegram using smartphone. Thus, the same user will have two different accounts. His will have two different token balances, and this is a very inconvenient for him to manage two different accounts.  To solve this situation in Sharpay there is a system of merging accounts. When linking a social network profile to a Sharpay account, it checks for the presence of this profile in other accounts. And if it finds an intersection, it merges them into one common account, where all social user accounts and total balance will be combined together. The algorithm for merging accounts turned out to be problematic for the bounty tasks.  Let us return to the user who found this loophole in our system.  He created a main account using email and password login. Then, he created a second account using a social network and completed several bounty tasks for earning tokens. After that, he logged into his main account and linked the same social network profile that he used for the second account. Our system detected it and merged both accounts and balances together. The second account which completed the social network task was deleted because of the merging. He removed social network bindings from his main account. As a result, he was able to complete the task again by registering a new account via social networks and earn 370 S tokens more before we could stop him. In this bug, he could keep creating accounts using social networks, merging them together and disconnecting the social networks in the main account to loop the bounty task.  At the moment, we have made changes to the algorithm for merging accounts and the bonus for completing tasks is rewarded once. If the task was performed in both accounts, then during the transfer the bonus received in the second account will be subtracted from the transferred balance.  We strive to improve our system and pay great attention to security issues and protection against abuse. We are grateful to this user for his inquisitive mind and time spent. We not only did not reset tokens ‚Äúillegally‚Äù earned by him, but also in appreciation of his effort, we accrued to him an additional 1000 S tokens as a bug bounty reward.  We would like to ask all who are interested to help us in finding bugs and vulnerabilities in Sharpay. Any feedback helps us to become better and more convenient.  In Sharing We Trust!

Sharpay development update: added user‚Äôs completed tasks to Admin panel, a new function to send notification messages to individual users, improved account merging function, fixed audience settings error, etc.  Development requires continuous testing and improving. We have been developing Sharpay project for more years, added a lot of new functions and features. During the long development path, we keep reviewing and improving our system. There are some errors we fixed and improvements we made lately:  1) Added user‚Äôs completed tasks to Admin panel. We added the user‚Äôs completed tasks to our Admin panel, so we can easily check what bounty tasks the user has completed and speed up the checking when there are unpredictable errors.   2) Added function to send notification messages to individual users. Before adding this function, we used to contact and inform users by emails for different issues. Now, our Admins are able to send notification messages to individual users or to all users within the system, users can check the messages when they log into their Sharpay accounts.  3) Improved account merging function. We have mentioned about the issue regarding account merging function and bounty tasks before, we reviewed the merging function and changed the merging condition. After the improvement, the merging function will only consider active accounts and it will not transfer any disabled account balance when merging.   4) Fixed audience settings error. When a webmaster delegated project edit right to a user, the delegated user could not edit the audience settings and the system would show an error. We reviewed the audience setting page and fixed the code associated with the audience editing rights.   5) Fixed the email sending bug. There was a problem when sending emails via Amazon Simple Email Service. The problem would increase the connection timeout and pause before the second attempt to send an email to a user. We found the bug which caused the problem and fixed it.   We are speeding up our new interface development and very soon we will release it. The new interface has followed the 2019‚Äô UI / UX trend as we have mentioned before. The user panel has improved a lot and it is very user-friendly and stylish. Also, the new sharing window has completely changed and integrated with different new features. We are sure that it will bring our users the best sharing experience. Stay tuned!

Today, we would like to talk about how to make your Sharpay account more secure. The best way to secure your accounts is two-factor authentication (2FA). It is an important security tool in keeping accounts safer than simply using a password.  2FA adds a second step to logging into your Sharpay account, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to break in. Install Google Authenticator app on your smartphone and follow the below simple steps to set up 2FA:  1) Log into your Sharpay account. 2) In the top bar menu, go to ‚ÄúAccount Security‚Äù. 3) Click and activate ‚ÄúTwo-factor authentication check‚Äù, and you will see a QR code and a key. 4) Use your Google Authenticator application (GA) to scan and configure the QR code. You may manually add the key to your GA. 5) Type a recovery code word. 6) Enter a one-time password generated from GA to confirm your setting.  ‚ùóÔ∏è Remember the code word!

Sharpay.io is proud to introduce you our latest stylish upgraded sharing window and user panel designed with the 2019' UI / UX trends.   UI and UX are always changing, we keep improving our sharing window and Sharpay system to give you the best user experience. We worked for months and months, kept testing and trying, finally we chose the best framework.  Our latest sharing window and user panel are upgraded with the 2019' UI / UX trends, and we made lots of big impressive changes on how users share with our Sharpay share buttons and how users manage their accounts easily.  We not only optimize and maximize your user experience, but also let you decide how you want to share! We would like to tell you some key upgrades in our sharing window and user panel.   üî∏ 1) Additional modal design sharing window. Webmasters are able to choose to display the sharing window in modal effect in the button customization settings. A modal window is a javascript effect that displays on top of the current page. The main benefit of modal windows is that they avoid window pop-ups and additional page reloads. Seamless sharing in modal window brings all users perfect sharing experience!  üî∏ 2) Eye-catching interactive sharing animation and design. Every time you click on share, you will see an interactive animation modal window fade in and then slide down all the sharing choices for you. The top part of the modal window gives you a short description of the current page you are visiting, and you can see our Sharpay icon flipping with the token reward rolling under it. The S token reward is displayed in USD, and is synced with CoinMarketCap, that means you can always get the real time price calculated by CoinMarketCap. Now you are able to see what token rewards and how much you are going to get from sharing and from each visit!  We also added different toggle and hover effects. When you toggle different sharing options, they will show and hide with animation. When you hover over the text, it will be highlighted in our Sharpay orange color. The section body will be zoomed in when you hover over it, and zoomed out when you leave it.  Besides, we use the same animation and interface for our app.sharpay.io. We selected the best font and colors to use in our design. You may also see your token balance at the top is rolling with animation, the drop down menu is clean and clear. The overall interactive animation and the design are smart and attractive, which gives you a refreshing user interface!  üî∏ 3) Boundless sharing options. In the old sharing system, you could not choose what sharing methods you wanted and it was always decided by the websites. Before, we separated ""Simple sharing"" and ""Multisharing"". They were independent and connected to different social networks, and only the webmasters could decide how users share their website content.  In our new sharing window, we put all sharing methods together, and you are not restricted by the types of share buttons website installed. You are able to choose ""Direct sharing with rewards"", ""Multisharing with rewards"" or just copy the referral link for sharing with rewards. This gives you the freedom to share in your own way, and an opportunity to share website content to all your connected social networks!  üî∏ 4) User friendly and attractive user panel. The user panel has upgraded with new UI / UX design. The menu is on your left hand side, you can toggle and manage different sections. The homepage displays your account summary and bounty tasks. Everything has redesigned with distinctive colors and appearance. You can see that the information is displayed in details.  üî∏ 5) Neat smart card presentation. We dropped the old information framework and used smart card presentation especially for the bounty tasks and website projects. The smart card design gives you all clear information and action buttons. You can manage your website projects easily and tidily. Our system will also regularly display notifications, tips and new features for users in smart card format in user homepage and webmaster area.   üî∏ 6) Interactive and clear user guide. We have added user guides in different pages to explain different features and give instructions to users. You can find the ""User Guide"" button at the top of some pages like user dashboard and wallet. When you click on the ""User Guide"", it will pop up an interactive modal window to explain different features and sections.  We translated our system into 4 languages: English, Chinese, Korean and Russian. Unfortunately, the Korean translation is not good enough, because we do not have a good Korean translator. If you speak excellent Korean and English and you are willing to help us improve the Korean translation, please contact us and we will reward you with a large amount of S tokens for Korean translation as a bounty.  Try our new sharing interface and tell us what you think. We will keep improving our user sharing experience.

We noticed that after the release, many webmasters did not know that they could change the browser sharing window to modal sharing window for the convenience of users. We thought thoroughly and decided to make the automatic transition of all sites to use only modal sharing window.  Yesterday we made this mandatory update in our sharing system for all websites. We removed the option to choose between sharing window in browser window and modal window. Now you can see how modal sharing window looks by clicking on the Sharpay button installed on your website.  If you installed our share buttons in ""Static"" or ""Floating"" type, you will have a modal sharing window automatically. However, if you are using the ""Direct"" share button type, the sharing window will open in a new browser window, and lead you directly to the designated social media.

They can view the log for each project in ‚ÄúWebmaster Area‚Äù. The event log is very useful and important for them, they can track all the edits in the projects and recover changes if they want.   2) Enabled admin to view all project access rights. In order to monitor unknown errors in granting project management rights and accessing projects, we have created a list of granted projects in our system admin panel. This enable us to detect and fix the unknown project management errors quickly and easily.   3) Fixed regional domain verification for adding website projects. We discovered and fixed an error when adding regional domains. Regional domain names are in regional languages, so when users enter regional domain names, they will be converted into Punycode (a way to represent International Domain Names). We added Punycode method in our domain name verification, users are now able to add different regional domains to their website projects.   4) Changed the home page for account users. We changed the home page for Sharpay account users. After users log in their account on app.sharpay.io, they will see a new statistical chart showing their earned tokens with a detailed summary. Users are now able to see the summary of their earned tokens from sharing, conversions, and total number of tokens for deposit and withdrawal. For new account users, instead of showing users an empty chart with no values, it will give users instructions on how to install and use our Sharpay buttons.   5) Added new tables in our database for merging accounts. We added new tables in merging account method to record all account changes. We record both primary user account ID and secondary user account ID in the new tables when merging.   6) Added email notifications to users for granted project management rights. When webmasters grant project management rights and access to other users, an email notification will be sent to that user upon successful authorization.   7) Corrected bonus message in sharing window. We corrected the bonus message in sharing window when users have no connected social networks.   8 ) Added report caching on home page for account users. In order to speed up the loading of summary chart on home page for account users, we added caching function. It gives users a smoother experience.   In Sharing We Trust! Sharpay.io Team",False

Sharpay development update: corrected signup page redirection, added a list of authorized applications on user profile page, improved the security of comment section in the sharing window, improved sharing bonus checking, etc.  Today, we are going to tell you some of our finished development tasks. We increased the security of our Sharpay application, fixed some errors and added some verification functions.  1) Corrected signup page redirection after creating an account using a social network. We discovered that the URL parameters were ignored after creating an account using a social network via OAuth (for example, Cloudflare), the signup page would redirect users to the main page but not to the previous page. We corrected the redirection and users can continue on the previous page.  2) Added a list of authorized applications on user profile page. If users have connected and installed Sharpay‚Äôs Cloudflare app on their websites or other applications using OAuth 2.0 (an authorization framework), all the authorized apps will be listed on their ‚ÄúAccount Security‚Äù page. They can manage and revoke the authorization for each application or all at once.  3) Added a check for links when posting comments in the sharing window. We added a check for the presence of links that are without specifying scheme (without http / https) in the comments. This additional link check increases the security of the sharing window.  4) Improved the sharing bonus checking. For checking users with frequent sharing bonuses, we improved the checking method. We replaced the constant indicator with the number of connected social networks of that user in the consideration. We will freeze their sharing bonus and check the quality of their social network accounts, and only unfreeze their sharing bonus after the user passes the checking.  5) Set up email confirmation for deleting active web projects. If webmasters want to delete their active web projects which already have sharing or conversion activities, our system will send them a confirmation email to approve or decline the deletion. It can avoid deleting active working projects accidentally.  6) Set up email address verification for account registration. All users will need to verify their email addresses after signing up with their email addresses. Our system will send a verification email for the account registration.  7) Improved the storage structure of configuration files. We improved the storage structure of the configuration files for the convenience of our developers.  In Sharing We Trust! Sharpay.io Team",False

To check the token, our system would simply compare the current authentication token value and the recorded one in the database. However, if the web browsers updated the useragent, the check would fail and users would be logged out. To fix this, we changed the matching algorithm of useragent.   3) Fixed minimum token withdrawal bug. When updating token information from CMC, if the token value was very small, it would cause the rounding error and show 0 value. It would also cause the error in minimum withdrawal amount. We found the zero-division problem and fixed it.  4) Fixed conversion reward bug in floating buttons. We discovered a bug in a testing, the conversion reward accounting only worked for static buttons, but sometimes it did not work for floating buttons.

Sharpay development update: added user information in the project edit history, verification for redirection URLs, a check for connecting social network, a custom error to the user for handling FB page binding problem, cleaned inactive social networking bindings for preventing sharing error, etc.   We always focus on our project and keep improving our share buttons in order to give every user the best sharing experience. We announce development news to our community every week and here are some of the finished tasks:  1) Added user information in the project edit history. We added more information in the project edit history. Webmasters can view the editor‚Äôs IP address, country and browser information every time the editor makes changes in the project. They can get the edit log in ‚ÄúHistory‚Äù tab in the ‚ÄúManage project‚Äù section. The editor log is next to the username.   2) Added verification for redirection of URLs. For the ‚Äúback‚Äù parameter, we added URLs verification. It will check all URLs being redirected against allowed domains for various authorization schemes, for example, oauth, plugins, etc.   3) Added a check for connecting social network. We added a check to prevent connecting social networks multiple times to cheat and get social network task bonus. The bonus for connecting each social network can be obtained only once.   4) Added a custom error to user for handling FB page binding problem. When a user connects his Sharpay account to a Facebook page that had already connected, our system would ignore it and throw an exception. We have added a custom error for this problem.   5) Cleaned inactive social network bindings for preventing sharing error. We found some users had an active social network binding but it contained an empty value in the database. Because of that, the sharing did not work for him for that social network. In order to prevent this problem, we decided to delete and clean all old inactive social network bindings.   6) Added bounty task conversion metrics in Admin panel. For understanding what bounty tasks users completed the most, we added bounty task conversion metrics in our Admin panel. It can also tell us what bounty tasks we should add based on user activity.   7) Moved JavaScript code associated with init/hit to a separate module. We took out the duplicated code and moved init/hit to utils.js module for better performance.   8 ) Optimized the database resources. We modified the storage scheme for archiving log to optimize the database resources used.  9) Analyzed the APIs of all popular messengers. In order to understand the possibility of developing and adding our Sharpay sharing buttons to groups, chats and channels, we studied all popular messengers including KakaoTalk, WeChat, Viber, FB Messenger, VK Messenger, Whatsapp and Telegram. We will soon tell you in detail about our analysis and the possibility of such development.  10) Audit the entire Sharpay product code and refactoring planning. Over months and years of development of our product, its code has grown very large in size. We approached the need to do a large code audit in order to plan refactoring. We conducted such an audit and planned constant refactoring, we have already begun some tasks. The result of the audit will be published in a big article.  11) New 2019‚Äô UI and UX upgrade. In parallel with all development, we continue to work on the new 2019‚Äô UI / UX and soon we will upgrade our Sharpay user interface. Stay tuned!   In Sharing We Trust! Sharpay.io Team",False

As we have announced it before, we analysed all popular world messengers about the possibility of developing and adding our Sharpay sharing buttons to groups, chats and channels. Today, we would like to share with you our detailed analysis.  For each social network, this can be done only through the development of the bot, we studied their API and user cases.  1) Telegram. First of all, we analyzed Telegram, one of the most popular, fast-growing and promising instant messengers from a position of loyalty to cryptocurrencies. We studied their API and user cases for bots. A channel can have an unlimited number of subscribers. The bot can generate a unique link for each post, and let users to read, leave comments and share it. Result: possible, already developed, waiting for our release.  2) WeChat. We studied the API of WeChat and the capabilities of adding Sharpay share buttons bot to groups. WeChat allows users to create a group chat with up to 500 members. WeChat API does not have any direct support on adding Sharpay share buttons. However, WeChat shut down a 3rd party blockchain app in 2018, technically it is possible for us to develop our Sharpay sharing bot, but it will be impossible for implementation. Result: impossible to use, refuse to develop (as of June 2019).  3) KakaoTalk. We looked at the structure of KakaoTalk API. We studied this in the context of sharing and adding Sharpay share buttons. We found out some limitations of KakaoTalk. A public group chat can support up to 1500 users and a user can only create 10 public group chats. Only personal chats can use chat bots, and chat bots cannot be added to public group chats. Because of that we cannot apply the same Telegram scheme that we are developing to KakaoTalk. Thus, it does not allow us to develop a user-friendly sharing bot for KakaoTalk. Result: impossible to develop (as of June 2019).  4) VK Messenger. For VK Messenger, we found out that bots can be added to personal chats, communities or group chats. One group chat can have a maximum of 500 users. Chat bots support share buttons, but users can only use them at the chat menu level, no share buttons can be added to the messages shared in a group. Also, all posts shared in a group are limited to its group users, all chats are private within a group. Those restrictions do not allow us to make a full-featured bot for VK Messenger. Result: impossible to develop (as of June 2019).  5) Facebook Messenger. Chat bots only work in communicating with personal chats, and they cannot be added to group chats. One group chat can have a maximum of 250 users. A bot can send messages only via chat extensions, but the messages cannot add share buttons. There are no direct links for the posts shared in a group chat, therefore, users cannot comment or react to a post like Telegram. Also, the posts shared in a group chat are for its group users, it limits the ability to share posts to other users outside the group. Because of that, we cannot develop a good bot for Facebook Messenger. Result: impossible to develop (as of June 2019).  6) WhatsApp. Chat bot feature is only available to WhatsApp business accounts. A WhatsApp group chat can have a maximum number of 256 users. The chat bot can communicate with users in private messages and group chats. However, it is not possible to add our Sharpay share buttons to the messages. Result: impossible to develop (as of June 2019).  7) Viber. In Viber, there are two types of groups (public account and community) and the maximum number of participants of a group is 250. We can add a sharing bot to a public account, but public account is not for everyone. Since 2017, only large companies and popular personalities can open a public account. Everyone can open a community account, but bots cannot be added to a community as a member. Because not everyone can create a public account and community cannot add bot, we do not see any benefits to develop a sharing bot. Result: possible, but not relevant, refuse to develop (as of June 2019).  Summary: as of June 2019, only Telegram meets our development criteria for our sharing bot. Only for Telegram we can make a full-featured sharing bot with a user-friendly interface. We have already developed our Sharpay Telegram share bot, stay tuned and wait for the release!

Sharpay development update: standardized table names in our database, field names in all tables, replaced all empty and 0 values with null values for refactoring purposes, updated Linkedin API and fixed a sharing bug, etc.   Recently, we are working on our new 2019‚Äô UI / UX upgrade, but we will not stop improving our Sharpay share buttons. We would like to tell you some of our completed tasks:    1) Standardized table names in our database. First, we reviewed all the SQL command and the table names in our database. Then, we corrected and fixed all the table names. Since we have written a lot of codes during the development, we fixed more than 1,600 commands and codes.   2) Standardized field names in all tables. When we standardized the table names in our database, we also found and standardized all field names in all tables. For example, for all fields that contain ‚Äúusers‚Äù, ‚Äúuser‚Äù is shortened and standardized to ‚Äúu‚Äù.   3) Replaced all empty and 0 values with null values in our database. First, we made a small script to check and find all the columns which contained empty or 0 values. We found that at least 10 different tables (e.g. user account table, social media log table, sit conversion table) needed to be fixed. We checked and replaced all the empty and 0 values with null values for refactoring purposes.  4) Updated Linkedin API and fixed a sharing bug. Recently, Linkedin has updated their API and users were not able to share news via Linkedin. The new version of the API is significantly different from the old one, we had to study, rework and re-debug. We updated the Linkedin API to v2 version and fixed the sharing bug.  5) Adjusted the number of bonuses accrued upon sharing on social networks. We found a sharing bonus bug that occurred when sharing did not go through to the social networks. The bonus calculation did not reduce the sharing bonus even for failed sharing actions. We have added the bonus recalculation before generating the bonus transactions.  6) Corrected the project deletion error. If a website project has conversion events created, but the project is not active, there will be an error when the webmaster tries to delete the project. We fixed this error by removing the site related records for the project deletion.   7) Checked the output status of pending tokens. We found that some users had problems with their pending conversion bonuses, the pending conversion bonuses did not get approved after 24 hour. We fixed the user‚Äôs wallet for showing declined conversion bonuses.  In Sharing We Trust! Sharpay.io Team",False

Sharpay development update: fixed merging account crash, added Skype to direct sharing, SubReddit selection for binding Reddit account, fixed WeChat sharing error, extended sharing alert message etc.  Sharpay buttons sharing experience is strongly related to our development and of course it allows us to define our user journeys. We continuously improve our Sharpay buttons and regularly write news about it.  Let us tell you some of our completed development tasks:  1) Fixed merging account crash. We discovered an incomprehensible error in the logs that occurred during merge of accounts, the system was trying to connect accounts with itself. After we have analysed the code, the error was caused by a rare login situation. If a user who has a login session in the system and attempts to log in again, it will have such error. For example, a user opens the login page in two browser tabs and successively tries to log in to both. We decided to redirect the user to the main page when he performs the second login attempt.  We found a good fixation option to fix the bug. We had to substantially dig up and clean up the code in the controller methods which are responsible for the interaction (login, creating of a binding, merge) through social networks. As a result, this module has decreased by about 10% of total lines. We also added a couple of super-classes for social network classes in order to avoid duplication of the added code, and mainly, as a basis for future refactoring.  2) Added Skype to direct sharing. We have added Skype to direct sharing and now users are able to share website content to Skype. So far, users are able to share more than 20 different social networks using direct sharing, including Facebook, Twitter, WeChat, Telegram, Whatsapp, VK, Kakao Talk etc.  3) Added SubReddit selection for binding Reddit account. When users bind their Reddit account to app.sharpay.io, they are able to choose their SubReddit to share posts to. For existing users that have already binded their Reddit accounts and would like to change their sharing on Reddit, they could unpair it and bind their Reddit account again.  4) Fixed WeChat sharing error. Before when users shared to WeChat, the QR code was not generated properly and it did not work, we therefore have fixed the sharing error.  5) Extended sharing alert message description. When users get no bonus from sharing, it will give users a clearer message that the user‚Äôs social capital is too low and he can only receive tokens for each organic visit to the link he shared on his social networks.  6) Improved site domain unregistered error message. If the website was not registered in the domain list, users would not be able to share it to their social networks, and the system would throw a fatal error message. We took out the fatal error message, improved the error message UI and added the site domain unregistered error message. It is clearer for both users and webmasters.  7) Added a date filter in report. We have improved the UI and added a date filter button in the project‚Äôs report in Webmaster Area.  8 ) Improved direct sharing UX. If users want to share website content using direct share buttons to social networking applications (Viber, Facebook Messenger) that he has not installed, it will show users instructions to such application download pages.

We believe improving user experience by our sustained development attracts not only new button users, but also more new websites to install our Sharpay buttons.  We have completed some tasks for our back-end, for example:  1) Improved Simple Queue Service for handling different system tasks. Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables our system to handle different tasks. Before we used SQS only to manage our sharing tasks, but we have decided to use it to handle more different tasks for our future development. So, we had to improve our script for SQS and make it compatible in handling different function calls.   2) Implemented Simple Queue Service for sending emails. After we have improved our SQS script for handling different tasks, we added sending email function. We removed the old mailResend function and added SendMailTask in SQS script for handling system email queuing and sending.  3) Added email addresses from different social networks for system optimization. We have improved the social network login script, and it will get and save user‚Äôs email address from different social networks. One user account may have multiple linked social networks, and by saving and detecting their email addresses, we can avoid creating duplicate user accounts by linking them together and optimize user social network table and system functions, for example, mailing and login.  4) Added comment length restriction for sharing posts to Reddit. When users share posts to Reddit, the comment will be trimmed to 300 characters as restricted by Reddit. Before, if users shared posts to different social media including Reddit, and the comment length was longer than 300 characters, it would show a posting error.  5) Fixed getting traffic statistics from Google Analytics. We fixed the data reporting from Google Analytics, and now the webmaster report will display all views from users who clicked the website links.  6) Added caching of data obtained from Google Analytics. We added caching of data obtained from Google Analytics, and now we can add new cashes quickly without affecting the whole system, and the webmaster report load time is reduced by one third.  7) Created separate CSS file for social network icons. We have made a separate a separate CSS file for social network icons with background colors, made a separate button formatting class (size, rounding, etc).   8 ) Checked plugin compatibility with WordPress 5.1.

Promoting our Sharpay buttons worldwide is very important to us. We believe that with our partnerships in different countries and the expansion of cryptocurrency will definitely help us.  Does Sharpay have a way of measuring how valuable a particular share is? For example, if I share to 50,000 followers on twitter do I receive more tokens than someone who shares to 10 followers?  We are developing social power and targeting features. Our plan is to be able to calculate the social power of individual user based on their number of followers from different social media, and targeting bonus based on their demographic data, such as age group, interests, region.  The social power bonus is very simple. The more the followers/friends you have, the higher the bonus you will get. However, the social power bonus is like stamina, it will be decreased for each share and users will need to wait to restore it.  The targeting bonus aims to match users (target audience) with websites. Users can complete their profile (at their will, not compulsory) and they will be automatically included in the targeting bonus scheme. They will be able to get extra bonuses for sharing if they are in websites‚Äô target groups.  Do I receive more tokens if more people click on the link I shared?  Yes. If visitors click on your shared links (shared using Sharpay buttons), you will get a token reward for each unique and qualified visit. Basically, you will get one token reward per unique visit per day.  Token rewards from conversions (visits) will be frozen first, and our system will check if they are qualified or not. Within 24 hours, the frozen rewards will be released to users. We have developed a lot of measures to identify unique visit and fight against cheating.  In Sharing We Trust! Sharpay.io Team",False

Sharpay development update: set up confirmation method for conversion events, added create new project function to Sharpay plugin on Cloudflare, expanded logging when resending system emails, increased project deletion form‚Äôs security, etc.  We keep developing our Sharpay buttons in order to improve our system and your sharing experience. Here are some development tasks we have completed recently:  1) Set up confirmation method for conversion events. We considered Google Analytics Measurement Protocol as an example, and set up confirmation method for conversion events. When webmasters set up a conversion event, check and enable ‚ÄúRequires confirmation‚Äù, the conversion event will be confirmed on our server side. Our server will verify the conversion events and reward users conversion bonuses accordingly. A successful and valid conversion event flow is as follows:  A. A user shares website content on his social networks using Sharpay buttons. B. A visitor clicks on the link shared by that user. C. The visitor executes a conversion event (creating an order for example), and it will send us a request to verify. D. When the event is made and confirmed by the website (the order is made and paid), it will send us a confirmation request.  E. We will reward a conversion bonus to that user, if the event done by the visitor is verified.  For the conversion events and settings, you may read here: https://app.sharpay.io/index/events  2) Added create new project function to Sharpay plugin on Cloudflare. Before this update, webmasters needed to go app.sharpay.io to add their websites in order to use and link the Sharpay plugin on Cloudflare. Now webmasters are able to add different website projects to their Cloudflare Sharpay plugin without leaving Cloudflare, and select which project to link and run the Sharpay buttons.  3) Expanded logging when resending emails. We pulled the email sending error messages from the mail function and added some details in the logs in order to understand clearly the resending email reasons and errors. We also added email hashing function.  4) Increased the project deletion form‚Äôs security. We added a security code in the project deletion form to protect against cross site request forgery, and increased the form‚Äôs security.  5) Checked Mailru token update method. We checked the Mailru authorization token update method in the login script for Mailru. The script is responsible for checking login token validity, and we also improved the code for better performance.  6) Improved backend system tasks. We improved the performance of some backend system tasks.  And soon we will make an official release of our new site, in accordance with the 2019‚Äô UI / UX trends.  In Sharing We Trust!

Sharpay development update: added project management delegation function, domain name masking when shorten website links, conversion events to website statistical reports, notification messages for conversions only rewards, and fixed account recovery and password resetting messages.  Today we are going to share you some of our completed development tasks, and those tasks are mainly for webmasters. With the new functions, webmasters can monitor and manage their website projects easily with other delegated users.    Let‚Äôs see what they are:  1) Added project management delegation function. Webmasters are now able to delegate project management rights to other Sharpay users to manage and monitor their website projects. To do that, the person who wants to receive project management rights from a webmaster must also have an account on Sharpay (app.sharpay.io). Here are the steps to delegate project management rights by a webmaster:  a) go to the ‚ÄúWebmaster Area‚Äù; b) click ‚ÄúAccess‚Äù button in the website project; c) click ‚ÄúProvide access‚Äù; d) enter the email address of a Sharpay user account that you want to delegate rights to; e) choose the power of the rights, ‚ÄúAllow full access‚Äù, ‚ÄúAllow project editing‚Äù or ‚ÄúAllow access to reports‚Äù; f) click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù to finish.  You can change the project management rights of a delegated person anytime you want by switching on/off the toggle buttons. You can also delete a person that you no longer want him to access and manage your website projects.    With this update, webmasters can share their project management rights to their co-administrators. Webmasters can assign different tasks to their co-administrators, marketing team can understand and analyze user behavior with the access right to website statistical reports, and developers can handle and manage the technical side of things with the right to project editing. This can increase their productivity.  2) Added domain name masking function when shorten website links. Some websites might be blocked by social networks by misunderstanding, false reports or updated community rules, so users would not be able to share those website on their social networks. We added the domain name masking function when webmasters choose to shorten their website links. Webmasters can go to their website project, choose ‚ÄúShorten links via‚Äù in the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù tab to shorten and mask their website using different operators, for example, Bitly, Sharpay.  3) Added conversion events to website statistical reports. Before, there were only two types of rewards, ‚ÄúSharing‚Äù and ‚ÄúConversions‚Äù shown in website statistical reports, we separated and added ‚ÄúEvents‚Äù into the calculation. The ‚ÄúEvents‚Äù is the conversion events (https://app.sharpay.io/index/events) we recently added. After this update, webmasters are able to understand and control the rewards, especially monitor the ‚ÄúEvents‚Äù rewards.  4) Added notification messages for conversions only rewards. For websites that choose to reward users conversions only, users will get no token rewards on sharing. We added notification messages for users in sharing window, users now can check what types of rewards they will get. The reward type messages are placed next to the share action button, and also in the result window after sharing. Users will now understand clearly what types of rewards they will get.  5) Fixed account recovery and password resetting messages. We have fixed the account recovery and password resetting messages. The account recovery and password reset pages will display users successful email submission/change of password messages after executing.    In Sharing We Trust! Sharpay.io Team",False

Sharpay share buttons with blockchain rewards are reinventing the existing share buttons with distinctive development features. They are the future of effective social media marketing.   Recently we got words of support and some interesting questions from Bimmerhead, a Legendary member on BitcoinTalk. His questions were about how our Sharpay buttons work in sharing, as the answers are related to our future development, we would like to share them with you.  üî∏ Does Sharpay have a way of measuring how valuable a particular share is? For example, if I share to 50,000 followers on Twitter, do I receive more tokens than someone who shares to 10 followers? Do I receive more tokens if more people click on the link I shared?  First of all ‚Äî yes, if visitors click on your shared links (shared using Sharpay buttons), you will get a token reward for each organic visit. This feature is a working basic option for our system.  Moreover, we are developing social power and targeting features. Our plan is to be able to calculate the social power of individual user based on their number of followers from different social media, and targeting bonus based on their demographic data, such as age group, interests, region.  The social power bonus is very simple. The more the followers/friends you have, the higher the bonus you will get. However, it is like stamina, the social power bonus will be decreased for each share and users will need to wait to restore it.  The targeting bonus aims to match users (target audience) with websites. Users can complete their profile (at their will, not compulsory) and they will be automatically included in the targeting bonus scheme. They will be able to get extra bonuses for sharing if they are in websites‚Äô target groups.  For full questions and our answers, please visit our official BitcoinTalk topic: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2518528.msg50161486#msg50161486  If you have any questions regarding our development or you have some ideas to share with us, please do not hesitate to contact us (https://t.me/sharpay_admin).

Better, we ourselves will tell you firsthand how we are doing, so that there is no silence or conjectures, or even worse, you will listen to all sorts of haters. Therefore, we want to share with you some observations about the blockchain market in general and our results for the past period, in particular. Honesty is the best policy.  According to the results of the 4th quarter of 2018 and the 1st quarter of 2019, we can state that on the world market the breakthrough in popularization of cryptocurrency and blockchain projects has not yet begun. But it‚Äôs good that over the past 2 months it has become clear that the market has finally felt the bottom. And our S token groped the bottom too. The stagnation of the market for Sharpay means disrupting the plan for installing buttons on sites and lack of profit. Partly, we are also to blame for this, because (maybe, like you) we were very encouraged by the growth of the market a year ago and did not take care of our development plan in the most negative scenario. Therefore, for example, our tokens buyback program for Token Sale‚Äôs participants is not yet active and is postponed for an indefinite period (we will announce the launch of this program upon receiving the first profit).  In Asia, there is such a proverb ‚ÄúThe dogs bark, but the caravan goes on‚Äù. That is why we never listen to haters. They do not understand that the ETH we raised in Token Sale depreciated along with the market 10‚Äì15 times. Yes, we never exchanged ETH to USD and didn‚Äôt cash out. Yes, we are blockchain and crypto evangelists. Yes, our real fund after spending on expensive Token Sale promotion, financing the team work, as well as the depreciation of the cryptocurrency market now is very very modest in size. At the same time, in one and a half years of Sharpay development since the start of financing the project from Token Sale‚Äôs fund, we managed not to waste all resources and are ready to develop our Sharpay product further and steadily.  Over the past year, the collapse of the market, the main thing for us was to keep our team and develop the product every day. Haters do not understand this, but do you? They do not understand that good projects do not artificially raise their token prices with the help of ‚Äúmarket making‚Äù technology, moreover, in a falling market this is the Sisyphean task (those who did this and temporarily raised the price burned all resources and fell even lower after). Haters do not understand that the best exchanges, like Binance (on which we will be listed someday), do not charge for listing, but look only at the quality of the working product and the real daily work of the team. Haters do not understand this, but they constantly demand it, demand it and demand it. That is why we do not listen to haters. And we advise you not to.  We didn‚Äôt attract investment in Token Sale! It was written in all of our documents and White Paper. All S tokens sales were never an investment, but were the purchase of high-risk utility tokens of a high-tech project. We have no investors! But we have token holders. And we really appreciate your support and trust.  Yes, after Token Sale, our token fell. But, we repeat, the whole market fell! ETH fell 10‚Äì15 times a year and our S token also fell exactly 10‚Äì15 times. How could our S token grow if the market fell on it with a capitalization of tens of billions of USD? Do you understand the difference in capitalization? Even if we had burned all our fund to support the price of our token, this would be enough for us to do that for just 1 day only. For what??? Therefore, with horror on our faces, we were only silent observers of the falls of Olympus and prayed that the bottom would not be at zero. As a result, the S token has fallen in price in direct proportion to the fall in the market. This is a good signal of the expectations and faith of most of our token holders in our project.  Now the S token is traded on 3 exchanges: IDEX, SIMEX and OEX. Haters shout that they are exchanges with free listing. Nothing like this! Only listing on IDEX did not require any costs from us except the time for a joint audit of the closed GitHub code of our project with IDEX‚Äôs CEO. And for example, listing on OEX costed us about 12 BTC (at the rate) at the time of payment. By the way, the other day there was a unpleasant incident, when OEX mistakenly delisted our token. In reality, the CEO of OEX was changed, and the new management began to clean up the exchange. We contacted the new head of OEX, demonstrated our stability in development and the real work of our team, and after that, OEX immediately restored our token in the listing. In fact, it was a test of which projects are live and which are not. Yes, we are alive.  Here are what we are planning to do to increase the price of the S token.  1) Stably develop our product. We do it. 2) Introduce new features that will make our product more popular and increase the number of installations of our buttons on websites. 3) Launch large partnership programs with very well-known blockchain projects (and their tokens) and cool sites (from the regular market). While this is very difficult to do, as the market is depressed, but we are working to overcome resistance.  For example, we want to announce the readiness of a very important feature. Soon we will launch the opportunity for sites to reward for sharing not only S tokens, but also ETH and any other tokens! It is very cool. This feature has already been developed (like many other features), but we want to release it after a general UI / UX upgrade of our system.  As we have said many times, our S token is not for fast exchange speculation and not for quick profit. But after months or maybe years of your waiting (as is the case with BTC), we believe that you will get a good profit from owning S tokens. Now, using our fighting team spirit, we are doing everything we can to do this. Believe in us, wait and while the market is at the bottom, increase your S packs.  In Honesty We Trust!

Sharpay development update: added networks selection, async script option, refined password recovery, fixed locale switch bug and made other UI improvements.  Continuous development is one of the main tasks our Sharpay team should do, and week by week we develop new significant functions and make improvements for our users!  Let us share with you some new important updates.  Added networks selection. We have added a new ‚ÄúNetworks‚Äù selection function for webmasters. Now the webmasters can select and reward their preferred social networks which users can share content on. They can target their customers geographically by selecting different social networks, for example, they can select Weibo, Kakao Story and LINE only, if they want to target the Asian market.  Added async script option. When webmasters design their own buttons, they may turn off the async script loading if they want to use Sharpay client side API.  Refined password recovery. When users want to recover their passwords, instead of resetting their passwords by our system, users can enter new passwords by themselves. It becomes more convenient for users and they do not need to go back and forth.  Fixed locale switch bug. We have fixed the bug that happened when the browser‚Äôs non-English locale is in incognito bug mode.  Improved animated button. We have resized the iframe to avoid overlapping other elements on widget when hovering.  Improved email template UI and added Chinese translation.

We keep moving forward and pushing our Sharpay to be the best sharing button in the market.   Check out some of our Sharpay development we have made:  1) Added Renren to direct sharing. We successfully developed and added Renren, a big and growing Chinese social network, to our Sharpay direct sharing options. Now users are able to share news to Renren using direct share buttons.  2) Set up reward notification on Telegram. If users are connected their accounts to Telegram, they will be able to get sharing and conversion reward notifications from Telegram bot.  3) Expanded user profile for target audience. Users are able to enter ‚ÄúAge range‚Äù, ‚ÄúGender‚Äù, ‚ÄúCountry‚Äù in their profile, these will enhance the target audience segmentation for future reward development. You can use this option without adding real name and any personal data. We do not request, store or process your personal data (real names, passports / id cards / identity documents screenshots, etc.). You can use this feature at will, which in some cases will allow to pay you higher rewards for sharing links and promoting content.  4) Updated WordPress and Cloudflare plugins. We have updated the WordPress and Cloudflare plugins to match with our recent development updates.  5) Improved the display of share counter. The share counter is set on the opposite side of the widget. If user is using a right floating widget, the share counter will be on the left side.  6) Improved floating share button. We removed the ‚Äúmini widget‚Äù and ‚Äúanimate‚Äù options and simplified the floating share button, now the floating share button is already minimized with animation.  7) Changed the ‚Äúsimple sharing‚Äù to ‚Äúdirect sharing‚Äù.

Sharpay development update: Created a script to merge accounts with the same email & social networks, fixed database social network bindings, improved Telegram account binding, speeded up sharing window, added tools for system admin and improved alert UI.  Despite spending most of the time working on one of the main feature that we are going to release, we improved our Sharpay buttons and added some tools. Here are some of the development tasks we have done:  1) Created a script for merging accounts with the same email & social networks. We found that some users owned multiple accounts with the same social networks or emails that they accidentally created during registration using social networks. It was inconvenient and impossible to manage accounts for users. In order to detect and control duplicated accounts, we created a script for our system admin to automatically or manually merge accounts. This could also check each user account and accessibility and manage user accounts (to merge or duplicate account if necessary).  During this task, we discovered 59 inaccessible accounts that had neither password & email logins nor social network account bindings. These empty user accounts have been deleted by our system. There were 60 duplicated accounts, and our system have merged them accordingly. We have also sent emails to all the merged account users and notified them about the account changes.   With this new script and improvement, our system admin can check and monitor user accounts more easily and efficiently. It will also automatically send email notifications to users for any account changes.  2) Fixed database social network bindings. If the social network user is going to link to his Sharpay account has already used by another user, it will not work and will show user an error message. It can prevent user from creating multiple accounts using the same social networks.  We spent quite a lot of time to fix this social network bindings and it took us more time than what we expected. It was because we needed to test all 15 different social networks, and for each one we tested and corrected errors. Also, for linking social networks, it is tightly integrated with third-party authentication services that work only with our app.sharpay.io domain.   3) Created merging account tool for system admin. We created a tool for our system admin to detect and merge accounts with identical social network bindings. Before we needed to manual check and merge identical accounts which took us a lot of time.   4) Improved Telegram account binding. We improved the user identity field in our database and made sure it would be filled with a unique identifier when creating the Telegram account binding.   5) Speeded up the loading of the sharing window. We made asynchronous pull-up of metadata from the site to the sharing window in order to speed up the loading and improve performance.   6) Created passage mark for KYC in admin system. Now our admin will show a passage mark of KYC for those users who have passed the KYC for withdrawing their tokens bought in Token Sale.   7) Added a close button to alert messages. We have improved the UI with Bootstrap, users are now able to dismiss the alert messages manually by themselves.  Time is ticking and we are getting ready for the next new upgrade.

We have made an important strategic decision to focus on developing our sharing with blockchain rewards feature only. Now, this is our main feature.  Our Sharpay buttons have 2 main features: multisharing and sharing with blockchain rewards, and we have always promoted them together before. Each of them is unique in itself.  When we started developing our multisharing button, we aimed to connect all top social networks around the world, so everyone can share website content to their favourite social networks in one click (multisharing feature). However, some of the largest world social networks and messengers, such as WeChat and Kakao never give anyone the opportunity to use their social networks for multisharing. We did countless requests, but they were ineffectual. That is because of their company policies. As WeChat and Kakao are the largest social networks in Asia, multisharing has never been full-fledged without them.  Not so long ago, Facebook also restricted the rights of developers. This is due to last year's Facebook database leak scandal, for which Mark Zuckerberg was justified in the US Congress. The restriction applies to all applications. Because of that, now our users cannot use the multisharing feature for sharing news to Facebook unfortunately.  As Facebook is the largest social network, we believe that this restriction is very essential for us. This finally clarified the situation, now it became clear that our first feature ‚Äî multisharing in one click ‚Äî without Facebook can no longer be equivalent to our second main feature ‚Äî sharing with blockchain rewards. That is why we now decided to focus on the development and promotion of the Sharpay sharing with blockchain rewards feature as our only one major and unique feature.  However, it does not mean that we will give up and stop development or supporting our multishare feature! We only shift our development priority. Now multisharing on some large social networks is not possible yet, but periodically we will send them requests on using their API with advanced features. As soon as they approve our requests, we will definitely release it!  Now about the main thing.  Our sharing with blockchain rewards feature is automatic, unique and has no analogues. The use of this feature cannot be technically limited, therefore now we are not dependent on the policies of any social networks. And we have an international PCT patent priority on 152 countries for this (by the way, we will soon tell you in detail what it means).  Currently in accordance with our strategic vision, we are developing a new sharing window. As soon as the user decides to share interesting content from any site using our Sharpay share buttons, he will see a new sharing window with more technological features. The new sharing window will provide users all these three different methods for choosing:  - direct sharing with rewards - multisharing with rewards - referral link for sharing with rewards.  As the connected social networks in direct sharing and multisharing are different, all social networks in both sharing methods are different too. Unlike the old sharing window of which websites can only install one sharing option, either multisharing or direct sharing buttons, the new Sharpay sharing window will give users freedom and autonomous to choose different sharing methods.  We believe that with the usual clear-to-everyone sharing with unique features and focusing on sharing with rewards, Sharpay will succeed. Especially considering the fact that now you can do sharing with rewards on Facebook, WeChat, Kakao and all main social networks! It is very cool!  Now we are finishing work on updating our UI / UX and will soon make the official release of our new sharing window, user accounts, and also update our site, in accordance with the 2019‚Äô UI / UX trends.

Sharpay development update: added Facebook Messenger to direct sharing, strengthened comment section‚Äôs validation in sharing window, improved share bonus calculation, fixed network region table, fixed floating widget display bug and etc.  We have been intensively developing our new features and improving our Sharpay share buttons. We have finished a lot of tasks, such as:  1) Added Facebook Messenger to direct sharing. Users are now able to share website content to Facebook Messenger. Sharing on Facebook Messenger is working on both desktop and mobile (iOS and Android) apps. The Facebook Messenger API works differently in desktop and mobile devices, so we need to work separately for that.  We need to detect user‚Äôs device first and then call different APIs accordingly. We expanded the networks table in our database, added different call function for the API and changed the redirection links.  Currently, it is available only on direct sharing, but once the API supports also our multisharing function, we will definitely develop and add it to our multisharing buttons.  2) Strengthened comment section‚Äôs validation in sharing window. In the comment section of sharing window, we improved the comment validation and security. When we were working on the validation, we also found out that if user wanted to share content with comment on LINE or Reddit, the comment could not be empty. We needed to consider different situation and sharing limitation on different social networks, and added different validation rules accordingly.  We have added length and content validation in the comment section in both front end and back end sides of our application. Now, users cannot write any URLs in the comment section, also in certain social networks, the users cannot share website content without leaving any comments. Otherwise, an error message will display to remind user.  3) Improved share bonus calculation. Every time users share website content on their social networks, our system will check and calculate the share bonus to prevent cheating on sharing. We have improved the script by taking out the ‚Äúhour counter‚Äù component and adding the user‚Äôs active multishare list checking.  4) Fixed network region table. When we were working on the Facebook Messenger sharing function, we found that the network region table in our database had several errors and omissions. We therefore wrote a script to fix it.  5) Fixed floating widget display bug. When the mouse move around the floating widget, it did not display the background specified in the SVG image before. We have fixed the bug and updated the background colour. Now, the floating widget is working normally.   6) Fixed notification email for merging account. We found out that when we merged two identical accounts, the system would send notification email per account. We have therefore fixed it and now our system will check the duplicate email addresses and send only one notification email per email.   7) Fixed the sharing counter error caused by the change of encoding. We have corrected the error in the operation of the sharing counter due to the change of encoding.   8 ) Enabled user‚Äôs notification language. We added language option in the notification script. If user choose his language option, all notification messages will change in his language automatically.  We will continuously announce our development news to our social networks!

We have combined sale.sharpay.io accounts and app.sharpay.io accounts for system optimization.  We are pleased to announced that the sale.sharpay.io and app.sharpay.io accounts have been combined together. We have merged all the duplicate accounts, and transferred all unique accounts from sale.sharpay.io with the balance of S tokens purchased in Token Sale that have not withdrawn, to app.sharpay.io.  Many of our community members had to have two separate accounts in our systems. Before, sale cabinet (sale.sharpay.io) was necessary for us at the Token Sale stage, but now it is only used for token distribution and KYC procedures. The token withdrawal function is already available in our main system (app.sharpay.io), but there was no mechanism for KYC. Therefore, we decided to integrate KYC system from our partner Sum & Substance (S&S) into app.sharpay.io system, and simplify it for our users.  We work with S&S directly for the KYC and integration. We have requested a developer key to access the documentation and test the API. The documentation describes in detail several integration methods and we are able to choose the appropriate method for our system. S&S is very responsive to the work of their system, it has checked and tested the KYC system, and made sure that everything was properly configured before the release of KYC procedure on our app.sharpay.io.  To make sure that Token Sale buyers from sale.sharpay.io can successfully login on app.sharpay.io, we have changed the login form on sale.sharpay.io. When you try to log in on sale.sharpay.io, we will inform you about the combine of accounts and send you an instruction email to login on app.sharpay.io. In addition, we will ask you to update your password and two-factor authentication settings for your account security.  Now, we have transferred all your tokens from sale.sharpay.io that you have purchased in our Token Sale but have not yet withdrawn, to app.sharpay.io and combined them with the token balance that you earned from sharing on app.sharpay.io (if any).  Short easy summary:  1.

And all this costs a lot of money, nothing is free.  The whole market fell. ETH dropped 12 times. Now no one needs new tokens. We are not to blame for the fall of the entire market.

Webmasters are now able to add conversion events and reward Sharpay button users additional bonuses for their referrals!  Click and visit rate is important for websites, but visitor actions are critical in measuring their business growth. Conversion events allow webmasters to track the actions of site visitors who follow referral links on social networks shared by Sharpay button users.  The conversion event can be, for example, a simple click and visit, a form filling and submission, a purchase action. Sharpay button users who share referral links on their social networks will get additional conversion bonuses (set by webmasters) from their referrals.  All the site visitor actions will be recorded as event data and passed to Sharpay system using JavaScript. Thus, webmasters can track almost any visitor activity. Conversion events only work if visitors have clicked on referral links that shared using our Sharpay buttons.  How to create a conversion event:  1. Go to the Webmasters section and open the Edit project. 2. Open the Events tab and click on the Event settings button. 3. To create an event, specify its character Code (letters of the Latin alphabet, numbers and dashes are allowed). 4. Specify the Name of the event that will appear in the reports. 5. And the size of the Rate, which will be charged to the user for this event. 6. Click the Add Event button and save the changes.  Once the event is created to record visitor actions, it cannot be deleted. You can only deactivate it if you do not need it.  How it works:  1. User shares a referral link on his social networks using Sharpay button. 2. Visitor clicks on the referral link and performs actions on the website (e.g. register an account). 3. User gets an additional conversion bonus from visitor‚Äôs actions on the website set by webmaster.  Try our latest conversion events function (https://app.sharpay.io/index/events) now!

We would like to inform you about the growth of Sharpay market capitalization and an upcoming revolutionary system upgrade.  It is not so easy to list on exchanges as you think. 2 months ago, when Sharpay Team made the first listing and started open market trading S token, the price of S token began to decline according to the ‚Äúlaws‚Äù of market. We wrote a big post about it, asked you not to be panic and wait for many weeks and many months. Because our token is not for quick profit. Our token is only an indicator of the success of the development of a large unique product ‚Äî multishare buttons with blockchain rewards.  Then we made a listing on CoinMarketCap (a must for all good projects) and on the largest decentralized exchange IDEX.  The daily chart of how our token is being traded is now attached to this post. And we like it.  As you can see, for this we rely on the development of our product and open communication with each of you on all social media, as well as our personal chat with https://t.me/sharpay_admin.  And now, we want to make a big announcement. We are preparing a game-changing upgrade for Sharpay. This upgrade will bring Sharpay to the next level. We have already developed this new feature and we are testing it. Soon we will announce it. Wait!  Do not rush to sell our tokens. Buy now. We are standing at the beginning and there is a long way to go together for us.

As you know, some time ago we have announced the first listing of our S (Sharpay) token on SIMEX exchange: https://simex.global/en/exchange/s/usd  This is a good listing because SIMEX is a public US corporation from the list of TOP-15 cryptocurrency exchanges with good REAL volumes.  We received a lot of questions about trading on this exchange, about the market situation and the prospects of the price of our S token.  Some of you ask us about why it's so difficult to pass SIMEX verification? The answer is simple: because SIMEX operates in strict accordance with US laws. If you have any questions about verification, then you need to contact SIMEX support.  Many of you ask us about trading bots and whether the price of our S token on the SIMEX exchange is real? YES. Trading on SIMEX is real and shows the real market price of our S token. And about the trading bots. We would like to draw your attention to the fact that many professional traders use bots for effective trading. We do not trade our tokens. But we are positive about trading through bots.  Others ask why the market price of our token was gradually dumped? For us, this is the most painful question, but you must understand that all of the answers are simple, and reflect the whole market situation especially ETH and all altcoins!  We have been working on this project for many years, we have a REAL WORKING PRODUCT, we have filed several patent applications, our company has no analogs and competitors! Sharpay multisharing button with blockchain rewards is a unique product! And we get very angry when someone unreasonably and undeservedly accuses our team.  The community should not blame us for the fact that the entire cryptocurrency market has fallen 5 times in price! Over the past 6 months, ETH has fallen 5 times! All the cryptocurrencies are depreciating! This is not our fault. And the fall of the whole market has nothing to do with our Sharpay project. These are the realities of the whole market!  Things depend not only on us. We are pressed by the whole market. If the whole market falls, any of our costs will be ineffective. We need to work hard and wait for good conditions in the market.  We would like to remind you that according to the public poll of our international community, the results of which were published in the news (https://t.me/sharpay_io/300), about 74% of our community supported the idea to postpone the listing for an indefinite period, because now the market is at the bottom, demand for altcoins is minimal (!) and this can negatively affect the price of our S (Sharpay) token.  We are pleased that the volume of our trading is small. We are glad that the price of our token is not much lower than the nominal price. We agree with 74% of our community that now is not the right time to actively trade our tokens and you need to wait for a few months.  We have never said that buying our tokens could make quick profits. What did we say at Token Sale? We always said that we had a roadmap for several years ahead (!) and we were a unique company, because our product had no analogs in the world! Therefore, our tokens would be valuable in long term.  According to the rules of our Token Sale, buying our tokens was never an investment! We never promised any investment returns! The purchase of our tokens has always been and will be a chance to lose everything or to benefit. It's a chance, but not a guarantee! These are the usual standards for high-risk cryptocurrency purchases! And we believe that with our hard work we will make your risk minimal and justify your trust!  Our development plan was written on our Sharpay White Paper. All buyers should know this. All buyers need to read, wait and believe.  Our answer for each buyer remains the same. To get a good reward from buying our tokens, it takes many months and years of waiting. This is a purchase as a long-term contribution to the future! It is necessary to wait. And we believe that this expectation will pay back!  We follow our roadmap and we report on new developments every week. Each company has its own way of development. Now our information strategy is as it is. Over time, we will announce updates and news about our development and partnerships.  We openly communicate with any members of our community in one to one Telegram chat (this is much more effective than a public chat with an uncontrolled flood) and in all of our public social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Steemit, Medium, BitcoinTalk. This is a huge open space. This is more than enough for effective communication of all members of our multinational community.  We will continue the weekly publication of news of our new developments, promotions, and partnerships. Thank you for your support!  In Sharing We Trust! Sharpay.io Team  Hi! I hope you have read our post. For us, we continue to develop our Sharpay button and promote it worldwide, get more partnerships.

As you know, some time ago we have announced the first listing of our S (Sharpay) token on SIMEX exchange: https://simex.global/en/exchange/s/usd  This is a good listing because SIMEX is a public US corporation from the list of TOP-15 cryptocurrency exchanges with good REAL volumes.  We received a lot of questions about trading on this exchange, about the market situation and the prospects of the price of our S token.  Some of you ask us about why it's so difficult to pass SIMEX verification? The answer is simple: because SIMEX operates in strict accordance with US laws. If you have any questions about verification, then you need to contact SIMEX support.  Many of you ask us about trading bots and whether the price of our S token on the SIMEX exchange is real? YES. Trading on SIMEX is real and shows the real market price of our S token. And about the trading bots. We would like to draw your attention to the fact that many professional traders use bots for effective trading. We do not trade our tokens. But we are positive about trading through bots.  Others ask why the market price of our token was gradually dumped? For us, this is the most painful question, but you must understand that all of the answers are simple, and reflect the whole market situation especially ETH and all altcoins!  We have been working on this project for many years, we have a REAL WORKING PRODUCT, we have filed several patent applications, our company has no analogs and competitors! Sharpay multisharing button with blockchain rewards is a unique product! And we get very angry when someone unreasonably and undeservedly accuses our team.  The community should not blame us for the fact that the entire cryptocurrency market has fallen 5 times in price! Over the past 6 months, ETH has fallen 5 times! All the cryptocurrencies are depreciating! This is not our fault. And the fall of the whole market has nothing to do with our Sharpay project. These are the realities of the whole market!  Things depend not only on us. We are pressed by the whole market. If the whole market falls, any of our costs will be ineffective. We need to work hard and wait for good conditions in the market.  We would like to remind you that according to the public poll of our international community, the results of which were published in the news (https://t.me/sharpay_io/300), about 74% of our community supported the idea to postpone the listing for an indefinite period, because now the market is at the bottom, demand for altcoins is minimal (!) and this can negatively affect the price of our S (Sharpay) token.  We are pleased that the volume of our trading is small. We are glad that the price of our token is not much lower than the nominal price. We agree with 74% of our community that now is not the right time to actively trade our tokens and you need to wait for a few months.  We have never said that buying our tokens could make quick profits. What did we say at Token Sale? We always said that we had a roadmap for several years ahead (!) and we were a unique company, because our product had no analogs in the world! Therefore, our tokens would be valuable in long term.  According to the rules of our Token Sale, buying our tokens was never an investment! We never promised any investment returns! The purchase of our tokens has always been and will be a chance to lose everything or to benefit. It's a chance, but not a guarantee! These are the usual standards for high-risk cryptocurrency purchases! And we believe that with our hard work we will make your risk minimal and justify your trust!  Our development plan was written on our Sharpay White Paper. All buyers should know this. All buyers need to read, wait and believe.  Our answer for each buyer remains the same. To get a good reward from buying our tokens, it takes many months and years of waiting. This is a purchase as a long-term contribution to the future! It is necessary to wait. And we believe that this expectation will pay back!  We follow our roadmap and we report on new developments every week. Each company has its own way of development. Now our information strategy is as it is. Over time, we will announce updates and news about our development and partnerships.  We openly communicate with any members of our community in one to one Telegram chat (this is much more effective than a public chat with an uncontrolled flood) and in all of our public social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Steemit, Medium, BitcoinTalk. This is a huge open space. This is more than enough for effective communication of all members of our multinational community.

I've been involved in plenty of ICOs (good and bad), but this is the first one that I've seen unlocking tokens before listing on an official exchange.  Of course dumpers will always dump no matter what, but there's a reason why successful ICOs all lock their tokens until they are first listed on an exchange: it drives demand and prevents price drops before markets are even aware of it. I too voted to list later, but what good will that do now if people are already trading them anyway? Price has dropped already, they took away any hype factor that might have still existed by doing that.  And what makes you think I am whining about money I can't afford to lose? I wouldn't have invested it if that was the case, but that doesn't mean I don't care what happens to it.  Happy that you're happy with the way this ICO is being handled.

Dear friends! Dear community! Buyers and token holders!  Today is the day when we are ready to make an official announcement about the first listing of our S tokens on the crypto exchange market!  We promised you that this week we will make an official announcement about the start of trading. We keep our promise.  The first exchange where you can officially buy and sell our S tokens is SIMEX: https://simex.global/en/exchange/s/eth.  SIMEX is a multifunctional online international digital asset management, investment, and trading platform. Transfers between accounts and to accounts of third parties, deposit / withdraw from linked debit cards.  According to the official rating of CoinMarketCap, the exchange takes the 14th place in the TOP 15 of the world's cryptocurrency exchange trading systems: https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/  Currently, our S token is opened for trading in these pairs: S / ETH, S / BTC, S / USD.  The platform interface is available in English and not only. We know that our multinational community, including large Korean and Chinese communities, are waiting for the opportunity to trade in their own languages. Unfortunately, the platform has not yet been translated into some major Asian languages. But we promise that soon we will make new listings on other exchanges and our multinational community will be able to trade in their own languages!  To start trading on the SIMEX platform, you need to register and verify your account.  According to Sharpay White Paper, the initial price of placing the tokens corresponds to the nominal price of our token and is equal to 0.00003 ETH. Bidding has already begun a few days ago. At the moment, the market price of our token in the S / ETH pair is 0.00003996 ETH, which is about 30% higher than the nominal price!  As we announced a few days ago, according to the collective opinion of our experts, the entire market of cryptocurrency is now at the bottom and is preparing to make a new ascent up. We encourage all users not to rush to sell S tokens. This is a good start! This is our first step towards the common success! Congratulations! Buy Now!  In Sharing We Trust! Sharpay.io Team",False

We often announce our new partnerships and development features (almost every week) to keep our community up to date on our Sharpay project.  At the same time, listing on exchanges is definitely a very important task to us.  However, as you know the crypto currency market has been falling significantly. According to our research, almost all new projects have completed Token Sales and listed on exchanges recently, their token prices have fallen so much. Some very large projects, which raised tens of millions of dollars, perform even worse than others. Their token prices have fallen 5 times or more below their ICO prices!  Now, it is a very bad time for listing. We do not want our token price fall like all others! We already have agreements with exchanges, but perhaps we can wait and list on exchanges until the market recovers? We would like to hear your opinion, our community‚Äôs opinion. So, we have decided to create a public poll on Telegram.  Direct link: https://t.me/sharpay_io/300  We are waiting for your answers!

It has been almost a week since we launched an opinion poll about listing on exchanges. We have received a lot of comments and support. And furthermore, we consulted with our advisors and experts. Now we would like to announce our decision.   As we all know, this month, the collective capitalization of all cryptocurrencies hit rock bottom ‚Äî $189 billion. Almost all new projects, that have recently completed Token Sales and listed on exchanges, suffer a downward price trend, their token price has fallen below ICO price.  The experts believe that the market is in a poor condition these days and that there is no time to wait. We tend to agree with this position. The market might be not looking good now, but we believe that the prices will eventually go up and we need to start rising with the market together.  Moreover, there are interested buyers who can purchase our tokens anytime they want, and our token holders can buy more or sell at market price. Also, with regard to voting, a quarter of users suggest us to list on exchanges as soon as possible.   We have waited enough, it is time to act now. We are ready to do the first listing.  The exchange that we have chosen is now in the list of Top 15 global crypto exchanges with the largest trading volumes. It will help us to demonstrate to the public at large our trade capacity. The next step will be a public listing on CoinMarketCap which will open the window of opportunity for future listings on larger exchanges.  We understand that some of you wanted to wait and postpone listing on exchanges for better times, but taking into consideration current market trends, experts' advice, voting results and possible risks we have made a decision to list on exchanges in the nearest future for our community's best interest.   We will announce our first listing and provide more details later this week. Thank you all for your support and patience.  In Sharing We Trust! Sharpay.io Team",False

Sharing (technology of dissemination of information in social networks) appeared on the market more than 10 years ago. Then there were several independent start-ups that played the role of its popularizers - they made it possible to combine different social networks into a single unit and customize them for the site design. Today, the buttons of these services are installed only 3-5% of the total number of sites. Over this period of time (more than 10 years), in the operation of the aggregators of sharing, nothing has changed fundamentally - the limited methods of their monetization made the development of this industry meaningless and unattractive for developers.  The multisharing button, developed by our Sharpay company, is making a real breakthrough in the sharing. The use of blockchain technology in our share button has become a powerful impetus for the development of Internet marketing as it will help both sites, which use our button, and users, who share the information, to earn! No one share button has provided a such opportunity before. Moreover,  Sharpay provides multisharing of information, which allows users to place the content on all their own pages in social networks just in a one click!

We, Sharpay Inc. (registered in Belize), follow the ‚ÄúAnti-Money Laundering And Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Guidelines‚Äù issued by the Central Bank of Belize, therefore, we will perform KYC (Know Your Customer) procedure for all our buyers.  As some of our buyers might notice, we have started the KYC procedure at the beginning of last week. Some of our buyers saw the KYC buttons in their personal accounts. But unfortunately, around the same time, we were under a phishing attack. We had to stop the KYC procedure immediately to protect our users‚Äô data.  We successfully resisted the phishing attack. We made sure that all the data of our buyers were safe, all buyers‚Äô tokens were securely protected and the impact of the attack was minimal to us. And now we will start the KYC procedure.  The KYC aims to protect Sharpay Inc. from money laundering and financing of terrorism risks. To pass the KYC, please go to your personal account on https://sale.sharpay.io/ (ONLY on this site!).  üî∏ If you have 150,000 or more Sharpay Tokens:  You will need to complete a FULL KYC with supporting documents.

You will need to upload the following documents: ‚ÄúProof of identity‚Äù, ‚ÄúSelfie with the proof‚Äù and ‚ÄúProof of address‚Äù.  üî∏ If you have less than 150,000 Sharpay Tokens:  There will be no KYC button for you and you will need to complete a SIMPLE KYC, please go to your ‚ÄúProfile‚Äù section (https://sale.sharpay.io/cabinet/profile) and fill in all the required fields: ‚ÄúFull name‚Äù, ‚ÄúPhone‚Äù, ‚ÄúAge‚Äù and ‚ÄúCountry‚Äù.  Once you have submitted all the required documents (for Full KYC) and fields, and they were reviewed by the system with no problems, your KYC will be considered passed.

The result of Full KYC will be sent to your personal email, you can also check it on your account (https://sale.sharpay.io/cabinet/home).  In some cases, we will require some buyers who are considered to be suspicious by our system to complete the FULL KYC even they have smaller balances, but we will not disclose the criteria and the standards.  We have a very authoritative partner for the KYC process, Sum And Substance Ltd. (http://sumsub.com). We do not store your personal data.

Let‚Äôs introduce them:  Group 1 ‚ÄúBond / Leon / or Robin Hood‚Äù- attentive and accurate - a person who shares the content considering his subscribers‚Äô opinion. He shares carefully. Such users bring the most targeted traffic, the highest conversion to websites‚Äô owners.   Group 2 ""Hulk or irresistible clickers"" is a group of users who just share everything they see. These guys do their best not for quality, but for quantity. Apparently, they haven‚Äôt understood our philosophy - to share from all the heart! And it is not sold, you cannot buy! No matter how attractive our tokens are!   Group 3 ""Iodo (Star Wars) / Sherlock"" - those who do not change their ideas and follow their habits - they share without taking the earnings into consideration. They are real Masters!   Group 4 ""Deceptive Loki"" - those who share a little, but nothing is matching. A lot of sharing, but it's deceptive - the effectiveness is little due to the fact that either friends are passive, or there are not enough friends. But, no doubt, these Sharpayers will join the bright side of the life as well as of social networks life!  Is it funny? But also it is serious at the same time!  We'll see it together soon!

And today Sharpay is the only one engaged in the development of this technology in the market which size exceeds 500 billion dollars, it is cool isn‚Äôt it?  Will blockchain change our world? It is already changing, have not you noticed yet?

Do you want our forecast, what will happen next? Will the market grow? What place will Bitcoin and Ethereum take? How many billions of people will be in the blockchain? 1, 2 or 7? Would it still only work on decentralized technologies? Do you want to hear our answer?  We do not know exactly.

We get a lot of questions about our tokens and our own blockchain. Today we want to tell you about our plans related to these items.  1. At the end of the main Token Sale, we will issue the ERC20 tokens and credit them to all our customers to personal wallets.  2. After listing of our tokens on the exchanges, all buyers will be able to sell and buy our ERC20 tokens. The listing is scheduled after June. We do not inform in advance whom we are negotiating with, this is prohibited by the rules of exchanges. But we will let you know when everything is ready!  3. Our users who did not buy, but receive tokens for sharing, will also be able to sell tokens on exchanges. For this, a minimum threshold will be established, from which it will be possible to make transfers. The size of the threshold will be reported in the future.  4. Then, according to the plan in 2019, we will launch our high-speed blockchain with cheap transactions and make the migration of tokens. After that, the holders of a small number of our tokens will be able to make transfers from the Sharpay system to the exchanges.  5. Creating of our own blockchain is very important for us, because we need a full cycle ecosystem.  6. At the same time, there is an alternative. From experienced blockchain enthusiasts and members of our community, we periodically receive recommendations to make migration from ERC20 not to our own blockchain, but to use EOS or Ripple, for example. They argue this by the fact that it will optimize our system and increase the capitalization of our tokens due to synergy with a large blockchain.  7. We consider with interest and analyze such variants of the development.  8. The question of having of our own blockchain is tactical. Our goal is not to use our own blockchain, but the successful realization of the project as a whole growth of our capitalization.  We understand perfectly that it is not so important for all our token holders, what kind of blockchain we will be, it is important for everyone that we are successful! If we are successful, you will be happy, won‚Äôt you?  We will keep you informed about the results of our research and decisions!  In Sharing We Trust!

Today's post is about you! About target audiences of our project. There are three of them. And here is a brief description of each one.  Group 1: CONTRIBUTORS and MINERS - they are fans of cryptocurrency earnings and payments. They bet on real projects and ""skim the cream"" buying tokens in the early sales stages. These people are a bit gambling, they like analytics, making previews and betting. Buying tokens, they believe in ICO and dream that the project will repeat the success of Bitcoin, so they will tell to their children and grandchildren they were at the very beginning of the story.  In addition to the romantic ones, there are also real financial brokers who participate in Token Sale to diversify their portfolio. But the majority, in our opinion, is independent participants of the financial market, developers and those ones close to IT area.  Group 2: BUSINESS AND WEBSITES OWNERS - they are installing the Sharpay Multisharing button, they need a result, an effective SMM campaign, promotion of their product among relevant groups, traffic to the site, conversions, and sales. Perhaps, they are not much experienced in the crypto world, but they know for sure that the blockchain is the technology of the future, which is important and necessary, and available to benefit from already today.  Group 3: ACTIVE USERS of SOCIAL MEDIA - they specially distribute interesting content with a purpose to get token income to their accounts. They are young people who have a conscious interest in cryptocurrencies; for them, earning is a proof of their own consistency and independence. These people are also the ones who look for answers in the Internet, many of them are eager to communicate, share, express their opinions, combining time spent on the network, with profits.

We have recently interviewed Andrey Stepanov, a biochemist doctor who works in the field of bone marrow transplantation for patients with cancer. Andrey runs a very interesting blog (http://stepanov.blog) about human body: why a person yawns or sneezes in the light, why the fingers wrinkle in the water and many other curious matters he explains in his blog. Andrey installed the Sharpay multi-share button at his blog in January 2018, and we are happy to share with you Andrey's, a real website owner's experience and opinion about our product.  üîπThe installation of the Sharpay button does not cause any difficulties even for a beginner website administrator. I am just inserting the html-code of the button to the right place of the article.  üîπWhen new visitors see that someone else has already used the button, they are more willing to press to share themselves.  üîπHere is an example, in my personal account on Sharpay.io I can see that 6185 visitors came to my website thanks to the Sharpay sharing button's re-posts, and according to Google Analytics for the same period there were only 9245 visits to the blog.  üîπFor me, the entry point to the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency was the blog platform based on the blockchain. The Sharpay button is an even simpler way of blockchain initiation for the new Internet users.  üîπNow thanks to Sharpay, sharing interesting and useful information with friends is rewarded. And advertising with Sharpay is much more effective than traditional promo in social networks. People do believe much to their friends recommendations and their common interests match. Sharing is even more effective than targeting.  üîπPeople are also having an interest to everything new. Interest in everything new is characteristic of the human psychology in general. And Sharpay.io has all potential to teach people such new technologies as blockchain and cryptocurrencies.  What does it mean?! It does not matter what is your job and what's your website about... The world of high technologies concerns everything, everywhere and everyone. That's why the Sharpay sharing button is worth to be used and installed! Have you already had it at your website?

Our adviser Ken Huang wants to tell you about Sharpay.io and explain why he has chosen our project!  Ken Huang is well-known Blockchain Expert, CEO of Distributed Business Applications. He worked for CGI Federal office in the USA as Director of Cyber Security, and Director of Cloud Security. He established CGI Federal Identity Management Practice, and Cyber Security Competence Center. While working for CGI as Executive Consultant, Ken consulted the United States Federal Government, financial institutions, and utility companies and provided expertise in Finance, Blockchain, and Cyber Security. He graduated from Zhejiang Normal University, Xian Jiaotong University in China and the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. And so, let's go directly to his opinion!  ¬´Hello everyone! Some of you know that I am an adviser of Sharpay.io But do you know what Sharpay Project is about? And why would I recommend you to pay attention on it? Sharpay.io came with a unique idea of ‚Äúmultishare‚Äù button aimed for websites that reward the users with cryptocurrency for promoting content. The sole idea is very simple. A user shares the content, as he would do with any other regular plugin. However, this time he is awarded with tokens for his contribution.  Sharpay multishare button is a new SMM tool for multiple increasing traffic and sales to the websites, as well as it helps to the socially active users to monetize their popularity by earning cryptocurrency.  There are THREE reasons why I would strongly recommend you Sharpay.io: 1. Simple and attractive token model, understandable for non-crypto experts. 2. Transparent and detailed description of funds allocation and multiple scenarios in the very much detailed White Paper. 3. A team with a diversified experience able to reach the targets fixed.  Please be aware Sharpay Token Sale is going on for a few weeks more. Now you have a great opportunity to get Sharpay tokens with a good bonus!  Sincerely yours, Ken Huang¬ª  In Sharing We Trust!

We are glad to share his opinion with you:  ‚ÄúICO market remains tough in terms of fundraising. And the main reason is not the currently low cryptocurrency prices. Even if they soon double there will be no easy money for ICOs again. Contributors now are much more fastidious and traditional digital marketing tools are much less effective. While the number of ICOs has been increasing in the face of vigorous competition the projects should be smarter in all ways planning and executing ICOs. First of all they should engage proper and savvy team members and advisors to get well prepared yet before the ICO announcement. Good marketing strategy is crucial, there are so many ways to waste money with no results. Correctly chosen rating platforms, reasonably focused PR activity and fruitful tradeshows with the carefully selected local providers is a minimum requirement for ICO success now‚Äù.

It‚Äôs time to tell you all about.  The project itself has a large background and prehistory! A few years ago when we just started creating it we called our project ‚ÄúMultishare‚Äù. That name was chosen due to the main function of the project‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäMulti+sharing (an ability to share content to several social networks in just one click).  Later on when blockchain technologies started gaining huge popularity, and tokenization appeared and became trendy; we decided to add another part, an extra word explaining other main feature of the project‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätoken payment for sharing. Thus, the first four letters of our project‚Äôs name are based on the verb ‚Äúshare‚Äù, and the last three ones‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcome from the verb ‚Äúpay‚Äù. Putting them all together, we get‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚ÄúSharpay‚Äù: share and pay in one word.  Since this word is consonant with the breed of dogs shar-pei in many languages, we took our decision to select shar-pei dog as our symbol and Sharpay is our project‚Äôs name.

Some of these questions are very important. That is why we are posting the answers to the most important questions here.  üî∏Question 1: Your White Paper says that your Token Sale period is: from March 1 till May 31, 2018 (with an option to prolong Token Sale). - Is the deadline still the same or you are going to extend the Token Sale period?  üîπQuestion 2: According to the White Paper, more than 1/3 tokens will be reserved for the system operations. It is also said that it is planned to ""sell tokens from the RESERVE to companies which use Sharpay button to stimulate customers"". - In what cases will this reserve be used? What will be the cost of tokens from reserve? This is important for investors, as sales from the reserve can significantly affect the market value of tokens.  üî∏Answer 1: We have a plan to end our Token Sale on May 31, 2018. But we also consider an option to extend. It is not confirmed yet. No final decision is made. We will keep you informed.  üîπAnswer 2: When the Token Sale is completed but the listing on exchanges is not executed yet, if this occurs, tokens can be sold at a nominal price. We take into consideration the project‚Äôs features, White Paper and a need of selling tokens to sites from the reserve. When our tokens are listed on the exchanges, the market price will appear, then tokens will be sold at the market price (in case the price is higher). If the market price is below the nominal value (which is not excluded, taking into account volatility periods), tokens will be sold at the nominal price (which is almost equivalent to the absence of sales from the system, as they can be bought cheaper on the exchanges).

Sharing (technology of dissemination of information in social networks) appeared on the market more than 10 years ago. Then there were several independent start-ups that played the role of its popularizers - they made it possible to combine different social networks into a single unit and customize them for the site design. Today, the buttons of these services are installed only 3-5% of the total number of sites. Over this period of time (more than 10 years), in the operation of the aggregators of sharing, nothing has changed fundamentally - the limited methods of their monetization made the development of this industry meaningless and unattractive for developers.  The multisharing button, developed by our Sharpay company, is making a real breakthrough in the sharing. The use of blockchain technology in our share button has become a powerful impetus for the development of Internet marketing as it will help both sites, which use our button, and users, who share the information, to earn! No one share button has provided a such opportunity before. Moreover,  Sharpay provides multisharing of information, which allows users to place the content on all their own pages in social networks just in a one click! Sharpay button is a sharing button of next generation!  In Sharing We Trust! Token Sale 40% Bonus! Buy Now!",False

I addressed the team with more or less the same opinion quite some time ago, but my suggestions were more or less ignored. I'm quite sure tht they are goin to blame the whole market situation now - which doesn't make sense of course ---> sharpay tokens are pegged to ETH, so when you buy fresh ETH now from fiat you get the sharpay tokens quite cheap. So normally right now we should see a drastic increase of the sold amount, which is not happening.  When you have a look at other projects with priced pegged to ETH you see exactly the fast i mentionend above - during the last days, the amount of sold tokens increased drastically.

Thank you for your interest!   According to our White Paper, the actual emission of ERC20 standard SHRP tokens will be after the end of the total Token Sale. Currently, tokens are accrued and accounted for in the registry immediately after purchase in your personal wallet on sale.sharpay.io.  In our case, we are developing our new blockchain, which is not based on Ethereum, but is the fork of the more faster BitShares blockchain. Therefore, we do not exclude the fact that by the time of the official Token Sale launch we will immediately issue tokens already on our blockchain, instead of the ERC20 standard.   If this does not happen as quickly as we want, then according to the plan we will issue SHRP tokens on the ERC20 standard and will be credited to your wallets for safe storage and future to exchange the tokens of our new blockchain based SHRP token.  A special field for adding your ETH address is now hidden in our settings and will appear in your account after Token Sale in June 2018.  Token Sale 40% Bonus! ‚úÖ Buy Now!",False

For instance public voting to get on popular exchanges you need to mobilise ppl in telegram (lots of examples lately), a lot of famous youtubers with a lot of followers are asking which coin or ico to feature in their youtube video and if you have a strong community they will tell your name to the youtuber, if you want ppl to mention sharpay in social media you need to stay in touch with your community actively (telegram).

You lead me directly to first point -- I know of course who you are, but I guess most of the people while skimming and scanning might not realize who replied there (no offense). In your profile to my opinion sharpay should be mentioned at least once, but nothing at all :-(  But okay, now to some points, which could be given as examples according to what I was referring to in my first post:  (1) The product video - does not communicate what sharpay could be used for - does not arbitrate the needed level of expertise which is needed to convince people to invest (which you guys definitely have) - is ridiculous, because in the end it does not transport any information in an acceptable way at all.  (2) Bitcointalk Bounty campaign. This is so important, I don't get why you are telling the opposite. Via this sharpay gets present to a lot of peoples minds, so they can associate something with products name. Apparently there is also some miscommunication within the team - you tell me it will be not used while your official project account is writing that it will be announced soon. Strange! And definitely not ideal.  (3) Logo/symbol The logo - or let's say the symbol, this big fat ugly dog. I know why you guys are using it and that it is a pun. But come on, there is a certain point where you have to get rid of this. It really generates a strange impression, because 95% (I guess more) people are just asking themselves why this shitty dog is placed so omnipresent on your website and unfortunately also in your video.  (4) Social Media USE IT MORE. Your twitter e.g. is more or less dead. Force people to know what sharpay is and why it is so special so that they don't even have another chance than to invest.  (5) Medial coverage Some reports of big youtubers or a review article in cointelegraph would defintely help a lot. I know that you give examples of medial coverage on your website, but honestly, nobody reads cryptosrus.    Moreover I just have to approve what my previous speaker has already contributed, all points make absolutely sense.

To put it in a nutshell, you/we have to attract peoples attention. This is also true for people, who might not be interested in the project itself, but who are convinced that it will have success because so many others are ... and then also invest!

So how you going to transfer my coin to my wallet?  Hi! According to our White Paper, the actual emission of ERC20 standard SHRP tokens will be after the end of the total Token Sale. Currently, tokens are accrued and accounted for in the registry immediately after purchase in your personal wallet on sale.sharpay.io.  In our case, we are developing our new blockchain, which is not based on Ethereum, but is the fork of the more faster BitShares blockchain. Therefore, we do not exclude the fact that by the time of the official Token Sale launch we will immediately issue tokens already on our blockchain, instead of the ERC20 standard.   If this does not happen as quickly as we want, then according to the plan we will issue SHRP tokens on the  ERC20 standard and will be credited to your wallets for safe storage and future to exchange the tokens of our new blockchain based SHRP token.  A special field for adding your ETH address is now hidden in our settings and will appear in your account after Token Sale in June 2018.  Presale Bonus 50%! ‚úÖ  Buy Now!",False

The Sharpay button will be interesting not only to  websites using previous generation sharing aggregators, but to completely new mobile applications and websites that have never even implemented sharing functionality on their platforms.  According to our projections, spread of the Sharpay multisharing technology with blockchain payments will drive market penetration up by at least 10%, and the Sharpay button has the capacity to capitalize the market by several times over.

The Internet and online networks have made these processes more popular - people actively post interesting information in social networks, blogs, forums. Such a massive info dissemination is a very powerful tool to promote and attract traffic to sites. Traffic brings them an increase in revenue, business growth and reputation consolidation. Therefore, today every website seeking to expand its audience is interested in its material promotion within social space, i.e. in the sharing.  Sharpay Company has developed a unique idea in the field of sharing. The developers claim that using the next-generation sharing button called Sharpay, social space users will be able to distribute any favorite information in several social networks in just one click!

Sharing (technology of dissemination of information in social networks) appeared on the market more than 10 years ago. Then there were several independent start-ups that played the role of its popularizers - they made it possible to combine different social networks into a single unit and customize them for the site design.  Today, the buttons of these services are installed only 3-5% of the total number of sites. Over this period of time (more than 10 years), in the operation of the aggregators of sharing, nothing has changed fundamentally - the limited methods of their monetization made the development of this industry meaningless and unattractive for developers.  The multisharing project, developed by Sharpay company, promises to make a real breakthrough in the sharing. The use of blockchain technology in the project will become a powerful impetus for the development of Internet marketing.  Learn more about the project on our website.
