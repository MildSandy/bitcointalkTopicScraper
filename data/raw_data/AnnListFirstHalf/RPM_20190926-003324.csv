The vision that will be presented has been stirring in my heart for some time and started from a simple conversation where a business associate in a high-risk industry was sharing their problem in finding reliable, secure, and cost-effective Merchant Services. They share the fact that there are currently over 1,000 high risk industries where merchants are paying in excess of 20% of the transaction total to secure services. Even when they did secure a service it was often arbitrarily shut down and the industry was ridden with scams. Many of these merchants have simply resorted to cash. These high-risk markets are projected to process over $500 billion in transaction per year globally. A significant opportunity for Render Payment.  Our team began to examine the problem and wondered if a crypto-currency based solution might just be the answer. It's not like other comppanies hadn't approached the challenge, but in every solution, we looked at it forced buyers to have to learn how to buy a crypto-currency and then fund a wallet while at the same time asking the merchants receive funds in a possibly volatile currency that they were not used to.  Our team believes that crypto-currency based applications work best when the interaction with the blockchain is virtually invisible. Our first product the Render Payment Shopping Cart Payment Gateway does that by allowing the buyer to check out on a website in a way they are familiar with using the debit or credit card of their choice while the merchant also receives payment in the currency of their choice. As depicted in diagrams in this white paper our back-end leverages the RPM Token as a liquidity mechanism to solve the problem these industries are faced with.  We don't plan on stopping there. We have a robust roadmap that will roll-out further cart integrations, wallets, escrow systems, a rewards program and more. Our team is dedicated to seeing this vision realized and are set on disrupting the status quo in the blockchain space. We firmly believe that one of the most dangerous phrases in business is, ""We have always done it that way."" We have no doubt this team will be pioneers in designing the next evolution for payment processing.  Our goal is not to be a flash in the pan. We are here to build a brand. We are resolved and will be committed to the success of the business model presented here. Token holders will find a level of transparency not yet demonstrated with blockchain startups. Token holders will see regular audited financial statements, quarterly conference calls with management, and regular roadmap updates as the project progresses.  After reading this I hope you will share our vision for creating a profound merchant solution that will have significant impact on this $500 Billion industry providing them with the reliable, cost effective services they deserve.",False

As per the whitepaper note that the company is newly formed to address this specific venture. The Parent company Sderot is registered in Cypress and the US Based corporation is in Florida as Render Payment. So there is not a ton of history. The founders came together as per the BIO's on the team page to bring this vision into a reality.  For example. I have successfully owned www.integritycsg.com a regional IT Managed Services Provider for over 10 Years. Our CFO works for the publicly traded corporation MCIG.
