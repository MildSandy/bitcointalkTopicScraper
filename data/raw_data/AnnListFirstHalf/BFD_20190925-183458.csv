BTRIC, a 501(c)(3) organization, has established a fund dedicated to the founding of FTSRO and is now seeking additional contributors as well as persons or businesses to be included as founders.  By forming a non-profit Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO), BTRIC believes that the crypto asset industry can better accommodate regulatory requirements in a streamlined and efficient manner, allowing for maximum innovation and participation in this emerging field.  FTSRO will be focused on developing and implementing best-practices standards to cover areas such as crypto asset classification (i.e. determination if a crypto asset is a currency/commodity, a utility token, a securities token, a collectible or other special purpose token, etc.).  In addition, FTSRO will establish model standards for Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) that participants can utilize to ensure consumers and investors are protected against fraud and market manipulation.  Founders of FTSRO will play a role in the organization from the beginning, demonstrating their commitment to “light-touch” self-regulation that ensures that compliance is not expensive or cumbersome and that innovation continues to define and refine one of the most significant developments in the history of commerce.  BTRIC’s Chair of the Board of Trustees, Terri Lei Beideman, stated, “The founding of FinTech SRO is an important step in bringing regulatory clarity to a field that is often confusing and even, in some ways, contradictory.  By sharing information and resources among members and working with regulators, FTSRO will move this industry, which began as a small movement just under ten years ago, forward with constructive and practicable standards and guidance.  FTSRO provides a vehicle to ensure consumers and investors are protected and that crypto asset businesses and other participants are legally compliant while still accommodating the fast pace of innovation in this quickly growing field.”  Persons and businesses interested in participating as a founder of FTSRO, or those interested in contributing to the FTSRO organization fund, should contact BTRIC at ftsro@btric.org.  The concept for FTSRO, which is evolving as more people get involved, is described in this blog article.  About BTRIC: Blockchain Technology Research Innovations Corporation is a U.S. based 501(c)(3) non-profit economic development organization that is focused on the emerging technology field.  Within this field, BTRIC operates a business incubator and startup accelerator, a best-practices standards development, educational, and outreach initiative, and a research and development laboratory.  Due to the global nature of emerging technologies, we also operate a related U.K. based charitable organization (BTRIC UK) to enable contributions from donors located in the United Kingdom, European Union, Iceland, Norway, and Lichtenstein.  Contributions to BTRIC and BTRIC UK may be tax-deductible or eligible for other tax relief to the extent allowed by law.  Contact your tax advisor for more information.

We are poised to accomplish great things.  This is a unique opportunity in world history to make a difference in ways that will outlive all of us.  Bitcoin has proven that the control that banks have had over our lives, our businesses, even our governments, will and IS slipping away.  More people see that their lives have been managed by ""gatekeepers"" and the Internet makes those structures ripe for dismantling.  Even better, people are ready for it as well.  They see the truth, the traditional gatekeepers are no longer needed and for most, no longer wanted.  Technology, economics, and societal attitudes have come together at this moment in history.  We either seize it or we don't, and I'm of the mind that we need to make the absolute most of this chance to bring society to the next level.  Both in developed countries and also in the developing world which has been held back, in many ways, by forces of a corrupted form of capitalism.  We support true, free-market capitalism and want to do our part in bringing down the corrupted form and promoting fair, honest, transparent free-market economies.  Bitcoin proves it can be done.  Now we do it everywhere, with the many applications that distributed ledgers can be applied towards.  I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about our organization.  Feel free to reach out.

Though it was discussed in the whitepaper, the value of the BFD Token itself was not conveyed as clearly as it could have been.  Our organization is a hybrid 501(c)(3) that divests businesses as separate entities when they've completed incubation, so it is structurally a little different from ICO or ITO offerings you may be accustomed to.  To make this clearer, and to explain the value of being a BFD Token holder more clearly, please note that the following has been inserted into our announcement thread as well as the white paper.  If you have any questions, please feel free to PM me or contact me as shown in the first post on this thread.  I am available to discuss any aspect of BTRIC and the BFD Token fundraising campaign.  Best regards, Ben   Ongoing rewards for BFD Token holders (revised on January 18, 2018) In addition to being listed as a Founding Donor on our website and in our promotional materials (if you choose), BFD Token holders receive an additional, ongoing benefit.  An important benefit for holders of BFD Tokens is that they will be rewarded in some form by each project that completes the BTRIC Project Incubation Program.  For example, when we issue the “BTRIC Coin” (working name) token or cryptocurrency in the second quarter of 2018, all those holding BFD Tokens at the time/date of a “snapshot” (to be announced in advance) will receive a grant of BTRIC Coin.  You can read more about that in our white paper.  However, this is not limited to the issuance of our “BTRIC Coin”.  Every project that completes incubation and is divested from BTRIC as a separate business will have a publicized “snapshot” date/time.  All BFD Token holders as of that time/date will receive some benefit from the business that graduated from the incubation program as a separate business.  In this way, you are rewarded by every project that completes the Project Incubation Program for being among the first to support our organization.  One of the conditions for acceptance into BTRIC’s Project Incubation Program is that the project agrees to provide some reward or benefit to donors to their project, which specifically includes all BTRIC Founding Donors.  Because the projects vary in their business models, and will also vary in the jurisdictions they do business in, this reward will vary from project to project.  It could include (subject to applicable regulatory and legal requirements):    • Credits for use of their product or service;    • Free “not-for-resale” products;    • “Airdrop” coins or tokens;    • Buyback of coins or tokens; and/or    • Equity in the newly-created business.  By getting on board now as a BTRIC Founding Donor, you will receive benefits from each project that completes the BTRIC Project Incubation Program for as long as you continue to hold BFD Token.  If you transfer your BFD Token, the benefits will be given to holders of BFD Token as of the next “snapshot” time/date.",False

We put a lot of thought in how to deliver value to our token holders over the long-term.  Having spent much of my professional career managing non-profit organizations, I knew the hybrid-model of incubating projects inside the non-profit and then divesting them as separate business entities will be a clear advantage to our token holders, especially with benefits for each project to launch.

Yes this is the part that is easy to misunderstand.  There is ongoing rewards for those that hold BFD Tokens.  Our structure of a 501(c)(3) charity that creates businesses was carefully thought through in consideration of applicable laws and regulations.  The businesses that BTRIC creates will NOT be non-profits, they will be completely separate businesses.  The non-profit is the business incubator.  Basically, the incubator exists in order to create better ICO/ITO offerings.  I think we've all seen a good amount of half-baked ICO/ITOs.  That's one of the main things we are trying to improve.  When projects complete the incubation process, they'll be top-shelf ICO/ITO offerings, fully investment-grade and ready for rapid growth.  The reason to be a BTRIC Founding Donor and contribute to the BFD Token fundraising campaign is because BFD Token holders will be rewarded in some way by each project that emerges from the incubation program.  Oh, and the tax deduction doesn't hurt either.  Hope this explains how it works a little clearer.  Best regards, Ben",False

Yes, in fact we did extend our fundraiser.  It now ends on March 31.  We're going to do everything we can to bring people's attention to our project and some of the ways it can be a real benefit to the community as a whole.  I am reaching out to some investors as well as a few others that I might be able to get to cover our organization on their blogs and news sites.  We just updated our website to move more towards ""operating"" than just a fundraising site.  That will continue as we get more momentum.  I had an unexpected project fall in my lap in the middle of January from a past client that lost the only member of their staff that knew how to fully operate the system, so I spent some time documenting how to operate and maintain it and training the replacement person.  I was still engaged with BTRIC but under the circumstances felt it was the right thing to do given that they'd reached out to me with a bit of urgency (it's a system that runs payroll taxes for a pretty large healthcare business, and they had filing deadlines of January 30).  I'm now able to devote full-time effort into spreading the word and getting BTRIC going, hit the ground running.  I believe in BTRIC and the things we're going to accomplish and know that many others see the need for and the benefits of an organization like it.  ""Marketing"" this type of organization is a little different from a traditional ICO because of it's nature, but I'm going to reach out to everyone I can to spread the word.  Most people are very enthusiastic once they understand what we're about, which is great because I'm really enthusiastic about BTRIC and our potential.  I am going to check out your thread about Bitcoin champs.  There are a lot of ways that the community can support each other with all of the amazing things that are taking place.

Only 500,000 BFD will ever be minted, and all of them go to those that participate in this crowdfunding campaign as Founders.    By participating, you become a BFD Token holder and receive these unique benefits exclusively for our Founding Donors:  You can choose to be featured on our website (name/logo/URL) as a Founding Donor.  This is a great way for people or organizations to demonstrate their commitment to leading the emerging technology industry through the founding of new organizations devoted to supporting the rapidly evolving field. You will receive a free grant of ""BTRIC Coin"" (code name) when it is launched later this year. You will be given rewards from each project that completes the BTRIC Innovations Incubator program.  We're getting started with three projects and we intend to build our organization until we're launching at least one new business each month.  As a BFD Token holder, you will be rewarded from all of these projects.   What is BTRIC and what does it do?   BTRIC is short for Blockchain Technology Research Innovations Corporation.  We're a 501(c)(3) economic development organization.  Our mission is to build promising emerging technology projects into great startup businesses, through business incubation and acceleration, and to advocate, educate, and research about the benefits that emerging technology is bringing to humanity.  As a non-profit, we do not have investors—we have donors.  However, like other non-profit economic development organizations, our donors are uniquely positioned to become investors in the businesses that launch from our Innovations Incubator program.  Of course, the rules about investing are complicated and in a state of flux, but as each project launches as an independent business, they will reward their donors in some form (legally compliant based on their business model and the jurisdiction in which they choose to form their business).  This provides tangible benefits to our donors.  In addition, as a non-profit, we are uniquely positioned to provide our BTRIC Institute and BTRIC Labs programs that benefit the entire emerging technology ecosystem.  BTRIC has been awarded the GuideStar Platinum Transparency Seal, the highest recognition that GuideStar offers, demonstrating our commitment to operational and financial transparency.  Contributions to BTRIC – monetary, asset, and in-kind – may be tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. Consult with a qualified tax advisor for more information.  [Learn more about BTRIC: WEBSITE  ▬  FAQ]     BTRIC’s Innovations Incubator program is a project incubator and startup accelerator for emerging technology businesses.  We identify projects with great potential and transform them into businesses which we help launch.  By promoting best practices, focusing on delivery of the project, and handling administration so projects can focus on ideas, we create better businesses, one at a time.  Donations from people, businesses, organizations, and grants financially support projects while they’re in the program.  When they launch, they are divested from BTRIC into independent business entities.  All projects in the program commit to providing contributors with rewards once they’ve launched as businesses.  The first three projects in our Innovations Incubator program are code named as follows:  Bitcoin for Good: This project is creating a platform enabling donations to be made to any recognized charity.  With an ""Amazon Smile""-like experience and integrations for major shopping cart platforms and that will be marketed to major online retailers, donations to the charities will be paid in Bitcoin.  This increases the adoption of crypto assets as well as provides financial support to charitable organizations.  This business will launch in the second or third quarter of 2018.    [Learn more about Bitcoin for Good...] Cryptocurrency Federal Credit Union: This project is exploring the possibility of creating a U.S.-based Federal Credit Union that specializes in accounts for cryptocurrency users and businesses.  The first step is to conduct a statistically-valid survey of the proposed national scope of membership (crypto users and businesses).  If the survey is successful, then the work to prepare an application for a Federal Credit Union charter will be undertaken. If chartered, this credit union will help cryptocurrency users and businesses as they face ever-increasing challenges with the legacy banking and financial services industry.    [Learn more about Cryptocurrency Federal Credit Union...] Sea to Table: Utilizing a special purpose blockchain and IoT technology, this project will create a tracability system that will trace seafood, which is highly subject to fraud and misrepresentations, from the point of capture, farming, or import through to the point of sale.  In the United States, Federal regulations will mandate the use of seafood tracibility systems to reduce IUU (Illegal, Unreported, and Unmonitored) fishing and seafood fraud.  This business will launch in early 2019 with a product ready for fishermen, seafood importers, and fisheries management bodies.    [Learn more about Sea to Table...]  We will be developing an application and review process to admit new projects into our Innovations Incubator program during the second and third quarters of 2018.

[Learn more about BTRIC Innovations Incubator: ON OUR WEBSITE  ▬  FAQ]     BTRIC Institute is our advocacy, education, and policy development initiative.  Working across the emerging technology industry, it is important for common ground in the areas of standards, policies, and regulatory flexibility be developed and maintained.  There exist volumes of great concepts that don’t get as wide of an audience as they deserve.  At the same time, there is a need to develop and promote best-practices for organizations in the industry, as well as develop and implement educational programs that help the ecosystem as a whole.  Women and Diversity: It is important to promote greater diversity, including participation by women, both in emerging technology projects as well as end users. Effective Advocacy: Working with other organizations, we focus on developing and advocating common-sense, light-touch regulatory frameworks that enhance—not stifle—innovation. Reference Repository: We host a reference library of materials, both current and historical, to ensure that the records of the rapidly evolving emerging technology industry are quickly and easily accessible. Open Frameworks: We collaborate across the emerging technology industry to develop open frameworks for best-practices security, KYC/AML/CFT policies, crypto asset evaluation criteria, and others. Educational Outreach: We develop educational materials that are freely available to all.  We use them to conduct educational outreach to ensure that the public, policymakers, and business leaders understand our industry and the ways that it is reshaping society. Best-practices Standards: We work with legal advisors and other experts to develop open standards that can be used by the community for business formation and management, governance, project management, and other standards.  BTRIC Institute, through teamwork and collaboration with other organizations, plays a role in meeting this important need.  [Learn more about BTRIC Institute: ON OUR WEBSITE  ▬  FAQ]     BTRIC Labs focuses on conducting technology research and development that is not specific to any given project in our Innovations Incubator program.  The work done by BTRIC Labs could have applications in multiple projects or in the emerging technology industry as a whole.  By conducting “blue sky” research, we work to advance the leading edge of emerging technology.  Through BTRIC Labs our employees are also encouraged to contribute to open source projects of their choosing.  We believe it is vitally important to contribute to the projects that underpin much of the emerging technology ecosystem.  BTRIC Labs also provides offers to provide, on a cost recovery basis, support to carefully selected emerging technology projects that have a need for infrastructure or systems that are operated independently of their project.  [Learn more about BTRIC Labs: ON OUR WEBSITE  ▬  FAQ]     Our Launch Fundraising Campaign is open now through March 31, 2018.  This is your only chance to obtain BFD Tokens directly from BTRIC and be a BTRIC Founding Donor.  BTRIC’s mission is to work with great projects and transform them into awesome businesses through our Innovations Incubator program.  Once they’re ready, we launch them as separate entities, ready for investment and primed for growth.  We also focus on industry-wide advocacy, educational, and research efforts to promote best-practices and smart approaches to changing the world through decentralization and other emerging technologies.  BTRIC Founding Donors receive BFD Tokens, which are Ethereum ERC20 tokens.  Holders of BFD Tokens will be rewarded by every project that completes our Innovations Incubator program.  Now, strictly speaking, you shouldn’t consider BFD Tokens to be an investment (as that has specific legal meaning), but when projects are launched as businesses they will provide rewards to all those that then hold BFD Tokens.  Each business launch will specify the rewards that are given for that business (which is subject to applicable legal and regulatory requirements).  These could include:  Credits for use of their product or service; Free “not-for-resale” products; “Airdrop” coins or tokens; Buyback of coins or tokens; and/or Equity in the newly-created business.  BFD Token holders will also receive a grant of “BTRIC Coin” cryptocurrency or token when it is issued.  BTRIC Founding Donors can choose to be permanently recognized on our website and in our materials as a Founding Donor.  (This is optional, we won’t list your name/business name, website, logo, and URL unless you give us permission!)

Only those donors that participate in this campaign will be able to be recognized as BFD's (on our website if they choose as a Founding Donor).  Check out our white paper for more details on that.  One of the challenges where we we're focusing on making a difference is in increasing the quality of projects that emerge as investment offerings.

Looking at the CoinMetro white paper very briefly, I completely agree with the need for cryptocurrency to become much easier to use from an end-user perspective.  If crypto is going to replace much of banking, it needs to be at least as easy to use as a payment card.  In my view, that's the bar that must be met or exceeded in order for the paradigm-shift to really take hold.

Yes we have spent a lot of time focusing on the best way to deliver real value to our donors and others in the emerging technology community.  Being able to focus on aspects that aren't often considered and implemented as well as they need to be has given us a great perspective on how to do this.  One example is the need for projects to have a close examination of how their project is governed. It needs to be sufficient but not overbearing -- more fluid and dynamic approaches that remain focused on the goal and mission can be the key that separates a successful project that delivers from one that is ""a great idea"", but had stumbling blocks.

For the BTRIC Founding Donor Token (BFD), We have EtherDelta in process.  We are also working on other exchanges and want to seek feedback from our donors as to their preferences.  Some of the exchanges we are talking with require that we not discuss them by name (and also sign an NDA) until the listing is active or they reserve the right to ban the token.  Do you have particular exchanges that you believe are essential?  We want to be responsive to our donors.  As far as ""BTRIC Coin"" (working name)... this is a cryptocurrency or token that will be issued in 2018 Q2.  All holders of BFD Token as of a snapshot date/time (to be publicized in advance) will be granted an amount of BTRIC Coin for each BFD they possess at the time of the snapshot.  We do not yet know if BTRIC Coin will be a cryptocurrency with its own blockchain or will be a token, and if so, what platform it will be deployed on.  We are going to consult with advisors concerning the stability and resilience of the Ethereum platform as we do have some concerns about both.  Also, if we do deploy our own blockchain, again, we are going to do so under advisement of experts.  We do not want our organization to make a poor decision and cause harm to our reputation, so that's something that will be carefully considered as we move towards the launch of the coin.  If you have any more questions, please let me know.  Have a great day.  Best regards, Ben",False

Currently our BFD Token IDO fundraising campaign is in progress, so the full supply of BFD Tokens are stored in a secure paper wallet in our custody.  After the sale concludes (which may be sooner than February 15 at the current rate of contributions), we will distribute all of the BFD to those that contributed.  Our white paper says within 10 days from the close of the IDO, but it will very likely be done on or before February 19, which is the Monday after the IDO ends.  We are working with EtherDelta to ensure that our donors are able to exchange BFD tokens after they are distributed.  We are open to suggestions from our donors on other exchanges to ensure that donors are able to exchange their tokens easily.  Some of this cannot be announced in advance due to NDAs that they require.  But on our side, at BTRIC, we will do whatever we can to ensure that the token is listed on global exchanges as well as regional exchanges if there is sufficient donor interest in that region.  Now, an important factor to keep in mind is that all that hold BFD Tokens will be given a grant of ""BTRIC Coin"" (working name), which will be either a different token or a cryptocurrency, when it launches in the second quarter of 2018.  This is different from BFD (BTRIC Founding Donor) Tokens, and we are not sure yet which platform it will be issued on (if a token), or which codebase it will be forked from (if a cryptocurrency).  We are going to consult with crypto engineers on the mechanics of the BTRIC Coin, we want to make the right design decisions for a secure and resilient token or currency.  However, to repeat, all BFD Token holders will be given a grant of the BTRIC Coin when that launches.  This will not be an exchange, you'll be able to keep your BFD Token.  We want to reward our Founding Donors for supporting our organization in its initial launch phase.  Besides the BFD Token, founding donors can also have their name/business name, logo, and website forever listed on our website and recognized in our materials as founding donors.  We are in this for the long-term, and want our Founding Donors to be recognized as the leaders of the industry in bringing about this organization.  We also welcome participation from our donors and the community at large in our projects and even in our governance.  Our mission for BTRIC is to create an organization that:  - helps promising projects become investment-ready businesses (BTRIC Project Incubator Program); - advances causes that are for the common good of the emerging technology industry (such as advocating against regulations that would harm the industry, educational outreach, and promoting more women and diversity in projects and as users of crypto and other emerging technologies); - researches solutions to problems faced across the field (BTRIC Labs).  As a non-profit charity, we are formed for the good of the entire ecosystem.  Our projects graduate from the incubator program and become separate businesses.  We see it as a way to take a project from a ""great idea, let's make it happen"" phase to the ""investment-grade, ready to launch"" phase.  Like a traditional business incubator, but focused on emerging technologies like cryptocurrency, distributed ledger, and IoT.  These are the technologies that are going to reshape society, we want to do our part to make that happen!  If you have any more questions, please don't hesitate to ask.  Best regards, Ben",False
