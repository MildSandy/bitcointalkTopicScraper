I will try to clarify it here.  We are raising money for platform development, marketing, operations and legal costs (Whitepaper)  We are not building another $5k-$10k app to spam app stores, we are building an App that is eBay/Craigslist killer. For the reference, LetGo mobile app in the same niche, but with no any ""special sauce"" at all raised over $200m+ to become visible and competitive. It's a huge market and a big game.  Minimum goal is set to 1eth, which means we are not contingent on ICO for development, we are just giving away opportunity to participate in project and make it success alot faster  This is important - SGG coin has no affect on decentralization, decentralization is an app on your phone. Coin will pre-buy you premium services at big discount that would be available to purchase in-app with different crypto's as well.  And the last note on ICO's generally I strongly believe this is the future of seed/angel/venture capital, it's not mature yet, and there always scams/risks/hackers involved, but if you ever dealt with startup accelerators,  elevator pitches, smoke and mirrors, 'angels' and funds you would agree that ICO's is light years ahead in efficiency, transparency with no BS and 'secret handshakes', exactly the way it should be.",False

In our development we’ve been considering partnering with OB (still possible in future), but had to take a separate approach due OB limitations and different priorities and goals. Main differences are:  StuffGoGo is mobile first (desktop second), it runs natively on phones, it's an app. OB is a heavy desktop application Important: our app is not frontend to some server running ""distributed"" system, it's a actual node which creates this network. You are the network. From beginning we integrate auctions and Craigslist-style listings, including community and personal posts. No such thing in OB, not even considered. We build-in internal currency (SGG) and integrated multi-crypto wallet You can turn off your phone, but your items would still be for sale. OB slowly getting in this direction for next version We will have Integrated search, which works on protocol level. OB uses external ""crawlers"" and centralized servers for this, which is bad. No geek required approach - focused on usability, users should not even bother that they use distributed app - it'll work from their perspective totally conventionally  Another important note - depending on licensing, as of now OB uses MIT - we can bootstrap our app with OB network and can display OB items in our app and allow buy-it-now items to be pushed back to OB network. Will work with Brian Hoffman on that... 41000 listings from day 1.",False

I have suggestion for developers to have beta test net web app or mobil app before launching ICO. If the test net in 2019 or 2020  I think ICO like this not worth investing. How about Stuffgogo?,False

Fixed in WP. We initially considered deriving bounties from 50% of tokens made available for participants, but decided that it should come from company foundation, so all 500m are delegated to crowdsale contract (pls see in github) and distribution rules as follows:  50% (500 million tokens) will be available to participants; 2% (20 million tokens) allocated for bounty 38% (380 million tokens) will remain in the SGG Global Foundation 10% (100 million tokens) will be distributed among team members",False

Roadmap would be posted on a website tonight with very detailed project plan to follow as a separate document. I will post update on that. Most of our team is in software engineering for 20+ years, so we will stick to these timelines. In short, this is it:  - test net previews/regular dev builds would be available to beta-testers Q4  '17 via TestFlight/etc - we will have MVP of application deployed to Apple App Store and Google Play Store with sufficient features to satisfy early adopters and build the ecosystem early in Q1 '18 - full featured app v1.0 available to download in Q3 '18 with multi-crypto wallet integrated in the app, auctions, domains, promotions and payed listings enabled with SGG token.",False
