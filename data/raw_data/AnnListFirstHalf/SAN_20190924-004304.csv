Hello all, long time no see.  Just wanted to let you know that we at Santiment are now making all of our historical data on Daily Active Addresses and Dev Activity publicly available for the first time. To our knowledge, this is the most extensive data set on these two metrics.  You can access the data right now by visiting SANbase, and selecting any token. You can plot both data points over the asset’s price and a few other metrics. Alternatively, you can also access them via our API  We think this data can be relevant for traders and investors for several reasons:  DAA appears to have strong correlation with the token's price, when observed over time. Dev Activity is gathered all wrong by popular data aggregators, so it becomes a useless metric. We actually had to build a 100% custom method for measuring Dev Activity, so that data can actually make sense.  There’s a lot more information on our blog - https://santiment.net/blog/daa-dev-activity-data/, but the bottom line is - this data is exhaustive, unique and now free.

In this case, yes, there will be a level of curators ensuring data integrity and also to provide analysis. Users are able to participate at any level, whether just as a consumer of data or a contributor to data collection or even being a curator to name a few.  There are several mechanisms we are exploring with smart contracts and one key component is staking SAN via smart contracts to access a higher level of data. Also, reward systems will also utilize it.  While a decent amount of data will be public, more advanced feeds will require the staking of SAN tokens for access.

Community whitelist 'maximum' amounts are scaled down to 1.2x of your minimum, this applies to everyone with a max of more than 10 ETH.

Quote And btw the ICO limits are not set yet, as the dev stated above.  This is absolutely true, the ICO limits are not set in stone. For example, it's entirely possible that we'll lower our maximum cap.   Quote But... which slack? Which blog? And how to follow reddit (sorry, never used it) and which channel/group to read? While I can follow new Bitcointalk threads to find promising project, I cannot imagine what you would mean by reading blog and slack..? One cannot read all the crypto blogs in internet or all join all the teams existing on Slack. And which reddit group is good for finding new crypto projects?  Hi Drays, I'll answer your questions the best I can.  Regarding slacks, many projects have slack rooms specifically for their communities. You can find the Santiment slack room on our website, or get an invite directly from this link: https://santiment-slack.herokuapp.com/  Slack is our preferred place for community discussion, because we can have focused investing, trading, and product design discussions there.  For blogs, there are many blogs, but here is our medium publication: https://medium.com/santiment You can also follow our individual editors on that publication, Maksim and Mitchell.  For reddit, we're more active on the r/Ethtrader and r/Ethereum reddits, though we also participate in a few others. Simply google them and take a look. I'd recommend lurking in the communities for a week or two to learn more about it before making your own account and diving in. Other interesting reddits include:  I know it's hard to follow all the material, so I'd say don't bother; When you study, go DEEP on the subject so that you can appreciate new information when it comes out. That way you can also get to know the community, which is a lot of fun!   I hope you decide to join the Santiment community, but this information applies to lots of other projects too. I hope to see you in our slack!",False

I’d like to take a few minutes to describe the progress we’ve made and share our plans for the future. This is the first of our regular investor updates that will be shared monthly.  We are on track to start providing access to ICNX trading features to the next round of pre-registered beta testers by the end of February 2017.  Digital Assets Management Platform has undergone extensive testing ever since its launch in December 2016, with our whole team tirelessly working to perfect the platform for the public launch. There are currently 10 test users operating with ICNX, which is at the moment worth around 30k USD. Despite the fact that our core platform was ready by late December, we decided to delay the public launch. There were two key reasons for that decision.  The first reason for this was user experience that did not meet our standards. With initial UX designs geared towards the eventual full-featured platform, the experience of buying and selling ICNX was simply too complex. We believe that our product manager and user experience expert have solved this issue, which means that we can deliver a seamless and enjoyable ICNX trading experience.  The second reason is the current state of digital asset liquidity. We realised this during the late stages of ICNX development. If we did not implement any safeguards, it would be extremely easy for ICONOMI digital asset arrays to substantially affect the price of digital assets, leading to loss of value and opening the door for potential abuse. This is partially solved by instituting liquidity thresholds for asset inclusion in ICNX and imposing dynamic buying limits based on current market situation. However, with funds like Blue Magic Capital, an up and coming hedge fund on the ICONOMI platform, including digital assets with less than $5,000 daily volume, we realised that a much more robust and automated system would have to be developed. We have started working on this challenge, but there is a lot of work ahead of us. If you are a data scientist interested in solving this kind of problem, get in touch with us!  I would also like to update you on other ICONOMI activities. While the developers are a crucial part of the team, almost half of the ICONOMI team are not developers and work on tasks like business development, investment evaluation, ICO mentoring, customer acquisition strategy, customer support and legal affairs.  We are actively looking for investments for the ICONOMI.performance. Until now we have acquired assets in Golem, Byteball and today Santiment. In front of us there is an intensive investment period.  A solid relationship with the crypto ecosystem is crucial for our business to grow, which is why we presented ICONOMI at Ethereum Developers Community in the San Francisco Bay Area on 7th February we spoke at The Blockchain Event in Fort Lauderdale on 9th, and we will be at the Ethereum meetup in Vienna on 14th, EDCON Paris on 17th and 18th February, and the Cryptoinvestors meetup in Munich, Germany on 7th March.   Your sincerely, The ICONOMI team   ",False

Thank you to everyone that participated!   Santiment is the worlds' datafeeds hub and content platform for cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects. Santiment aims to be the market data infrastructure that supports the worlds' growing blockchain economy.   TOKEN SALE INFO:  Santiment's token sale will start on June 30th, 2017, at 23:50 GMT. Min/Max caps are below. The total cap will be split into 3. The first for our community, the second for Cofound.it Priority Pass members, and the third for the public. All 3 groups are guaranteed at least some portion.  Minimum: 15,000 ETH      Maximum: 45,000 ETH  UPDATE: PRESALE STARTED AND CONCLUDED ON FEB 12th, ENTIRELY SOLD OUT!   The Santiment Vision & Market Overview  Santiment will be the financial market data and content platform of choice for cryptocurrency and blockchain space, filling the role that Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters serve in traditional financial markets. Santiment offers datafeeds and content streams (including newswires) alongside a regularly updated database of cryptocurrency projects. Its long term goal is to be the market data infrastructure for cryptocurrency and blockchains.  The market for Santiment services are the following: Wealth and hedge fund managers, newcomer traders, and data vending channels. Wealth and hedge fund managers are looking for a diverse set of useful datafeeds, often for quantitative trading. Newcomers prefer more digestible content that gives them insight into market trends. Data vending channels like exchanges (eToro, Bittrex, Kraken) and asset management platforms (ICONOMI, Melonport) are looking for ready-to-go data solutions that give them a competitive advantage. For all these parties, Santiment has a solution to offer. The mainstream market data market size was over $28 billion in 2016, and this market will reach a similar proportion as the crypto-markets grow.   Market Problem and the Santiment Solution  There’s a serious problem in the blockchain space; We’re building the future of finance, yet we lack the tools to trade effectively. Reliable market intelligence is very hard to come by; instead there is a constant flow of misinformation. And where are the crypto-specific datafeeds and analytics? Trading journals? Basic tools? It's apparent that the crypto-markets run on crowd sentiment, yet there is no way to get this kind of data either. There are major problems beyond those in the crypto-markets. In particular, the lack of verifiable information and usable data makes crypto-traders and investors vulnerable to dramatic information asymmetry and scams. Santiment solves these problems with hard data and market insights.  https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57cbba3c197aea06e480c072/t/5878d9173a04113301b4214e/1474097451010/?format=1000w  As traders, we want to trade with discipline, identify and correct flaws, and boost profitability. Santiment is building the datafeeds platform and tools to solve these problems, while creating a new information standard for trading in cryptocurrency and blockchain assets. With datafeeds on market sentiment and blockchain activity, users will be able to monitor the markets in real time. By creating a transparent database of projects, Santiment gives investors a means of identifying and avoiding scams. When combined with objective datafeeds and expert-curated content, these solutions give subscribers a trading advantage while mitigating risk.  http://brighteyelabs.com/clients/santiment/sentiment_graph_1.jpg http://brighteyelabs.com/clients/santiment/sentiment_graph_2.jpg  But first, the products: We're creating a set of trading tools within a crypto-bloomberg terminal that'll make systematized improvement easy, while giving you market data you can't find anywhere else. These include:  A datafeeds platform focused on CROWD SENTIMENT and BLOCKCHAIN ANALYTICS Streams of Expert-Curated Content Aggregated Newswires An Open Database of Crypto-Projects (the Santiment Database, aka the SANbase) And more to come...   Core Documents  Early Product + Roadmap Santiment has a working mobile app, at the alpha stage. It consists of a historical price feed and charts, a trollbox sentiment feed, and a sentiment journaling game. This combination of feeds is the foundation for a growing mobile terminal. Santiment aims to have a functioning mobile and web terminal by early 2018, with thousands of datafeeds by 2019.  Want to learn more? Here are some of our core documents, though the new versions are not yet released:  START HERE with our project summary in a 1-pager document: Santiment 1-Pager (2 min read) Here's our WHITEPAPER, which provides a broad overview: YET TO BE RELEASED Finally, here's our Token Sale SMART CONTRACT, for public examination. There is a bug bounty available for any flaws found: YET TO BE RELEASED   Token Economics & Structure  The Santiment Network Token Prototype (SAN) is a coupon issued in Switzerland according to FINMA regulation. By staking SAN, users and exchanges get access to free streams of information and feeds. By letting large parties (like exchanges and asset management platforms) stake large amounts of tokens to give free content to their users, Santiment will expand faster.  It is also the sole means of purchasing exclusive datafeeds and content (mostly sentiment-related) available via auctions. By letting SAN holders bid for Santiment's most valuable data, we ensure we get the fairest and most accurate price relative to the value. Non-exclusive services are available for fiat subscriptions.  Strategic Partners  TO BE ANNOUNCED SOON!
