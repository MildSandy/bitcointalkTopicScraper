We are pleased to inform you about the completion of the first stage of development of our product. At the moment the following functions are implemented:    1. Storage of BTC, BCH, ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, ESR, USD, EUR;    2. Instant currency conversion at a favorable rate;    3. Sending any currency to the ESR Wallet users (using their e-mail addresses, for example);    4. Two-factor authentication using Google Authentificator.  Unfortunately, due to technical works on the KYC / AML provider's line, the function of user verification is unstable nowadays. This problem will be solved in the very near future. We decided not to wait for the solution of this problem, since it is not on the side of ESR Wallet and we would like to share with you the work done for today.  For security reasons for the first time we have set small limits for all operations. This is a temporary measure, and soon the limits will be increased.  Now, as for ESR Wallet cards. We think everyone is already aware of the news about the termination of VISA's work with all crypto-payment companies. This affected the integration period with the card service and significantly complicated our task as we already had signed agreements with VISA card‚Äôs providers.  At the moment we are at the stage of obtaining a financial license in the territory of Gibraltar - this is a requirement that was presented to us by a card provider working with the Mastercard system. State regulation of crypto-currency in Gibraltar began only now, and the procedure for obtaining a license takes 3 months. Unfortunately, at the moment there is no faster legal way to create banking cards with cryptocurrency support.  Based on the circumstances, we decided to close the ICO on February 7, 2018, regardless of the amount collected.  Why did we have $ 8M collected in our plans? The fact is that for today we have more than 20 thousand pre-orders for the ESR card, and to ensure uninterrupted operation with so many customers it is necessary to keep a sufficiently large amount of money on prefunded accounts of the company. The less money we collect during the ICO, the less clients can use the service at the first stage. The amount of funds raised will not affect our plans to implement the entire planned ESR Wallet functional list, but it will reduce the number of clients that will be able to get their cards in the near future. With the growth of the company's revenue, we will increase our customer base and attract new clients.  Options for loans and deposits will be available to ESR Wallet customers right after connecting the card service. ESR Wallet versions for iOS and Android will be available for you within 2 months.  The ESR Wallet Token will be traded on the Livecoin.net exchange. We found this to be a good option: the exchange itself has been established long ago and has significant trading volume. Now there is a process of adding an ESR token to exchange, it will be completed by February 28, 2018. The exact time of the token listing will be announced as news from Livecoin arrives.  In addition our token will still be available for sale on the Orderbook exchange. Negotiations on cooperation with other exchanges are also underway.  On behalf of the entire ESR Wallet team, we are very grateful to all ESR Wallet investors for your patience and support. We assure you that we are trying our best to achieve the goals set and are working 24/7 to do it in the very near future!",False

Let me use your points to keep it straight.  1. 100 M - we were saing from the very beginning that our goals are much lower. That is only maximum amount - nothing more. Also - we were saing that product will be finished with any summ collected.  2. Orderbook - yes, there are several problems with that platform, we even had thoughts to start selling Tokens on other platforms couple weeks ago, but now to finish the project development in the 1-st priority task for us. We didn't know that problem before we started the pre-sale.  3. Well, all Tokens are locked on orderbook - you are right, and this platform has its problems (read ‚Ññ2) - but to change anything here for us is really more complicates, than to launch the Wallet itself.  4. Read ‚Ññ2 - it's orderbook platform problem.  5. Well, and what is the problem with that? Our front team is in USA at first - ESReliable - but even if we consider only russian part of team - we have launched the biggest car-wash network in our segment, that have several IT applications, that is working in 8 counties; we have been listed in Forbes top-lists for the last 3 years. If that is nothing for you - I have only to congratulate you.  6. All the cryptoworld can be called a huge redflag then. We see coins getting 300% growth for a day's time;  but more important - we have huge experience in working in financial field. Read more about ESReliable Investments.  7. Our ATM network grows rapidly - no worries with that. All the mistakes and inaccuracies will be corrected.  8. All these rating are being paid. We don't have any task to show-off in such way.  9. So?...  10. Please read PS section.  11. These are not fake followers - that are followers who came from advertisement.  12. Part of American team used to work there, nothing else is said.   PS, Thank you for such interest in our project! Summarizing all the 12 Red Flags - you are not sure in us, you see meny problems and so on. The important thing is that we don't want to spend extra money on ads and noice about project - we will have our Wallet finished soon and it will be better than any advertising. Then you will see that all your worries were unreasonable. Thank you once again! ",False

Guys! Are you getting paid for all those scam enthusiastic reviews?!?!?  You are telling people to put money in something, because of the nice looking web-site?

Just check the projects with a similar market cap. and see how strong they are, what team do they have, etc. Just compare.  2) Orderbook has zero liquidity for ESR token. You can't sell any significant amount - there are no buyers.  3) The token is not listed anywhere else, so there is no way to get rid of it.  3) ESR Wallet rep. said in this thread that they are setting up the ""market"" price at orderbook MANUALLY! Looks like a scam and nonsense at the same time.  4) More reliable and respectful card-projects like TenX, Cryptopay, Wirex recently were dropped from Visa network and still doesn't have a solution to this issue. I bet ESR never could make a deal with VISA.  5) Strategic managers are two russian guys with CAR WASH background. Are you kidding me?!    6) ESR promises per annum rate 20% for deposits. That is a HUGE red flag. Ridiculous! Looks like Ponzi scheme.  7) Information that ""ESR ATM is the largest ATM network in Florida"" is FALSE. Just google it.

The legal part is another shadow area.  9) The team has no recognizable people in crypto-world.  10) Hype score is zero. No drivers for growth.  11) Facebook and Twitter ESR accounts has tons of FAKE followers.

On 18 of December, 2017, we are starting our ICO.  2 months have passed since the end of pre-ICO, and our team was able to do a great scope of work during this time.  Many ask us a question, how ESR Wallet differs from similar projects like TenX and Monaco. The answer is simple: we don‚Äôt create an ordinary electronic wallet, but a convenient and customary banking tool with cryptocurrency support and with all popular services: loans, deposits and trust management.  Issue of ESR plastic cards will revolutionize the field of blockchain-fintech, because now you can literally pay crypto for any everyday purchases! Neither of those alike projects, nor anybody else has realized the operation of cryptocurrency cards yet‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthat points not only at technical complexity, but also at complexity of legal tasks to be solved for the implementation of such product.  Fortunately, we are close to the solution and hope to become the first full-fledged cryptocurrency bank.  The basic functionality of the wallet will be launched for everyone as soon as possible. Functions of storage, sending, currency conversion will be available. Until the end of the ICO we will release our first cards and announce the full launch of the ESR Wallet service.  We would like to express our gratitude to our investors for their patience and support. The ESR Wallet team is working on the product 24/7 and we are doing our best to justify the hopes entrusted to us!",False

We think that our Tokens are bought just besause investors are expecting their price to rise after sales. That‚Äôs true, but there are other ways how you can use them. Firstly, for Tokens the most profitable currency exchange rates will be available. Secondly, you will have an ability to pay for some operations with them as well - both inside the ESR Wallet's system (like fees) and outside (with our partners - some services will be sold for ESR Tokens)  ‚Äî so if you are after earning not only with the Token‚Äôs price growth, but with ESR Wallet itself, it‚Äôs better for you to get some.

IS this correct ? And if yes can you go in details how you gonna manage to do so !! BTW I like your website a lot .  Well, thank you for reading the whole 4 (now almost 5 pages) of our theme!) About 20% - yes, that's correct. If you join us during pre-sale or main ICO 20% profit annual profit program is available for you. No hidden details or small sized fonts, you support us and we show our gratitude - siimple as that. About ways to bring it to life - questions will come to ""where are you, guys, going to get enough money to make it possible?"" the answer is simple - credits and fees (like for currency exchanges and transactions). Don't forget that we have some experience in micro crediting business - we know all the how-to, and it's bringing enought to make 20% profits possible. About site - nice to hear that! Didn't you think it's over-informative in some ways?    Quote from: Alanaz on September 30, 2017, 03:10:29 PM wow, 50% discount, but why not bounty  Well, bounty will be available during main ICO, and now it's 40% discount coming to an end.

We work in cooperation of the licensed payment provider, it issues Visa and MC cards for us.  Quote from: Strike3urOut on September 21, 2017, 02:06:06 PM Stopped reading at $10 USD/Token. Unless they plan on releasing a limited amount of coins then this project is already overvalued.  Love how these new ICO's just pull numbers out of their ass. Why not $50 USD or $200 USD? Nothing on the white paper shows me that value. The ATMS they claim are generic ATMS that any major debit card can be used with and thats's if they can get approved by VISA or MS even at the prepaid level. Just see how well that went for MCO.

Definitely something to buy post ICO WHEN the price crashes down to about 15k Satoshi. Notice I didn;t say ""IF"" but WHEN. Happens to all the Overvalued ICOS.  Hello there. 1. There are ICOs with 10 cent Tokens and with 100$ Tokens. We decided that 10$ is optimal. Number of Tokens is limites of course, all data is available in our WP. 2. If compared with other alike projects (we are looking at Tenx and Monaco projects) - we have several advantages. The most important on my opinion is that our service already can operate with fiat money - now it is tested, the second - we are going to issue card to provide you with an ability to pay crypto anywhere (where card are accepted).

None of these options, we will make an emission of out Tokens using smart conrtact tech.  Quote from: Hackaton on September 22, 2017, 07:53:41 AM Now I have the Paytoo prepaid card.

Quote from: Mazt rhiezt on September 22, 2017, 05:55:28 PM is this card still in trial? or can you explain the advantages?  So, the big question. I'll try not to write a full poem)  The card is in trial, yes. For now it works only with fiat, no cryptocurrency payments. That is the thing still to be developed, but we are working on it.  Now about advantages: 1. We have deposits and crediting system for crypto. 20% annual profit in popular coins (the list will be growing) - doesn't that sound good? 2. Such services like currency exchange, money transactions, cashback system, merchant system (allows you to pay with crypto on popular websites) - see our project plan for the full list. We try to provide you with a functionality of a real bank. But with crypto. 3. Cards. We do think that the idea to pay with crypto anywhere (where cards are accepted) is musthave for such projects. 4. At last, our team. Our comand is strong enough to bring such project to life. We have winners of the worldwide programming competitions, we have guys who used to work in other e-wallets, almost all of us are graduates from world known universities (at this moment I felt kinda shy, but thats also true. If you need more details - just let me know). And thats not advisors or partners - its the team itself. 5. There are some others, but basically almost any alike project has smth like that, so do you really need to read something like ""Streight plan for every step of the project"", ""giant will to make all the best..."" and so on?  Thank you and welcome with other questions)",False
