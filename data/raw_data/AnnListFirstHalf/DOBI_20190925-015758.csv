The part about the consensus is really interesting. It is not the consensus on whether this or that particular ICO is good, but rather a consensus on how ICO analysis must be structured. We hope that as people will analyze ICOs they will collectively agree on a framework of ICO analysis that can answer questions like: ""What aspects are the most important in defining whether the ICO is trustowrthy or not?"" or ""How does a ""perfect"", in terms of trustworthiness and completeness of information, ICO look like?"". If such framework comes to existence, it will also enforce restrictions on the ICOs - they will have to adher to a ""code of conduct"" described in the framework to be taken seriously.  This is a big dream, but we hope that our platform will if not bring it about, then at least bring it closer to reality. Such framework will bring structure to the ICO market, which will benefit all.   Now, let's talk sentiment analysis. It is now susceptible to the problems you've described, but I'm actively working on overcoming them. Right now I'm finalizing a new implementation of the model that is based on Recurrent Neural Networks, which should improve overall quality of sentiment detection. I've included some tweaks that will help the model to recognize posts unrelated to the ICO itself as neutral, thus decreasing the extent of the problem you've described. There is also a problem with answers to posts - for example, if some poster says something negative about the project and the answer calls them ""an uneducated dummy"", the algorithm will label the answer as negative (because of negative lexicon), though it is clearly positive towards the project. I have an idea on how to overcome this, but I'll need some time for implementation. As for other social media besides BTT, don't worry - we are working on it!    It is indeed possible to see the expert's previous activity (though it depends on the widget design, we will include this in our basic expert widget). The 3 months aggregation period was decided with the following logic - the expert should be able to go on a vacation without losing their reputation, but prolonged inactivity should be punished. As for rating the expert's previous posts - we decided that the expert should only be rated in the current month, because it simplifies the rating system and makes it more robust to attacks. However, the situation that you've described can arise. One way to solve it for the Subscriber is to rate the expert in the current month for their previous activity. Though it is inelegant, and we will think of a better solution. Thank you for raising a point.    The main purpose of the community development fund is to attract early Experts and Authors and to fill the platform with content. The money will be used to subsidize new Experts and Authors, as well as attract well-known and respectable industry Experts to post on the platform. I think may peers will be able to tell you more about precise sums, but this is the general idea.   As for review structure - it depends on the widget design. The way we see our basic Expert widget is such - the Expert scores the main aspects of the project (i.e. idea, team, etc.) from 1 to 5 and will give a brief summary on each criteria, explaining why they have given this or that score. But anybody may create another Expert widget with entirely different review structure.",False

I really liked the developers’ idea and the way they are turning in to the reality, but I’d like you to clarify some points. You stated that there will be consensus forecast, so in what form is it going to be? As I understood, experts will create their own opinion with their own arguments, but how is it going to be consensus? Is it only about statistical representation of your platform’s experts’ suggestion whether invest in some particular ICO or not? Buy the way, I am very interested in your evaluation using machine learning. Well, it is useful, when you get information about market’ moods in a form as your widget provides, however, would it be effective? I mean it is not hard to find comments that are not really referred to some ICO’s theme or are not going with definitions «positive» or «negative», moreover there are only comments from bitcointalk. Please, tell more about how machine learning will be adopted. Besides, I am concerned about experts’ rating system. As it is written in whitepaper, experts have their payment based on 3 months result activity. Then how do you see the process of rating experts by subscribers? For example, some expert writes a review on some ICO with may be suggestion that its coins price is going to grow for 4 month, then a subscriber make an investing decision and after 4 month he or she goes to the review and rates the expert. In that particular case how would the expert be rated and payed? It happens that 4 months ago the expert could have different effectiveness than now, so his or her rating (and payment) is calculated by ratings given for present activity or by «marks» given in present? Also would it be possible to see at an expert’s previous activity and ratings? Additionally, as a potential investor I’d like to know more about allocation of funds, specially community development fund which includes education programs and learning materials. You are going to spend $2 300 000 on it, so It’d be great if you’ll be more concrete about it. And the last question is would Dolphin provide some roughly speaking criteria or benchmark about how experts should work and how to rate them? Just to make sure that the paid platform will not become a usual forum with tons of unorganized and vaguely useful information. Thank you very much in advance for paying attention to my personal concerns",False

And setting a maximum amount wouldn't help either - the ""whale"" can quite easily create another address and invest from it. It's not possible to prevent this without introducing complicated (and potentially game-theoretically faulty) designs into the crowdsale model.  If you're worried that these ""whales"" could undermine the platform's economy - don't worry! First, the individual Subscriber's influence scales logarithmically with their wealth, so a crowd of well-behaving subscribers will overwhelm a malicious subscriber with ease. Also, there will be a voting mechanism that will allow Subscribers to rescale the platform's prices if the DoBI/USD rate changes significantly. So the capabilities of ""whales"" in manipulating the platform are very limited.  Quote from: Dhcold on September 20, 2017, 02:52:02 PM I read your whitepaper and saw interesting point - self-promoting attack. Lets imagine the situation, for example, i am smart enough to create absolutely real fake accounts, and I will not only rate myself, but other amazing experts. If you think  that people lazy enough do not do this, believe me some are not. So, how you will protect honest and smart experts, who deserve big rating from this totally the same smart guys, which are a bit trickier and have a lot of free time ?                       It is practically impossible to completely block such an attack - a person crazy enough to spend troves of money on an attack would probably succeed. However, observe Bitcoin - its total cap is $66 billion, so a wealthy enough entity (some banks could probably do that with ease) could buyout all Bitcoin for $100 billion (considering the price will start to grow) and completely crash the system. But nobody does that, because crazy people rarely have enough money to blast everything to bits  The idea here is to create the system where such attack is not practically impossible, but economically infeasible. The potential profit from an attack must not be greater than its cost. So we introduce the aforementioned logarithmic scaling to cripple a wealthy malicious subscriber and force them to buy new accounts if they want to perform an attack. And so we try to design the system in such a way that buying Sybil accounts will cost more than the revenue from the possible reputation gain. To evade automatic detection an attacker will have to rate other experts both positively and negatively; but when you rate others positively, you increase their revenue and decrease yours! There is also a number of votes threshold and other counter-measures that will make the attacker spend more than they gain.",False

It combines evaluation using machine learning and evaluation by experts. The platform utilizes a smart contract to transparently distribute reward among experts based on their reputation and contribution. Reputation of an expert is based on investors' voting and automatic evaluations of expert’s forecasts. We will also promote third-party developers to create and sell their own applications build on top of the platform. Revenue will be distributed to application’s author according to application usage.  Our mission is to become the first crypto asset investment analysis marketplace and number one data source for ICO market analytics. Thanks to our platform the analysis of ICOs will become much faster and more efficient and experts will be able to build up their reputation and monetize their expertise. We are also establishing partnerships with crypto asset funds to provide them with ICO scoring functionality and private access to the best experts.   Key features Enhanced Analysis Speed The platform combines speed of machine learning algorithms with versatility and depth of expert evaluation to provide subscribers with tools for a swifter and more flexible decision-making process.  Collaboration The platform enables collaboration and knowledge sharing between participants, allowing for opinion variety and broadening the scope of analysis.  Expert rating system A transparent and attack-proof rating system allows the experts to make a profit out of their contributions  Smart Contract Core The rating system, revenue distribution and access to widgets are handled by a set of smart contracts, which provide objectivity and transparency  Community-driven development All update proposals to rating or revenue distribution system are voted on by the community and the platform evolves according to needs of users  Custom widgets Independent authors can create their own widgets and deploy them on the platform, enriching it with new features and simultaneously making profit   Economics Please check with our whitepaper chapter 4 where you can see our economic description, there you can find token allocation, our 3 business models and caps, and our 3 ""secret sauces"".

Bounty program Conditions of bounty program will be published after presale completion.   Token generation event conditions There will be two token generation events (TGE):    •   presale TGE (DBIP token)    •   main TGE (DOBI token + conversion of DBIP tokens to DOBI tokens)  At the presale TGE there’s two stages: private and then public. The cap for private TGE is set at 400’000 USD. If the milestone is not reached, the remainder will be open for public buyout at public stage. Otherwise the cap will be raised to 600’000 USD for the public stage so that investors without preliminary agreements can invest as well. During the presale the DBIP (Dolphin BI Presale) ERC20 token will be generated.  There is a 25% bonus during the preliminary TGE, i.e. DBIP tokens will be provided at 1 token per 0.8 USD. During the main TGE there will be no bonus and the primary DOBI token will be provided at 1 DOBI per 1 USD. We will perform a 1:1 conversion DBIP tokens to DOBI tokens before the main TGE.  DBIP tokens will be delivered to subscriber’s Ethereum account. The conversion rate will be calculated according to the ETH/USD rate at 9:00 UTC (GMT+0) with rate from https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/ethereum/.  We will accept BTC and other digital tokens from the subscribed subscribers during the private stage. In that case, the conversion rate is agreed upon by parties individually and DBIP tokens will be sent manually. The conversion rate will be calculated according to value of the provided tokens in USD at the end of previous day (per http://coinmarketcap.com).  Dolphin BI presale TGE will take place by two stages:    •   private token generation event from August 31th 13:00 - September 18th 2017 15:59 (GMT)    •   public token generation event from September 18th 16:00 - September 30th 2017 23:59 (GMT)  At the second stage, the participation is only possible through the Ethereum smart contract.  The volatility risk should be also considered. For example, if during the preliminary TGE 1 ETH is 200 USD, then the subscriber can receive 250 DBIP for 1 ETH (200/0.8). If 1 ETH is 300 USD at the moment of the main TGE then subscribers can receive 300 DOBI for 1 ETH, while preliminary subscribers will only receive 250 DOBI through the conversion. This is a common occurrence during ICOs. Therefore, we are ready to carry 50% of the volatility risk. We will compensate 50% of preliminary subscribers’ loss due to rate growth from the “team reward” part of the token distribution. In the aforementioned case, the preliminary subscriber will gain 275 DOBI, which will mitigate half of their losses. Automatic DBIP to DOBI conversion will be performed at the beginning of the TGE. This insurance bonus will be calculated according to the ETH/USD rate at the beginning of main TGE (per http://coinmarketcap.com).

A gateway with Waves Platfrom is planned to be implemented to allow a user to buy and sell DOBI tokens through the Waves Platfrom wallet and DEX.  Frontend is planned to be implemented as a webservice initially and then also a mobile apps will be developed (as descibed in our roadmap). If DApps become widely adopted we will think to implement our Frontend as DApp.  Widgets and Data Providers are to be implemented as Docker containers (we already have this architecture in beta.dolphin.bi).

Actually, the project itself started from analyzing distribution curves of ICO payments. We have found that for all solid ICOs the distributions after logarithmic transformation looked very similar (bell-shaped, so the underlying distribution could be considered Gaussian or Student's). This allowed us to detect tampering in payments - for example, the project investing big in the start of its own ICO to simulate high demand. However, the main problem here is that this analysis can be only performed after the ICO, so we decided to instead concentrate on something more useful at all stages, like sentiments or ICOface (a database of all people who did an ICO, where you can look them up by their photo).  So what you can surely expect in the future is payment curve and payment distribution analysis, and we also had a cool idea floating around about clustering addresses to find out whether, for example, exchanges were involved. But this is not our focus right now.  As for detecting whether the ICO is fraudulent or not directly, several problems arise - first, the data on fraudulent projects is scarce, not nearly enough to train a decent model; second, people seem to distrust even an amazing model, when the task is formulated as predicting fraud/not fraud. And if you make even a single mistake, you can really upset either investors or the project team that you called fraudsters. After interviewing some investors we found out that they would prefer to see indicators of possible fraudulency themselves and pass judgements on their own.  In the meantime, we will concentrate on some basic widgets like exchange rate curves, number of token holders, token balances distribution and so on.  Quote from: Elementique on September 15, 2017, 07:15:15 PM And perhaps could you please give more insights into the ""bug-bounty"" program? How it will be implemented, and what would be the main purpose of it?   This is going to be an automated bug hunt after the initial version of Dolphin BI smart-contract will be deployed. The idea is that we set the contract's invariants, and people who manage to break them will automatically be rewarded.
