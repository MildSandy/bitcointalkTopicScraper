This was known as the infamous Virtual Fixtures system made for the United States Air Force back in 1992.  Aside from that, Augmented Reality was primarily used in entertainment and gaming. That said, as technology advances (both hardware and software), other industries are joining in.  Now that mobile phones have proliferated every facet of life, it’s common for people to claim that VR/AR is the next frontier. Augmented Reality hardware has been virtually non-existent (no pun intended) for the past several years.  The only thing that’s come close has been the short-lived Google Glass.  A hugely unpopular product, Google Glass had the unfortunate luck of being both ahead of its time and also severely under-supported by Google. While it had tremendous potential, it wasn’t until the advent of blockchain technology that the prospect of AR glasses became an attractive proposition again.  Lucyd’s glasses act also as a wallet, enabling users to send and receive transactions — much like other cryptocurrency wallets.  With 75% of smartphone users requiring prescription eyewear, the market for Augmented Reality eyewear is huge. While we don’t expect wearable tech to completely replace smartphones, we are confident that the every-day usability of eyeglasses combined with the advantages of Augmented Reality will create a busy marketplace for both developers and users.",False

The basic issue as it relates to any transaction of goods, is that there’s an imperfect balance of information. The seller of a used car, for example, knows a lot more about the history of the vehicle than the buyer — putting the buyer at a disadvantage in most cases.  On the flip side, the asymmetric information dilemma can also work against sellers. Consumers assume that high-priced items are a rip-off because sellers are keeping key information from them, and shy away from buying because they don’t think they’ll receive fair value.  And while technology has taken a stab at solving the asymmetric information problem — think of websites like Carfax or Zillow — there’s on emerging technology that has the potential to be a real game-changer for both buyers and sellers: Augmented Reality (AR).  https://medium.com/@LUCYDLTD/how-smart-glasses-could-solve-the-asymmetric-information-dilemma-e360fb0da004",False

Blockchain’s promise is the decentralization of trust, potentially enabling value exchange without intermediaries in a democratized ecosystem. It provides the potential for financial transactions to be verified and cleared without the need for a trusted third party sitting between market participants. Removing intermediaries reduces costs and complexity and should enhance security, while also enabling a freer exchange of value and services. Blockchain offers a number of exciting opportunities, including secure peer to peer transactions. In blockchain we saw the incredible potential to develop the Lucyd platform, through our token generation event, where we will launch our AR utility token called LCD. It also provides enhanced functionality for an AR content ecosystem, which through the Lucyd Lab blockchain can grow rapidly and be community-regulated. Our blockchain will let developers mine new LCD by creating quality content, with more LCD being released as the content gets more positive ratings. Downrated content can be automatically removed from the ecosystem, and developers can gain influence and prominence in the ecosystem by continually creating well-rated content. LCD has a number of vital functions in the Lucyd platform. It will allow highly secure, rapid, P2P transactions on the Lucyd network. For example, you could send LCD to your colleague simply by speaking the command in-Lens. By having both the medium of access, and the hardware wallet itself in a single unit, we believe highly secure and convenient cryptocurrency transactions will be possible. By letting developers mine tokens with quality content, and rewarding users for community-building actions, we believe our AR platform can grow much faster with the blockchain than traditional app ecosystems. LCD can be used for purchases of smartglasses, Lucyd native content and in-lens transactions, creating a decentralized micro-economy around our hardware platform. A token generation event is much faster than traditional fundraising methods, which is especially important in the rapidly-advancing AR space. A final reason for using a token generation event to raise contributions for development of our smartglasses, is that the typical token purchasers are tech-savvy and more likely to be an early adopter of our next-gen smartglasses.",False

Smartglasses are eyewear that transmit real-time information into a users field of vision. Despite promising developments on this front, tech giants like Apple, Google and Oculus have yet to be successful in their efforts to create a version for mainstream consumers. Though Google Glass has garnered the most attention in this space, the current product has many drawbacks (short battery life, privacy issues and high price).  However, the smartglasses concept delivers promising possibilities by allowing users to transfer everyday information to the internet from a comfortable, wearable, hands-free device experience.  One company that intends to create a new normal for the smartglasses movement is Lucyd. Lucyd is an emerging technology startup that facilitates the development of augmented reality mobile applications and wearable smart products. Founded in 2017, Lucyd is creating next generation augmented reality smartglasses with the added twist of using a decentralized platform for its alternative reality (AR) platform and app marketplace.  Lucyd is targeting those seeking to access information more easily — essentially, smartphone users. With an estimated 75 percent of the world’s population needing corrective lenses of some type, Lucyd Lens aspires to make ordinary glasses redundant.  Lucyd’s grand vision is to untether users from the prevailing hassle of having to glance away from the outside world to access online information, whether it be through a mobile phone, computer or some other device.  Wearers of Lucyd smartglasses can switch between ordinary glasses or a broad spectrum of AR applications to complete different tasks.  https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/lucyd-seeing-augmented-reality-through-blockchain/",False

LCD will also facilitate rapid peer-to-peer transactions in the Lucyd AR world, and is used to organically motivate user and developer engagement with Lucyd Lens. It accomplishes this through the Lucyd Lab blockchain, on which new AR content & apps are registered. Blocks then release LCD to developers based on user ratings of their content, and to users based on their feedback to the developer community, and participation in ads and promotions. LCD can be used to purchase AR products from Lucyd and other developers, as well as bought and sold on token exchanges. Purchasing 5000 LCD ($1150 with 10% bonus) by the end of the ICO is enough to reserve a beta Lucyd Lens. You must retain at least 5000 LCD to exchange for the Lens in Q1 2019 when available.

Not saying we will be like them, but for example Google was started in garage with one pending patent when YAhoo was multibillion dollar company.  Most players in AR have been focusing on creating entertaining, but mostly geeky looking, indoor applicable devices mostly. And those have some great uses and fun applications. But we see our glasses as not necessarily a consumer electronics gadget, but next level glasses. Our technology focuses on improving ergonomics of smartglasses, because any mass market product for consumers need to be ergonomic. And ergonomics of a product like smartglasses is mostly derived from optics behind it. Most of our patents are in advanced optics, between free form optics, light guide, eye tracking etc.This technology has been worked on for many years at a leading advanced optics research center in the U.S. My wish for everyone would be to read the article by Dr. Kostoulas about where our technology fits on the competitive landscape: https://www.lucyd.co/technology/  We focus on improving certain aspects of currrently available AR displays that prevented it from going mainstream: For example, current devices have up to 30 degrees field of view, our tech enables up to 120 degrees, so that it feels like natural eye view and doesnt cause eye strain. iI also miniaturizes optics elements needed to make lenses and frames smaller, lighter, and looking more like normal glasses. It is prescription ready. It improves real object detection accuracy. All very important aspects from the standpoint of people being actually able to wear glasses in every day situations",False

There are a lot of useful applications on our AR platform, but the answer is actually straightforward.    In a similar fashion to the Internet connecting people and ideas from all over the world, blockchain can enhance, spread and protect data by putting it on a peer-to-peer, decentralized network. A network or marketplace operates more smoothly and fruitfully when it is assuredly fair, with a transparent authority shared by the userbase. At Lucyd, we recognize that a mainstream AR platform will be bigger than any one idea, bigger than any one company. So we are trying to open the software marketplace for our platform to the developers of the world, to be built, experienced and controlled by the community. By using blockchain to democratize the content creation and moderation process, we are attempting to build a self-sufficient ecosystem, which can grow much faster than traditional app stores. The Lucyd Lab blockchain will organically promote well-received apps and media, while systematically deleting harmful or useless content, all while letting developers keep more of their app revenue. With the Lab, we can lay the foundation for a smartglass that combines ergonomic, next-gen hardware with an active and engaged developer community.  To improve processing speed and economic utility, functions on a blockchain typically operate on peer-to-peer cryptocurrency tokens. These tokens are used to store monetary value in the network, with more tokens roughly equating to a greater “stake” of ownership in the network. Tokens are typically rewarded to “miners” and server owners who supply computing power to operate the blockchain. In the case of Lucyd Lab, LCD tokens are mined by developers and users for community-building efforts, as well as by sharing storage of app and content data. Developers can mine LCD by creating positively rated content, and users can mine LCD by participating in reviews, bounties, referrals and promotional content. LCD can be used to purchase content from the network, hardware from Lucyd, cashed out on token exchanges, or sent in peer-to-peer transactions. We envision all utilities of the token, and all developer and user activity, taking place entirely within the AR interface of Lucyd Lens.  https://www.lucyd.co/2018/01/24/blockchain/",False

The token has several core functions mentioned on the site and elsewhere in the whitepaper (the referenced section is about Lucyd business initiatives). Token functionality is not a perfect mirror of Lucyd projected revenue streams—network fees on LCD transactions and transfers is just one source of revenue. LCD tokens have these prime uses: •   Encourages app development and user engagement with Lucyd Lens by rewarding developers and users for certain actions with LCD tokens. Developers will get LCD based on user ratings, which are submitted to a block corresponding to their content on the Lucyd Lab blockchain. This additional merit-based bonus atop traditional app revenue will motive 3rd party development. •   Users get LCD for basic actions like reviews, app referrals and ad participation. •   Enables a user experience untethered to existing platforms and financial systems, grounded only in the Lucyd smartphone companion app and Lucyd Lab blockchain. LCD enables in-Lens purchases of Lucyd hardware and Lucyd-native apps and media, without a bank account. In-Lens downloadable content takes the form of in-app purchases in the Lucyd companion app, allowing our ecosystem to initially function on existing smartphone platforms. •   LCD enables instant, vocally-initiated P2P transfers among the Lucyd community. •   LCD can be natively integrated into Lucyd apps, allowing for instant in-app purchases and participation rewards without requiring signup or a bank account. E.g., a game that integrates your LCD wallet for its currency, rewarding achievements and selling gem packs in LCD.",False

We are on the front page of Disruptor Daily, top tech disruption website out there: https://www.disruptordaily.com/lucyd-startup-building-future-wearable-ar/  What are the top three tech trends you're seeing in AR?  #Tech Trend 1: We believe that AR will become more widely adopted once a smartglass can fit the form of standard spectacles. Eyeglasses were first introduced in 1290, in Pisa, Italy. For more than 700 years, people have embraced the current eyeglass design motif to correct their vision and as a fashion accessory. Due to its nature as a facial wearable, smartglasses need to be lightweight and highly customizable, both features that Lucyd technology enables.  #Tech Trend 2: Increasing enhanced field of view (EFV), the AR-supported scope, to be able to support all or most of the user’s natural visual field. For smartglasses to go mainstream, first and foremost, they must be good glasses available in a wide variety of frame styles. Smartglasses are not a traditional consumer electronics product like a wearable exercise monitor or a smartwatch, but rather an evolutionary leap in current eyeglasses. This is necessary for intelligent positioning of real and virtual objects in the visual field.  #Tech Trend 3: Hands free control of smartglasses with microphones and bone conducting speakers to leverage artificial intelligence tools like Siri, Google Voice and Alexa.",False

Clunky form factors, eye-straining monocular displays, poor processing power and resolution, and difficult-to-master controls are just a few of the issues holding back AR devices. Additionally, a Forbes article suggests that marketing problems could also be interrupting progress. Just what problem do smartglasses address? Why do I need it? These are questions that must be answered for the public to adopt AR with the same candor as the smartphone revolution. Lucyd is addressing all of these issues with its unique technology advantage.  Fortunately, Lucyd is addressing both the technology and marketing fronts of AR. On the technology side, our smartglasses are built on a portfolio of 13 symbiotic patents from the renowned College of Optics and Photonics at the University of Central Florida. These patents were invented largely by Dr. Jannick Rolland, a Lucyd advisor and a world-class optical engineer. Years of dedicated research went into Lucyd patents, and it shows in their incredible potential. Lucyd Lens smartglasses will fix many of the major problems in today’s AR displays. They have flush microdisplays instead of external AR units, they accommodate prescription lenses, auto-adjust to lighting conditions, have multiple control methods, and harness the processing power and data signal of the user’s smartphone. It all adds up to the first sleek, unibody smartglasses that look and feel just like regular spectacles. Except Lucyd Lens will change how you see the world.  We are also presenting Lucyd in a way that shows all of AR’s potential to the public. The truly handsfree computing offered by Lucyd Lens will drastically improve the way we do many personal and professional tasks. Imagine voice-navigated internet browsing, eye-controlled apps, a heads-up car dashboard and GPS, visually enhanced surroundings, instant communication, and seamless connectivity with the Internet of Things–all in a single device. Smartglasses are not just going to be a necessary device for the connected individual, they are going to evolve human sight itself. If any bit of information is missing from your real world experience, Lucyd Lens can fill that void with relevant information. This is all while allowing the user to be more comfortable and aware than when completing similar tasks on a smartphone. Once you have the cloud right before your eyes, in a pleasing, hi-res interface, you will get the Lucyd dream.  https://medium.com/@hgross_74590/why-you-dont-own-smartglasses-yet-fdb52393f550",False

It shows exactly why our project is so valuable:   ICO_hunter01 december 2017, 19:53 ""I met someone from Lucyd at the Blockchain Expo in Santa Clara this week. There aren’t a lot of product ICOs, so Lucyd stands out that way by making AR smart glasses with apps on blockchain. And I agree with the expert review that this type of tech is a risk, but everything in this space and investments in general all have embedded risk. What’s promising here is that if you read their patents (there’s 13!) and see how they apply the first in class features to lightweight glasses it has the potential to upend big players like oculus rift and Microsoft’s hololens which remind me of the first mobile phones: giant and clunky. Look at the team they’ve assembled too which include the inventor who runs the National Science Foundation Center for Freeform Optics, the guy from Amazon’s Computer Vision Group, the director of USC’s Vision and graphic lab plus 5 other PhD’s. They have a good shot at making this reality and obviously by the looks of it this token sale will accelerate development. """,False

We started campaigning pretty late in the game, in October, in the month of the ICO pre-sale. We are very special and unique in terms of tangible hardware solution (next-gen smartglass technology) and decentralized app store, quality of the team but also backing of a public company. There is no golden ""one rule for everyone"" and we are confident in the final success given the ICO is running until Feb 28th, we are getting first major strategic alliances, attending major conferences, talking to whales and funds as we speak.  2. You will not be able to take advantage of smartglasses functionality without blockchain for a few reasons:  - without the token, we will not be able to motivate and incentivize developers enough to work on the vast universe of apps needed for smartglasses. By creating a decentralized app store, we will allow developers to keep more of their traditional app/media revenue than if they worked within traditional app ecosystem. Then the blockchain will encourage app development additionally by rewarding them with LCD tokens for best reviewed apps. Developers will get LCD based on user ratings, which are submitted to a block corresponding to their content on the Lucyd Lab blockchain. This additional merit-based bonus atop traditional app revenue will motive 3rd party development - at the same time, the ecosystem grows by attributing a small portion of LCD for basic actions like reviews, app referrals and ad participation - LCD token would also enable a user experience untethered to existing platforms and financial systems, grounded only in the Lucyd smartphone companion app and Lucyd Lab blockchain. LCD enables in-Lens purchases of Lucyd hardware and Lucyd-native apps and media, without a bank account. In-Lens downloadable content takes the form of in-app purchases in the Lucyd companion app, allowing our ecosystem to initially function on existing smartphone platforms. - its the only way for instant, vocally initiated peer to peer transfers among the people wearing smartglasses - LCD can be natively integrated into Lucyd apps, allowing for instant in-app purchases and participation rewards without requiring signup or a bank account. E.g., a game that integrates your LCD wallet for its currency, rewarding achievements and selling gem packs in LCD - LCD will let you purchase AR hardware and content from the Lucyd store in-Lens, or be cashed out on token exchanges.  So in essence blockchain fits AR so much because it enables decentralized app store - and without decentralized app store you won't be able to create a native app ecosystem in an efficient, economic way. Then you have the token as the means of economic value of course.",False

Tekcapital plc (LSE:TEK), has had a working relationship with University of Central Florida for some time. That relationship helped secured exclusive, worldwide license (noone else can do anything with the technology including UCF) to the 13 patents discussed for Lucyd, a porffolio company of Tekcapital.Dr. Jannick Rolland is the lead inventor behind Lucyd patents, and is on board as an advisor. Dr. Rolland has already developed the central optical system that will be utilised by Lucyd and is excited to be on board.  Lucyd is very different from existing AR solutions because our tech is truly next-generation. Lucyd’s 13 AR patents were developed over a decade of well-funded research at the College of Optics and Photonics at UCF. Lucyd patents enable thin microdisplays for a richly textured, dynamically layered HD AR experience, unlike existing smartglasses that use a clunky external display and have grainy AR objects. This tech also enables Lucyd Lens to be the first smartglass that can be fitted with prescription lenses, and looks like a normal pair of glasses. Lucyd also has an advanced patent for real-world object detection, allowing its AR interface to smoothly intermingle digital content with the real world. Other notable Lucyd firsts are a dynamically adapting user interface that automatically adjusts to the task at hand, built in bone-conduction speakers, light leakage prevention and a 120° enhanced field of view over 3X larger than existing AR displays. In our opinion, it doesn’t matter if someone else makes smartglasses—there are already several current on the market. But their user base is limited to the ultra-geeky. We strongly believe Lucyd Lens will be the first smartglass that works for everyone.  It is highly unlikely that a pair of smartglasses will come out with all of the features our technology addresses. There might be some improvement, but our technology really makes it much more mass market ready. PLus blockchain will enable much faster and efficient content development for the smartglasses.  Its entirely normal to be skeptical, but if things were that binary we would have no successful startups  Good summary of technology here: https://lucyd.co/LucydIntro.pdf  More videos from our team member soon on our YT channel too! https://www.youtube.com/c/LucydAR  Best, Lucyd Team",False

Also, LCD is more practical for certain microtransactions such as in-app purchases, which are not practical to use even .01 ETH for, such as “gems” in a game. LCD is also rewarded to regular users of Lucyd Lens, in exchange for their community contributions such as beta participations, user ratings, user reviews and bug reporting. But the automated developer rewards released by the blockchain are the most integral LCD function for growing the Lens rapidly. Developers will be rewarded based on the quality of their content, and can instantly cash out their LCD or use it to buy new developer tools and hardware from Lucyd.  There are literally unlimited uses of practical smartglasses like we are trying to build. Ending distracted driving is one of our main goals, as well as making day to day tasks easier. Lucyd plans to generate revenue both from hardware and software sales, as well as by owning the app ecosystem accessed via the Lens, and taking an extremely small network fee from every LCD transaction.",False

Scratch Resistant Lenses  Minimizes scratches and fogging are important concerns for all eyeglass users. The best way to handle both is through the use of specialized coatings on the lenses. No lenses are scratch proof, however, lenses that are treated front and back with a clear, scratch-resistant coating have a much harder surface that is more resistant to scratching, whether from dropping your glasses on the floor or occasionally cleaning them with a paper towel. Kids' lenses, especially, benefit from a scratch-resistant hard coat for greater durability. We are also considering using Trivex lenses, which are lightweight and are available with anti-glare coatings as well. http://www.allaboutvision.com/lenses/trivex.htm  Fog Resistant Lenses  We are also considering using a permanent coating for reducing the fogging of glasses. It's called Fog-free and is made by Opticote (http://www.opticote.com/fog_free.php) another coating currently available is called Optifog made by Essilor (https://www.essilor.com/en/brands/optifog/). We agree if you live in a cold climate, or play sports, nothing is more frustrating than having your eyeglasses fog up when you come in from the cold or are performing athletic activities. This also can be a safety issue, since it limits your ability to see until the fog clears. Lens fogging can be especially dangerous for police officers and other first responders to emergency situations. Lens fogging is caused by tiny water droplets that form by condensation on the surface of eyeglass lenses when the lenses are significantly cooler than the surrounding air temperature. These coatings eliminate the condensation of moisture on lenses that cause fogging.   Many thanks for your interest and good questions.

Note we have  very tangible technologies (13 patents developed by a major optics experts in the United States by one of the leading optics expert centers) and the team of optics/AR experts put together specifically for the purpose of addressing the main shortcomings of currently available smartglasses. We know that we need better field of vision, lighter and more ergonomic shape, adaptable to corrective lenses, better battery life and our technologies and team will address that. Our articles sums it up pretty well, I encourage you to read:  https://lucyd.co/2017/10/09/our-ergonomic-advantage/ https://lucyd.co/2017/10/09/lucyd-in-brief-a-comprehensive-introduction/  The AR market will be in dozens of USD$ billions by the time next decade starts.

We like the idea of token sale instead of a regular capital raise because of speed and the presence of talented community to help develop the native software. New AR developers who submit quality content to the blockchain will be rewarded LCD based on user ratings, in addition to traditional app revenue. This will encourage production of new apps and AR-native media that harness Lucyd hardware to improve the experience for everyone. Users will be rewarded LCD for contributing to the developer community with betas, ratings and reviews, and by participating in promotions, ads and bounties. By running the Lucyd AR world on LCD, we get to focus on delivering you a smooth, uninterrupted experience, and LCD holders can easily buy new AR products or cash out on an exchange, with coin they got just for using their Lens. Everybody wins, and everybody can participate in the growth of the platform. LCD will make peer-to-peer transactions among Lens users in any country easy and efficient. Another feature will be in-glasses shopping platforms, and paying with Lens in real life via RFID.  To reward early adopters of the token, we are reserving the first 500 pairs of production Lucyd Lens smartglasses for token sale participants only (there will be a queue in Q1 2019 when we are expecting to deliver the first run). We estimate one pair will cost around 5,000 LCD.  We want to provide an extremely smooth user experience to ensure the success of our smartglasses. We also want to motivate people to engage with the AR revolution, so handsfree computing can make everyone’s lives easier and more productive.",False
