This is the reason to hold ARTIS As Sarabenda mentioned the AARP program will reward holders in BTC, ETH, EOS, XRP, DGB, LTC, Dash, and more as Crypto's are listed on the coming exchange. Basically how this works is that when these crypto's are traded in pairs, the seller pays a TX fee of 0.25% in the Crypto sold. These fee's will be distributed to ARTIS holders pro-rata to the amount of ARTIS they hold (note that only 50% of collected fees will be directed into operational costs of the exchange).  This sets the exchange apart Note that the exchange will be made live in June this year.  Cross Pairs availability - which means you will see unique trading pairs available for the first time e.g., ETH/XRP Multi Device Platform - now users can trade easily through desktop or mobile Simplified UI and user friendly design - in our market research we have learned that many people are still hesitant on entering the Cryptosphere due to lack of user ability. Really think about this; most people are not so technically savvy and do not understand all the technical ways of blockchain technology Free signals (I would rather call them trading recommendations) will be given to our users as part of our proprietary trading algorithm - this will give traders that extra hand when they need it most Uniquely positioned in Africa that will pave the way for fiat conversions on the continent. There are two competitors here called Luno and Altcoin Trader however the above will make us truly beyond borders  I hope this clears it for you  ",False

It was also decided that there would be a reward for all members who contributed in the ICO byway of additional ARTIS, it is necessary to reward members who contributed in the ICO. Details to follow.  Secondly we are working hard to get the wallet released, this would place Artis Turba in a TOTALLY different league as we would compete with major players in the industry and would definitely affect the value of ARTIS. We obviously encountered delays due to hardware and network upgrades and expect the wallet release in the first or second week of March 2018.  Lastly we want to ensure we honour the trust that was vested in us by our members and ensure we create value for every ARTIS holder.

We hereby wish to update all of our members with regards to the progress of the project at this stage as we approach full wallet release which will launch the Artis Turba Project into a whole new league, as wallet functionality will ensure that we compete with major industry peers.  Considering that we are working towards our own exchange we faced some delays to ensure that the foundational architecture is in place for the upcoming exchange as we won’t stop development after the wallet release.  As we all know — security is a major concern when it comes to Cryptocurrencies and hence the Development team is now hard at work to ensure that users can safely store their Cryptocurrencies in Artis Turba wallets. The wallets will make use of Salted Hashing techniques which means that users’ information is and always remains encrypted. Furthermore, a 2 Factor-Authentication Pin by the user will be required to sign transactions, such as sending Cryptocurrencies or even trading them. This ultimately means that our users can safely store their Cryptocurrencies with ease of mind in Artis Turba wallets.  Once security is finalised it will be merged with the already wallet coding which leaves us with fully functional wallets for Artis, Ethereum and Bitcoin. Shortly thereafter the other major Cryptocurrencies n.l., Litecoin, Dash, and Ripple will be added to the list before we proceed with the development of the exchange.    The scheduled date of release for the wallets is on Monday the 19th of March, 2018. Happy Trading, and Forward Together!    Nigel & Nickey",False

We hope that you are all enjoying the journey with us and that all Artis Turba family members are as excited as we are about Artis Turba's first product release occurring today. Artis Turba development is conducted in phases and each phase represents a significant milestone to reach in order to provide a wholesome service and experience to our users.  Today's wallet release is termed phase 1.1 and includes full wallet functionality for Artis, Ethereum and Bitcoin. Our users will now be able to safely and securely store and transact with their Cryptocurrencies. Thereafter, Phase 1.2 is expected to be completed over the next month and will see wallet functionality implemented for Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, Ripple, Monero and popular ERC-20'S.  We are happy that phase 2.1 work has already started and is expected to be completed in June month 2018, during which we will implement the Artis Turba exchange platform. The exchange platform will enable our users to trade the listed Cryptocurrencies and will open up new Crypto pairs which has not been available to the public as of yet! We are also aiming to create a new trend and standard for Crypto Exchanges in terms of user functionality.  Phase 2.2 is the highly anticipated Artis Turba Affiliate Rewards Program and will be implemented along with phase 2.1. This will enable all of our users to earn an income from Cryptocurrencies and we have worked hard to ensure that the model implemented will be sustainable in the long term.  After the first two phases we will move onto phase 3 which we termed the ""value addition"" phase. During this phase we will implement free signals for our users as well as fiat conversion options! We are also glad to announce that we have already started negotiating with service providers about this.  As for the listing of ARTIS on additional exchanges; we will apply to more exchanges after completion of phase 1 and are carefully considering the options to place ARTIS strategically.  Our recent listing on OctaEx has enabled ARTIS pairs with BTC, LTC and USD and also afforded ARTIS the opportunity to gain exposure to the Asian markets.

We hope that you are all enjoying the journey with us and that all Artis Turba family members are as excited as we are about Artis Turba's first product release occurring today. Artis Turba development is conducted in phases and each phase represents a significant milestone to reach in order to provide a wholesome service and experience to our users.  Today's wallet release is termed phase 1.1 and includes full wallet functionality for Artis, Ethereum and Bitcoin. Our users will now be able to safely and securely store and transact with their Cryptocurrencies. Thereafter, Phase 1.2 is expected to be completed over the next month and will see wallet functionality implemented for Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, Ripple, Monero and popular ERC-20'S.  We are happy that phase 2.1 work has already started and is expected to be completed in June month 2018, during which we will implement the Artis Turba exchange platform. The exchange platform will enable our users to trade the listed Cryptocurrencies and will open up new Crypto pairs which has not been available to the public as of yet! We are also aiming to create a new trend and standard for Crypto Exchanges in terms of user functionality.  Phase 2.2 is the highly anticipated Artis Turba Affiliate Rewards Program and will be implemented along with phase 2.1. This will enable all of our users to earn an income from Cryptocurrencies and we have worked hard to ensure that the model implemented will be sustainable in the long term.  After the first two phases we will move onto phase 3 which we termed the ""value addition"" phase. During this phase we will implement free signals for our users as well as fiat conversion options! We are also glad to announce that we have already started negotiating with service providers about this.  As for the listing of ARTIS on additional exchanges; we will apply to more exchanges after completion of phase 1 and are carefully considering the options to place ARTIS strategically.  Our recent listing on OctaEx has enabled ARTIS pairs with BTC, LTC and USD and also afforded ARTIS the opportunity to gain exposure to the Asian markets.  We sincerely believe that the completion of each phase will boost confidence in ARTIS and thereby promote growth for all ARTIS holders.  Forward Together!

The following forecast was made and please note that calculations here are based on the assumption that trading volumes are $10 million per day constantly and that earnings are dependent on trade volume.    ""For example if i will hold  5000 artis how much i will get artis or dollars?""  It will depend on 2 factors; trade volume on ARTIS TURBA exchange (ex fees are 0.25% per trade) and the prices of all the cryptos listed. The payouts will be distributed in the underlying Cryptocurrencies n.l., BTC, ETH, DASH, LTC, XRP, XMR, ARTIS (more will be added to this list in due time) according to each cryptos underlying volume traded.  So for simplicity let us assume that the sum of all cryptos volumes equals $10 million per day Ex fees = $10 million x 0.25% = $25,000 Share 50% = $12,500  $12,500 is then split among all ARTIS holders via smart contracts (the equivalent in BTC, DASH, XRP, XMR, LTC, ETH and ARTIS).  There is 350 million ARTIS so  1 ARTIS gets $12,500/350,000,000 ARTIS = $0.00003571 per day  Thus 5000 ARTIS gets $0.00003571 per day x 5000 ARTIS = $0.17 per day     ",False
